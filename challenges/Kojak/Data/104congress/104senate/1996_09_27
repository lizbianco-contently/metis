Mr. President, I wish to again thank all the Senators for \ntheir cooperation yesterday in moving a couple of important bills--the \npipeline safety bill and the NIH reauthorization.

I also \nwish to thank the Senator from New Hampshire for his efforts on the \nbill that we did have a vote on yesterday.\n  This morning there will be a period of morning business until the \nhour of 12 noon. I believe Senator McCain and others have time \nreserved. Following morning business today, the Senate will be asked to \nturn to the consideration of any of the following items: the Presidio-\nparks bill conference report, FAA conference report, the Coast Guard \nconference report, and possibly begin consideration of the omnibus \nappropriations bill making continuing appropriations for fiscal year \n1977. Rollcall votes are possible during today's session, and depending \non the progress that is made on the omnibus CR, there could even be \nvotes tonight.

So Senators need to be aware that it will occur \nbefore 5 o'clock in all likelihood, and they would need to be here for \na vote earlier than that during the day.\n  The reason for that, obviously, is it is the end of the fiscal year, \nand we will have other business we will be having to work on. If we get \nan agreement worked out, of course, then the chance is that the illegal \nimmigration bill would be put into the CR, and it would not be \nnecessary to have a cloture vote or further debate on the bill at that \ntime. We will keep all Senators advised over the next couple hours what \nis happening with the negotiations, and, of course, we do hope to get \nup some of these conference reports today.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11469-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith).

BYRD\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I suspect that all Senators, when we first \ncome to this great institution we call the U.S. Senate, look around \nthis Chamber for role models and mentors to help us become effective \nand productive Senators. I was privileged, after graduating law school \nat Emory University 1962, to come to Washington and work for \nCongressman Paul Vinson for nearly a year. I was privileged to follow \nin the footsteps of Senator Richard Russell. These were certainly two \ngreat Georgians who set an example of public service that I have sought \nto emulate. I was honored to have served with many Senators I have \nlearned from, including Senator John Stennis and Senator Scoop Jackson, \ntwo legendary Senators who served in the Richard Russell tradition.\n  I have also learned very much from a unique Senator, the Senator from \nWest Virginia by the name of Robert Byrd. Before I leave the Senate \nwhich I love, I want to take a few moments to thank my colleague and my \ngood friend, Senator Robert Byrd, for the encouragement and assistance \nhe has given me during my entire career here in the Senate and for the \nexample he has set for all of us who served here and who have observed \nhis leadership and his personality.\n  It has been said that great men are like eagles. They do not flock \ntogether. You find them one at a time, soaring alone, using their skill \nand their strengths to reach new heights and to seek new horizons. Such \na man and such an eagle is Robert Byrd.\n  Twenty-four years after I first came to the Senate, Senator Byrd \ncontinues to be a role model for me. His tremendous understanding and \ndeep reverence for the role of the Senate in our democracy; his total \ncommitment to serving the people of his beloved State of West Virginia \nand the people of this country; his life-long commitment to learning; \nhis sense of honor and integrity; his commitment to high moral \nstandards; and his tremendous work ethic represent the highest ideals \nof public service.\n\n\n                           Role of the Senate\n\n  The ``Almanac of American Politics'' has what I think is a very \nappropriate description of Senator Byrd. ``Robert Byrd, senior senator \nfrom West Virginia,'' says the Almanac, ``may come closer to the kind \nof senator the Founding Fathers had in mind than any other.'' Mr. \nPresident, the ideals of the Founding Fathers and the role they \nenvisioned for the Senate have always shaped Senator Byrd's performance \nof his duties.\n  Robert Byrd reveres the Senate of the United States, not just because \nhe serves in it, but because of his respect for its role in the history \nof our Nation and the world. Over the years, Senator Byrd has devoted \nan enormous amount of time and effort to the study of the Senate's role \nin our history and its duties under the Constitution. His four volumes \nof speeches on the history of the Senate mark Senator Byrd as the most \nknowledgeable person on the history of this body to ever serve in the \nSenate, and he is the leading expert on this subject in the country \ntoday.\n  By the power of his intellect and the depth of his understanding of \nthe Senate's history and rules, Senator Byrd is not just the Senate's \ninstitutional memory. He is also the custodian of the Senate ideals and \nvalues that go back to the Founding Fathers and even to ancient Rome--\nas he reminded us in his extraordinary series of speeches on the Senate \nof the Roman Republic in 1993. I have heard Senator Byrd recall the \nwords of Majorianus, a Roman Senator, who said that when he was crowned \nemperor in 457 A.D. that he still gloried in the name of Senator. \n``That,'' Senator Byrd is fond of saying, ``is my bottom line.''\n  Like the authors of our Constitution, Senator Byrd views the \nlegislative branch as closest to the people and the primary safeguard \nof their rights and liberties. In his speeches on the history of the \nU.S. Senate, Senator Byrd points out that the Senate is unique not only \nbecause its rules allow unlimited debate, and that, of course, attracts \na lot of attention from time to time. Unlike some legislative bodies in \nthe world, the Senate can originate legislation. In addition, Senator \nByrd reminds us:\n\n       The Senate not only has the power to legislate. It also has \n     the power to investigate, to approve the ratification \n     of treaties, to confirm nominations, and to try impeached \n     persons. Thus, it has judicial, legislative, executive and \n     investigative powers. This combination of powers makes the \n     Senate unique.\n\n  Senator Byrd's knowledge of the rules and procedures of the Senate \nhas become legendary. Senator Byrd recalled that in 1967, when he was \nelected Secretary of the Senate Democratic Conference, ``I began to \nstudy the book of precedents and the book of rules, and soon came to \nknow something about floor work. As a result, I became proficient in \nthe use of the rules.'' Mr. President, saying that Robert Byrd is \nproficient in the use of the rules is like saying Rembrandt knew \nsomething about painting. I suspect there have been few Members of the \nSenate in the last 200 years who approached Senator Byrd's knowledge of \nthe rules and precedents of the Senate.\n  As a result of his exhaustive study of Senate procedure, Senator Byrd \nhas had a major impact in shaping the rules and precedents under which \nthe Senate operates today. Some of these precedents bear his name. The \nByrd rule has become a household term for anyone who follows the \nprogress of reconciliation bills in the Congress. That rule, of course, \nprecludes consideration of provisions in reconciliation bills that are \nnot related to the deficit reduction goals of the reconciliation \nprocess.\n  In his farewell address earlier this year, the majority leader, \nanother remarkable legislator, Senator Dole, paid an unusual tribute to \nSenator Byrd when he said, ``I have learned from a lot of people in \nthis room. I have even gone to Senator Byrd when I was the majority \nleader to ask his advice on how to defeat him on an issue. If you know \nRobert Byrd as I do, he gave me the answer.'' That is high praise \nindeed from a man with Senator Dole's great skills as a legislator in \nthis body, who was in the opposing party--actually\n\n[[Page S11471]]\n\ngoing to Senator Byrd and asking him, ``What rule can I use to defeat \nyou on this motion?'' That is about as high a compliment as an \nindividual can be paid in this body.\n  In his devotion to the U.S. Senate, Senator Byrd has always shown a \npersonal concern for the people who serve in this institution--not just \nSenators but all those who are part of the Senate family. Despite his \nresponsibilities in the Senate leadership or his duties as chairman or \nranking Democratic member on the Appropriations Committee, he has never \nbeen too busy to ease the burdens, remember a birthday, or share in the \njoys and sorrows of a colleague or staff member with a note or a bit of \npoetry. I have never forgotten a dinner given in my honor by my friends \nin Dublin, GA, in February 1975. Senator Byrd came to Georgia for that \ndinner. He gave a speech and brought down the house when he played \n``Going Up Cripple Creek'' on his fiddle, all for a junior member of \nhis party who had only been in the Senate for 2 years. My friends from \nGeorgia, needless to say, were very impressed.\n  Over the years I have received tremendous support from Senator Byrd \nas a member and then chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Senator \nByrd has always been a strong supporter of national defense and of our \nmen and women in uniform. I am proud of the fact that the Armed \nServices Committee has passed a Defense authorization bill every year \nsince I have served in the Senate. During my chairmanship, Senator \nByrd's leadership as majority leader and his parliamentary skills were \nabsolutely essential to completing Senate action on this national \nsecurity legislation.\n\n  I have also had the pleasure of participating in delegations to \nforeign countries headed by Senator Byrd. I remember two trips in \nparticular. One was a trip to the People's Republic of China early in \nmy Senate career in 1975, back when Chairman Mao and Chou En-Lai, \nPresident Chou En-Lai were still alive. We did not visit with them \nbecause they were very ill, but it was a crucial time, not only in \nChinese history but in United States-Chinese relationship. The other \nwas a trip to the Soviet Union in 1985 to meet with Soviet President \nMikhail Gorbachev. Senator Byrd led the bipartisan Senate delegation on \nboth of these trips. He was a very effective spokesman for U.S. \ninterests, and he always managed to leave our foreign hosts with an \nunderstanding of the role of the Senate in U.S. foreign policy.\n  Mr. President, from the day I came to the U.S. Senate in 1973, \nwhether the issue was foreign policy, national security policy or \nSenate floor procedure, Senator Byrd has been my teacher and my \ncolleague; in many cases, my legislative partner. And, most of all, my \nfriend.\n\n\n                  Serving the People of West Virginia\n\n  Senator Byrd's reverence for the U.S. Senate is matched only by his \ncommitment to serving the people he represents in West Virginia.\n  Senator Byrd was first elected by his fellow citizens of West \nVirginia 50 years ago to represent them in the State legislature. He \nhas retained that trust and won every public office he has sought since \nthen. Few people are ever accorded the honor and responsibility of \nbeing elected to represent their fellow citizens--a very high \ncompliment. Robert Byrd has sought that honor and that responsibility \n13 times and 13 times he has succeeded, starting with his election to \nthe first of two terms in the West Virginia House, a term in the State \nSenate, three terms in the House of Representatives and seven terms in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  This makes 50 years--5 decades--of public service to the people of \nWest Virginia by this remarkable man.\n  Senator Byrd has served in the Senate longer than any of the 29 other \nUnited States Senators who had been elected from West Virginia. Next \nyear, he will become the fourth longest serving Senator in the history \nof our Nation. He is also only the third Senator to be elected to seven \n6-year terms. Think of it, seven times he has been elected to 6-year \nterms, along with Senator Carl Hayden and another remarkable Senator, \nthe President pro tempore, our colleague, Senator Strom Thurmond from \nSouth Carolina. This week, Senator Byrd cast his 14,577th rollcall \nvote--14,577 rollcall votes--more than any other Senator who has ever \nserved in this body.\n  In his seven elections to the U.S. Senate, Senator Byrd has won with \nan average of 72 percent of the popular vote--72 percent. Twice he has \ncarried every single county in his State, the only person in the \nhistory of West Virginia to do so.\n  For all the time he has spent in the Nation's Capital, Mr. President, \nRobert Byrd has never forgotten where he came from or why the people of \nWest Virginia sent him here. His childhood during the Depression taught \nhim about the plight of people who had a hard time in life, including \nthe people who worked in the coal mines. His father moved the family \nfrom town to town looking for work, but despite these constant moves, \nRobert Byrd graduated first in his high school. He married his high \nschool sweetheart, Erma James, after he graduated from high school and \nfound a job--Robert Byrd, the son of a coal miner, marrying a coal \nminer's daughter. At a time when America is suffering from the \nbreakdown of the family which causes so many more of our other \nproblems, the 59-year marriage of Robert Byrd and Erma James Byrd and \ntheir dedication to their family should serve as an example to each and \nevery one of us, not only in this body but in America.\n  Senator Byrd had to save for 12 years before he could afford to \nattend college, even part time, but he made great use of his time. \nWorking as a gas station attendant, a produce boy in a coal company \nstore, a shipyard welder, and meat cutter, he learned about the lives \nand the hardships of ordinary people, and he learned about the hopes \nand the dreams of the citizens of West Virginia.\n  Robert Byrd's legislative priorities have been shaped by the needs of \nhis State--investment in highways and other infrastructure projects to \nstimulate economic development badly needed in West Virginia; adequate \nand affordable health care, particularly for the coal miners of his \nState; and education to improve the lives of young people, not only in \nWest Virginia but across the Nation.\n  Senator Byrd's diligence and approach to every challenge he \nundertakes is summed up in the passage from Ecclesiastes he is fond of \nquoting:\n\n       Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.\n\n  Mr. President, everything Robert Byrd does he does with all of his \nmight. He brings an intensity to his work that few of us could match \nand none of us could sustain. Watching Robert Byrd serve as majority \nleader and as leader of the Appropriations Committee, it is clear to \neveryone that when the going gets tough, Robert Byrd doubles his \nefforts and just works harder.\n  So, Mr. President, from humble beginnings, Senator Byrd has made \nhimself into something truly extraordinary in the history of our \nNation. He was not born with wealth or connections. He certainly wasn't \nborn with any power. He has made himself what he is today by working \nharder and studying harder than anyone else, and in doing so, he has \nbecome a wonderful example for the young people of this Nation of what \ncan be achieved through the old-fashioned values of integrity, hard \nwork, faith and perseverance.\n\n\n                    Life-long Commitment to Learning\n\n  Mr. President, from the experience of his past, Senator Byrd has \nbecome a strong proponent of investing in our future, our people and \nour infrastructure in this country. Children are our most important \nresource, and he knows that there is nothing more important to the \nfuture of our children than education. But the Senator from West \nVirginia is living proof that education is not just for young people \npreparing for a career. He has given all of us an example that \neducation is a lifetime experience. Robert Byrd has never stopped \nlearning. He has never stopped trying to improve himself. He has never \nbeen satisfied that he knows everything he needs to know, and he never \nwill be. That is the nature of this remarkable man.\n  Like the senior Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, the Senator \nfrom West Virginia is both a student and a teacher who constantly \nabsorbs information, he soaks it in, and who shares his knowledge and \nhis wisdom with his colleagues to the benefit of this entire \ninstitution and the Congress. Senator Byrd started his Senate career as \na student, absorbing the lessons of history, its traditions and its\n\n[[Page S11472]]\n\nrules, from men like Richard Russell and John Stennis. Over the years, \nthe student Robert Byrd has become the teacher Robert Byrd, but also \nremains the student Robert Byrd--a remarkable combination.\n  He has devoted his time and energy to formal education, earning a law \ndegree while serving as a Member of Congress. Imagine that, all the \nduties of a Congressman and also getting a law degree, the only time in \nhistory that anyone has both begun and completed law school while \nserving in the Congress.\n  But just as important, the Senator from West Virginia also studies \nfor his own enjoyment because he loves to learn, he loves to study and \nhe loves to go through self-improvement, and he does it every day. \nRobert Byrd's devotion to learning is reflected in his work. When \nSenator Byrd offers an amendment, manages a bill, or speaks on an \nissue, he knows what he is talking about, and all of us recognize that \non both sides of the aisle.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd's advice \nand counsel led to the system of discretionary spending caps we have \nbeen using for the last 6 years. These spending caps and the reductions \nin Federal discretionary spending they have enforced have made the most \nsignificant contribution to deficit reduction of any policy we have \nadopted in the last decade.\n  If we in the Congress took the same kind of step on entitlement \nprograms that we have done under Senator Byrd's leadership on \ndiscretionary programs, the fiscal outlook for our country and the \nfuture of our children and grandchildren would dramatically improve.\n  Too often today, when important matters are being considered, the \nmedia and some politicians look to opinion polls first for guidance. \nThe Senator from West Virginia is not one of those individuals. The \nSenator from West Virginia is much more likely to follow the advice of \nWinston Churchill who said: ``Study history, study history. In history \nlies all the secrets of statecraft.''\n  Mr. President, Senator Byrd's knowledge of history and the relevance \nof history to the issues we face today--it is not just knowledge of \nhistory, it is the parallel between what we should learn from history \nand the kind of challenges we face today--and his deep appreciation of \nthe connection all Senators should feel to those who have gone before \nus are the hallmarks of his service and, indeed, I think the unique \ncontribution he has made to this institution.\n  When Senator Byrd speaks on issues like the line-item veto, for \ninstance--and I agree with him that in the future the Senate will \nregret turning over this power to the executive branch. It has been \ndone. We will see how it works, but I am one of those in the Robert \nByrd school on the line-item veto. I do not think it will be used to \nbring down the deficit. I think it will be used by the President for \nwhatever power he would like to display on whatever his priorities are \nat the moment, depending on the President.\n  But when he speaks on issues like the line-item veto, Robert Byrd \nspeaks with the knowledge born of long hours of study of the \ndevelopment of constitutional Government and of separated and shared \npowers in the history of England and ancient Rome as well as our own \ncountry.\n  Historian Robert Byrd knows how long it took for the legislative \nbranch to attain the power of the purse. He knows what it means to have \nthe power of the purse. He knows what it means for the President to \nhave the power of the purse, because that has been done more frequently \nin history than having the legislative body with that power. He also is \nkeenly aware of what it means to lose the power of the purse.\n  Robert Byrd understands and articulates better than any Member of \nthis body the crucial role that an independent legislature plays in a \ndemocracy. You do not have a democracy without a legislative branch. \nThe Senator from West Virginia knows that we cannot have democracy \nwithout an independent legislative branch.\n  Mr. President, I could speak about the leadership and virtues of \nRobert Byrd for a long time. But let me wrap up my remarks by quoting \nthe senior Senator from West Virginia in his history of the Senate, a \nmagnificent quote in my view, summing up his view, and I hope \nincreasingly all of our views, of the role of this great body.\n\n       After two hundred years, [the Senate] is still the anchor \n     of the Republic, the morning and evening star in the American \n     constitutional constellation. It has had its giants and its \n     little men, its Websters and its Bilbos, its Calhouns and its \n     McCarthys. It has been the stage of high drama, of comedy and \n     of tragedy, and its players have been the great and the near-\n     great, those who think they are great, and those who will \n     never be great. It has weathered the storms of adversity, \n     withstood the barbs of cynics and the attacks of critics, and \n     provided stability and strength to the nation during periods \n     of civil strife and uncertainty, panics and depressions. In \n     war and peace, it has been the sure refuge and protector of \n     the rights of the states and of a political minority. And, \n     today, the Senate still stands--the great forum of \n     constitutional American liberty!\n  Mr. President, the U.S. Senate still stands as a great forum of \nconstitutional liberty, in large part because of the vision of our \nFounding Fathers and the genius and durability of our constitutional \nsystem of Government. The men and women who serve in the Senate have a \nsolemn obligation to understand this history and to protect the \ncombination of powers that make the Senate unique under the \nConstitution.\n  Senator Byrd further reminds us of this solemn obligation in his \naddresses on the history of Roman constitutionalism when he said:\n\n       For over two hundred years, from the beginning of the \n     republic to this very hour, [the American constitutional \n     system] has survived in unbroken continuity. We received it \n     from our fathers. Let us surely pass it on to our sons and \n     daughters\n\n  Mr. President, it is my hope and prayer that our successors will \nstudy the words, study the life and emulate the deeds of Robert Byrd, \nU.S. Senator from West Virginia, as he has studied the words and \nemulated the deeds of our forefathers. If they do, the Senate of the \nUnited States will stand as a beacon of liberty, and the lamp of \nAmerica's freedom will shine for the next 200 years.

Mr. President, we are nearing the end of the 104th \nCongress, a time when many will review the accomplishments and the \nfailures of the last 2 years.\n  Though the dramatic budget disputes have dominated much of the brief \nhistory of the 104th Congress, there have in fact been a number of \nbipartisan successes that have not been as publicly noted. These \nbipartisan efforts have included congressional compliance, unfunded \nmandates legislation, lobby and gift reform, modest, but helpful, \nhealth insurance reform, and the promising beginnings of campaign \nfinance reform.\n  But, Mr. President, perhaps the biggest achievement of this Congress \nhas been something that was not done. This Congress did not enact any \nof the massive, fiscally irresponsible tax-cut proposals that Members \nof both parties have proposed.\n\n  Mr. President, a recent headline in the Washington Post read, \n``Dole's Tax Cut Centerpiece Has Yet To Strike a Chord With Voters.'' \nIt is a telling story about the inability of the Dole campaign to gain \nsignificant political benefit from his proposal to cut taxes by nearly \nhalf a trillion dollars.\n  To a certain extent, I think the same kind of story could be written, \nin fairness, about President Clinton's tax-cut proposals. The bulk of \nthe success that the President has enjoyed--I believe will continue to \nenjoy--clearly comes not from his tax-cut plans, but from his handling \nof the economy and his record on deficit reduction.\n  So, Mr. President, I think neither candidate has benefited in any \nsignificant way from proposing tax cuts. The reason is straightforward. \nVoters understand we simply cannot afford to\n\n[[Page S11473]]\n\ncut taxes if we are to balance the Federal budget within the next 6 \nyears. Mr. President, do Americans want lower taxes? Of course they do. \nBut given the choice between cutting taxes and balancing the budget, \nthe American voter wants to balance the budget.\n  Make no mistake, Mr. President, that is the choice we have before us. \nWe have to do one or the other. You cannot do both. Anyone who claims \nyou can do both is either blowing smoke or simply does not understand \nthe huge problem we have in this country with our deficit and the debt \nwhich underlies it.\n  Mr. President, we saw how politically unsustainable a budget package \nbecomes when it attempts to provide a major tax cut while it also \nclaims to be eliminating the deficit. The political developments of \nthis past year are testimony to this fact.\n  Indeed, any budget package that eliminates the deficit will be \ndifficult enough to sustain over the next few years that it would take \nto fully implement its provisions even without the added burden of \nfunding a significant tax cut.\n  The failure of the tax-cut plans offered by either party to gain \npolitical momentum is, of course, not due to a lack of effort. Millions \nof dollars are being spent on carefully crafted television commercials \nadvocating these tax-cut proposals. These plans are not new nor are the \nefforts to promote them.\n  The President's plan that we have heard about recently is similar, in \nmany ways, to the one he proposed in December of 1994. The Dole plan \nclearly has its roots in the massive tax cut proposed as a part of the \nnow famous Contract With America. In fact, many in this body will \nrecall that the Speaker of the other body pronounced that the tax-cut \nproposal, of all the proposals in the Contract With America, was the \n``crown jewel'' of the Contract With America, in his words.\n  Mr. President, the Speaker's characterization was notable. Of all the \nprovisions in that political document, it was the tax cut that he, the \nleader of that charge, gave the privileged position. Yet, despite the \nconsiderable political inertia that is conferred by being singled out \nas the crown jewel of the Contract With America, the tax cut has not \nbeen enacted.\n  Mr. President, does anyone doubt that, if there had been strong \nbroad-based support for that tax cut, it would have been enacted by \nnow? Clearly it would have been. If the American people truly preferred \ntax cuts to deficit reduction, we would have seen an inevitable \nbipartisan rush to enact them. But that has not been the case.\n\n  In the Washington Post story on the failure of the Dole tax-cut plan \nto attract voter support, a gentleman named Ralph Miller, of \nGreencastle, IN, a self-described independent, is quoted as saying \nthis:\n\n       When I hear all that talk about how they're going to cut \n     taxes and balance the budget, it turns me against the both of \n     them.\n\n  He added:\n\n       I don't believe anybody can do that * * * I have respect \n     for Bob Dole, but this seems ridiculous to me.\n\n  Mr. President, despite the lost opportunity to make even more \nprogress to reduce the deficit during the 104th Congress, the deficit-\nreduction package passed in 1993 continues to lower the annual budget \ndeficits below where they otherwise would have been.\n  As many have noted, in the last 4 years we have seen deficits come \ndown from nearly $300 billion to an estimated $117 billion. That \nprogress, of course, has come only with great difficulty. Finishing the \njob will be even tougher, but it is something that absolutely must be \ndone.\n  Mr. President, proposals to provide large tax cuts jeopardize that \neffort by pirating the savings generated by spending cuts away from \ndeficit reduction in order to fund tax cuts.\n  They also undercut deficit reduction by providing an alluring \nalternative to the often painful and unpopular work of balancing the \nbudget.\n  It is much easier it is to talk of cutting taxes than it is to focus \non where to cut spending.\n  The American people have not been swayed by the talk of cutting taxes \nby the Presidential candidates.\n  In fact, if President Clinton wins, as I hope and expect he will, it \nwill in large part be because of his success in reducing the deficit, \nnot because of his tax cut proposals.\n  Mr. President, in 1994, the first time many voters became aware of \nthe Contract With America, including its crown jewel, was after the \nelection.\n  But that fact was conveniently ignored when the new congressional \nleadership sought to advance their agenda.\n  The contract's provisions were held up as an electoral mandate, \nthough I doubt 1 voter in 10 was in any way familiar with the real \nspecifics of the Contract With America.\n  There will be no comparable, after-the-fact, document this year, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The differences between the two candidates are well known.\n  And despite the efforts of some in both parties, and the political \nand media specialists in both campaigns, the outcome of this election \nwill rest in large part on whether voters choose reducing the deficit \nor cutting taxes as the higher economic priority of this Nation.\n  Mr. President, despite the loudly trumpeted promises made at the \nbeginning of this Congress, and despite the significant political \npressure brought to bear by well-funded special interests, we have \nsucceeded in avoiding significant damage to the deficit, and to the \ngoal of a balanced budget, that a huge tax cut would have meant.\n  If, in the 105th Congress, as I very much hope, we are finally able \nto enact a bipartisan budget plan that will balance the Federal books, \nit will be in large part because we did not enact a fiscally \nirresponsible tax cut in the 104th Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to report to \nCongress and the American people on a unique success story. A story \nabout a public-private partnership. A story involving a cooperative \neffort of two Federal agencies. A story requiring teamwork between a \nState government and the Federal Government. A story about our land \ngrant university for Mississippi, and catfish farmers in Mississippi's \nDelta.\n  First, let me say, I am proud to report to my colleagues that the \nMississippi Delta produces 80 percent of the farm-raised catfish \nenjoyed in America. This farm-raised catfish industry represents \napproximately 70 percent of the commercial value of America's entire \naquaculture industry. Clearly, farm-raised catfish is big business in \nAmerica. And clearly, it is big business for Mississippi.\n  But, it was not always successful. The catfish industry in \nMississippi struggled for 25 years. There were many tales of financial \nwoe. However, with hard work and the willingness to accept large fiscal \nrisk, Mississippians developed aquaculture into a dynamic and viable \neconomic enterprise. The pioneers in this industry spent a lot of their \nown money to build a giant infrastructure which includes production, \nprocessing, transportation, marketing, distribution, and feed mill \ncapacity. We are talking about a $2 billion agricultural investment.\n  Mr. President, according to data provided to my office by the State \nof Mississippi, the Mississippi catfish industry employs more than \n25,000. And this industry sells approximately $0.5 billion each year of \ncatfish at the pond bank.\n  Throughout the growth of this new fledgling agricultural enterprise \nover the past 25 years, the No. 1 priority for the catfish farmers has \nalways been to find new production techniques. If you build a pond and \nfill it with catfish, the question is not where the fish are. No--the \nreal question and challenge is how to harvest the fish of a certain \nsize.\n  Similar to any other intensely managed livestock operation, the farm-\nraised catfish industry experienced enormous production challenges such\n\n[[Page S11474]]\n\nas nutrition problems, disease, and harvesting technology. There were \nmany costly false starts in a search for solutions. Success was a hit \nor miss event. Gradually, solutions to feeding and health problems have \nbeen developed. Today, part of the catfish industry's attention is \nfocused on obtaining new technology. This involves the National Marine \nFisheries Service. The goal is to take advantage of existing \ntechnology.\n  Now, to many Americans fish are fish. To some, fish are classified as \neither fresh water or salt water. Here is where the Federal Government \noften draws a hard and fast bureaucratic line. The Federal Government \nhas two different and distant agencies in two separate departments \nwhich deal with fish depending on the water they live in.\n  This is OK if these agencies talk to each other and share their \nsuccess stories--yes, fish stories. And not about the one that got \naway. In Washington they call this dialog interagency coordination \nwhich is formalized with a memorandum of agreement. Sadly, this does \nnot always occur.\n  Today, I stand here to tell you about one of those instances where \nthe two Federal agencies did indeed find each other. They found each \nother without prodding from outside sources--like Congress. The story \ngets even better. When they found each other, there was a cooperative \nspirit to help America's catfish industry. Here, there is a success \nstory.\n\n  Mr. President, it is encouraging for me to report to my colleagues \nthere was a personal commitment, at the staff level, to help \nMississippi's Delta catfish farmers. The National Marine Fisheries \nService [NMFS], in Pascagoula, which is part of the Department of \nCommerce took on the persistent fresh water pond harvesting technology \nproblems. They worked with Scientists at the Department of Agriculture \n[USDA] laboratory, at Mississippi State University in Stoneville. \nTogether they formed a joint effort to apply existing marine fisheries' \ntechnology to catfish ponds. The established saltwater fishing industry \nis excellent at catching fish. The new fresh water community is good at \ngrowing fish, however, they needed to learn how to be more effective at \ncatching them. NMFS stepped in to share new gear technology with the \nfresh water fish community. This sharing of technology kept the fresh \nwater community from reinventing the wheel.\n  The Government's traditional business as usual policy would have \nprevented the assistance and technology exchange. To provide this help \nacross jurisdictional lines is a Federal no-no. More importantly the \npolicy would have been prevented because it threatens budget authority \nand funding issues.\n  But, despite these Washington obstacles assistance was offered and \nreceived. A Mississippi success story.\n  The NMFS laboratory in Pascagoula committed itself because of its can \ndo attitude. And clearly USDA and Mississippi State University were \nreceptive. NMFS brought a range of potential solutions to the \nharvesting technology problems of the warmwater aquaculture industry \nbecause they had worked on this issue for years in the marine fishing \nindustry. I want to single out two individuals. Specifically, John \nWatson and Charles ``Wendy'' Taylor of NMFS's Pascagoula laboratory. \nThese two directly assisted in the development and retrofitting of \nharvesting equipment. They had lots of ideas. They offered hands-on \nhelp. They produced rapid results.\n\n  They showed those fresh water folks lots of new ideas and real \nsolutions. Many of these ideas caused revolutionary improvements in the \nharvesting efficiency and quality control for the farm-raised catfish \nindustry. Revolutionary is not an overstatement. This is not a fish \nstory about the one that got away. This is about the catfish that got \ncaught. The proof was tangible and quickly evident at the processing \nplants. John and Wendy made a difference in Stoneville.\n  The NMFS laboratory staff in Pascagoula could have told the \nscientists in Stoneville's USDA Laboratory that procedures and policies \nprohibit the marine fisheries' experts of Federal Government from \nsharing their technology with a sister industry. But, they did not. \nInstead, through the combined efforts of these two diligent scientists \nand the cooperative spirit of personnel with USDA's Stoneville \nExperiment Station and Mississippi State University, steps were taken \nto discover potential solutions to the technology problems which have \nplagued the farm-raised catfish industry.\n  I must say this cooperative spirit extends all the way back to \nWashington. It is also exhibited by Rolland Schmitten, the Director for \nthe National Marine Fisheries Service. There is a leadership example \nwhich is reflected throughout the agency.\n  Mr. President, it is a pleasure to share with my colleagues this \nstory of Federal interagency cooperation. It also illustrates that \npublic-private partnership can be productive. I think it is worth \nnoting that this cooperative effort has reduced duplication of Federal \nefforts. This makes fiscal sense, especially as we strive to make the \nservices of government more efficient.\n  All of us should look for similar opportunities within Federal \nagencies in our own home States. I am sure there are more Stoneville's \nout there. I am sure there are more ways that the Federal Government \ncan deliver cost-effective solutions to the problems. I am also sure \nthere are more public-private partnerships that can make a difference. \nLet us use our oversight responsibilities in the next Congress to \nreexamine Government priorities, policies, and procedures for other \ninteragency opportunities with an aim of forming more partnerships with \nindustry.\n  Mr. President, Stoneville should be the standard in the future, not \nthe exception.\n  Again, I applaud the efforts of the National Marine Fisheries Service \nand I want to publicly thank them. They have significantly helped \nAmerica's farm-raised catfish industry. I strongly encourage the \ncontinuation of the successful relationship between Stoneville and \nPascagoula.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11473-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11474-S11475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE ACADEMY OF TELEVISION ARTS AND SCIENCES\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Academy \nof Television Arts and Sciences as it celebrates its 50th anniversary.\n  The television industry reflects so much of what we are as Americans. \nThe Academy of Television Arts and Sciences--with its annual Emmy \nAward--recognizes the positive impact television makes on so much of \nour everyday life.\n  I'm an avid channel surfer at home, so I watch a fair amount of \ntelevision. I know how positive a messenger television can be--whether \nexplaining the spread of a deadly disease, bringing us up-to-the-minute \nreports of world events, or simply making us laugh during a half-hour \nsituation comedy when our day has ended and we're ready to take a \nbreak.\n  The people and programs honored with the Emmy Award are a permanent \npart of our country's history.\n  Just listen to some of the who's who's list of recipients of the \nacting awards in the comedy field alone: Lucille Ball--four time \nrecipient--Red Skelton, Danny Thomas, Eve Arden, Jack Benny, Shirley \nBooth, Carol Burnett, Dick Van Dyke, Mary Tyler Moore, Julie Andrews, \nand today's recent recipients Candace Bergen--five time recipient--\nKelsey Grammer, and Helen Hunt. The programs honored--``Dick Van \nDyke'', ``The Odd Couple'', ``All in the Family'', ``Get Smart'', \n``Taxi'', and ``Barney Miller''--show just why the programming of \n``Nick at Nite'' is so popular with people trying to recapture the \nclassic days of comedy.\n  The drama programs honored over the years also give us a snapshot of \nAmerican life at the time the programs aired: ``Studio One'', \n``Gunsmoke'', ``The Fugitive'', ``Mission Impossible'', ``Marcus Welby, \nM.D.'', ``Masterpiece Theatre'', ``The Waltons'', and the modern-day \n``Hill Street Blues'' and ``E.R.'' Who can forget the Waltons' powerful \nmessage of family persevering through the Depression or who can forget \nhow ``Hill Street Blues'' showed us the life of a police officer like \nwe had never seen it before.\n  For all that is good, educational and powerful on television, I am \npleased to pay a small part in honoring the academy and the entire \ntelevision industry for its work.\n\n[[Page S11475]]\n\n  As the Senior Senator for California, I also know how vital the \nentertainment industry is to my home State, where more than 150,000 \npeople are employed in more than 1,000 entertainment-related companies.\n\n  The academy, itself, was founded in 1946 by Syd Cassyd, and elected a \nyear later Edgar Bergan as president. Under his direction, the academy \nfirst produced the Emmy Awards in 1948. The organization went national \nwhen it merged with the New York Academy in 1947 with Ed Sullivan as \nits first president.\n  The academy continued to expand adding new chapters throughout the \nUnited States.\n  Today, with 9,000 members, the academy is the largest organization in \nthe television industry. In addition to the Emmys for which it is best \nknown, the academy also runs an intern program for college students \ninterested in film and holds student film competitions. In 1984, the \nacademy formed its first steering committee on drug and alcohol abuse \nand began its work with a 2-day seminar in Washington, DC with First \nLady Nancy Reagan. A decade later, the academy sponsored another \nmeeting--this one focusing on the information superhighway--with our \nVice President, Al Gore.\n  Mr. President, it is an honor and a privilege to acknowledge the \naccomplishments of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences as a \nleader in the entertainment industry. I commend the academy on its \ngrowth and creativity over the past 50 years and I look forward to the \nnext 50.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask that I might be able to speak for \nabout 10 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11474-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11475-S11477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           OMNIBUS PARKS BILL\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, there has been a great deal of interest \nfrom many Members in the disposition of the omnibus parks bill. As the \nChair is aware, we as a committee, the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, met in conference and reported out the Presidio package \nseveral days ago, which contains 126 separate sections covering some 41 \nStates.\n  We sent it over to the House. There was an implication regarding \ntaxes on one particular section. We attempted to clear it over here. We \nhad an objection. That objection has been addressed. It is my \nunderstanding that, procedurally, this matter can move from this body, \nassuming there is no further objection.\n  There is another track that is underway by some Members--mostly from \nthe other body--that suggest that the disposition of the omnibus parks \nbill should be in the appropriation bill, the CR that is forming. I \nfind that extraordinary because there are authorizers and there are \nappropriators. My committee, as an authorizing committee, has done its \njob. The Committee on Natural Resources, chaired by Representative \nYoung, has done its job. We got our packages together. We had further \ncommunicated with the White House over a week ago, addressing \nspecifically certain contentious sections and asking for a disposition.\n  There are, initially, four major items in dispute. One was the Utah \nwilderness issue. The administration saw fit to initiate the invocation \nof the Antiquities Act to take care of the Utah wilderness. In other \nwords, it was a land grab; the administration simply took 1.8 million \nacres and didn't notify the Utah delegation--the Governor, the Members \nof the Senate or the House. It was really a land grab, with no public \nprocess, which this administration highlights as part of their \nphilosophy. We had been debating Utah wilderness for an extensive \nperiod of time and hadn't resolved it. But the democratic process was \ngoing on, people were being heard, different views were being heard.\n  It wasn't so long ago that we had an opportunity to debate the \nCalifornia wilderness bill. There was no antiquities application or \nland grab there. They let the democratic process move forward. The \nreason I point this out is because that was a contentious item, Utah \nwilderness. We withdrew it because of the threat of a veto.\n  Another contentious issue involved a 15-year extension for the only \nmanufacturing plant in my State of Alaska. Without a 15-year extension, \nit could not make the $200 million investment to change that plant from \na conventional pulp plant to a chlorine-free plant. They needed that \ncommitment. The Forest Service would put up the timber so they could \namortize the investment. The administration chose to object to that. \nThe problem is, of course, that there is no source of timber, other \nthan Federal timber, because all of southeastern Alaska is part of the \nTongass National Forest. The communities are in the forest. The \ncommunities were assured at the time the forest was created that there \nwould be enough timber to maintain a modest timber industry. So out of \nthe 17 million acres of the forest, we have digressed down to trying to \nmaintain an industry on about 1.7 million acres.\n  The pathetic part of it is, Mr. President, only roughly half of the \ntimber is suitable for pulp. It is either dead, dying, or immature, in \nthe sense that there is not enough soil to continue to maintain growth \nto full maturity. It has no other use. The reason this pulp mill was \ncreated is so we would have a tax base--this is the only year-round \nmanufacturing plant in the State--and to secure jobs, and we would not \nhave to export the pulp out of the State of Alaska--at that time, it \nwas the territory of Alaska--down to the mills in the State of \nWashington, or to British Columbia, or Oregon.\n  Well, by the administration's dictate of lack of support for the \nextension, this mill will close. So the Senator from Alaska has taken \nhis hit. I withdrew that from the omnibus parks package. Then we had \nthe grazing issue. The administration objected to the fee structure of \ngrazing on public land--the traditional Western use of public land. So \nwe withdrew that. Then we moved up to Minnesota and we had the Boundary \nWaters Area. This was a question of whether you could use small \nmotorized four-wheelers to haul small boats, canoes, and so forth, over \na trail between the lake system. It is all right for the young folks to \nget 10 people out there and push it, but some of the older folks need \nsome motorized assistance. They objected to that. So we took that out.\n\n   Mr. President, as justification for that I ask unanimous consent \nthat the letter from the OMB outlining the objections be printed in the \nRecord, along with a list.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 1996.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Lott: I am writing to provide the Administration's \n     initial views on the conference report on H.R. 1296, the \n     Omnibus Parks Legislation, that was filed last night. We are \n     still in the process of reviewing this extensive legislation \n     and understand that a number of changes were made to the \n     conference report from the version of the bill we reviewed \n     late last week. But, on the basis of our review of the \n     conference report language, the President would veto the \n     conference report.\n       The conference report still includes provisions that are \n     unacceptable to the Administration including: unwarranted \n     boundary reductions to the Shenandoah and Richmond \n     Battlefield National Parks in Virginia, special interest \n     benefits adversely affecting the management of the Sequoia \n     National Park in California, permanent changes in the process \n     for regulating rights of way across national parks and other \n     federal lands, unfavorable modification of the Ketchikan Pulp \n     Company contract in the Tongass National Forest, erosion of \n     coastal barrier island protections in Florida, and mandated \n     changes that would significantly alter and delay the \n     completion of the Tongass Land Management Plan.\n       We have repeatedly stated our strong support for \n     legislation to improve the management of the Presidio in San \n     Francisco, use Federal funds to help acquire the Sterling \n     Forest in the New York/New Jersey Highlands Regions, and \n     establish the Tallgrass Prairie National in Kansas. We have \n     also repeatedly stated our strong willingness to work with \n     you to develop bipartisan, compromise legislation that \n     protects our Nation's natural resources. This conference \n     report does not meet that test. We remain willing to work \n     with you to develop a compromise package that could be \n     included in a bill to provide continuing appropriations for \n     FY 1997.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Franklin D.

Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, that being done, we assumed that the administration \nmay have mild objection to others. But last night we had a proposal \nfrom the administration. I want those that are watching in the offices \nto pay particular attention because I am going to refer to those in the \nbalance of my remarks because, if you look at them, I can't say they \nare nonpartisan. They are very partisan as to what they now want \nomitted from the package. So it seems like they have goalposts on \nwheels because now they want more omitted. Not only do they want more \nomitted but they do not want this package that the authorizers have \ncompleted in both the House and Senate. They don't want this package to \nbe presented in the two bodies.\n  As evidence of that, Mr. President, I read the accompanying letter \ndated September 25. I think just the last sentence is in order. The \nletter is from Franklin D. Raines, Director of the Executive Offices of \nthe President. ``This conference report''--which is our authorizing \neffort--``does not meet the test. We remain willing to work with you to \ndevelop a compromise package that could be included in a bill to \nprovide continuing appropriations.''\n  So what they want to do is they want to cherry pick this 126-section, \n41-State report--over 2 years of effort. Some of these things have been \nbefore my committee for over 4 years. Our committee acted in a \nbipartisan manner. We took the issues on the merits.\n  Let me show you what the administration proposed last night, and you \ncan judge for yourselves.\n  Of course, title I, the Presidio, which we all support, is included. \nBut when we get into title II, the Boundary Adjustments and \nConveyances, it is rather interesting.\n  Section 216 they want omitted. That is conveyance to the city of \nSumpter, OR. That happens to be Senator Hatfield.\n  Section 218, Shenandoah National Park: That is Senator Warner. \nSenator Jeffords has an interest I believe, and Senator Robb also has \nan interest.\n  Section 219, Tulare conveyance: The Colorado delegation and perhaps \nthe Utah delegation has an interest.\n  Section 220, the Alpine School District: Senator Hatfield. They want \nthat omitted.\n  Section 223, Coastal Barrier Resource System in Florida: Senator \nMack, Senator Graham, and I believe the Governor of Florida, a \nDemocrat, happens to feel very strongly that this should be in there. \nThey want that stricken.\n  There is a Unified School District. I think that is the California \nissue.\n  Several in Alaska: The Alaska Peninsula Subsurface Consolidation, \nwhich is a very, very small consolidation on the Alaskan Peninsula.\n  But here is a big one they want stricken: Snowbasin Land Exchange \nAct. That is big in Utah. That is big in the Olympics. That is big in \nIdaho. That is big out west. This is going to allow a land exchange so \nUtah can hold the winter Olympics. They want it stricken out of here. \nThey don't want it. They don't want that land exchange. There are some, \nevidently, environmental objections somewhere. It must be a lot \nstronger than we thought. We held hearings on it. The base of support \nfrom the States and the Olympic Committee spoke for itself.\n  Sand Hollow Land Exchange: Another Utah issue they want stricken.\n  Out in Colorado, section 311, 312, 313: Land exchange with the city \nof Greeley, CO, for the water supply and storage company.\n  And, then there are a couple more: Gates of the Arctic Land Preserve \nExchange; the Native's association land exchange.\n  They own our State. There is no question about that. As we try to \nmake adjustments to accommodate our citizens, we go through a process \nof hearings, get the input, and get the State administration involved.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I was not aware there was a time limit \non morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a time limit on morning business.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent that I may have another 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. I will try to be a little more \nrapid.\n  Colorado, section 101: Cache La Poudre corridor, Senator Brown, \nSenator Campbell.\n  RS2477, Section 405: An Alaskan issue.\n  They want to strike 406, the Hanford Reach protection which is out in \nthe State of Washington.\n  Section 502, which is an historic area, the Vancouver National \nHistorical Reserve: Gorton; Murray. They want to strike that.\n  Civil and Revolutionary War sites: That is section 602.\n  The Corinth, Mississippi Battlefield Act: I believe Senator Lott.\n  The Richmond National Battlefield Park: Senator Warner, and perhaps \nSenator Robb.\n  Section 604, the Revolutionary War, and the War of 1812 Historic \nPreservation Study: Senator Jeffords.\n  The Shenandoah Valley Battlefield: Senator Warner and Senator Robb:\n  Ski area permit for rental charges they want stricken.\n  Visitors' services they want stricken. This is a park fee.\n  Glacier Bay National Park: Section 704 stricken.\n  And then out in the West: Senator Bond, Senator Ashcroft, section \n803, referral, burros and horses.\n  And, moving on, another Alaskan issue, 806, Katmai.\n  Senator Campbell, section 811: Expenditure of Funds Outside \nAuthorized Boundaries of the Rocky Mountain National Park, stricken.\n  Section 815: National Park Service Administration Reform; Senator \nBaucus, and Senator Feinstein, I believe.\n  Mineral King, additional permits, Section 816, stricken.\n  Section 818, Calumet Ecological Park: I believe that is Senator \nSimon, and Senator Moseley-Braun.\n\n[[Page S11477]]\n\n  Moving over to others: Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park \nComplex, stricken; 1021, Senator Campbell, National Park Foundation, \nSenator Bumpers and myself, stricken; 1027, 1028, 1029, the Deschutes \nbasin ecosystem, Senator Hatfield; Mount Hood Corridor Land Exchange, \nHatfield; creation of a forest; Senator Hatfield; 1034, Natchez \nNational Historical Park, Senator Cochran; and the rest of them are in \nthis section 1035; and a few Alaskan issues of little consequence.\n  Mr. President, the point I want to conclude with is we as authorizers \nhave done our job. There is an effort now to circumvent the legitimate \nprocess of the authorizers by momentum of the administration to put \nthis in the appropriations package. I have committed to Senator Gorton. \nIf they want to put the whole thing in, that is one thing. But I am not \ngoing to see the effort made by our authorizing committee and our \nconferees to have this simply cherry picked. Otherwise, there is \nabsolutely no reason for our existence. If the appropriations process \nis going to pick up and cherry pick what we have done when we are ready \nto go, we have our holdings--at least I am sure on our side--addressed \nbecause of the way this process would proceed. The way this process \nwould proceed, Mr. President, since we are ready to send it back over \nto the House by taking off the technical blue slip because of the tax \nimplications, but we have to do that, of course, without objection. We \nare ready to do that.\n\n  Our job is done. The only risk to this is in sending it and \nsubjecting it to a vote for recommittal. If the vote fails, the package \nis dead. But it will not fail. It will not fail in the House. It will \nnot fail here. Give us a chance to vote on the package. Give us a \nchance to vote on what the authorizers have done here.\n  I implore my colleagues, particularly those who have been around here \nfor a while, to recognize what this attempt is all about. They did not \nthink we could get a consensus on the parks omnibus package. They \nthought all along they would be able to cherry-pick what they want out \nof it, but we fooled them. We got our job done. And now they are using \nthe momentum of some in the minority to suggest they are going to go \nahead anyway.\n  Well, we will see about that. We are ready to go. Our job is done. \nAnd to suggest some expeditious action by including it in the \nappropriations process at this late stage simply is not the way the \nSenate is supposed to function. I know that all of us get frustrated \nfrom time to time relative to our chairmanships, but this is a travesty \nof the process if this is a successful effort to cherry-pick those \nthings and put them in the appropriations process when we are ready to \ngo now. We can have it done today. We should be allowed to proceed.\n  So I hope that the leadership would reflect on that at noon when we \nproceed with the remainder of the calendar and just how we are going to \ntreat these provisions, specifically the omnibus parks legislation, \nbecause at noon we will be ready to go subject to an objection. If \nthere is an objection, I hope those objecting will come up with an \nalternative so that we can meet their objections, because our job is \ndone. Technically, there is no reason why the parks omnibus package \nshould not move ahead as it was intended and designed to do and as \nreported by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I certainly understand and sympathize \nwith the distinguished Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski], who, as \nchairman of an authorizing committee, has before us an important bill \non which time has been spent and many hearings have been held. It is \nenormously frustrating not to be able to have that put before us and \nacted upon. I am very supportive of the efforts he spoke of regarding \nthe Presidio bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11475-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11477-S11478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WORK FORCE AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT ACT\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I wish also to speak as chairman of an \nauthorizing committee, the Labor and Human Resources Committee, about \nmy frustration that we cannot act on a piece of legislation I think is \nvery important. It deals with job training reform. It is called the \nWork Force and Career Development Act. Numerous hearings have been held \non this bill over the past 2 years of the 104th Congress. It passed the \nSenate with only two dissenting votes. It passed the House. And now we \nhave on the calendar a conference report. It is enormously \ndisappointing to me that in the final days of the 104th Congress we are \nsubject to dilatory tactics, and if legislation is not going to be \ncalled up today, or at the latest Monday, there is no hope of it \nsucceeding.\n  So I would like to speak for a moment, before this legislation will \nbe put in the dust bin of the 104th Congress, on the need for major job \ntraining reform. I would like to speak on why I believe it was so \nimportant for us to have been able to consider this legislation and my \ndisappointment that it cannot be brought forward.\n  The legislation would have reformed our job training and training-\nrelated programs. There is no doubt that the current maze of training \nprograms is woefully inadequate to address the very real and immediate \nneeds of workers for training and education. I think nothing makes us \nmore aware of this than reports we have continually heard about how \nimportant skilled workers are to our work force today and the \nimportance of vocational education.\n\n  Despite over $5 billion which the Federal Government spends annually \non our various job training programs, the results are less than \nimpressive. Study after study has pointed out the waste and overlap \namong job training programs that now exists.\n  Just to name a few, in January of 1994, the General Accounting Office \nissued a report, entitled ``Conflicting Requirements Hampered Delivery \nof Services.''\n\n  Another GAO report was issued in March of 1994: ``Most Federal \nAgencies Do Not Know if Their Programs Are Working Effectively.'' Other \ntitles include: ``Overlap Among Training Programs Raises Questions \nAbout Efficiency,'' and ``Major Overhaul Needed To Reduce Costs, \nStreamline the Bureaucracy, and Improve Results.''\n  According to a 1996 GAO report, entitled ``Long-Term Earnings and \nEmployment Outcomes,'' few training programs have been rigorously \nevaluated to assess their true impact on the long-term earnings of \nparticipants. While there may be some positive effects for participants \nshortly after training, the GAO found that over a 5-year period JTPA, \nthe Job Training Partnership Act, participants rarely earn much more \nthan comparable individuals who do not participate in that program, and \ntheir employment rates are only slightly higher. Despite months of \ntraining and placement assistance, the GAO could not attribute the \nhigher earnings to JTPA training rather than to chance alone.\n  All too often, Mr. President, training programs spell disappointment \nfor those who have sought assistance in building a better life for \nthemselves and their families. That is why I think this is such a \nmissed opportunity. We have talked and talked about reinventing \ngovernment. That was an initiative that President Clinton, when he took \noffice, announced he was going to undertake. This is a perfect example \nof where we had the opportunity to do so, and now we find we are \nthwarted from voting on the conference report on this important piece \nof legislation.\n  We heard testimony before the Committee on Labor and Human Resources \nfrom Ernestine Dunn who said that her experience with Federal job \ntraining programs was ``a journey [she] thought would never end.'' She \nspent over 10 years and went through eight different job-training \nprograms before getting the job skills and training she needed to get \noff welfare and into a permanent, well-paying job.\n  Her experience is not unique. With all the different programs and \norganizations that deliver services, people have difficulty knowing \nwhere to begin to look for assistance. As a result, they may go to the \nwrong agency or, worse, give up altogether. When training is provided, \nit often results in only part-time or temporary work. We must do better \nif we are going to create a world-class work force that can compete in \nthe 21st century. I believe it is\n\n[[Page S11478]]\n\nour responsibility to see that we assist and work with local and State \ngovernments and the business community to do just that.\n  The Congress and the President both agree that reform is long \noverdue. Less than 1 year ago, as I said, we passed this with \noverwhelming bipartisan majorities. Last October, the ranking member of \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Kennedy, remarked that \n``this is an area of public policy which is of great significance and \nimportance to working families in this country and of great \nsignificance and importance to the United States as a nation and its \nability to compete.'' That was true then and is even more true now. \nWith ever rapid advances in technology, workers will have to constantly \nchange and upgrade their skills in order to compete.\n  The importance of training and education were also central to the \ndebate and passage of the welfare reform legislation this summer. In \norder for welfare recipients to successfully make the transition to \nwork, they must have the training, education, and job skills that will \nhelp them get in jobs and stay in jobs. That is what this legislation \nis all about.\n\n  It is not about programming a child from kindergarten clear through \nhigh school in a career path. It is about giving our States and our \nlocal communities the resources to help design flexible programs that \nwill meet the needs of Kansans, or meet the needs of those who live in \nNew Hampshire or Maine or California. There are differing needs in \ndiffering States and at different times in a person's progress through \nschool and work.\n  Again, that is what this legislation is all about. It would allow the \nStates the flexibility to design integrated systems where services are \ndelivered on a one-stop basis. No longer would an individual have to go \nto several different offices for help. With a one-stop system they \ncould get job counseling, skills training, and other services all in \none place. That is what the administration said they wanted as well.\n  Meeting these challenges will not be an easy task. One possible \nresponse might be to increase funding for education and training. We \nare on the way to doing just that. I am troubled, however, that we \nwould pursue this course while leaving in place the same old programs \nwhich we all recognize do not work. More funding, I would argue, will \nnot advance the type of major structural overhaul and consolidation of \ntraining and education programs that is needed to create a workforce \nsystem that can serve the local needs of job seekers and employers \nalike. It is a Band-Aid approach that deals only with the symptoms and \nnot the underlying causes of the problem.\n  This bill would consolidate over 90 programs of various job training \nefforts scattered among 15 different agencies. It really does take us \nin a new direction that I think offers positive assistance. So, it is \nwith enormous disappointment that I see these efforts may now be \nwasted--but I hope not--as we complete the 104th Congress. For those \nwho will remain, because I will be retiring, it is my hope that what we \nhave laid out here in months and months of work can provide a \nbackground for further efforts in the 105th Congress.\n  This legislation has been strongly supported by the National \nGovernors' Association, both Democratic and Republican Governors. They \nbelieved this was one of the most important pieces of legislation that \ncould be passed in this Congress.\n  The workforce development conference report that is now on the \ncalendar is a result of 2 years of bipartisan work to develop a vision \nof a workforce development system for the 21st century. The elements of \nthis common vision include:\n  Flexibility for the States to design systems that meet their own \nneeds, while preserving the core activities traditionally supported by \nthe Federal Government;\n  Greater coordination among educators, trainers, and the business \npeople who create the jobs for which individuals are being trained;\n  Innovative strategies like vouchers to improve training; and\n  Improved effectiveness of programs by focusing on results, not \nbureaucratic redtape.\n  This conference report, I think, deserves the full support of all \nthose, both Republican and Democrat, who were committed to achieving \nbroad job training reform less than 1 year ago. One of the staunchest \nsupporters of this effort is on the other side of the aisle, Mr. \nPresident, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska.\n  Some have complained the conference report does not go far enough in \npreserving a Federal role in job training. Others claim it creates too \nbroad a Federal role. I do not believe that any of the specific \ncriticisms that were leveled against this bill are significant enough \nto bring down such a solid piece of legislation which has been years in \nthe making.\n  I had hoped that what began as a bipartisan effort with passage of \nthe reform efforts in both the Senate and House would come to \ncompletion in a bipartisan vote of support for the conference report. \nWe are faced with a challenge of creating a new and coherent system in \nwhich all segments of the workforce can obtain the skills necessary to \nearn wages sufficient to maintain a a high quality of living. In \naddition, American businesses need a skilled workforce that can compete \nin the world marketplace. I believe this legislation gives the States \nthe necessary tools to meet those challenges.\n  We should not have allowed the distractions of an election year to \ndetract us from moving forward in a bipartisan fashion on this \nlegislation, which I believe is so important.\n  Mr. President, I conclude by saying it is my hope that in the 105th \nCongress it will be one of the top priorities as we recognize how \nextremely important it is for us to address our skilled work force for \nthe 21st century.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11477-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11478-S11483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           LEAVING THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, it is altogether fitting that I follow the \nremarks of my colleague from Kansas. I think those who have been \nwatching have seen just an example of the kind of passion that she has \nbrought to public service, the kind of strength and integrity that she \ncontinues to display even in the waning moments of this session. I know \nthe country is going to miss her service. I am certainly going to miss \nbeing a partner in so many endeavors that we have had over the past 18 \nyears in the U.S. Senate.\n  I must say, this is both a sentimental and a sweet moment for me. It \nshortly will mark 24 years of serving in both the House and the Senate. \nIt is a mere blink of the cosmic eye of time, and it has all been \ntelescoped into these final few moments as we conclude this session. So \nit is sentimental in that sense, but it is also sweet in another, \nbecause I have been standing in the glow cast by so many friends and \ntheir kind remarks. Last evening, Senator Byrd took the floor and gave \nan encomium to me. I was pleased that I was not here to hear it, \nbecause, had I been here, I would have been too embarrassed to have \nremained on the floor.\n  If someone throws rocks at me, I am quite accustomed to throwing them \nback. But if you hurl a bouquet, then I am usually undone.\n  So, I thank Senator Byrd for his gracious comments last night, along \nwith those of Senator Nunn, who also was most kind. He and I have \nserved on the Senate Armed Services Committee for the past 18 years. I \nmust say it has been truly an honor for me to have served with such a \ndistinguished, intelligent, and dedicated individual, one who has \ndedicated his life to promoting a sound and responsible national \ndefense policy, foreign policy, and, indeed, economic policy. It is my \nhope that sometime in the future we will be able to continue efforts in \nall of these areas.\n  While I have been caught up in the golden afterglow of the accolades \nof my colleagues and those of the editorial writers in my home State, I \nhave always been mindful of Dr. Johnson's observation that: ``In \nlapidary inscriptions, men are not under oath.'' I suspect there may be \nsome truth to that as far as the editorial comments are concerned or \nfinal tributes to our parting Members. I might say, for my own part, I \nhave been little more than Aesop's fly on the wheel of history's \nchariot, marveling that I could kick up so much dust in a period of \n2\\1/2\\ decades.\n\n[[Page S11479]]\n\n  I have also been deeply humbled by the experience. I think it is a \ntestament to the openness of the people of this country, especially the \npeople of Maine, that a boy who was born in the bed of his mother on \nthe third story of a tenement building on Hancock Street, in Bangor, \nME, just a block away from what used to be described as the ``Devil's \nhalf acre'' could, in fact, be elected to the greatest elective body in \nthe entire world.\n  Maine people have always demonstrated a generosity of heart and, \nalso, I believe, self-serving as it may sound, a great soundness of \nmind, to judge people not on their origins, not on their economic \nstatus, ethnicity or race, but on merit, and that is why, historically, \nwe can point to people like Margaret Chase Smith, who stood on this \nfloor so many years ago and delivered her ``Declaration of \nConscience.''\n\n  It is why the people of Maine elected Ed Muskie, whom we lost just a \nfew months ago who demonstrated his commitment to this Nation's \ninterest in helping to clean up our waterways, improve the quality of \nour air and became known as Mr. Clean, then Mr. Budget, and the \nenormous contribution he made through public service to the entire \ncountry. The people of Maine are very, very proud of him and are \nworking to memorialize all of his work.\n  They elected George Mitchell, who, in a very short period of time, \nbecame the Senate majority leader and one of the most effective in the \nhistory of this body.\n  They elected Olympia Snowe to replace Senator Mitchell when he \ndecided to retire. Soon I believe they are going to send Susan Collins \nto sit beside Olympia Snowe. Governor King, who is an Independent \nGovernor of the State of Maine, made the comment when I announced my \nretirement, ``What do you do? What does a State do when it loses Babe \nRuth and Lou Gehrig?'' I suspect he was referring to Senator Mitchell \nas being Babe Ruth and me as Lou Gehrig. But what do you do?\n  I might say the same for Kansas. What does Kansas do when it loses a \nBob Dole and a Nancy Kassebaum? What the people of Maine will do is do \nwhat the Yankees did. They will go out and recruit Mickey Mantle, which \nthey have done in Olympia Snowe, and Roger Maris, which they will have \nin Susan Collins.\n  I think all of us feel the sense of loss that so many are leaving--\nsome 13 now, with Bob Dole, 14--the U.S. Senate at the end of this \nterm. We feel that perhaps things won't go on as they should. People \ntalk about the ``center no longer holding, of things falling apart.'' \nBut I believe it was Charles De Gaulle who said ``That our graveyards \nare filled with indispensable people.'' There will be others equally \nqualified, if not more qualified, to take our place in this \ndistinguished institution.\n  I had occasion to travel out to Ann Arbor, MI, yesterday afternoon to \npartake in a conference that was held at the Gerald Ford Library. The \nmoderator of the panel, which consisted of Tom Foley, Bob Michel, and \nmyself, hit me with a question the moment I arrived. He said, ``Why are \nyou leaving? Why are you and so many others leaving?''\n  Of course, I could have given a glib answer and said, ``Well, I'd \nrather have people wonder why I'm leaving than stay and have people \nwonder why I'm staying.'' But it was a serious question that required a \nserious answer.\n  Each of us are leaving for different and profoundly personal reasons. \nSome are departing the Senate at the end of this session because of \nage. Some are departing because of health factors. Some are departing, \nlike my colleague from Kansas, for family reasons, of wanting to be at \nhome with her children and grandchildren.\n  For me, I must say, there is never a good time to leave the best job \nin the world. There is never a good time to do that. But for me, it is \nthe best time. I have what I would call a Gothic preoccupation with the \nrelentless tick of time. I served almost a quarter of a century on \nCapitol Hill now representing the people of Maine, and I know had I \nchosen to run one more term, the pressure would have been on to say, \n``Well, now that you are chairman of one of the various committees on \nwhich you serve, we need to keep you where you are, so run again.'' So \nit would be 12 years from now I would then still be running after \nSenator Strom Thurmond, whom I am sure by that time would have \nrenounced his late-blooming support for term limits and decided he \nwanted just one more term.\n\n  But the subject of term limits, of course, raises another issue. The \npeople of Maine passed by way of referendum a proposal to place a two-\nterm limitation on those who serve in the U.S. Senate. It was not \nbinding, as such. It was not retroactive, and so it never would have \napplied to me or, indeed, to Senator Mitchell. But it basically said \nsomething about the mood of the people of our State; that they feel, or \nhave come to feel, at least those who voted, that 12 years is long \nenough.\n  I must say, in the back of my mind, that weighed rather heavily; that \neven though it did not apply to me in any legal sense, in spirit, some \nwere at least saying, you have been there twice as long as we would \nlike to see people serve in the U.S. Congress.\n  I think it is a mistake. It is open to, obviously, a difference of \nopinion, with good will on both sides of this particular debate. But I \nthink it is a mistake to suggest that people should only be here 12 \nyears and move on. It will only, in my judgment, continue the churning \nof people moving in, moving out, and we lose a sense of history that a \nSenator Robert Byrd possesses and that of Senator Moynihan and others. \nI can go down the list of people who serve with great distinction, who \nbring such a wealth of information, a sense of history, a sense of \nreverence for the finest institution in the world.\n  That is a personal judgment on my part, but I think we should be wary \nof just pushing people in, pushing them out, relieving people of their \nresponsibility of voting. We have term limits. We have them now. They \nare called elections. If you don't like what your elected official is \ndoing, then go to the polls and vote them out. But, no, it is an easy \nway to say, ``We don't even have to think about it, it is automatic. \nYou have done your 12 years; now move on.''\n  So that was something that weighed at least in the corners of my \nconsciousness as to whether I should stay or leave.\n  I must say to my colleagues that my goal in politics has always been \nquite modest, and that is to help restore a sense of confidence in the \nintegrity of the process itself, to help bring Washington a bit closer \nto the main streets of my home State. I have always tried to bring a \nsense of balance and perspective and, yes, let me use the word, \nmoderation. It is not in vogue today to talk about being a moderate. We \nare frequently depicted as being mushy or weak-principled or having no \nprinciple, looking for compromise--another word which has somehow taken \non a negative tone.\n  I recall after supporting the crime bill 2 years ago, a call came \ninto one of my district offices, and a man was very angry. He said, ``I \nam angry with your boss,'' to one of my staffers.\n  I said, ``Why was he angry?''\n  He said, if you excuse the expression, ``He's too damn reasonable.''\n  Perhaps that will be the epitaph on my gravestone.\n  I believe it is essential to have passion in politics, provided that \npassion doesn't blind us to the need to seek, find and build consensus. \nRepublicans and Democrats have different philosophies. We are \ndifferent. We see the role of Government in different ways, of either \nthe need for its limitation or expansion. But we have the same goal, \nand that is to provide the greatest amount of good for the greatest \namount of people in this country. I also think it is sheer folly to \nbelieve that either party holds the keys to the kingdom of wisdom, and \nI think the danger to our political system is that each party is going \nto plant its feet in ideological cement and refuse to move.\n  The Senate has changed since I first came here. The personalities \nhave surely changed, and that is to be expected. It was inevitable. We \nhad people of such stature like Senator Ribicoff, Senator Baker, \nSenator Javits, Senator Tower, Senator Jackson, Senator Rudman, Senator \nDanforth, and the list goes on. They have all departed from this \ninstitution, and we lost a great deal when they retired or passed away.\n  So the personalities have changed, but the process has also changed.\n\n[[Page S11480]]\n\n Toffler wrote a book some years ago in which he said we were entering \nthe age of future shock, in which time would be speeded up by events \nand our customs and culture would be shaken in the hurricane winds of \nchange.\n  Those hurricane winds of change have been blowing through this \nChamber over the past three decades as well, and has changed, \nfundamentally, the operation of the Senate itself. The introduction of \ncameras into our Chamber has changed it, some for the good and some not \nfor the good.\n\n  The House has always been able to act differently than the Senate. \nThe House is a different body, a different institution with a different \nhistory. I served there for 6 years.\n  I recall reading that Emerson with a visitor in the gallery, pointed \nto the House floor, and he said, ``There, sir, is a standing \ninsurrection.'' And that is what it is. It is far more energetic and \nboisterous and full of passion because that is the House of the people. \nThat is where they are closest to the people that we serve.\n  The House undertook a 100-day march at the beginning of this session. \nThey passed some major legislation. The pressure immediately was on the \nSenate: ``Why can't you do the same? We did all of this in 100 days. \nWhy can't you do the same?'' And the answer is, the Senate was never \ndesigned to act in 100 days, to take up the same agenda in the same \nperiod of time. We were designed to slow down the process, to be more \nthoughtful about exactly what we were about, to take up major issues \nand to ventilate them, to debate them at length, if necessary, to allow \nthe public to understand exactly what we were undertaking, to express \ntheir approbation or disapproval.\n  But now the pressure is on to move faster and faster, to become more \nlike the House. That is a great institution, but we should not merge \nthe two identities.\n  I think there has been a loss of reverence for our institutions. In \nfact, if you look, perhaps the Supreme Court may be the only \ninstitution for which there is a deep sense of respect and reverence, \nand perhaps that is because the mystique that surrounds it has yet to \nbe torn away and shredded.\n  I find it troubling that we see shoving matches outside committee \nrooms in the other body. While poets have asked, ``What rough beast \nslouching its way toward Bethlehem,'' we have to ask, ``What rough \nbeast slouching its way toward the Potomac?'' Is it the Russian Duma? \nHave we come to shoving matches to make our points? It was discouraging \nto see that passions are so high that we have to resort to fisticuffs.\n  Perhaps there is a recognition that we have gone too far. We can take \nsome hope that Members in the other body are now holding retreats and \nactually socializing. Think about that. They are deciding to socialize, \nDemocrats and Republicans, something unheard of for the past 2 years, \nand now starting to socialize to get to know each other a little bit \nbetter so that perhaps during the height of those passionate debates, \nthey might still maintain a sense of order and respect.\n  I remember during the Watergate process I served on the House \nJudiciary Committee that was debating whether to bring impeachment \narticles against Richard Nixon. It was more than 22 years ago. And I \nraised a question. I said, ``How did we ever get from `The Federalist \nPapers' to the edited transcripts? How have we come that far?'' And I \nwondered yesterday, in the same vein, how did we ever get away from the \nkind of relationships that Gerald Ford and ``Tip'' O'Neill and Tom \nFoley and Bob Michel had with each other where they could vigorously \ndebate their philosophical differences but go out and play a round of \ngolf or have a drink after debate ended that day, and now we find \nourselves filing ethics complaints against each other, a volley going \nback and forth to see who can make the strongest charges against the \nother?\n  Mr. President, there are many reasons why this is taking place. It \nwould take a full day and longer to analyze them from a sociological \npoint of view. I would prefer to defer to someone of Senator Moynihan's \nstature and knowledge, to talk about social issues. But I think radio \nand television has contributed somewhat to that stripping away of \nreverence for our institutions. We now have journalists who are \nheralded as celebrities. They have radio shows and television programs \nthough which they have achieved a great deal of notoriety.\n\n  Some of them achieve notoriety by taking the most extreme positions \npossible and using the most inflammatory rhetoric they can, and, of \ncourse, as the rhetoric becomes more extreme, their popularity tends to \nsoar. As their popularity soars, the invitations for them to come and \naddress various conventions and groups also continues to escalate, as \ndo their speaking fees.\n  Somehow, all of that excessive, inflated, and sometimes outrageous \nrhetoric starts to get recirculated back into the congressional \ndebates, because then Members of Congress are invited to participate in \nthose very shows and programs. They are then prone to come up with \nsomething equally extreme or quotable so that they can continue to be \ninvited back on the programs.\n  So a little vicious circle has been set up and set in motion, people \nthen vying for the best quote, the most inflammatory, provocative thing \nthey can say in order to make the news on that program or another.\n  There is also the hydraulic pressure that everyone in this body and \nthe other body faces from the endless quest for raising campaign funds.\n  There is the rise of the negative attack ads. It is a sorry spectacle \nthat we have been witnessing all too much. We all say that they are \nterrible, but all of the consultants say, ``But they work.'' So we have \nallowed ourselves to lower the sense of decency and civility in this \ncountry by attacking character, trying to portray our adversaries, our \npolitical adversaries as enemies, as evil-minded people who are set out \nto destroy the fabric of this country.\n  We have witnessed the rise of special interest groups. There have \nalways been special interest groups, but today they are far more \norganized, they are far more technologically advanced than ever before, \nand they have a greater capability than ever before of blunting and \nstultifying any attempt to forge legislation in the Congress.\n  John Rauch wrote an article for the National Journal some time ago--I \nthink since has been expanded into a book--but it referred to the \nprocess as ``demosclerosis,'' that the arteries of our democratic \nsystem have become so clogged with special-interest activities and \norganizations that it is virtually impossible to work any kind of \nchange because single-minded groups have more at stake in preventing \nlegislative changes than the general public has in supporting them. So \nthere is that intensity of interest, and they are able to hit a button \nand suddenly flood our offices with 5,000 letters overnight or several \nhundred phone calls in the matter of a few hours.\n  There is also, I must say, a reluctance on the part of the Members of \nthis body and the other body to touch the so-called third rails, to \ntouch politically volatile issues like Social Security and Medicare and \nentitlements. All of us have been shying away from these issues.\n  We have to rethink exactly what the role of a U.S. Senator is. I \nalways felt that it was the responsibility of Members of this body who \nare elected to come to Washington, to become as informed as they \npossibly could, to have an open door to all special interests--and \neveryone in this country has a special interest--to be open to all \nissues and arguments and advocates, and then to weigh the respective \nmerits of those arguments, to sift through them and come to a \nconclusion and vote, and then go back to our constituents and explain \nexactly why we voted as we did, not just react to or appease the most \nvocal among our citizenry.\n\n  Some of that has changed. We do not quite do that anymore. Today, we \nare being driven by overnight polls. Today, we are lobbied intensively \nby various groups. Today, everything has become compressed.\n  Margaret Chase Smith, I mentioned her earlier. She used to sit over \nhere to my right. She never announced a vote until the roll was \ncalled--never. And that was her particular mark, saying, ``I want to \nhear what all the arguments are before I make my decision.'' Most \npeople cannot do that today. Most people are not allowed that luxury of \nwaiting until debate is concluded before announcing their \ndecision. Those who do\n\n[[Page S11481]]\n\nrun the risk of being criticized editorially or otherwise as being \nindecisive, possessing a Hamlet-like irresoluteness. You mean you do \nnot know how you will vote on a bill that may come to the floor a month \nfrom now? Have you not thought it clearly through?\n\n  We even get ranked by various groups on legislation that we do not \ncosponsor, so that you have black marks listed next to your name if you \nrefuse to cosponsor a bill that may never come to the Senate floor.\n  I have on occasion taken this podium and announced that the mail \ncoming to my office and phone calls coming to my office were running \nheavily against the position I was about to take. Having said that on \nthe Senate floor, my office would then be flooded with immediate calls \nsaying, how dare you indicate that your mail is running two or three or \nfour or five to one but you are going to vote the other way? How could \nyou possibly be so arrogant? Well, of course, those callers presume \nthat that body of mail and that volume of calls received reflect the \nwill of the people of Maine, which may or may not be the case. Much of \nthe time it is so highly organized it does not reflect the general will \nof the people of the State.\n  But it also presumes that we serve no function other than to tally up \nthe letters and to tally up the phone calls. You do not need us for \nthat. You do not need a U.S. Senator to do that. All the people have to \ndo is just buy a few computer terminals and put them in our office, \nhave the mail come in, count the phone calls, and then push a button \nand have a vote. You do not need us for that.\n  So we have to restore the sense of what the role of a Senator is. We \nhave to really work to persuade our constituents that this is not a \ndirect democracy, it is a republic. It is what Benjamin Franklin said: \n``We have given you a republic, if you can keep it.''\n  So we have to dedicate ourselves not to a direct democracy, or to \nvoting according to the passions of the moment of what an overnight \npoll may or may not show, but to consider thoughtfully and weigh the \nmerits of the opposing arguments and then take a stand on an issue and \ntry to persuade our constituents we have done, if not the right thing, \nat least a reasonable thing. If we cannot do that, we do not deserve to \nbe reelected. That is the way the system should operate--not, take an \novernight poll and formulate our policy to comport to what the \novernight poll shows. Polling is now driving our policies, driving it \nin the White House--this is not the first White House--and it is \ndriving it in Congress as well.\n  Mr. President, I am fond of quoting from Justice Oliver Wendell \nHolmes Jr, and the Presiding Officer as a very gifted attorney, I know, \nis familiar with his writings and his works.\n  He wrote at one point:\n       I often imagine Shakespeare or Napoleon summing himself up \n     and thinking: ``Yes, I have written 5,000 lines of solid gold \n     and a good deal of padding--I, who have covered the Milky Way \n     with words that outshone the stars, yes, I beat the \n     Australians in Italy and elsewhere, and I made a few \n     brilliant campaigns, I ended up in a cul-de-sac. I, who \n     dreamed of a world monarchy and Asiatic power. Holmes said, \n     ``We cannot live our dreams, we are lucky enough if we can \n     give a sample of our best, if in our hearts we can feel it \n     has been nobly done.''\n\n  During the past 24 years, I have tried to give a sample of my best. I \nwill leave it, of course, to the people of Maine to judge whether it \nhas been nobly done. I mentioned a sample of the best, because \nyesterday for me was a very momentous day. I had the great privilege of \ncochairing a hearing held by the Senate Aging Committee and the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. For the first time in 18 years, I had the \nhonor of sitting beside Senator Mark Hatfield, a man whom I admire \nenormously, someone who stands as tall and straight and tough as any \nindividual that has ever occupied these desks.\n  We held a hearing to deal with the issue of providing in some fashion \nmore funding for research for medical technologies and developments. We \nhad quite a remarkable group of people testifying before that joint \ncommittee. We had General Schwarzkopf who, having defeated Saddam \nHussein's army on the battlefield, waged another kind of battle against \nprostate cancer. He was successful, and he is now waging a campaign on \na national level to educate the American people of what the dread \ndisease really entails and how it needs to be combated.\n  We heard from Rod Carew who talked about losing his 18-year-old \ndaughter Michelle to leukemia, a very painful experience for him, and \nthe television program that was shown to demonstrate her lightness of \nbeing, her generosity of heart and spirit was moving to all of us.\n  We heard from Travis Roy. Travis Roy is a young man from Yarmouth, \nME. He was a great hockey player. He lived for the moment that he would \ntake to the rink and play for Boston University. He suited up, stepped \non to the ice, and 11 seconds later he became a quadraplegic, having \nbeen shoved head first into the boards. But to listen to him talk about \nwhat his aspirations are, that he wanted one day to have the kind of \nhelp, medical help that would allow him to get married, to hug his \nwife, to hug his mother, to teach his son how to play hockey, as his \nfather had taught him, was quite a moment.\n\n  We had Joan Samuelson who has been waging a 9-year battle against \nParkinson's disease. She talked about the day-to-day struggle that she \nhas to encounter, and so many others, hundreds of thousands if not \nmillions of others, have to confront every day of their lives, just to \ncarry out functions that we take for granted.\n  We heard from a young woman from Oregon who is dedicating her life to \nbecome a research scientist but does not know if she will be able to \ncomplete that kind of education or whether the funding will ever be \navailable to carry on medical research.\n  It was a momentous occasion for all of us. But what was equally \npoignant for me and memorable was the reaction of our colleagues. I \nparaphrased a poet during the course of the morning, and I said each of \nus, every one of us, here in the galleries, here on the floor, we all \nprepare a face to meet the faces that we meet. Every one of us puts on \na mask every single day. But for at least a moment yesterday, every one \nof the Senators who were there dropped the mask of being U.S. Senators \nand revealed the pain and suffering that they, too, have known.\n  We had Senator Pryor who talked about his son's illness, having \ncancer of his Achilles tendon and what that entailed. We heard from \nSenator Connie Mack who talked about the loss of his brother and his \nwife's fight against breast cancer. Conrad Burns, Harry Reid, Bob \nBennett, Herb Kohl--each one of them told a personal story of their own \npain and suffering of that of friends and family members.\n  It was not, Mr. President, an adversarial hearing. It was a \nbipartisan meeting, a realization that we have to dedicate ourselves to \ndefeating on a bipartisan basis common enemies that assault us daily. \nYesterday we spoke of disease, but there are far more enemies that \nawait us as we rocket our way into the 21st century.\n  There is something called a balanced budget. We can work toward a \nbalanced budget on a bipartisan basis. This is not a political \nstatement. This is a moral imperative. This is something that we have \nan absolute obligation to our children and our grandchildren to do. It \ndoes not matter whether you are a Republican or a Democrat or \nIndependent. We have to balance the budget within a reasonable \ntimeframe if there is any hope for ever solving this country's fiscal \ncrisis.\n  Mr. President, we can have and we have to have a bipartisan consensus \non the need for a strong national defense and a coherent and consistent \nforeign policy. I say this not as partisan, but we have lacked \ncoherency, we have lacked consistency, and it has been to the great \ndetriment of this country's credibility as the only superpower in the \nworld.\n  I am fond of thinking back to a time when Churchill was being served \nhis breakfast by his man-servant and, as the breakfast was being \ndelivered to him, he said, ``Take this pudding away; it has no theme.'' \nWell, we have been lacking a theme in foreign policy for too long.\n  You cannot pick up today's paper without being disheartened, if you \nlook at what is taking place in Israel today, or Russia, or Bosnia, or \nIraq, or China, or Japan. You cannot adopt the policy or the position \nthat, well, I am just going to focus upon domestic issues.\n\n[[Page S11482]]\n\n You can't focus just on domestic issues. You have to focus on foreign \npolicy because foreign activities can overwhelm your domestic concerns \nand considerations.\n  We need to develop a strong bipartisan consensus on what the role of \nthe country is to be in the next century. We have to do so and put \naside those differences that we may have on other issues. Everyone is \nfond of saying, ``We can't be the world's policeman.'' I agree, but we \ncan't afford to become a prisoner of world events either. It requires \nus to be engaged, and requires us to be engaged not only with the \nPresident, which we have yet to be engaged fully, in my judgment, on a \nnumber of key issues; we have to be engaged with our allies and, \nindeed, even our adversaries. We have to have a world view. There is no \nsuch notion of coming back to America, of zipping ourselves in a \ncontinental cocoon and watching the world unfold on CNN. We have to be \nactively and aggressively engaged in world affairs. History has shown \nthat every time we have walked away from the world, the world has not \nwalked away from us. The history of the 20th century has been one of \nwarfare. What we need to prevent the 21st century from descending into \nwarfare is an active, aggressive engagement in world affairs.\n  Mr. President, we need to have a restoration of individual and \ncommunity responsibilities. We don't need to debate that issue as \nDemocrats or Republicans. We have to return to the stern virtues of \ndiscipline and self-reliance. That should not be a matter of partisan \ndebate. Everyone understands what has happened in this country by \nsimply turning to Government to solve our problems. We have to get back \nto a sense of moral responsibility, fiscal responsibility, self \nresponsibility, to be accountable for our own actions, and, yes, turn \nto the Government and have that Government care for individuals who are \nunable to care for themselves, be they poor, disabled or elderly.\n  We also, Mr. President, must work very hard on a bipartisan basis to \nheal the racial divide in this country. The words ``affirmative \naction'' are no longer in vogue; it is distinctly out of fashion to \ntalk about affirmative action in America. Many people say it is the \nobligation of Government--if not the reality--to be colorblind. Well, \nwe don't live in a colorblind society. It is a fiction. We live in a \nsociety in which racism is still very much alive. It is an evil that we \nhave to rise up and confront day in and day out.\n  The notion that we are all starting from the same line, the same end \nzone, running a 100-yard dash, is pure folly. Can you imagine \nsuggesting that we are starting out equal, when you have some young \nchildren in suburbia who go to bed with their laptops and teddy bears \nat night, and children in the urban areas who go to sleep still ducking \nbullets that are fired by gangs? Are they starting off equally in our \nsociety?\n\n  Affirmative action may not be the answer to these problems, but we \ncannot adopt a position of indifference or hostility to recognizing the \nneed to overcome barriers that have been erected for centuries against \npeople who have been deprived of their opportunity to participate fully \nin the American dream.\n  Mr. President, I could go on at length about the subject of the need \nto heal the racial divide, or the wound that has been opened up in our \ncommunities. I will save it for another time in a different forum, \nobviously.\n  I would like to conclude my remarks by referring to a book that was \nwritten many years ago by Allen Drury. If ever there was an author who \ncaptured the essence of what this institution at least used to be like, \nit was Allen Drury in his novel ``Advice and Consent,'' written and \npublished in 1959. He said something which I have carried around with \nme from those very days when I first read the book. He said about us:\n\n       They come, they stay, they make their mark writing big or \n     little on their times in a strange, fantastic, fascinating \n     land in which there are few absolute wrongs or absolute \n     rights, few all-blacks or all-whites, few dead-certain \n     positives that won't change tomorrow, their wonderful, mixed-\n     up, blundering, stumbling, hopeful land, in which evil men do \n     good things and bad men do evil things, where there is a \n     delicate balance that only Americans can understand, and \n     often they, too, are baffled.\n\n  It was a wonderful description of Washington itself. But I have gone \nfurther back into the past in Mr. Drury's writings, and I found \nsomething even more pertinent and important to me. He kept a journal. \nHe used to sit up in that press gallery and look down upon the workings \nof the U.S. Senate. He kept a journal between 1943 to 1945. It is a \nremarkable piece of writing. It is so brilliantly and eloquently \nexpressed, I don't think there has been a better piece of writing since \nthat time. He said something about the Senate which I would like to \nrepeat for my colleagues, because I am sure that the book is not on the \nshelves of all of us. He said:\n\n       You will find them very human, and you can thank God that \n     they are. You will find that they consume a lot of time \n     arguing, and you can thank God that they do. You will find \n     that the way they do things is occasionally brilliant, but \n     often slow and uncertain, and you can thank God that it is. \n     Because of all these things, they are just like the rest of \n     us, and you can thank God for that, too. That is their \n     greatness and their strength, and that is what makes your \n     Congress what it is--the most powerful guarantor of human \n     liberties free men have devised. You put them there, and as \n     long as they are there, then you can remain free because they \n     don't like to be pushed around any more than you do. This is \n     comforting to know.\n\n  I don't know, if Mr. Drury were sitting up in the gallery today, that \nhe would look down and find as much comfort as he did in 1943 through \n1945. But I must say that I do.\n  After all that I have said in pointing out all the difficulties and \nall the problems that confront us as an institution, I take hope. I \nlook at people like Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, John Breaux of Louisiana, \nKent Conrad, John Chafee, Olympia Snowe, Slade Gorton, who is sitting \nin the Chair, Bob Bennett, Pat Moynihan, and they are just a few--in \nspite of all of the difference, all of the criticism we have witnessed \nin the past--and John Glenn who just walked through the door. I include \nhim by all means in that category of people that I look to the future \nwith great hope and encouragement.\n\n  I want to just point out that, several years ago, when Senator Sam \nNunn and Senator Pete Domenici--two more giants in this body--offered \nan amendment to curb the growth of entitlements, I thought they came up \nwith a very rational, responsible proposal. It said, let us take the \nentitlement programs that are growing at such a dramatic rate and see \nif we can't rein in those spending programs a little. Everybody who is \nentitled to enter a program can still come in and we will provide a \ncost-of-living adjustment, a COLA, every year, and for the next 2 years \nwe will even add 2 percent, and then we will cap it at that rate. It \nsounded eminently reasonable to me. But what happened? How many people \nvoted for that? I think it was 26. Only 26 Members were prepared to \nstand up and endure the wrath of our constituents, for fear that we \nwere taking away something that they were entitled to. Well, that has \nchanged,\n  Mr. President, thanks to people like you, the senior Senator from \nWashington, and thanks to the others I have mentioned, and so many \nmore, we had a vote recently in which we presented a balanced budget \nthat included some very difficult choices. It included reductions in \nthe growth of Medicare. It included some tax cuts--not as much as many \nhad hoped but more than perhaps many believe we are entitled to at this \nmoment in time, but, nonetheless, tax cuts; Medicare reductions; \nreductions of a half of a percentage point in the Consumer Price Index. \nSome would like to have at least 1 percent, but half a percent is a \nvery courageous thing from Members to do in an election year. Forty-six \nMembers of the U.S. Senate went on record in favor of that. That is why \nI am encouraged that we will find men and women succeeding those of us \nwho are departing and who will look into the eyes of their constituents \nand say, ``This is something that is right for us to do.''\n\n  The Social Security system eventually will go bankrupt, the trustees \nsay by the year 2029. Around 2015, revenues collected will be exceeded \nby payments to beneficiaries. Medicare will be broke in 6 years.\n  It is a tragedy that the White House has absolved itself of this \nissue and has refused to come to the grips with the issue of Medicare \nsolvency. I know what is going to happen. They will wait until the \nelections are over, and then, whoever wins at that time--if it is\n\n[[Page S11483]]\n\nPresident Clinton who wins reelection, I can almost guarantee that the \nfirst thing he will do will call for the creation of a blue ribbon \ncommission to resolve the Medicare crisis. It is an issue that should \nbe debated this year. It should have been resolved this year, but it \nwill not be.\n  I take hope, Mr. President, when I look at leaders such as Tom \nDaschle and Trent Lott. I know, again, what the reaction was when \nSenator Mitchell, my colleague from Maine--again, I point out he was \none of the most effective majority leaders in the history of this \nbody--when he left, there was a great expression of woe. ``What will we \ndo?'' When our distinguished colleague, Bob Dole, left, all of us felt \nthe pang and the anxiety of saying, ``What are we going to do now?'' \nBob Dole is no longer with us--a master at bringing people together.\n  I believe that we are still in good hands. I am impressed with the \nmajority leader, with his drive, intelligence, and determination and, \nyes, his pragmatism, his willingness on key issues to reach across the \naisle, and to say, ``Can't we work this out? We have our differences, \nbut can't we at least come to some kind of consensus on the major \nissues confronting this country?'' I am enormously impressed with his \ntalents, and those of Senator Daschle as well, both men of outstanding \nability and good will.\n  To those people who declare that ``the center can no longer hold; \nthings are going to fall apart; the best are lacking in conviction \nwhile the worst are full of passion and intensity,'' I say nonsense. \nThere are going to be people who will come to this Chamber who will be \nfilled with passion, to be sure, who will argue strenuously for their \npositions. But I believe it is inevitable that they will come back to \nthe center.\n  The center may have shifted slightly to the right. People are more \nconservative today than they were 10 or 20 years ago. But the center \nhas to hold. If the center does not hold, then you will have \nstagnation. If the center does not hold, then you will have paralysis. \nIf the center does not hold, you will have Government shutdowns. When \nthat takes place, the level of cynicism that currently exists will only \ndeepen to a point that is so dangerous that it will afflict us for \ngenerations to come.\n  Mr. President, Alistair Cooke summed it up for me in his wonderful \nbook called ``America.'' In one of his chapters, he made the inevitable \ncomparison between the United States and Rome. He said that we, like \nRome, were in danger of losing that which we profess to cherish most. \nHe said liberty is the luxury of self-discipline; that those nations \nwho have historically failed to discipline themselves have had \ndiscipline imposed upon them by others. He said America is a country in \nwhich I see the most persistent idealism and the greatest cynicism, and \nthe race is on between its vitality and its decadence. He said we \nhave--paraphrasing Franklin--a great country, and we can keep it, but \nonly if we care to keep it.\n\n  I believe based upon the many friends that I have made here--the \npeople that I admire and who are leaving with me, but those, more \nimportantly, who are staying and those who will come--that there is a \ngenuine desire to keep this the greatest country on the face of the \nEarth, a country that is still a beacon of hope and idealism throughout \na world that is filled with so much oppression and darkness, and this \nwill remain the greatest living institution in all of the world.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my friend, \ncolleague, and the senior Senator from New Jersey, Bill Bradley, as he \nleaves the U.S. Senate. I have served with Bill Bradley for nearly 14 \nyears, my entire tenure in this body, and it is difficult to imagine \nwhat it will be like without him. Although we have different styles, \nrhythms, and backgrounds, we formed an effective team which fought \ntogether for our State's and our Nation's interests.\n\n  Throughout his life, Bill Bradley has achieved remarkable success as \na scholar, an athlete, an author and an outstanding public official. \nAnd whether he was helping his team to championships at Princeton \nUniversity, the Olympic arena, or the floor of Madison Square Garden, \nor helping to pass landmark legislation on the floor of the Senate, \nBill Bradley always strives for the best. He has performed always as a \nrising star, and I know that this is not his apex.\n  Mr. President, in the Senate, Bill Bradley concentrated on a few \nareas and helped to translate his own vision into public policy. As a \nmember of the Finance Committee, he continually fought for fair tax \npolicy, honest budgeting, and economic policies that enhance growth. He \nis widely known as the author of the fair tax, which was the foundation \nof the Tax Reform Act of 1986.\n  Bill also knew that the single best economic advantage is a good \neducation. So he designed a new way to help pay for college. His self-\nreliance loans give all students, regardless of income, the chance to \nborrow money from the Federal Government.\n  He has been a strong voice against gun violence and crime in our \ncommunities and a creative thinker in developing opportunities for \nurban youth. His efforts are reflected in the enactment of community \nbanking and urban enterprise zone legislation, educational reforms and \ncommunity policing programs.\n  But what many of us will remember most is Bill's passion when it \ncomes to issues involving equality. Bill established himself as a \nserious and badly needed voice in the national dialog on racism, \npluralism, and discrimination. He has challenged every American to \nconfront the festering sore of racism. In his keynote at the 1992 \nDemocratic convention, he warned that ``We will advance together, or \neach of us will be diminished.''\n  One of his most powerful moments in the Senate, and one which I will \nnever forget, was his denunciation of the horrifying beating of Rodney \nKing. I will always remember Bill standing at his podium, pounding it \n56 times with a bunch of pencils. His blows were meant to represent the \nbeating administered by the police to Rodney King. The sound, \nresonating through the Senate Chamber, was a powerful reminder of just \nhow far we need to go on the road to equality.\n  In the international arena, Bill Bradley was so energetic and \ncommitted that he traveled to the former Soviet Union for a weekend--to \ntry to facilitate understanding between the superpowers, and to foster \npeaceful co-existence through economic cooperation.\n  With all of his achievements, Bill's chief goal in the Senate was to \nfurther the interests of New Jersey. He has written that he once \nreceived a special gift, a collection of every variety of rock found in \nour Garden State. I, too, think that it is the perfect gift, because \nwhat could better symbolize a man whose commitment to New Jersey's \ninterests and her people was always rock solid?\n\n  His hard-working schedule would, on occasion, take Bill to New Jersey \ntwice in a single day, in order to fulfill his obligations to meet with \nconstituents, to help solve a problem, to deliver a talk to students, \nor to simply stay on top of the Garden State's needs. And his famous \nNew Jersey beach walks, which he took during every one of the past 18 \nyears, are symbolic of Bill's constant presence and consistent \ncommitment to our State.\n  Bill has written that he prefers moving to standing still, well I \nknow that wherever his journey takes him, his ultimate destination will \nbe success, and all of us will benefit from his efforts. To my friend, \ncolleague, and fellow New Jerseyan, I thank you for the contributions \nyou have made, and for those yet to come. I offer my wish for continued \nsuccess and happiness.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on Wednesday, September 25, 1996, notice\n\n[[Page S11484]]\n\nappeared in the Congressional Record that a final issue of the \nCongressional Record for the 104th Congress will be published on \nOctober 21, 1996, in order to permit Members to revise and extend their \nremarks.

Mr. President, the time has come that, I daresay, every \nMember in this Chamber, Republican as well as Democrat, hoped would \nnever come. With the end of the 104th Congress, we must say goodbye to \n``The Judge''--Senator Howell Heflin.\n  Since he was first elected to the Senate in 1978, the senior Senator \nfrom Alabama has always shown himself to be a southern gentleman of the \nfirst order. His word is his bond; his integrity and dedication to \npublic service is without question; and his love of country and \ndevotion for the U.S. Senate is apparent to all who know him.\n  During his 18 years in the Senate, Senator Heflin has been \nrespectfully called the ``spokesman for Southern agriculture'' for his \nefforts to improve the life and work of America's farmers and to \npreserve his State's valuable agricultural heritage.\n  He is also commonly and warmly referred to as ``The Judge,'' not only \nfor his years of service as the chief justice of the Alabama Supreme \nCourt, but for his efforts in State court reform, his extraordinary \nleadership in fighting crime and drug abuse, and his service on both \nthe Senate Judiciary and Ethics Committees. Dozens of times I have \nobserved my colleagues seek his advice on how to vote on legal issues.\n  Mr. President, I would like to add another characterization of ``The \nJudge''--I think of Senator Heflin as ``Mr. Alabama.'' No Senator has \nmore cherished or more ably respesented his or her State than the \nsenior senator from Alabama. He has magnificently and skillfully \ncombined the national interest with the interest of his State through \nhis support of Federal agricultural programs, America's space program, \nand the maintenance of a first-rate defense. Only in 1 year during his \n18 years in the Senate did he fail to visit each of the 67 counties in \nhis State in order to do what he says he likes best--``talk to the home \nfolks.''\n  The people of Alabama, obviously, appreciated his work and his \nservice. Never once did he poll less than 61 percent of the vote in any \nelection.\n  I will always remember ``The Judge.'' I will always remember him as a \n``public servant who served with dignity, integrity and diligence, \nworthy of the confidence and trust that Alabamians placed'' in him.\n  And I miss him. I will miss his folksy, southern humor. His stories \nof ``Sockless Sam.'' His depictions of friends and foes alike--in his \n1990 campaign, he did not run against a mere Republican, he ran against \na ``Gucci-shoed, Mercedes-driving, Jacuzzi-soaking, Perrier-drinking, \nGrey Poupon Republican.''\n  Now the time has come. I say thank you and congratulations to Senator \nHeflin on a remarkable career in the Senate. I wish him all the best, \nand to his wonderful wife, ``Mike,'' as they embark on the next phase \nof their lives--their return to Tuscumbia, which, ``Mr. Alabama'' has \ncalled ``a wonderful little town to be from and best little town in \nAmerica to go him to.''\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11484-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11484-S11488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 1296\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I ask \nunanimous consent, after consultation with the distinguished Democratic \nleader, that we may turn to the consideration of the conference report \nto accompany the Presidio bill, and when the Senate turns to the \nconsideration of the conference report, at this time, the reading be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. On behalf of a number of my colleagues, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I obviously regret hearing the \nobjection from the other side to dispense with the reading of the \nPresidio conference report. I am informed by the clerk that this would \ntake awhile. It has been estimated at some 10 hours or thereabouts. \nNeedless to say, the Senate has many very important pieces of \nlegislation that we must enact prior to the end of the fiscal year.\n  This objection is an obvious indication that Members on the other \nside of the aisle do not intend or do not want to have this significant \nparks bill have consideration before this body. The objecters have been \ninformed, it is my understanding, if they were to let the Senate turn \nto the conference report, that I, as leader, was to immediately ask \nunanimous consent that the conference report be recommitted back to the \nconference committee in order that the conferees could address several \nissues raised by the President. Consequently, since the objection was \nraised, that conference committee unfortunately will be unable to meet \nand address these concerns.\n  So, obviously, the will of the Members will not have been addressed, \nthey will not have an opportunity to proceed with that. I regret that \nthe Senate Democrats feel a need to block the Senate from enacting this \nmassive omnibus parks bill, the single largest environmental package we \nhave had before us that affects 41 States and includes 126 separate \nparks and public land matters.\n  Each Member will continue to work with the Democratic leader. \nSpeaking for the leadership, Senator Lott has indicated he will \ncontinue to work with the Democratic Members who have objections, but \ntime is running out. So I urge all Members to rethink this objection, \nallow the conferees to address this very important issue.\n  Further, Mr. President, we are prepared--the Republicans are \nprepared; as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I \nam prepared; our conferees are prepared--to recommit this bill to \nconference. We can fix the provision which the leader referred to in \nhis statement which causes that small problem in the House.\n  What it was, was a small tax-related problem. As you know, most all \ntax issues must originate in the House, so we have taken that out. We \nhave the report here, Mr. President, ready to go, 700 pages, the result \nof 2 years of work, 126 separate sections are in here, 41 States are \nrepresented in here.\n  We have heard from the administration, but they objected to the Utah \nwilderness. Utah wilderness was not included. They went ahead and \ninitiated an action under the Antiquities Act. That is another story \nfor another time.\n  Grazing was a major issue, more objection from the administration. \nGrazing is not in here. The Tongass issue in my State to extend a \ncontract for 15 years so we could build a new pulp mill and save 4,000 \njobs, 1,000 directly in the pulp mill by extending the contract. That \nmill will never be built. The existing mill will be shut down. We will \nlose our jobs. I do not know what those people will do. That was taken \nout.\n  Up in Minnesota, the Minnesota wilderness lakes bill was objected to \nby\n\n[[Page S11485]]\n\nthe administration. We took that out. We have had communication with \nthe administration. We have tried to be responsive. They keep changing \nthe goal posts. They move them back. So now we are in a position where, \nI suppose, the administration has prevailed on some Members on the \nother side, and we are down in this mire again.\n  Now, we have still, if we can clear those objections, an opportunity \nto move this. We are ready to go, Mr. President. As I have said, the \nwork is done and our committee has acted. What we have is a rather \ncurious process around here where the authorizing committees, when we \nget down to the end, seem to have no voice. But the appropriations \neffort is now to pick a few things out of here, put them on the \nAppropriations Committee, and abandon the rest.\n  I looked at a list that came in from the White House last night, and \nit is significant, Mr. President, to see what they want deleted. They \nwant conveyance to the city of Sumpter, which authorizes the Secretary \nto convey 1.5 acres to the city of Sumpter, OR, for public purposes. \nThey are prepared to veto the whole package. This is supposed to be the \npeople's President. What in the world does he have against a place for \nkids to play?\n  I just met with a spokesman for the White House. They do not have any \nidea what is in here. They are simply carrying the bucket. Somebody \nsaid, object to that, we do not want it. That is Senator Hatfield's \nwill.\n  Section 218, Shenandoah National Park--Senators Robb and Warner and \nCongressmen Bliley and Wolf in the House. It is interesting to identify \nwho is who, because there is a certain amount of partisanship that you \ncannot help but see as a reality. It adjusts a 1923 boundary \nauthorization to meet today's park boundary. The White House staff \ninforms me they would have reached the same conclusion on the boundary \nadjustment but they needed more ``process.'' Now, when they invoked the \nAntiquities Act, they did not need more process. They made a land grab \nin Utah of 1.8 million acres. It does not take anything away from the \npark. The old map authorized 500,000 acres. If we went to that limit, \nthere would not be enough money in the Treasury to buy all the private \nfarms and homes that would be in the park.\n\n  The Tular conveyance, CA, big issue in the House, affirms that land \nsold by the railroad to citizens in Tular, CA, is free from any title \nproblems. That is section 219. They want that out. This was an attempt \nto bring some stability and certainty to land ownership in the town of \nTular. This administration does not seem to care about the town, the \nfolks, or their future.\n  Section 210, the Alpine school district, Senator Kyl and Senator \nMcCain, 30 acres of lands for a public school facility. What in the \nworld is wrong with supporting a school district and aiding in the \neducation of schoolchildren? I thought this was the educational \nPresident. We took these up. We have had hearings, 2 years of hearings. \nWe set up a process. This administration, in some of their rabbit-trail \nclearance process has come up with this lesson and said this is \nunacceptable.\n  I am saying we have an opportunity to move this, to remove the \nobjections. If we do not, there is another opportunity and we can put \nthe parks package as passed with the objectionable items they \nthreatened to veto that I already outlined, and we will put the whole \npackage in the appropriations bill and let it go. I pleaded with them \nto do that this morning. Well, they cannot accept all these little \nthings. These are the little things they cannot accept now.\n  Coastal barrier resource system, all Florida issues, transfers 40 \nacres of development property out of 2.1 million acres of undeveloped \nresource area. This is what the Florida delegation and the Governor \nbelieves, Democratic Governor believes, is in the best interest of \ntheir citizens. Since this President knows better than the States and \nthe elected officials what is good for the people, there is certainly \nno longer a need for State-level elected officials, if that is the \ncase.\n  Section 224, conveyance to the Del Norte County unified school \ndistrict, a big issue in California and House Members, transfers a \nsmall acreage to the school district for educational purposes. I guess \nit now takes more than a village to raise a child. The title to the new \nPresident's book is, ``All You Really Need Is a President To Raise a \nChild.''\n  I find this incredible, Mr. President. Here we are, picking the \nbones, if you will, of this legislation to suggest that Presidio should \nbe lost, San Francisco Bay area should be lost, Sterling Forest should \nbe lost. That is what they are saying. The Alaska peninsula subsurface \nconsolidation, one of mine, authorizes the Secretary to exchange \nsubsurface holdings of a small native corporation on an equal value--\nequal value--for lands and interest owned by the Federal Government. \nThis will complete exchanges approved earlier. It was this provision of \nthe bill that caused the tax problem. That was unfortunate. We have \ntaken care of it. From this action I can only conclude that the \nPresident thinks it is a good idea to have private inholdings in \nnational parks. We have taken that out.\n  Section 304--Olympic Committee, wake up--Snow Basin land exchange--I \ndo not know whether they have simply written off the State of Utah as \nthey have perhaps Alaska. Senators Hatch and Bennett, Representative \nHansen. This allows expedited land exchange to facilitate the 2002 \nWinter Olympics which would be an economic boom to Utah, economic boom \nto the West, and an economic boom, of course, to the United States as \nwell--the United States, Utah, the West. This has been in the process \nfor 6 years, and we have received absolutely nothing from the Clinton \nadministration as they try to balance some environmental objection. \nThey want to balance it. I am not sure what the President has against \nthe Olympics or the people of Utah. Maybe he would like to see the \nUnited States, I do not know, embarrassed in the eyes of the world by \nnot coming through. As far as Utah, Alaska, Idaho, and a few other \nStates, we are ready to secede from the Union. We would do better \nourselves than trying to deal with a legislative process that this \nadministration has dictated.\n\n  You know, I used to think, Mr. President, because we control the \nHouse and the Senate, we could perhaps get a few things done around \nhere. It doesn't seem to be the case.\n  Section 309. Sand Hollow Exchange. Senators Hatch and Bennett. \nAnother Utah. They seem to be pointing at Utah. Equal value exchange to \nadd acreage to Zion National Park and allows additional water to flow \nthrough the park.\n  His ``own'' people and the environmental community have pushed this \nexchange. I don't know what the President has against Utah. All I can \nconclude is that, perhaps, as a young man, Bill Clinton must have been \npushed down by a big kid from Utah during recess. That is the best \nexplanation I have heard.\n  Section 311. Land Exchange, city of Greely, CO, Senators Campbell and \nBrown. Equal value exchange to secure property needed by the city to \nsecure ownership of a city's water supply.\n  Well, apparently, this administration would like to manage the city \nof Greely's water supply--having achieved world peace and cured the \ncommon cold, they apparently are bored and need something to do. Well, \nsorry, Greely.\n  Section 312. Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve land \nexchange and boundary adjustment. That is mine, Governor Knowles, \nSenator Stevens, and Representative Young.\n  This exchange would have led to more than a 2 million acre expansion \nof the Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve in Alaska--in \nexchange for lands in Naval Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.\n  Since when is helping the national parks a bad idea in the Clinton \nadministration? The only conclusion that can be drawn is they don't \nlike it because it is not their idea. I don't know what else.\n  Kenai Natives Association land exchange. This would facilitate an \nexchange between the Kenai natives and the Fish and Wildlife Service to \nallow an Alaska Native Corporation to gain the economic use of their \nland, which would result from the acre-for-acre exchange.\n  There seems to be no rhyme or reason in the White House position. On \none hand, they don't want to add 2 million acres to a national park \nand, on\n\n[[Page S11486]]\n\nthe other hand, they want to double the acreage put into a withdrawal.\n  Now, I know we can debate the merits of some of these. We did it in \ncommittee. But we had a committee action, Mr. President. We had a \ncommittee vote. We brought the package before this body. You can vote \nup and down on the package. Some members said, ``Senator Murkowski, why \ndo you have this big package with 126 sections in it?'' The reason we \nhave this big package is obvious: Because Democrats--one specific \nDemocrat from New Jersey had a hold on every single bill out of our \ncommittee. There were holds put on by the Senators from Nevada, one or \nthe other. That is their own business. But that is why we could not \nmove these bills in the orderly process associated with the every-day \nbusiness of this body. So we waited until the end because that is all \nwe could do, put it in the package, present it before the Senate, and \nthat is where we are today.\n  Section 401. Cashe La Poudre Corridor, Senators Campbell and Brown, \ntheir number one priority. Establishes corridor to interpret and \nprotect unique and historical waterway.\n  All I can conclude from their refusal to support this action is they \ndon't think that the Cache La Poudre deserves to be protected. I guess \nthe people of Colorado are wrong in wanting to preserve an important \npiece of their history.\n\n  Section 405. RS2477, a western issue, Senators Murkowski, Hatch, \nBennett, Stevens. Puts a moratorium on the putting new regulations in \nplace without Congressional approval.\n  What in the world is the objection to that? That is the democratic \nprocess. This is ``just'' moratorium language. The minority and the BLM \nnegotiated this language with us. We were all in agreement.\n  Out west again. Section 406. To be eliminated is Hanford Reach \nPreservation, Senator Gorton and Congressman Hastings in the House. \nExtends a moratorium on construction of any new dams or impoundments in \nthis area.\n  Can we conclude from this action that Clinton wants to start building \ndams on the river? I don't know.\n  Section 502. Vancouver National Historic Preserve, Senators Gorton \nand Murray. It changes a historic site into a national park. I don't \nknow whether Senator Murray and Senator Gorton don't know what their \nconstituents want, but I assume they do.\n  Section 602, stricken. Corinth, Mississippi Battlefield Act. This is \nSenator Lott, who has been working on it for a long time. Establishes a \nNational Park Service Civil War site in Mississippi. Is there something \nwrong with honoring the events associated with the Civil War in \nMississippi? Or could it be that this is the majority leader's State, \nMississippi?\n  Moving a little further north in the south, section 603. Stricken. \nRichmond National Battlefield Park, Senators Warner and Robb. \nEstablishes boundary in accordance with a new National Park Service \nmanagement plan, dated August of this year.\n  The administration is concerned about the process. This did not seem \nto bother them when the President declared a national monument in Utah, \nwhich was created with no process. But the administration's excuse \nhere, to establish a boundary in accordance with new National Park \nService management plan, dated August of 1996. Is that an \nadministration that is concerned about the process? Come on, give us a \nbreak.\n  Where were the administration's explanations when the land grab was \nmade of 1.8 million acres in Utah, over the objections, and without the \nknowledge of the process even occurring--no public hearings and no \nnotification to the Utah delegation. They didn't do it, Mr. President, \nas you will recall, in Utah. They went to Arizona and put the desk on \nthe edge of the Grand Canyon--a big show. The press bought it, they are \ngullible. They bought it hook, line, and sinker. They knew there would \nhave been a few objections. A few school kids would have said, ``Hey, \nwhat about our school funding from some of this land?'' There was no \npublic process. I tell you, when you start to try to identify who is \nresponsible for these things, the accountability is awfully hard to \nfind in this administration, but there are a lot of rabbit trails that \nare easy to find.\n  Section 604. Revolutionary War, Senator Jeffords. That was a study to \ndetermine if these sites warrant further protection.\n  Most of the problems we have had with this administration is that \nthey simply leap before they think. I guess the idea of studying the \nneed for something before doing it perhaps is a bit alien in the \nconcepts of the White House. That has been proven time and again. This \nis very important to Senator Jeffords. It is a study to determine if \nthese sites warrant further protection.\n  Section 607. Shenandoah Valley Battlefield, Senators Warner and Robb \nagain. There is an election in Virginia this year, I believe. This \nwould establish a historical area. It doesn't make a new park. This \nthey want stricken. This is what the delegation wants. That is why we \nheld the hearings. That is why we had the input. That is why we \nresponded. Can they not be trusted, their own delegation, to determine \nwhat's right for their own constituents? Evidently not, because the \nWhite House wants that stricken. That is part of their veto package.\n\n  Ski Area Permits, 701. This simplifies a very complex ski area fee \ncollection process, making collection easier, cutting down on the \nadministrative costs, and it provides more funding for the Forest \nService and other Federal agencies that are collecting ski area \npermits. It is supported by the ski industry and supported by the ski \noperators.\n  As far as we knew there was not any objection to it. This is \nsupported by the National Ski Association and the Western States \nelected officials. We are elected officials. That is what I do not \nunderstand about this process. We are supposed to know something about \nwhat the people want. We are supposed to hold hearings. We are supposed \nto initiate a process. We have done that in these 126 sections of this \nbill. Now they are saying this is what is wrong. This is what we want \nout. And we can only speculate that the rationale is based on the \nconversations we have had.\n  Make no mistake about it. This is a process of long deliberations. \nThis package is part of a process. That is why it is so important it \nstay together. We have taken again those items out that they want to \ninitiate a veto on, and now they have come back again.\n  Section 703--visitor services--would raise $150 million for parks to \nhelp with badly needed repairs of existing park structure. One hundred \npercent of new fees go back to the park.\n  I do not understand the opposition to this. We had testimony in \nsupport of it. It is simply ridiculous. The Park Service needs these \nfunds to maintain operations.\n  This seems like a blatant attempt to tear down the national parks and \nblame the Congress. The national parks are over $4 billion behind on \nmaintenance. Here is a way to generate some relief.\n  Section 704--Glacier Bay National Park--raises fees to support \nresearch and natural resource protection through a head tax on \npassengers that go into Glacier Bay. And the only way you can get in \nthere is the cruise ships. It is a 90-day season. It starts Memorial \nDay and ends Labor Day.\n  What is wrong with that? Never let it be said that this \nadministration would let scientific data get between them and a \npolitical decision.\n  Section 803--feral burros and horses. This is a Missouri issue; \nSenator Ashcroft, and Senator Bond.\n  Notice the trend here, Mr. President, as we address the partisanship.\n  This bill would prevent the slaughter of wild horses by the National \nPark Service. It would prevent it. Take a look at it, you \nenvironmentalists out there.\n  Section 803--feral burros and horses; Ashcroft, and Bond. The bill \nwould prevent the slaughter of horses by the National Park Service.\n  It is not bad enough that the White House has declared an open \nhunting season on people of the West. They want to shoot the horses \nthat they rode into the West on as well, it seems. It is the only \nconclusion I can come to.\n  Section 806--Katmai National Park Agreements. It means a lot to \nCongressman Young. It authorizes the U.S. Geological Service to drill \nscientific core samples. This is volcanic research. In Alaska we have a \npretty hot plate. It blows up occasionally. It is about ready to do it \nhere. We have volcanoes. We have earthquakes. This is volcanic research \nauthorization.\n\n[[Page S11487]]\n\n  What is wrong with that? Maybe Mr. Clinton needs to live at the base \nof an active volcano, and he would appreciate the need for the advanced \nvolcano research. And where do you do it? You do it where you have \nvolcanoes. You don't do it in Vermont or Washington, DC. You do it out \non the Alaskan peninsula.\n  That is what this is all about. They object. They want to veto this \nover that.\n  I hope the American public would just be indignant for picking out \nthese--well, you have to judge for yourselves.\n  Section 811--expenditures of funds outside the boundary of Rocky \nMountain National Park.\n  That is rather interesting because that again focuses in on the great \nState of Colorado--Senator Campbell, and Senator Brown.\n  It simply allows the National Park Service to build a visitors center \noutside the park, mostly with private funds. They don't want that.\n  Section 815--National Park Service administrative reform--provides \nauthorities which the National Park Service has requested for years--\naid parks in protection of resources and provide facilities for \nemployees; provides facilities for National Park Service employees; \nprovides Senate confirmation of the National Park Service Director.\n  In keeping with that theme, not only evidently does this \nadministration--the President--not trust his park employees, now he \nwants them to live under substandard conditions, which a lot of them \nare doing.\n  So what we have attempted to do--this isn't the Senator from Alaska \ndoing this. This is a process that occurred in our committee by the \nintroduction of the bill, hearings held, voting it out to the floor, \nand putting it into the package. That is the process. We had a process, \nnot like the inequities in the Utah land where there was no process.\n  Section 816--Mineral King--a California issue--extends summer cabin \nleases. I am not familiar with it--totally discretionary by the \nSecretary.\n  Opposition to this provision I think is simply ridiculous. The Park \nService needs these funds to maintain operations.\n  This seems like a blatant attempt to tear down the national parks and \nblame the Congress, I guess.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would be happy to yield. But I want to finish my \nstatement, and then I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mineral King--I want to finish that. That is a California issue--\nextends summer cabin leases totally discretionary by the Secretary.\n  Again, I can only assume that the President does not trust his \nSecretary of the Interior or his Park Service folks to do what, \nobviously, a majority of the committee felt was the right thing.\n  This bill, of course, gives them complete control.\n  Section 818--the Calumet Ecological Park--that is Senator Simon and \nSenator Moseley-Braun--a study to extend the I and M Canal National \nHeritage Corridor to incorporate a large portion of Chicago.\n  I am not conversant on that. But it certainly sounds reasonable.\n  Section 819--they want stricken--acquisition of certain property in \nSanta Cruz.\n  There are goats evidently that are ruining the island. Provisions in \nthis bill would allow the National Park Service to address the removal \nof the goats from the island and try to restore a more pristine \ncondition. It does not authorize the shooting of the goats, I might \nadd. This portion of the island that is not under Government management \nI am told looks like certain areas of Afghanistan. The remainder of \nthis island needs to be protected.\n\n  Section 1021--the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. This is \na major issue for one Senator, Senator Campbell.\n  It formally creates a recreation area. Changes monument status to a \npark. Creates a BLM conservation area. Creates 22,000 acres of \nwilderness. Has all the four management agencies involved operating \nunder one complex. Extensive hearings; extensive support; no questions \nabout this. But it is on the list for veto.\n  National Park Foundation--I believe Senator Lieberman, and myself--\nprovides for the opportunity for the private sector to sponsor the \nNational Park Service similar to the sponsorship of the Olympic games. \nWe accepted Senator Bumpers' six amendments which clarify that the \nsanctity of our National Park Service will be maintained. Clarifies \nthat in no way the corporate entity can overcommercialize the Park \nService.\n  The national environmental community is ginning up opposition against \nthis. Well, let them come up with the $4 billion that is necessary to \nprovide adequate maintenance in our parks.\n  They are quick to criticize. But when somebody comes up with a \nsolution, obviously, they criticize but they don't counter with a \nresponse.\n  Mount Hood--Senator Hatfield--1028--exchange between private company \nand Federal Government. Provisions already in the continuing \nresolution.\n  Section 1029--creation of the Coquille Forest--Senator Hatfield--\nequal value exchange creating a tribal forest.\n  Section 1034--Natchez National Historical Park--creates an auxiliary \narea to the National Park Service unit, and provides $3 million for \nintermodal transportation system and a visitors center.\n  Is this administration opposed to creating less intrusive modes of \ntransportation to allow more people to be able to enjoy the magnificent \nnational park system, or are they just opposed to Republicans getting \nsomething for their home States? I don't know whether this is just a \npartisan shot. But it sure looks like it.\n  Section 1036--rural electric and telephone facilities--it authorizes \nthe BLM to waive right-of-way rental charges for small rural electric \nand phone cooperatives.\n  Section 1037. Federal borough recognition, payment in lieu of taxes. \nThis allows the unorganized borough in Alaska to receive PILT payments. \nThey are unorganized, few people living there; 60 percent of the \nFederal lands in Alaska are in this borough. The administration did not \noppose this during the committee action, and the language was worked \nout in cooperation with them. The administration supported this in \ncommittee. This is a slap in the face to my State, the rural Alaskans \nin my State, who lose out on economic opportunity because of the \nmassive amount of public lands in their backyards. What could possibly \nbe the reason for opposing this other than it is in a State that \nprobably will not vote for the President?\n  Alternative processing, 1038.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes under the morning \nbusiness agreement has expired.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have about 3 more minutes. I wonder \nif I may be allowed to complete this statement.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, \ncertainly, I would like to ask if we might lock in some time for a bill \nintroduction following the completion of the work by the Senator from \nAlaska. I would like to be recognized for 12 minutes; the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein, for 12 minutes; and Senator Reid of Nevada, \nfor 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is that a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes. I make that in the form of a unanimous-consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my colleague.\n  Section 1038. Alternative processing. This is an attempt to save the \nremaining jobs in my State, in southeastern Alaska in a timber area. \nWhy doesn't the President just tell us: I want the remaining jobs to go \naway. I want the communities to go away, or simply suffer.\n  That is what he is doing. What this would do would be to simply \ntransfer timber that is being used as pulp, as a designation of that \ntimber under an 8-year contract that is binding to be transferred over \nto sawmill use so that, as we lose our pulp mills, we can continue to \nhave a supply under a contractual commitment to our sawmills. We only \nhave four sawmills, three of which are running. The other one is not \nbecause they do not have enough logs.\n\n[[Page S11488]]\n\n  So we have taken our pound of flesh on this package. We have \nwithdrawn what we hoped the administration would support and that was a \n15-year contract to allow a $200 million investment to bring our pulp \nmill up to environmental standard. They would not support that.\n  Section 1039. Village land negotiations. This is another slap in the \nface of Alaska Native people. This provision just asks the Secretary to \ntalk to five tiny Alaska villages that have waited more than 20 years \nfor a conveyance that they were promised. This is a classic example of \nthe Federal Government using the old bait-and-switch routine on \nAmerica's native people and having no intention, evidently, of making \ngood on the promises.\n  Section 1040. Unrecognized communities in southeastern Alaska. That \nmerely let five communities in Alaska establish as a group or urban \nnative corporations. It involved no land transfer. It was a Alaska \nNative equal rights bill that gave these people simply an opportunity \nor the authority to proceed. No land transfer was associated with it--\nanother solution in which the Federal Government has turned its back on \nAlaska Natives.\n  Section 1041. Gross Brothers. They served their country in uniform. \nThey lost their deed. Their country is denying them the land they \nhomesteaded, land they lived on.\n  Section 1043. Credit for reconveyance. This would have allowed Cape \nFox Corp. to transfer 320 acres of land near a hydro project back to \nthe Forest Service. They would not have gotten any land in exchange. I \ndo not know why they oppose that. We are giving the land back.\n  Section 1044. Radio site report. A study to determine if radio sites \nare needed.\n  Section 1045. Retention and maintenance of dams and weirs. Forces the \nForest Service to maintain specific dams and weirs in the Immigrant \nWilderness.\n  Section 1046. Matching land conveyance, University of Alaska. This \nauthorization is for the Secretary of the Interior to discuss--discuss, \nnot mandate--a land grant with the University of Alaska, which has \nnever received its Federal entitlement, on a matching basis with the \nState.\n  Once again, this is an education President striking again against \neducation, and I just do not understand the rationale. This is the only \nstatewide university in our State. It is a land grant college. It has \nno land in the largest State.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I want to advise my colleagues also \nthat I have maintained that we have put this package in the most \nresponsible form. It is ready to go. If it does not go, if it does not \ngo in the package, it is not going to go. We will have to come back and \nstart the process all over again. We will lose Presidio. We will lose \nthe San Francisco Bay area cleanup. We will lose the issues in New \nJersey, Sterling Forest. We will lose 126 sections of hard work that \ncame out of the democratic process simply because, by executive \nmandate, this administration says they will not accept it. I find that \nunconscionable.\n\n  I am very pleased with the action of our leader in introducing this. \nI hope we can address the concerns of the minority, and I am willing to \nwork with the minority to try to do that in the time remaining.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I thank the Chair and my friend for \nallowing me to continue. I appreciate their graciousness.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor up to 12 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I did not, when I asked the Senator to yield, intend to \ndiscuss goats or horses, or erupting volcanoes for that matter. I \nexpect there will be a rejoinder at some point on the floor, but that \nwas not my intention. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan and Mrs. Feinstein pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2140 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11484-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11488-S11489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DAKOTA, MINNESOTA, AND EASTERN RAILROAD CELEBRATES 10TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, this month marks the 10th anniversary of \nthe Dakota, Minnesota, and Eastern [DME] Railroad. The DME is South \nDakota's only statewide railroad and operates more than 1,100 miles. I \noffer my heartfelt congratulations to the DME. I particularly commend \nthe many dedicated workers and officials who have worked to make DME \nsuch a successful rail service provider. All associated with DME should \nbe proud.\n  I recall back in 1983 when I first became involved in a lengthy \nbattle to preserve critical rail service slated for abandonment. The \nChicago and NorthWestern was planning to abandon 167-miles connecting \nFt. Pierre and Rapid City. That fight ultimately lead to establishment \nof the DME.\n  At first, many were skeptical about DME's prospect for success. Those \nsame skeptics are believers today. DME's annual revenue and freight \ntonnage have doubled during the past 10 years. So has its number of \nemployees. And, more than $90 million has been invested in main line \ninfrastructure improvements during that same period.\n  I am proud to have played a role both in DME's creation and its \nsuccesses. I have enjoyed working closely with rail shippers and DME to \nadvance this critical transportation service. I remain committed to \ndoing all I can to promote adequate and effective rail service for our \nState.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article by Roger \nLarson and an editorial printed in the Huron Daily Plainsman detailing \nthe DME odyssey be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the Huron Daily Plainsman]\n\n                      Laying Tracks for the Future\n\n                           (By Roger Larsen)\n\n       Larry Pressler says 1989 marked the beginning of what he \n     now calls his ``DM odyssey.''\n       Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad officials are more \n     direct. Without the senator's intervention, they say, their \n     corporation wouldn't exist.\n       And South Dakota's roads would be taking a severe pounding.\n       ``If we weren't here, it would probably take about 50,000 \n     semis hauling on the state and U.S. highways here in South \n     Dakota, which would certainly cost the state a lot more money \n     in road and bridge maintenance,'' said Lynn Anderson, DM's \n     vice president for marketing and public affairs.\n       Looking back on their first 10 years in operation, DM \n     officials say Pressler, at substantial political risk, was \n     instrumental in the railroad's creation and survival.\n       It hasn't always been a smooth ride.\n       The short-line railroad was born out of necessity--and a \n     sense of urgency--when the Chicago & North Western Railroad \n     announced in 1983 that it wanted to abandon 167 miles of \n     track between Pierre and Rapid City.\n       Pressler received an emergency phone call. Could he send a \n     representative to a meeting of shippers and others in Philip?\n       He went himself.\n       ``I worked with local shippers in organizing an abandonment \n     protest,'' he said. ``That triggered a formal ICC (Interstate \n     Commerce Commission) investigation.''\n       As C pushed forward with its abandonment plans, an ICC \n     field hearing was conducted in September 1983.\n       ``The ICC decision in November denied the abandonment \n     request,'' Pressler said.\n       The ruling by the administrative law judge surprised more \n     than a few people who had become resigned to the situation.\n       But the judge based his decision on ``the serious impact of \n     the loss of rail service on rural and community development \n     or the lack of any viable rail or motor carrier alternatives \n     to that service.''\n       ``At that time, I was the only public official in the state \n     who believed the 167-mile stretch could be saved,'' Pressler \n     said.\n       Anderson doesn't believe the senator is overstating his \n     involvement.\n       ``Well, I think he was the key individual that worked to \n     keep the railroad in place between Pierre and Rapid City,'' \n     he said. ``Without the things he did and the support he \n     gathered, I think there's a good likelihood the line would \n     have been abandoned.''\n       The judge's decision, Pressler said, ``allowed us more time \n     to work with C to find a long-range solution to the \n     Pierre-to-Rapid-City line problem. It was the only route west \n     for years.''\n       Still, C remained adamant. It appealed the ruling to the \n     full ICC. In February 1984, it was upheld on a tie vote.\n       By August, the railroad again announced it would continue \n     its efforts to abandon the track.\n       ``C made it clear that there was no interest in \n     compromise,'' Pressler said. ``They wanted to get rid of it. \n     Early attempts to come up with a long-term solution seemed to \n     fall on deaf ears.''\n       Eyebrows were raised in January 1985 when C extended its \n     abandonment plans all\n\n[[Page S11489]]\n\n     the way to Wolsey, pushing the total to 273 miles. The \n     Aberdeen to Oakes line in northeastern South Dakota was also \n     being considered for abandonment.\n       C declined invitations to negotiate. The future of the \n     rail lines looked bleak.\n       A breakthrough came when Pressler intervened in a proposed \n     sale of Conrail to the Norfolk Southern Railroad, a merger \n     that C claimed would cost it $60 million a year in traffic \n     diversions.\n       In return, C approached the negotiating table with a \n     commitment to find a potential buyer of its South Dakota \n     track.\n       And in dramatic fashion, those along the track provided a \n     huge show of support.\n       ``C joined me in a day-long working train trip in May \n     1985.'' Pressler said. ``We rode in a rail car between Rapid \n     City and Pierre. Twelve hundred people turned out along the \n     way to express their support for continued service. That \n     really helped turn things around with C officials.''\n       For the first time, the shortline or regional railroad \n     concept was introduced.\n       And that trip across South Dakota's prairie seemed to have \n     a calming effect on the players.\n       ``It coalesced everyone,'' Pressler said. ``It was the \n     first time all sides sat down and discussed the issue with \n     the uniform goal to make the line work. Everyone agreed it \n     would take some give and take.''\n       At a rail conference in September 1985, C outlined a \n     divestiture proposal which led to the birth of the DM \n     Railroad.\n       A year later, the new railroad's locomotives were pulling \n     cars full of grain, lumber, wood chips, bentonite clay and \n     cement.\n       This summer, 100 miles of deteriorated track between \n     Wessington and Pierre has been upgraded with new, 115-pound \n     rail. This $20 million project is being financed by a bond \n     issue the railroad will repay over 20 years with no state \n     dollars.\n       The project is two months ahead of schedule. Crews are in \n     the stretch run, laying new track between Blunt and Pierre.\n       In May, DM added 203 miles to its system when it \n     purchased the ``Colony Line'' from the Union Pacific \n     Railroad.\n       The line connects with the DM at Rapid City and extends \n     north to Bentonite near Colony, Wyo., and south to Crawford \n     and Chadron, Neb., where it links with Burlington Northern \n     Santa Fe and Nebkota Railway.\n       ``We are looking forward to a smooth transition'' DM \n     president J.C. ``Pete'' McIntyre said when the sale was \n     announced.\n       The railroad purchased 12 more locomotives and hired 50 \n     employees, increasing the workforce to more than 300.\n       ``These are good-paying jobs and benefits,'' Pressler said.\n       Also, the railroad announced it is spending more than $32 \n     million for 625 new freight cars, including 325 covered \n     hoppers to haul cement from South Dakota Cement Plant at \n     Rapid City.\n       Others--such as grain elevators along the rail line--have \n     made major improvements as well.\n       It's obvious to Anderson that had C been successful in \n     its abandonment efforts, the line wouldn't have been rebuilt.\n       ``Business would have gone over to the Nebraska line,'' he \n     said.\n       But because it didn't--and rail traffic now travels in \n     South Dakota--it means long-term economic development for the \n     state, he said.\n       ``The C had rerouted traffic out of the Black Hills to \n     Nebraska,'' he said. ``When they failed to abandon the line \n     from Rapid City to Pierre, they decided to sell it.\n       ``After we began operations, and began upgrading the line \n     and showed the ability to handle the carload business, we \n     convinced C to reroute that traffic coming across South \n     Dakota in lieu of Nebraska.''\n       And then C decided to abandon the Nebraska line.\n       ``The reverse could have happened,'' Anderson said.\n       Ten years ago, one of the first repainted C locomotives \n     was named the ``Larry Pressler.'' Since then, locomotives \n     have carried the names of cities along DM's service area.\n       The railroad also honored him by naming a Rapid City \n     intersection ``Pressler Junction.''\n       Pressler admits he was like a kid in a candy store on a \n     particularly memorable trip back home.\n       ``They let me drive a locomotive a little bit once,'' he \n     said.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                   DM Keeps S.D. on the Right Track\n\n       In the middle of the night, a train whistle carries a \n     mournful, lonely sound on the prairie air.\n       As homesteaders pushed westward in the 19th century, the \n     advent of trains signaled hope and opportunity in the \n     uncertain vastness of Dakota Territory.\n       Today, they continue to represent a kind of comforting \n     stability.\n       They have become as familiar to the landscape as rolling \n     grasslands and an endless horizon. But trains in much of west \n     and central South Dakota were nearly derailed by a corporate \n     stroke of the pen a decade ago.\n       Chicago & North Western Railroad wanted to abandon its \n     deteriorating track between Rapid City and Wolsey. It talked \n     about walking away from its line between Aberdeen and Oakes, \n     N.D., as well.\n       In historic fashion, shippers circled their wagons and \n     waited for reinforcements. And, as their forefathers had done \n     with other territorial disputes, they pushed for a reasonable \n     solution.\n       Into the mix came Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., who \n     rightfully used his political standing in Washington to force \n     field hearings.\n       In the end, it came down to a little give-and-take. C's \n     back was scratched when a railroad merger elsewhere in the \n     country--which could have hurt its bottom line--was opposed \n     by Pressler. In return, the boys in the C boardroom agreed \n     to find a buyer for the track it wanted to abandon in South \n     Dakota.\n       Thus, the birth of Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad.\n       DM has been a good corporate neighbor in its first 10 \n     years. It has proven it can handle the needs of shippers, \n     farmers and other customers up and down its 900-mile line.\n       And it's doing something else that's certainly long \n     overdue.\n       It's putting its money--and longterm viability--where its \n     mouth is.\n       With the current track upgrade between Wolsey and Pierre \n     nearly complete, DM has invested some $90 million in \n     infrastructure. Millions more dollars have been committed to \n     purchase hundreds of new rail cars.\n       Trains have had a romantic, endearing quality in this part \n     of the country for well over a century.\n       For those who truly care about the future, their whistles \n     will continue to beckon with faith and anticipation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11488-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ECONOMIC NEEDS OF PUERTO RICO\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, since 1973, my first year in the Senate, \nI have spent a great deal of time and energy on issues affecting Puerto \nRico. I rise today to voice my concern for our fellow citizens in \nPuerto Rico, who have been greatly affected by our recent action to \neliminate economic development incentives under section 936 of the \nInternal Revenue Code without providing them with an alternative \nprogram. I understand the need to curb excessive corporate tax benefits \nin order to get our Nation's fiscal house in order. However, in \naccomplishing this, we must not ignore the needs of the people of \nPuerto Rico. The 3.7 million American citizens of Puerto Rico deserve \nthe opportunity to become economically solvent and self-sufficient. We \nmust work hand in hand with them to develop a sound economic \ndevelopment program that helps achieve those goals. Modifications, \nimprovements or alternatives such as a wage credit have been suggested \nfor Puerto Rico. All of these options deserve serious consideration, \nbut above all we must not allow the economy of Puerto Rico to be \ndevastated by inaction or the wrong action by Congress. Although I \nshall not be returning for the 105th Congress, I urge my colleagues to \ngive prompt attention to this issue early next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11489-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11489-S11490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMERICA, WHO STOLE THE DREAM?\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, lost in the rhetorical haze generated by \npollster politics is a serious discussion of the principle challenge \nfacing this Nation, that is, how can we arrest the decline in wages and \nliving standards and restore the American Dream. Instead of addressing \nthis fundamental issue, what currently passes for political discourse \nis a mindless discussion in which each candidate stands up and proudly \nproclaims that he or she is for the family and he or she is against \ncrime. What neither party wants to address is the immutable connection \nbetween two decades of economic stagnation and dislocation, and the \nbreakdown of families and the destruction of communities.\n  In the past decade over 2 million high paying jobs in manufacturing \nhave disappeared. The social fabric of hundreds of communities have \nbeen ripped apart. Those who have jobs are working longer and harder \nfor less compensation. Isn't it more than a coincidence that the \nbreakdown in the family and the collapse of our inner cities would \ncoincide with an unprecedented era of economic insecurity? Once the \nland of opportunity, America now has the worst distribution of income \nin the industrialized world.\n  Fortunately, the Philadelphia Inquirer has filled this void. In a \npenetrating 10 part series, the Pulitzer Prize winning team of Donald \nBarlett and James Steele have put a human face on the devastation \nwrought by our failed trade policy. From our unwillingness to enforce \nour trade laws to the sorrid spectacle of former U.S. officials lining \nup to represent foreign interests, Bartlett and Steele correctly \nidentify the root causes of our economic decline.\n\n[[Page S11490]]\n\n  The strength of Barlett and Steele's piece is epitomized by the \nvicious attacks that have been leveled at this prize-winning team. \nBarlett and Steele have drawn fire from the same crowd who have for \ndecades produced the same mindless, conventional wisdom that equates \nunilateral free trade with economic growth. These are the same people, \nwhose wild assertions about NAFTA and GATT, were utterly false.\n  During the NAFTA debate the purveyors of conventional wisdom anointed \nCarlos Salinas as the man of the decade, valiantly reforming the \npolitical system and transforming Mexico into a first world economy. \nNAFTA was supposed to usher in a golden era for U.S. exports to Mexico \ncreating thousands of new high wage jobs. Two years later we have \nrecorded $23.2 billion worth of trade deficits with Mexico. The Mexican \neconomy collapsed into a depression and the man of the year, Carlos \nSalinas, is living in forced exile while the extent of his \nadministration's corruption is documented in the pages of the New York \nTimes and the Wall Street Journal. NAFTA was supposed to create a North \nAmerican Free Trade Block to compete against Europe and Asia. Instead, \nAsian investment has poured into Mexico. A recent article in the Nikkei \nWeekly, specifically cites Mexico's low wages and NAFTA's duty-free \naccess as the reason why Asian investors are flocking to Mexico.\n  Mr. President, the same group that attacks Barlett and Steeles' \nobjectivity, never once, during the debate on the GATT, questioned \nblatantly false assertions made about the efficacy of section 301, or \nthe GATT Rounds' impact on the U.S. economy.\n\n  While we were assured that the United States maintained its rights to \nuse section 301, Japan's Minister of Trade and Industry boldly \nproclaimed that, ``the era of bilateralism is over, all disputes will \nbe settled by the WTO.''\n  In the year since the GATT/WTO has taken effect, our trade deficit \nhas continued to soar at a record pace. Trade has become a net drag on \nthe economy, robbing the United States of close to 1 percent of growth \nas imports consistently out-pace exports. Most pernicious were the \nclaims made by the members of the Alliance for GATT Now. Claims of \nexport booms that would lead to increases in employment. The reality is \nthat 250 companies are responsible for 85 percent of U.S. exports. \nThese same companies have been among the largest downsizers in the \nAmerican economy. Pink slips rained down on workers at AT, IBM, and \nGeneral Electric. According to an executive vice president at General \nElectric, ``We did a lot of violence to the expectations of the \nAmerican worker.''\n  How can those who have consistently been wrong about trade now turn \naround and question Barlett and Steele?\n  Mr. President, this provocative series in the Philadelphia Inquirer \nhas undermined many of the dubious assertions about trade. Assertions \nthat for decades have been unquestionably accepted.\n  I urge my colleagues to read this series, and I hope it will \nstimulate a much needed debate on the most serious issue facing this \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11489-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11490-S11491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Senator Sam J. Ervin, Jr., the \ndistinguished former Senator from North Carolina, often said that the \nUnited States had never lost a war nor won a treaty. Well, during the \nsummer, the Clinton administration quietly set the wheels in motion in \nGeneva for yet another disastrous treaty for the United States.\n  During July meetings, Tim Wirth, Undersecretary of State for Global \nAffairs, committed the United States to the negotiation of a binding \nlegal instrument with the stated goal of reducing global greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  Many experts agree that the premise for this new treaty, which \nexcludes developing countries from enforcing the commitments to reduce \nemissions, makes its goal simply unachievable. Developing nations such \nas China will be the largest source of new greenhouse gas emissions in \nthe post 2000 period, yet will be exempt from any new restrictions.\n  The United States currently is party to the U.N. Convention on Global \nClimate Change, signed at Rio in 1992 and ratified by the Senate in \n1993. Under that treaty the member countries are divided into \nindustrialized countries, termed ``Annex I countries,'' and developing \ncountries, termed ``non-Annex I countries,'' for purposes of \ndetermining treaty commitments. The treaty tasks Annex I Parties to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.\n  In March of 1995, the parties to the U.N. Convention laid the \nframework for the current negotiations when they met in Berlin, \nGermany, and agreed to the so-called Berlin mandate. The Berlin mandate \nstates that the parties to the Convention would address this global \nproblem post 2000 without binding any of the non-Annex I parties to new \ncommitments. By agreeing to this disastrous concession--after making \nassurances to Congress that they would not do so, I might add--the \nmeans for addressing the issue as a global problem were removed from \nthe table.\n  Mr. President, as things often happen, the flawed Berlin mandate \nbecame the building block for the latest round of concessions made by \nTim Wirth in Geneva. There, parties approved a Ministerial Declaration \nwhich--in ``U.N. speak''--directs Annex I parties to ``instruct their \nrepresentatives to accelerate negotiations on the text of a legally-\nbinding protocol of another legal instrument.'' The Declaration directs \nthat the commitments of Annex I parties will include ``quantified \nlegally-binding objectives for emission limitations and significant \noverall reductions within specified timeframes, such as 2005, 2010, \n2020.''\n  In plain English this means that any new treaty commitments regarding \ngreenhouse gas emissions will set forth legally binding emission levels \nthat must be met by industrialized countries only. The U.S. position \nturns basic principles of sound economic policy on its head since it \ndirects industrialized countries to subsidize developing countries by \npolluting less while incurring higher costs so that developing \ncountries can pollute more without incurring costs.\n  Some of our allies recognize the serious flaws in the current \nnegotiations. According to the findings of an Australian Government \nstudy entitled ``Global Climate Change: Economic Dimensions of a \nCooperative International Policy Response Beyond 2000,'' the treaty \nwill not even achieve the desired environmental effect. The study finds \nthat stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions of developed countries only \nat 1990 levels during the period from the years 2000 to 2020 ``would \nlead to minimal reductions in global emissions and would have higher \ncosts for most countries than alternative abatement strategies.'' \nAccording to the Australian study, despite the additional costs, there \nwill be no substantial reduction in the growth of global emissions \nbecause of the continued growth in the rest of world emissions.\n  Mr. President, even the elements that would provide some leveling of \nthe playing field are nonexistent in the Ministerial Declaration that \nwas approved by the parties in Geneva. For example, the document makes \nno reference to Joint Implementation [JI], a practice by which a \ncountry's emissions abatement costs can be spread across national \nborders. Under JI, a nation with relatively high marginal abatement \ncosts can offset costs through involvement with projects in countries \nwith relatively low emissions reduction costs. If countries were truly \nserious about decreasing the level of global emissions this plan would \nprovide a global solution to the problem and bring economic benefits to \nthe lower cost country in the form of foreign investment. These are \nclearly not the goals of the parties advancing this doomed policy.\n\n  According to a study by the General Accounting Office that I \nrequested, during the period from 1993 to 1995, Federal agencies of the \nUnited States have spent almost $700 million on global climate change \nrelated spending. This is more than 70 percent of the total spending by \nthe United States to advance major international environmental \ntreaties. Despite the heavy resources being pumped into this Convention \nby the Clinton administration, Congress has yet to be provided a full \neconomic analysis of the costs of the proposed protocol to the original \ntreaty. Nor has the administration been forthcoming in its own \nproposals for\n\n[[Page S11491]]\n\nthe new Protocol. Instead, a shell game is being played out in which \nthe substance of the new protocol will be laid on the table in \nDecember, after U.S. elections.\n  During hearings last week in the Senate Energy Committee, the able \nSenator from Alaska, Frank Murkowski, raised serious questions about \nthe administration's support of the current negotiations underway at \nthe United Nations, particularly the possibility of a carbon tax. I can \nassure you that for so long as I am chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee any international legal instrument agreed to by this \nadministration must not and should not put the U.S. economy at a \ncompetitive disadvantage to other countries. Most importantly, the \ntreaty should actually achieve the purpose for which it is negotiated. \nAny treaty that comes before the Senate for ratification must ensure \nthat U.S. businesses will remain competitive and U.S. jobs will be \nprotected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11490-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HONORING THE PETERS ON THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

Mr. President, I would like to comment briefly on the \nasylum-related provisions of H.R. 2202, the Illegal Immigration Reform \nand Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. The agreements we reached \nwith the House in the conference report involved a number of \ncompromises on provisions involving the asylum system. I worked very \nhard in conference to modify the House provisions, and I think we \narrived at workable compromises that will be fair in practice.\n  The conference report's provisions on summary exclusion, also \nreferred to as expedited exclusion, significantly revise the summary \nexclusion provisions of the Terrorism Act, which apply to those \nexcludable based on document fraud or the absence of documents. The \nprovisions of the Terrorism Act would not have provided adequate \nprotection to asylum claimants, who may arrive in the United States \nwith no documents or with false documents that were needed to exit a \ncountry of persecution.\n  Under the revised provisions, aliens coming into the United States \nwithout proper documentation who claim asylum would undergo a screening \nprocess to determine if they have a credible fear of persecution. If \nthey do, they will be referred to the usual asylum process. While I \nsupported the Leahy-DeWine amendment that was included in the Senate \nbill and that passed the Senate 51 to 49, the conference report \nrepresents a compromise.\n  The conference report provisions apply to incoming aliens and to \nthose who entered without inspection, so-called EWI's but have not been \npresent in this country for 2 years. Although the Senate provisions \napplied only in extraordinary migration situations, House Members felt \nvery strongly about applying these procedures across the board. I think \nthat, with adequate safeguards, the screening procedures can be applied \nmore broadly. If any problems with these provisions arise in their \nimplementation, however, and they do not seem to offer adequate \nprotections, I am willing to consider changes to them.\n  The credible fear standard applied at the screening stage would be \nwhether, taking into account the alien's credibility, there is a \nsignificant possibility that the alien would be eligible for asylum. \nThe Senate bill had provided for a determination of whether the asylum \nclaim was ``manifestly unfounded,'' while the House bill applied a \n``significant possibility'' standard coupled with an inquiry into \nwhether there was a substantial likelihood that the alien's statements \nwere true. The conference report struck a compromise by rejecting the \nhigher standard of credibility included in the House bill. The standard \nadopted in the conference report is intended to be a low screening \nstandard for admission into the usual full asylum process.\n  Under the conference report, screening would be done by fully-trained \nasylum officers supervised by officers who have not only had comparable \ntraining but have also had substantial experience adjudicating asylum \napplications. This should prevent the potential that was in the \nterrorism bill provisions for erroneous decisions by lower level \nimmigration officials at points of entry. I feel very strongly that the \nappropriate, fully trained asylum officers conduct the screening in the \nsummary exclusion process.\n  Under the new procedures, there would be a review of adverse \ndecisions within 7 days by a telephonic, video or in-person hearing \nbefore an immigration judge. I believe the immigration judges will \nprovide independent review that will serve as an important though \nexpedited check on the initial decisions of asylum officers.\n  Finally, under the conference report, there would be judicial review \nof the process of implementation, which would cover the \nconstitutionality and statutory compliance of regulations and written \npolicy directives and procedures. It was very important to me that \nthere be judicial review of the implementation of these provisions. \nAlthough review should be expedited, the INS and the Department of \nJustice should not be insulated from review.\n  With respect to the summary exclusion provisions, let me remind my \ncolleagues that I supported the Leahy-DeWine amendment on the Senate \nfloor, which passed by a vote of 51 to 49. The compromise included in \nthe conference report is exactly that: a compromise. I support the \ncompromise because I believe it will provide adequate protections to \nlegitimate asylum claimants who arrive in the United States. If it does \nnot, let me say that I will remain committed to revisiting this issue \nto ensure that we continue to provide adequate protection to those \nfleeing persecution.\n  I would also like to comment briefly on one of the more significant \nchanges to the full asylum process that are contained in the conference \nreport. The Conference Report includes a 1-year time limit, from the \ntime of entering the United States, on filing applications for asylum. \nThere are exceptions for changed circumstances that materially effect \nan applicant's eligibility for asylum, and for extraordinary \ncircumstances that relate to the delay in filing the application.\n  Although I supported the Senate provisions, which had established a \n1-year time limit only on defensive claims of asylum and with a good-\ncause exception, I believe that the way in which the time limit was \nrewritten in the conference report--with the two exceptions specified--\nwill provide adequate protections to those with legitimate claims of \nasylum.\n  In fact, most of the circumstances covered by the Senate's good-cause \nexception will be covered either by the changed circumstances exception \nor the extraordinary circumstances exception. The first exception is \nintended to deal with circumstances that changed after the applicant \nentered the United States and that are relevant to the applicant's \neligibility for asylum. For example, the changed circumstances \nprovision will deal with situations like those in which an alien's home \ngovernment may have stepped up its persecution of people of the \napplicant's religious faith or political beliefs, where the applicant \nmay have become aware through reports from home or the news media just \nhow dangerous it would be for the alien to return home, and that sort \nof situation.\n  As for the second exception, that relates to bona fide reasons \nexcusing the alien's failure to meet the 1-year deadline. Extraordinary \ncircumstances excusing the delay could include, for instance, physical \nor mental disability,\n\n[[Page S11492]]\n\nefforts to seek asylum that were thwarted due to technical defects or \nerrors for which the alien was not responsible, or other extenuating \ncircumstances.\n  Once again, if the time limit and its exceptions do not provide \nadequate protection to those with legitimate claims of asylum, I will \nremain committed to revisiting this issue in a later Congress.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, in this morning's Washington Post \nnewspaper--and newspapers all over the United States have headlines \nthat are comparable to the headline in the Washington Post--``Ring Used \nReligion as Cover To Sneak Drugs Into Lorton.''\n  Lorton is a Federal penitentiary in this area. This was on the front \npage of the Washington Post.\n  Mr. President, I wish I were not here today to say, ``I told you \nso,'' but I am here today saying, ``I told you so.'' When the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act came up for a vote, I offered an amendment to \nexclude religion in prisons from the confines of that act. It was a \nvery close vote in this body. It was defeated. People said, ``Don't \nworry about it. It won't cause any problems.''\n  From the day the Religious Freedom Restoration Act passed, it caused \nproblems in prison. This article says a number of interesting things. \nAmong which:\n\n       A drug ring posing as a church group smuggled cocaine and \n     prostitutes into the Lorton Correctional Complex and filmed a \n     pornographic video in the prison chapel, with a law \n     protecting religious freedom to avoid scrutiny by guards. . .\n       Posing as members of the Moorish Science Temple--\n\n  Mr. President, I have nothing to say bad about this religion. It \ncould have been any religion. They happen to be using this religion as \na front for their criminal and basically immoral activities.\n\n       Posing as members of the Moorish Science Temple, a religion \n     popular in jails, the group exploited what officials called a \n     gaping loophole in Lorton's security.\n       Because of a 1993 federal law protecting religious freedom \n     of prisoners, members were allowed to have private visits \n     with inmates at virtually any hour and were subjected to only \n     minimal searches, officials said. The members also routinely \n     intimidated guards by threatening to sue them, they said.\n       ``We had correctional officers who were afraid to do their \n     jobs,'' said D.C. Corrections Director Margaret A. Moore . . \n     ..\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       ``This case is not an indictment of the Moorish Science \n     Temple''. . .. ``It is an indictment of individuals who \n     exploited a religious exemption to smuggle drugs.''\n\n  I was very happy that one of the leaders of this religion said, and \nis quoted in the paper, a man by the name of Harvin-Bey:\n\n       ``We don't condone anything like that, and if they are \n     members [of the Moorish Science Temple], then justice should \n     take its course''. . . . ``It's sad that anyone would misuse \n     any religious organization. That's not what our teachings \n     promote.''\n\n  Skipping on:\n\n       Federal prosecutors and prison officials said they had \n     suspected for several years that illegal activities were \n     occurring during some religious services. Outsiders seeking \n     to attend religious services in the complex only had to fill \n     out a card, and prison officials did not verify whether they \n     were church members. . . .\n       In addition . . . such visitors received numerous \n     exemptions from standard security procedures at the \n     District's 6,000-inmate prison complex [located] in southern \n     Fairfax County.\n\n  Mr. President, the sad part about it, this was not uncovered by some \ngreat work done by the prison itself. There was an inmate who \nparticipated in taking pictures of people having sex during the \nreligious service, and he passed these on to the authorities. That is \nthe only way. They had somebody who thought, for what was going on \nthere, that that was a little much.\n  They would never have uncovered this. They would have continued to \nlet these activities--cocaine.\n\n       Posing as a drug seller in the maximum-security unit, the \n     inmate received drugs brought in by mostly female visitors, \n     many in dresses of the type often worn by Islamic women.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       . . . Bell and Cook [these two individuals] allegedly \n     brought in three women to a scheduled religious service in a \n     conference room that was being used as a makeshift chapel. \n     Prison officials earlier had intercepted a phone call between \n     Bell and an inmate making plans to bring in the women. . ..\n       For about 10 minutes, an inmate using a smuggled video \n     camera recorded sex acts between the women and the inmates. . \n     . .\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Moore said prisons nationally are experiencing problems--\n\n  Moore is the prison official talking.\n\n       Moore said prisons nationally are experiencing problems \n     with the 1993 Religious Freedom and Restoration Act, saying \n     it limits the ability of prison officials to restrict \n     religious activities among inmates.\n\n  I repeat, I did not want to come here and say, ``I told you so,'' but \nI have to. I come here and say, I warned everyone. I warned the U.S. \nSenate that this would happen. This is a problem of inmates abusing the \nspecial protections provided under the Religious Freedom Restoration \nAct. The special protection should not be there. Prisons should be \nexempted.\n  During the consideration of this bill, I repeat, I offered an \namendment to exempt prisoners from coverage of the act. It failed. I \nfeared then, and I fear even more now, these special protections will \nbe abused, would be abused, have been abused, and will continue to be \nabused by these inmates. I say regrettably that my amendment was \ndefeated because it is now apparent that inmates are in fact abusing \nthe special rights provided under this act.\n  I have worked with Senator Hatch, chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and I appreciate his efforts, his good will, in working to \nsolve some of the problems that I see existing. He worked with me very \nhard earlier in this Congress to pass the Prisoner Litigation Reform \nAct. That is the one, you will recall, Mr. President, where prisoners \nwere suing over whether they had to eat chunky or smooth peanut butter, \nor they were suing over how many times they could get their underwear \nchanged or whether they were entitled to wear lady's underwear in a \nmen's prison, some of these very weighty, substantive issues that they \nwere wasting the court's time on. In Nevada, 40 percent of the Federal \ncourts' time is wasted on this senseless litigation. So I appreciate \nSenator Hatch working with me on that legislation.\n  But I say that Senator Hatch told me that if there is a problem with \nthis prison litigation, prison abuse with the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act, he would work with me. We need some work done on this. \nWe need to stop this foolishness. Why we would allow anything like this \nto take place--people whose civil rights have been taken from them \nbasically who have committed so many crimes that they are in prison--\nand we are saying that they have the right to do anything they want \nregarding religion.\n  That is indicated in this newspaper article. We are not going to \ncheck who comes into the religious services. We are not going to check \nto see what they bring in. We are not going to check to see who they \nbring in or check to see what they do when they are having these so-\ncalled services. Mr. President, I think today's article in the \nWashington Post and the one that is appearing all over the country \nindicates why we need to do more.\n\n  I repeat again, to spread all over this Record, I appreciate very \nmuch what the chairman of the full committee has done to work with me \non some of these problems I have. This is an important issue that we \nneed to review as soon as we get back next year. I will pursue this \nproblem. This is a problem the attorney generals all over the United \nStates recognize as a problem--frivolous litigation--and now we have \nthese problems that are raised by the Religious Restoration Freedom \nAct. We need to do more. I intend to do what I can with the U.S. \nAttorney General so that she appreciates the growing litigation they \nface in this area.\n\n[[Page S11493]]\n\n  She has not been strong on this issue in the past, and I think that \nis not appropriate. I think she should be the leader in this issue to \nmake the prisons prisons and not places to allow stuff like this to \ntake place. Criminals do not enjoy the same rights and privileges as do \nlaw-abiding citizens. But, according to what we see in the papers \ntoday, they have more privileges, not less. The sooner we recognize \nthat criminals do not enjoy the same rights and privileges as law-\nabiding citizens, the better off we will be.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the Washington Post article printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n         Ring Used Religion as Cover To Sneak Drugs Into Lorton\n\n                          (By Charles W. Hall)\n\n       A drug ring posing as a church group smuggled cocaine and \n     prostitutes into the Lorton Correctional Complex and filmed a \n     pornographic video in the prison chapel, using a law \n     protecting religious freedom to avoid scrutiny by guards, \n     officials said yesterday as they announced more than 30 \n     arrests.\n       Posing as members of the Moorish Science Temple, a religion \n     populated in jails and prisons, the group exploited what \n     officials called a gaping loophole in Lorton's security.\n       Because of a 1993 federal law protecting religious freedom \n     of prisoners, members were allowed to have private visits \n     with inmates at virtually any hour and were subjected to only \n     minimal searches, officials said. The members also routinely \n     intimidated guards by threatening to sue them, they said.\n       ``We had correctional officers who were afraid to do their \n     jobs,'' said D.C. Corrections Director Margaret A. Moore, who \n     announced several measures to tighten control of prison \n     visits at a news conference in Alexandria.\n       U.S. Attorney Helen F. Fahey said she hoped the arrests \n     will warn visitors not to smuggle drugs into Lorton. She \n     emphasized that the crackdown was not intended as an attack \n     on any religious group.\n       ``This case is not an indictment of the Moorish Science \n     Temple,'' Fahey said. ``It is an indictment of individuals \n     who exploited a religious exemption to smuggle drugs.''\n       A. Harvin-Bey, grand sheik of Moorish Science Temple No. 74 \n     in the District, condemned those involved in the alleged \n     crimes at Lorton.\n       ``We don't condone anything like that, and if they are \n     members [of the Moorish Science Temple], then justice should \n     take its course,'' Harvin-Bey said. ``It's sad that anyone \n     would misuse any religious organization. That's not what our \n     teachings promote.''\n       Harvin-Bey said the religion has attracted millions of \n     worshipers across the country. There are about 10 temples in \n     the Washington area, he said. The religion, which is open to \n     all races, focuses on the ancestry of American slaves, saying \n     they descended from Moabites who formed the Morrish empire.\n       A grand jury issued 38 secret indictments Tuesday. About 6 \n     a.m. yesterday, federal agents and local police officers \n     began arresting suspects. By 6 p.m., seven remained at large, \n     said William Megary, acting special agent in charge of the \n     FBI's Washington field office.\n       Officials said 21 suspects were from the District, eight \n     from Maryland, two from Virginia and seven had unknown \n     addresses.\n       All of the defendants were charged with cocaine \n     distribution offenses, and two--Nathaniel Pleasant Bell and \n     Karima Cook, both of Baltimore--also were charged with \n     transporting women across state lines for prostitution.\n       Federal prosecutors and prison officials said they had \n     suspected for several years that illegal activities were \n     occurring during some religious services. Outsiders seeking \n     to attend religious services in the complex had only to fill \n     out a card, and prison officials did not verify whether they \n     were church members, Moore said.\n       In addition, according to papers filed yesterday in U.S. \n     District Court in Alexandria, such visitors received numerous \n     exemptions from standard security procedures at the \n     District's 6,000 inmate prison complex in southern Fairfax \n     County.\n       In January, officials said, a cooperative inmate gave \n     investigators vital access to the drug ring.\n       Posing as a drug seller in the maximum-security unit, the \n     inmate received drugs brought in by mostly female visitors, \n     many in dresses of the type often worn by Islamic women. \n     The drugs were supplied by an undercover officer posing as \n     a drug seller outside the complex.\n       Because all of the cocaine ultimately was routed to the \n     cooperating inmate, none actually reached the general inmate \n     population, prosecutors said.\n       On Jan. 23, Bell and Cook allegedly brought in three women \n     to a scheduled religious service in a conference room that \n     was being used as a makeshift chapel. Prison officials \n     earlier had intercepted a phone call between Bell and an \n     inmate making plans to bring in the women, authorities said.\n       For about 10 minutes, an inmate using a smuggled video \n     camera recorded sex acts between the women and the inmates, \n     according to Timothy J. Shea, an assistant U.S. attorney who \n     helped supervise the investigation. The informant later was \n     able to obtain a copy of the video inside Lorton.\n       Moore said the prison temporarily will issue no new passes \n     to visitors who say they represent religious groups and will \n     subject all current volunteers to criminal background checks. \n     In addition, she said, guards will be ordered to constantly \n     monitor services through observation windows and periodically \n     walk through rooms where services are taking place.\n       Moore said prisons nationally are experiencing problems \n     with the 1993 Religious Freedom and Restoration Act, saying \n     it limits the ability of prison officials to restrict \n     religious activities among inmates.\n       Todd Craig, a U.S. Bureau of Prisons spokesman, said \n     representatives of religions who visit federal prisons \n     already go through criminal background checks and receive \n     extensive training on rules.\n       Jonathan Smith, executive director of the D.C. Prisoners \n     Legal Services Project, said that he would closely review any \n     restrictions on religious worship but that he probably would \n     not oppose reasonable security measures.\n       ``Religious activities in prisons are one of the most \n     valuable tools available for an inmate's rehabilitation,'' \n     Smith said. ``If they want to search visitors, I probably \n     would not have a problem. If they say there will be no more \n     religious visitors, we would very likely challenge that in \n     court.''\n\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate and the American people will greatly regret \nthe absence of Senator Exon from this Chamber upon his retirement at \nthe end of Congress. I cannot think of anyone in this body who reflects \nthe concerns of America's heartland and the commonsense approach to \nproblems so prevalent in that part of the country better than the \nsenior Senator from Nebraska. I am very pleased to have been able to \ncall him a friend now for a long, long time.\n  I have always felt a special bond with Senator Exon because he, too, \nwas born and raised in South Dakota. His parents were active in the \nSouth Dakota Democratic Party. I do not know if that accounts for his \noutstanding career in the Senate, but I know it did not hurt.\n  Senator Exon has given a lifetime of public service. He served in the \nArmy in World War II and afterward became a successful businessman and \nproud father of three. In the 1970's, he was elected twice as Governor \nof Nebraska, serving longer than any other person in the State's \nhistory. He was elected three times to the U.S. Senate, and through his \nhard work and dedication, he has earned the affection and the trust of \nthe people of Nebraska who know him best.\n  Reflecting his rural upbringing, Jim Exon, without a doubt, is one of \nthe most knowledgeable Members of this body on agricultural issues. As \na Governor and certainly as a Senator, he has always had his hand on \nthe pulse of rural America. I have turned to him on numerous occasions \nfor advice and counsel, and will not hesitate to pick up the phone in \nthe future on these same issues.\n  Jim Exon is also well-known for his command of budgetary issues. By \nthe time he came to the Senate, Senator Exon had already established a \nproven record of fiscal responsibility. As Governor of Nebraska, he \nbalanced that State's books time and again. Therefore, when he assumed \nhis Senate duties and a seat on the Budget Committee, he did not enter \nthe Nation's budget battles unprepared or unarmed.\n  After observing him closely in my time in the Senate, I can \nconfidently say that Senator Exon stands second to none in his \nknowledge of the Federal budget and its impact on working Americans \neverywhere. As Senate Democratic leader, I have repeatedly drawn on his \nexperience and wisdom for guidance in the many fiscal battles that have \ncome to define this Congress.\n  As ranking member of the Budget Committee, Senator Exon has been my\n\n[[Page S11494]]\n\nmost valuable ally and adviser as we developed a plan to balance the \nbudget without compromising the priorities we stand for. He has never \nwavered in his commitment to balance the budget fairly.\n  Most of all, Senator Jim Exon will be remembered as having served the \npeople of Nebraska and all Americans with dignity, diligence, and \nintegrity. As a soldier, Governor, as a Senator and as a friend, he has \nexemplified all these virtues and many more.\n\n  His love for the Senate is exceeded only by his love for his family \nand the beautiful State of Nebraska, and I might add the not-so-\nsuccessful team in the last weeks, the Nebraska Cornhuskers. I know \nthat troubled him, and he has lost a great deal of sleep over that \nduring the last week, and I am sure his fortunes will turn.\n  Both he and I have had the good fortune now to serve in this \nwonderful body for some time. I can say in all sincerity I will miss \nhim a great deal. I wish Senator Jim Exon, his wife, Pat, and their \nfamily the very best in the years ahead.\n  Mr. President, at times like this you wish you could find other ways \nwith which to express gratitude and friendship and the best of health \nto those who are retiring. Oftentimes, we wait too long to come to the \nfloor to make these expressions of great affection and admiration for \nthe public servants who come here every day. I could talk at some \nlength about Senator Exon, as I now will about Senator Sam Nunn. They \nare men from whom I have learned a great deal, men of remarkable \ndecency, men respected on both sides of the aisle, men with a sense of \nhumor and a sense of devotion to country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11493-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FAREWELL TO SENATOR NUNN\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The day Sam Nunn cast his 10,000th vote, I mentioned \nthat his first vote, on January 23, 1973, was to confirm a nominee to \nbe Assistant Secretary of Defense. Since then, Senator Sam Nunn has \nbecome the Senate's leading authority on defense policies. He has \nserved as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee from 1987 to \n1994. He has introduced or cosponsored the most important legislation \nand the most important military and defense issues of the last two \ndecades, including Defense reorganization, reducing the threat of \nnuclear war, Pentagon procurement reform, base closing, and \nrestructuring of military pay and benefits.\n  He has earned the respect of virtually every colleague with whom he \nhas served--Republican, Democrat, conservative and liberal, Presidents, \nVice Presidents, Members of the House. He has earned, also, the thanks \nof every American throughout this country for his efforts to ensure the \nintegrity and mission of our military establishment in the face of many \nof history's most significant challenges. Every administration since \nthe 1970's has consulted him on military matters and considered him for \ntop-level positions in their administrations.\n  Senator Nunn's career has neither been confined to nor consumed by \nmilitary and defense issues, however. In the Senate, he has played \nmonumental roles in laying the groundwork for national service, deficit \nreduction, and on efforts to redirect our national economic and tax \npolicies. He has applied his talents and energy to a multitude of \nissues whenever they were required. I must say that America is better \nfor it.\n\n  Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague, my advisor, my friend, \nSenator Sam Nunn, on his remarkable career, and I thank him for his \nservice to this institution and to this country. Unfortunately, it is \nalso time to say goodbye and wish him well in his future endeavors. We \nwill miss him in the Senate, but I must say that we expect him to be \nvery visible, very active, very involved, very engaged, both in public \npolicy and in matters relating to private enterprise, for many, many \nyears and decades ahead.\n  I hope that, should he have the opportunity to serve in other \ncapacities in government, he will take them--not for his benefit, but \nfor ours.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as everyone knows, we have, over the \nlast year, year and a half, made some adjustments in the ethics rules \nfor the Senate. The Select Committee on Ethics is principally in \nbusiness to do investigative and disciplinary work, but its work in the \narea of Member and public education is also a major part of what the \ncommittee does, and that is less familiar to most Americans.\n  The committee's advice and counsel, typically provided to Members, \nstaff and the public affected by the Senate code of conduct, in fact, \nconstitutes a substantial amount of the work that the committee does in \ngiving advice to people who are seeking not to run afoul of the rules \nof the Senate. On a regular basis, the committee answers questions and \nprovides guidance on a wide array of subjects, from financial \ndisclosure to the application of gift and travel rules, to conflicts of \ninterest. Much of the advice takes the form of just responses to \ntelephone calls, which are typically received by the committee staff. \nBut, frequently, the committee responds in writing to a specific \nquestion raised by a Senator or, for that matter, somebody out in the \npublic who is trying to get advice about how to structure an event. All \ninquiries, frankly, are welcome and are treated as confidential, in \naccordance with the committee's rules.\n  On occasion, a specific question raised with the committee is \ndetermined to have general relevance to the entire Senate. Over the \nyears, the committee has published the answers to such questions as \ninterpretative rulings. Between 1977 and 1992, the committee issued \nmore than 440 interpretative rulings, all of which are publicly \navailable.\n  The committee has also, from time to time, communicated with all \nSenators in the form of ``Dear Colleague'' letters on a particular \npoint of the Code of Conduct. The committee did that earlier this year \nregarding the application of the new gifts rule. The committee has \ncompiled various other documents explaining rules governing proper and \nappropriate Senate conduct.\n  The committee staff also conducts regular briefings for staff and \norientation sessions when we have new Members coming in at the \nbeginning of each Congress.\n  The sum and substance of this means that information and education \nare an important part of the work of the Ethics Committee. In order to \nfacilitate and improve the committee's educational role, we have, \ntoday, published the first-ever Senate Ethics Manual. I regret that it \nis as thick as it is, but the Senate, over the last 10, 15 years has \nbeen increasingly made more complex in the rules by which we must live \nour lives, so we have had the staff work, over the last year, trying to \ndevelop a manual which, candidly, Mr. President, is not going to answer \nevery question, but may help in providing a sort of quick, ready \nreference for Members of the Senate in trying to determine how to \nhandle a matter that might raise some ethical question. Again, I \napologize for the thickness of it, but I think it illustrates how many \nnew rules we have adopted for ourselves and how much interpretation is \nneeded in order to discover what to do under the new rules. So this \nwill be made available to every Member of the Senate. I suggest that, \nfor whoever in the office becomes sort of the office expert on matters \nof this sort, this be on their desk and, hopefully, that person will be \nable to be of some assistance to the Senator in the coming years in \nanswering questions.\n  The manual is comprehensive. It covers gifts, conflicts of interest, \noutside income, office account, financial disclosure, political \nactivity, the frank, Senate facilities, constituent service, and \nemployment practices. It explains the rules and incorporates the \ninterpretations that we have developed over the years. In addition, it \ncontains many illustrations of situations that have occurred, or could \noccur, and sets forth the standard for appropriate conduct.\n\n[[Page S11495]]\n\n  I am confident that every Senator will incorporate this manual in his \nor her important office documents. As I have suggested earlier, it will \nprobably end up occupying a significant spot in the office of every \nSenator. I think it is not likely to eliminate the need to call the \nEthics Committee for advice, although it may make those phone calls \nless frequent.\n  The committee staff worked long and hard on this manual, and they \ndeserve the appreciation of the Senate and the American people. In \nparticular, Victor Baird, Linda Chapman, Elizabeth Ryan, Adam Bramwell, \nMarie Mullis, and Annette Gillis toiled long hours over the last \nseveral months to bring this project to fruition. They have turned out, \nin my view, a very fine product.\n  As I indicated earlier, one copy of this manual will be made \navailable to each Senator. In fact, this afternoon, one copy will be \ndelivered to each office. I am not going to ask that it be printed in \nthe Congressional Record, as it is quite thick, but I ask unanimous \nconsent that the manual be printed as a Senate document.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Then there will be sufficient copies available to \ncommittees and subcommittees as well as the general public.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that this ethics manual will be useful to \nMembers of the Senate and to others who will need to become at least \ngenerally familiar with the rules of the Senate.\n  Again, I thank the staff of the Ethics Committee for an outstanding \npiece of work. It was really quite a difficult project. I thank them on \nbehalf of all Members of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11494-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I was shocked and saddened today to learn \nof the President's threat to eliminate or veto the parks bill that \nincluded a number of projects.\n  I was particularly disheartened over the decision to kill four \nColorado environmental projects--surprised because, on a number of \nthese, the administration has specifically reviewed them and signed off \non them; that is, we had taken the trouble and the time to walk them \nthrough, to seek their advice, to incorporate their suggestions, and to \nwork with them for something that could meet the President's \nguidelines.\n  Thus, after doing that--and having secured, at least in many of those \nprojects, the administration's input and approval--we are now faced \nwith a political hit list with regard to Colorado projects. I think it \nis particularly surprising when you look at where that hit list \nfocuses. It focuses primarily in States where the President has had a \ndifficult time in winning good reelect numbers--Alaska, Colorado, and \nVirginia are the heaviest hit on that hit list.\n  Mr. President, the projects in Colorado are bipartisan projects. They \nare ones that are of enormous benefit to the environment and the State. \nI hope that the President will reconsider.\n  This is raw politics to punish those who will not go along with the \nPresident's bid for reelection. And it is vindictive politics. It is \nbeneath the Office of the President to engage in this kind of \nvindictive hit list based not on a rational review of the issues or \nreasonable discussions of the problems, but simply sending a cold power \nplay to punish those States where the President's ratings are not high \nenough.\n  I called the White House this morning because I was concerned about \nthese projects and about one project in particular which, I think, \nparticularly saddens me, and asked why these projects were being \neliminated. They were not able to give me an answer. The woman who was \nkind enough to chat with me did speculate with regard to one of them, \nand speculated that maybe they were concerned about it being a heritage \narea. And, of course, the major one involved the Cache La Poudre River \nbill which is not a heritage area. We specifically changed that aspect \nbecause Members of the House and others had concerns about heritage \nareas.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk for a moment about a project that we \nworked for more than 20 years on which is included in that Cache La \nPoudre area bill. The Cache La Poudre River is a river that was named \nby the French, obviously, in the pioneer days. It is a river that has \nprovided the flow of communications, water, transportation, and a \nlifeline throughout eastern Colorado. It starts in the high mountains \nin northern Colorado, in those high mountain regions, and it flows down \ntoward the plains. It is now Colorado's only wild and scenic river. I \noffered that as a Member the House of Representatives.\n  Peter Dominick did a study perhaps three decades ago on wild and \nscenic rivers in the State. And it was a great pleasure for me to see \nthe passage of that wild and scenic designation. While Peter Dominick \nhas long passed away, his sons came to that signing ceremony. It was, I \nthink, a token of something very important because it is an effort to \npreserve part of our national heritage.\n  The La Poudre bill the President now wants to veto is one that takes \nthat area of the river as it passes through Fort Collins and extends \nout on the plains. The suggestion is very simple. Let us see if there \nis some way to set aside the floodplain of the river as it passes \nthrough the city of Fort Collins and Greeley and by the city of Windsor \non its way. It is an area of rapid growth. It is in the middle of a \ngreat urban area stretching from Denver, or perhaps even Colorado \nSprings, all the way up to Cheyenne, WY.\n\n  What a wonderful thing to have set aside open space of a floodplain \narea for riding and bike paths and hiking paths and recreation \nfacilities in the heart and the middle of a great metropolitan area.\n  Mr. President, as you well know, many in our part of the world are \nnot so sure they want the heritage broke, and it is controversial. But \nthe saddest thing of all would be to see it grow and for us not to \nprepare for it, plan for it, and set aside the open space that will \nkeep some of the quality of life that has attracted so many to that \npart of the world.\n  That is really what this bill is all about. It does it without a cost \nto the U.S. Treasury.\n  It does it by saying if there is surplus land in the State that is \nfederally owned, this bill allows the exchange of surplus land in other \nparts of Colorado for part of the flood plain of the Cache La Poudre. \nIt will not have a net impact on the Treasury, but what it will do is \ngradually see land that is held by the Federal Government in areas \nwhere it is not needed exchanged for land in the flood plain of the \nCache La Poudre River. It promises, I believe, over a lengthy period of \ntime to give us a substantial amount of open space that will be \npreserved throughout the Republic to the lasting benefit of the \ncommunity.\n  Frankly, I think it is a question that needs to be addressed in the \nWestern United States itself. The West is blessed with a large amount \nof public\n\n[[Page S11496]]\n\nland held by the Federal Government, but I do not think anyone, liberal \nor conservative, Democrat or Republican, would question the fact that \nsometimes that land is not held in the location where most would prefer \nit. Most of our land ends up being where settlers did not homestead it \nor where miners did not stake a claim. However, it is not the only \nbasis that you ought to use for land allocation and ownership.\n  What this bill does is give us a chance to shift the ownership of the \npublic land away from areas where it is not needed to areas where it \nclearly will be needed.\n  I cannot help but think that this measure has enormous environmental \npluses in it, and I find myself dumbfounded that the President would \nchoose to veto it. My hope is that the administration will be willing \nto sit down with us, let us know their concerns, and work things out if \nthat is the case. But, also, I must say I am not willing to roll over \non this. I am not willing to ignore good legislation. My suggestion is \nthat if the President wants to work with Congress, he has to be willing \nto step forward and enunciate his concerns. Right now we are in a \ncircumstance where the President has put these projects on a hit list \nwithout even being willing to name or articulate what his concerns are.\n  My belief is and always has been that good legislation is a product \nof thoughtful review and good communication between those involved not \nonly at the legislative level but those outside of this body. I hope \nthe President will reconsider his actions. Once before a President of \nthe United States came up with a hit list for the Western United \nStates. President Carter took vengeance out on the Western United \nStates with his hit list. My hope is that President Clinton will not \nrepeat that mistake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Chair for recognizing me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11495-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11496-S11497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I take the floor to make a couple of \ncomments about my extreme disappointment over the obvious fact that now \nthis Congress will not be able to take up an agreement that has been \nworked on and negotiated for over 7 years that has now been completed \nbut that will not be considered by our Congress through the \nratification process.\n  The agreement that I speak to is the so-called OECD agreement, which \nis the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which has \nbrought together the shipbuilding countries of the world, and after 7 \nyears and two administrations negotiating this agreement and having the \nother nations of the world that build ships sign on the dotted line \nsaying that this agreement is right for this time, unfortunately, this \nCongress, and this Senate in particular, will not be in a position to \neven bring it up for ratification.\n  The bottom line is that this agreement, which has been negotiated for \nso long, has as its major purpose the ending of shipbuilding subsidies \nby the other countries of the world.\n  In my time in the Congress, I have heard from people who work in \nshipyards, people who own shipyards, people who have shipyards in their \ndistricts and in their States, that if we could only end the other \ncountries' subsidies to their yards, government subsidies, we in the \nUnited States could not only compete with these other foreign shipyards \nbut we could do much better than they are doing.\n  This agreement, I say to my colleagues and to all, does exactly that. \nAfter 7 years of negotiation under the leadership of the Clinton \nadministration and Bush administration, both of which have said this is \na priority, and this agreement has now been completed and signed, we at \nthis last hour refuse to take it up because there are some in our \ncountry who have said it is not perfect so, if it is not perfect, we \nwill not participate. The losers of this battle are the people who \nasked us to enter into these negotiations in the first place, the \nshipbuilding industry. It is unfortunate that now there is such a \ndivision among the industry that we in the Congress are not able to do \nsomething which helps everybody in a major way.\n  I am committed to continue our efforts in the next Congress. I am \nfearful, however, that other countries will see the U.S. lack of \nratification of this international agreement to mean that they will \nthen be able to engage in their own subsidy wars once again, and that \nwill be most unfortunate because, if there is anything which is clear, \nit is that this country cannot participate and cannot win an \ninternational subsidy battle with other countries willing to heavily \nsubsidize their shipbuilding industries as a matter of national policy.\n  We have no subsidies directly provided by our Government to our \nshipbuilding industry. That program, the construction subsidy \ndifferential program, was ended in the administration of President \nRonald Reagan. He said we are not going to do that any more. Congress \nagreed, and there is no longer any shipbuilding subsidies in place for \nour yards in this country, but all the other countries that are major \nshipbuilders still have subsidy programs.\n  This international agreement got them all to sit down at the table \nafter 7 years and say, all right, if everybody agrees they are not \ngoing to do it, we are not going to do it either.\n\n  That agreement is a win-win for the United States. Failure to ratify \nand approve that treaty is a lose-lose for the United States industry \nand the thousands and thousands of men and women who work in those \nindustries, because if we do not enact this agreement and other \ncountries continue to subsidize their yards, we will continue to lose \nbusiness. We will continue to build only militarily useful vessels in \nthis country and commercial shipbuilding will continue to go overseas \nto yards that are consistently subsidized by their governments, because \nin many of these countries shipbuilding is their biggest industry. It \nis not in our country, and therefore we do not subsidize it. This \nagreement would have put other countries on a level playing field with \nus.\n  I am struck by the fact that at the last minute, when some of our \nindustry people came in and said, well, we do not like this agreement \nbecause of this, that and the other, my staff, USTR people, many \nMembers of the Senate and in the House sat down and said, all right, we \nwill try to get what we can to fix it to address your concerns. Those \nwho opposed the treaty said, well, they needed explicit clarification \nthat the United States would not under any circumstances change our \nJones Act, and we did that and clarified that in the treaty, that that \nwould be exactly the way they asked for it.\n  They said that they need explicit clarification that our national \nsecurity interests would be protected by this treaty, and that the \ndefense features and military reserve vessels would be outside of the \nagreement. And we put that into this treaty to be ratified.\n  They said they needed 30 additional months of the current title 11 \nfinancing program for our shipbuilders to cover projects that were \nclose to having their applications in. And we did that.\n  They said they needed clarification that the limited restructuring \nsubsidies for some countries, which were allowed under the agreement to \nfour countries in order to reduce their shipbuilding capacity, would be \nactionable if they, in fact, increased their capacity instead of \nreduced their capacity. And we did that.\n  It is unfortunate that, in the end, some would agree only on a \nperfect agreement. If anyone has been here longer than 2 weeks, he or \nshe knows there are no such things as perfect bills, perfect \nlegislation, or perfect treaties--or perfect anything. We are humans \nwho try to do the best we can. Perfection is not something that we, \noftentimes, are able to achieve.\n  So, while this agreement may not have been perfect, we answered in \neach instance the opposition of those who continue to oppose this \ntreaty. They, in my opinion, will be the ones who will ultimately \nsuffer the most by their stopping this Congress from bringing forth \nthis agreement for ratification.\n  I know there are a lot of people who worked very hard. I commend \nCongressman Sam Gibbons, from the other body, who really tried to bring \nhis people together on this issue. Senator Bill\n\n[[Page S11497]]\n\nRoth, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, \nworked very hard with his staff to say, yes, let us meet to try to \nbring this together. Our Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, tried to urge \npeople to sit and negotiate. And also, particularly, Senator Trent \nLott, the majority leader, who hosted meetings with the differing \nparties to try to bring people closer together, to say, yes, we should \nget this agreement in a posture to which everyone could agree.\n  I will conclude, Mr. President. We have been ravaged, ravaged by the \nsubsidy practices of other countries in the shipbuilding industries. \nThis agreement that two different administrations hammered out and \nnegotiated over a 7-year period was an effort to end those subsidy \npractices of those other countries so the United States, which does not \nhave a direct subsidy program, would be able to compete with our \ncompetitors from around the world on a level playing field.\n  Unfortunately, in the absence of this agreement being ratified by \nthis body, we as a country have a signature on a piece of paper which \nis meaningless because we in the Senate could not bring the parties \ntogether to see the benefits of this agreement. It is a most \nunfortunate set of circumstances. It is unfortunate because there will \nbe thousands of men and women who work in these yards every day who \nwill be disadvantaged and who will be less competitive, not because \nthey have less skills or are less productive, but because they are \nunable to compete with other governments.\n  Our workers and our industry and our engineers and our technicians \ncan compete with any other engineer or any other technician or any \nother worker anywhere in the world. But our workers cannot compete with \nother governments who are not concerned about making a profit. We \ncannot compete under those terms with another government that so highly \nsubsidizes those industries in those nations.\n\n  It is clear, at a time when we are talking about reducing Medicaid \nbenefits, reducing welfare benefits, reducing benefits in Medicare, \nthat we are certainly not going to start subsidizing our shipbuilding \nindustries in the opposite direction.\n  So I am extremely disappointed, but, as always, I try to always be \noptimistic. There will be those in the next Congress who will realize \nthis was a tragic mistake. I say to the other countries around the \nworld that they, too, should look upon this effort, not as a final \nfailure on the part of the United States, but rather only a pause in \nthe legislative process, and, in the next Congress, hopefully we will \nget back on track and get our industries together to allow this \nCongress, and particularly this body, to approve what I think is a good \ntreaty.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11496-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11497-S11503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE U.S. ECONOMY--ON THE RIGHT TRACK\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, yesterday we received more good news on \nthe performance of the U.S. economy. Yesterday, the Census Bureau \nreported outstanding news with respect to increases in personal income \nand reductions in the levels of poverty in our country. I believe a \nsignificant part of the reason for the excellent economic performance \nis the Clinton economic plan that was passed in 1993. I believe that \nplan has contributed by reducing the deficit, reducing the deficit 4 \nyears in a row. That took pressure off interest rates, and that fueled \nan economic resurgence in this country.\n  I think when we evaluate the performance of the last three Presidents \non the question of deficit reduction, the record is remarkably clear.\n  Back in 1981, President Reagan came into office and inherited a \ndeficit of $79 billion. The deficit promptly skyrocketed under the \ntheory of supply-side economics--the notion that we could dramatically \ncut taxes while increasing defense spending and somehow it would all \nadd up.\n  Unfortunately, it did not add up. In fact, the deficit exploded. The \ndeficit went up to over $200 billion a year and stayed at that level \nthrough much of the Reagan administration, although there was some \nimprovement in the final years of that administration.\n  Then we saw President Bush come into office. He inherited a deficit \nof about $153 billion, and then the deficit truly went out of control. \nEach and every year the deficit rose, until in the final year of the \nBush administration, we had a budget deficit of $290 billion. That was \nthe budget deficit.\n  Perhaps it would be helpful to explain the difference between \ndeficits and debt, because I often find that people are confused by the \ntwo. Deficits are the annual difference between what we raise in \nrevenue and what we spend. It is the annual difference. Debt, of \ncourse, is the accumulation of all of the deficits.\n  Under President Clinton, unlike President Bush where the deficit went \nup every year, in the Clinton years, the deficit has declined each and \nevery year. In fact, we went from a unified deficit of $290 billion----\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. It is true, is it not, I say to the Senator from North \nDakota, that 4 years in a row of declining deficits, the last time that \nhappened was in the 1840's--that is 1840's--prior to the Civil War; is \nthat true?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct. The first time that we have seen the \ndeficit decline 4 years in a row under one President was back in the \n1840's.\n  Mr. REID. I also ask the Senator from North Dakota, in looking at the \nchart as I came into the Chamber, it appears to me that the deficit is \nonly one-third of what it was at the height of the Reagan deficits.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If you measure the deficit against the size of our \nnational income, which is probably the best measure of the deficit, \nthat is true. In fact, the deficit measured against the size of the \neconomy is the lowest it has been since 1974. In fact, we now have the \nlowest deficit of any of the major industrialized countries in the \nworld. Again, I think that is the central reason we have seen this \neconomic resurgence.\n  Mr. REID. Can I ask one final question? And that is, I think the \nSenator from North Dakota would agree that even though the last 4 years \nhave been remarkable in driving down the annual deficit, I think we \nwould all acknowledge we are working toward a zero deficit; is that \ntrue?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think that is the goal that many of us share. I hope \nthat would be what we could accomplish, to have a balanced budget in \nthis country. It is critically important that we do that, because we \nface the demographic time bomb of the baby-boom generation. In very \nshort order, the retirement of the baby boomers is going to double the \nnumber of people eligible for our major programs, from 24 billion to 48 \nbillion. That is why we have to keep the pressure on to keep the \ndeficit down.\n\n  I will conclude the point with respect to the Clinton \nadministration's performance. In 1992 President Clinton promised he \nwould cut the deficit in half. He has done much better than that. In \nfact, the deficit is down about 60 percent during the Clinton years.\n  Interestingly enough, the Federal Reserve Chairman, not known as a \nstrong supporter of the Clinton administration--in fact, originally \nappointed by a Republican President--said that the deficit reduction in \nPresident Clinton's 1993 economic plan was ``an unquestioned factor in \ncontributing to the improvement in economic activity that occurred \nthereafter.''\n  This is the Chairman of the Federal Reserve in February of this year \nindicating that the Clinton plan was the central reason we have seen \nthat dramatic improvement in the deficit during the Clinton years.\n  Not only do we see an outstanding story with respect to deficit \nreduction, this chart shows what has happened to real business fixed \ninvestment in billions of 1992 dollars. This chart goes back to 1985. \nYou can see, ever since Bill Clinton has been in office, we have seen a \ndramatic improvement in business fixed investment. In fact, this is the \nbest record for increases in business investment for any President \nsince World War II.\n\n[[Page S11498]]\n\n  The good news doesn't stop there, because we also see the misery \nindex at its lowest level since 1968. The misery index is a combined \nmeasure of the unemployment rate and the level of inflation. The misery \nindex is now at the lowest level it has been in 28 years.\n  Again, the good news doesn't stop there. We remember when President \nClinton was seeking the office of President. He said that he would have \nas a goal the creation of 8 million jobs in the first 4 years of his \nadministration. He has exceeded that. He has delivered on his promise. \nWe have more than 10 million new jobs. In fact, we have now reached \n10.5 million new jobs.\n  And unemployment is down, down sharply, under President Clinton. In \nDecember of 1992, the level of unemployment in this country was 7.3 \npercent. This chart shows in June of 1996, it was down to 5.3 percent. \nIt has gotten even better since then. The level of unemployment was \ndown to 5.1 percent in August 1996.\n  We have also experienced strong economic growth under President \nClinton. In fact, this chart compares private-sector growth under \nPresident Clinton as compared to President Bush. Under President Bush, \nthe private sector grew at a rate of 1.3 percent during his 4 years. \nUnder President Clinton, this chart shows 3.1 percent. With the latest \nupdate, private-sector growth in this country is up to 3.2 percent \nduring the Clinton years. In fact, this is the highest rate of growth \nof any of the last three Presidents--private sector economic growth, \nthe best of any of the last three Presidents.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. You have talked about the private growth in our economy. \nWill the Senator agree that we have a smaller Federal work force now \nthan we had during the years of President John F. Kennedy? Federal jobs \nhave been cut back significantly; is that not true?\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is true. The Federal work force is at its smallest \nlevel since the 1960's, during the administration of President Kennedy. \nI might also point out, and I think this is interesting, that Federal \nspending--this President is accused of being a big spender--Federal \nspending measured against our national income has gone down each and \nevery year of the Clinton administration. Interesting.\n  During the Bush administration, Federal spending went up. Under \nPresident Clinton, Federal spending has declined each and every year as \nmeasured against our national income.\n  I might just conclude that yesterday we got more good news. We got \nthe Census Bureau report showing that incomes are going up; poverty is \ncoming down. Median household income showed its largest increase in a \ndecade. We had the largest decline in income inequality in 27 years. We \nsaw the biggest drop in poverty in 27 years; 1.6 million fewer people \nin poverty. We saw the poverty rate for the elderly drop to its lowest \nrate ever, lowest rate ever for elderly poverty, and the biggest drop \nin child poverty in 20 years.\n  It seems to me that part of any Presidential campaign ought to be the \nrecord. The record, with respect to the economy, of this administration \nis crystal clear: The deficit is down, unemployment is down, poverty is \ndown, incomes are up, jobs are up, business investment is up. That is \nan outstanding record. I hope people will have a chance to learn this \nrecord between now and the election. I think if they do, this President \nwill be reelected with a resounding vote. I am happy to yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me yield myself such time as I may consume of the \nhour that has been set aside.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator from North Dakota, prior to the senior \nSenator from North Dakota leaving the floor, allow me to just ask a \ncouple questions of the senior Senator from North Dakota?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the senior Senator from North Dakota, \nthat you have made an interesting and I think a compelling case how \nthings have improved during the past 4 years, from lower Federal \nemployment, to higher private-sector employment, millions of new jobs, \n10 million new jobs created, the lowest poverty levels in 27 years. You \nhave gone through that, and I think made, as I indicated, a compelling \ncase.\n  But I would like to ask the Senator a question. Do you realize in the \nState of Nevada--this is not on the overall economy of this country--\nbut in the State of Nevada, which is a State sparsely populated but \ngrowing, the most rapidly growing State in the Union, do you realize \nthat the unemployment rate in Nevada has declined from almost 7.5 \npercent when President Clinton took office now to about 5 percent? Were \nyou aware of that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I was not aware of that. But I was aware of national \nfigures that showed the unemployment rate declining from 7.3 percent \nnationally to 5.1 percent today, the lowest level of unemployment we \nhave had in this country in 7 years. I think that is another indicator \nthat the Clinton economic plan, which passed in this Chamber by a \nsingle vote, is a plan that is clearly working.\n  Mr. REID. I would also ask the Senator--in fact, you have made an \ninteresting and, again, a very dynamic case for what has happened with \nprivate-sector growth during these last 4 years nationally. But let me \nask you if you know that in Nevada, there are 2\\1/2\\ times as many new \nprivate-sector jobs per year than during the previous 4 years? That is \na tremendous increase.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is a remarkable accomplishment. I think any \nobjective observer who looks at the economic indicators can only \nconclude that this economic plan has been remarkable in its success. In \nfact, last year, for the first time in many years, the United States \nwas judged to be the most competitive economy in the world. That \ndesignation has been given to the United States again this year. It is \nthe first time in a very long time we saw the United States replace \nJapan as the most competitive nation in the world. So again, I think \nthe evidence is clear and powerful and compelling that this President's \neconomic plan is working and working well.\n  Mr. REID. I will just ask one last question before the floor is taken \nby the junior Senator from North Dakota. In Nevada, we have had new \nbusiness incorporations increase by 14 percent--that is big for any \nState--but 14 percent during the 4-year period of time. This is in the \nState of Nevada, not nationally, but the State of Nevada.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Again, it follows the trend we are seeing nationally. \nPresident Clinton has the best record in terms of an increase in \nbusiness investment, the rate of increase, of any President since World \nWar II. You see the stock market at an all-time high. Virtually every \nindicator shows clearly that this economic plan has been a tremendous \nsuccess.\n  I might just say that when we passed that plan, we took a lot of heat \nfor it. I remember our friends across the aisle said that this plan \nwould crater the economy. They said that if we passed this plan, it \nwould increase unemployment, it would reduce economic growth, it would \nincrease the deficit. They were wrong. They were wrong on every single \ncount. The fact is, those of us who voted for that plan, it was \ncontroversial and we took a lot of political heat for passing it, that \nplan has proved itself and proved itself remarkably well.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on the last point, the Senator talks about \nwhat the reaction was to the plan in 1993 that required some amount of \nfortitude to vote for because it was not popular. The political thing \nwould have been to vote ``no.'' And half this Chamber did. It passed by \none vote. Speaker Gingrich said at the time, ``This will lead to a \nrecession,'' August 6. ``Pass this, it will lead to a recession.'' What \nhas happened? Well, the deficit is down, unemployment is down, \ninflation is down, jobs are up, economic growth is up.\n  I will just discuss a bit some of the things that you have talked \nabout. I thought I would just tell a story, if I might, that happened \nto a friend of mine the other day that describes context. You always \nhave to put things in context, because what happens in politics is, \nsomeone comes to the floor of the Senate--and it has been done a lot \nlately--and they will take one little piece that you are able to find, \nand\n\n[[Page S11499]]\n\nthey will hold it up to the light and say, ``Look at this. Isn't this \nugly? Isn't this awful? Look at this awful bad news.'' That is the way \nthis system works.\n  Of course, bad news travels faster than good news. The old saying: \n``Bad news travels halfway around the world before good news gets its \nshoes on.'' So people do this. Let me talk about context.\n  A friend of mine has a precocious 3-year-old. She went to the video \nstore, because they were going to be home for the weekend and they \nthought they would get a couple movies. They went to the video store \nand bought a little cartoon for the 3-year-old to watch and then a \ncouple of movies for her and her husband to watch for the weekend.\n  She told me this story. After they went to the video store and got \nthese three movies, they stopped at the grocery store, and this \nprecocious 3-year-old of hers, as they are walking past the checkout \ncounter in the grocery store, the little boy said, ``Well, Mommy got us \nsome movies for the weekend.'' The cashier said, ``Really?'' He said, \n``Yes. She got a cartoon movie for me and two adult movies for them.'' \nWhat happened is the little boy was explaining on the way to the \ngrocery store, ``Gee, I get to watch three movies,'' and the mother \nsaid, ``No. We bought one for you, and the other ones are for myself \nand your father.'' ``Why can't I watch them?'' ``They are for adults.'' \nThen he tells the cashier, ``Mommy got two adult movies.'' Well, he was \ntechnically accurate, but contextually, in the context of this \ndiscussion she told me, she was trying to look for a cash register to \ncrawl under.\n  That is what happens with respect to all of this discussion. It loses \ncontext when you take just a part of it and hold it up.\n  The Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from Nevada talked \nabout where we are and where we are heading. The question is, it seems \nto me, not so much in isolation but in the context of the broader \neconomic question, are we headed in the right direction or are we \nheaded in the wrong direction? Are we moving forward or are we moving \nbackward?\n  Let us just not listen to Senator Conrad. He wears a blue suit, \nserves in the Senate, and talks, and Senator Reid wears a blue suit and \nserves in the Senate and talks, and I am talking. So people say, \n``Well, you're politicians on the floor of the Senate. All you do is \ntalk about these things.'' Let us not listen to us.\n\n  Let us listen to money magazine. Here is what they say:\n\n       The majority of Americans are better off on most pocketbook \n     issues after 3\\1/2\\ years under [President] Clinton, who's \n     presided over the kind of economic progress any Republican \n     President would be proud to post.\n\n  Barron's:\n\n       In short, Clinton's economic record is remarkable. . . . \n     Clinton also rightfully boasted that, ``our economy is the \n     healthiest that it has been in 30 years.''\n\n  Business Week:\n\n       [I]nflation is low, growth is good, and the dollar is \n     strengthening. America is in its best economic shape in 20 \n     years.\n\n  Reuters:\n\n       Clinton has run up an enviable record in the past 4 years, \n     cutting the budget deficit each year, and making good on a \n     campaign promise to cut the deficit in half.\n\n  That is not us. Money magazine, Barron's, Reuters, Business Week are \ntelling this story. It is the story that Senator Conrad just told with \ncharts--steady economic growth, deficits down, way down, and inflation \ndown, way down, 5 years in a row, unemployment down to 5.1 percent. \nThis is a remarkable economic story.\n  Are things perfect in our country? No. Are we finally heading in the \nright direction? Are we seeing higher deficits? No, we are seeing much \nlower deficits. Are we seeing unemployment grow? No, we are seeing \nunemployment diminish, more people are working. That is movement in the \nright direction.\n  This economic news in our country is news that most of us ought to \nview as remarkable news, that ought to be a source of strength to the \nAmerican people.\n  Senator Conrad just touched in the last part of his presentation on \nsome things that just came out yesterday, and we were at a meeting with \nthe President last evening, in fact, a meeting with the President \nyesterday at noon, the three of us were there, and then a gathering \nwith the President last evening again where he talked about the new \nCensus Bureau information.\n  I would like to share it with people because it is important. Typical \nhousehold income up $898 in 1995, the largest increase in a decade. \nTypical African American family's income is up $3,000 since 1992. The \nmedian income of African-American families has increased from $22,900 \nto $25,900, the largest decline in income inequality in 27 years. We \nhave had a problem with income inequality, the poor getter poorer and \nthe rich getting richer, the largest decline in that inequality in 27 \nyears. The number of people in poverty fell by 1.6 million, the largest \ndrop in 27 years. The poverty rolls are not growing, they are \nshrinking. The poverty rate fell to 13.8 percent, the biggest drop in \nover a decade. The African-American poverty rate dropped to its lowest \nlevel in history. The elderly poverty rate dropped to 10.5 percent, the \nlowest level ever. The biggest drop in children living in poverty in 20 \nyears. The largest drop in poverty rate of female-headed households in \n30 years. This is from the census data about what is happening in the \nAmerican economy.\n  The point I want to conclude with is that we put this country on \ncourse with a plan that was not popular and we paid a price for that. I \nunderstand that. It was not popular at the time. It turns out to have \nput this country on solid footing to move toward greater economic \nstrength, more jobs, more economic growth, less unemployment, less \ninflation. It was the right thing to do and America is heading in the \nright direction.\n  While there might be some who are complainers in America, we have a \ndesignated corps of complainers in our country who never want to do \nanything for the first time, have never found anything they are pleased \nabout. They might want to find small areas where they would say, ``Gee, \nthis is not right. This is not working.'' While they have complained it \nwill not work and it is not right, we have set it right and are making \nit work and are moving this country in the right direction. That is the \nstory of the economic numbers.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. There are two Senators from North Dakota on the floor and \nthey, of course, attended the meeting yesterday where the President \ncame and talked to us. There was no press, not a single press person in \nthe room, and I listened very closely as did my colleagues.\n  The thing I will never forget, I am confident I am not telling tales \nout of school, is when the President showed us this, he said, ``Last \nnight, late at the White House, I was given this, and I sat there alone \nlooking at one page and almost cried,'' because he has also, as you \nrecall, gone through literal hell, people criticizing his economic \nplan. The President of the United States, alone in the White House, \nsaid when he saw this he became so emotional he almost cried because \nthis is good news.\n\n  Would the Senator agree this is good news? This is the glass being \nhalf full, not half empty. We all recognize, as I indicated to the \nSenator from North Dakota earlier in this discussion, we can do better. \nWe can do better. But the glass is half full. It is not half empty.\n  The American people deserve to hear this good news. Would the Senator \nagree?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I absolutely agree. As I said earlier, good news does not \ntravel very far, very well, or very quickly. There is an industry that \nis interested in seizing and entertaining people on bad news. Part of \nthat industry is in American politics, because they understand that \nnegatives far more easily motivate people than do positives. I \nunderstand even though today we could have people come to the floor and \nhold up a bunch of negatives and say, ``Is this not awful,'' we do not \nhave a situation that is perfect in this country. Circumstances exist \nwhere the American people govern this country in a representative \ngovernment. We make decisions, at times, decisions that the American \npeople probably do not want us to make, but we do it in what we think \nis in the best interests of this country.\n  This President is a mortal President. I like him. I vote with him \nwhen I\n\n[[Page S11500]]\n\nthink he is right. Yesterday I voted against him. I thought he was \nwrong on something. He is not a perfect President. None of us is \nperfect. This President has attempted to be a leader. When he took \noffice in 1993 he proposed a plan that says this is a tough plan, and \nit is tough medicine, but let us, together, try and eliminate this \nFederal budget deficit. I would like you to vote for a plan that does \nit. Part of the medicine will be, yes, some increases in taxes, \nalthough most of the tax increases went to the very highest income \npeople in this country, and especially some spending cuts in areas \nwhere we were spending too much money, and it was a package that we \nvoted for, and I was pleased to vote for it. It was the right thing to \ndo. We did not get even one vote from that side of the aisle. You would \nexpect somebody to make a mistake occasionally and vote wrong. Not one \nwould vote with us. We won by one vote, one single vote in the House \nand the Senate.\n  We put in place an economic plan that was the right thing to do. The \nresult? More employment, less unemployment; more economic growth, lower \ninflation and lower deficits. That is a country that is moving in the \nright direction.\n  I am happy to yield the floor and allow the Senator from Nevada to \ntake some time at this point.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to spend a little bit of time \nreviewing the good news that we received yesterday. The good news, I \nrepeat, typical household income went up last year almost $900. In \n1995, the median household income increased 2.7 percent. This is \ntremendous. It is now up to $34,076, the largest 1-year increase since \n1986. Typical family income is up over $1,600 since the President's \neconomic plan has passed. Median family income has increased, up to \nover $40,000 a year in 1995. That is an increase of over $1,600, as I \nindicated, since his plan passed in 1993, when the Vice President of \nthe United States had to come in and cast the deciding vote because it \nwas on a 50-50 tie with Senators.\n\n  Under President Bill Clinton, the typical Afro-American family in \nAmerica's income is up over $3,000. The median income is up to almost \n$26,000. This is a $3,047 increase compared to when President Clinton \ntook office.\n  Mr. President, 27 years--we have had the largest decline in income \ninequality in 27 years. In 1995, household income inequality fell as \nevery income group from the most well off to the poorest experienced a \nreal increase in their income for the second straight year. One measure \nof inequality, something called the Gini coefficient, which is \nsomething economists use but is deemed to be the most reliable judge of \ninequality, dropped more in 1995 than any year since 1968.\n  People in poverty. Mr. President, enough people are off poverty to \nfill the States of North Dakota and the State of Wyoming and then have \npeople left over--1.6 million people are off poverty. This is \nsignificant. This is even though the population is growing. We are \nstill maintaining this drop. It is the largest 1-year decline since \n1968.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That would be the equivalent of five Wyoming's, as I \ncalculate?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 1.6 million--I think Wyoming is about \n600,000, so it is about 2\\1/2\\ to 3\\1/2\\ Wyomings.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thought Wyoming had a smaller population than that, but \nit is sufficient to say you could take a number of the States in the \nnorthern Great Plains that are not heavily populated and you can \ncompare the kind of progress we have made in a number of these areas by \nreferring to those States.\n  It is remarkable when you take a look at income data provided by the \nCensus Bureau, no one would have predicted this kind of economy would \nproduce that in this 3\\1/2\\-year period.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the reason I mention States is these \nare real human beings, real people that go to work every day, \nhopefully, if that is possible, if they have a job. But these people \nget up every morning and go to bed every night--real human beings, 1.6 \nmillion of them are off poverty. That says a lot, I think.\n  The poverty rate fell to 13.8 percent, the biggest drop in over a \ndecade. In 1995, the poverty rate dropped from 14.5 percent to 13.8 \npercent. That is the largest 1-year fall in the poverty rate since \n1984. Since President Bill Clinton's economic plan was signed into law, \nthe poverty rate declined from 15.1 percent to 13.8 percent, the \nbiggest 2-year drop in the poverty rate in 23 years.\n  The Afro-American poverty rate dropped to its lowest level in \nhistory. I repeat: The Afro-American poverty rate dropped to its lowest \nlevel in history. In 1995, the rate declined from 30.6 percent to 29.3 \npercent. That is the first time it dropped below 30 percent and is the \nlowest level since data was first collected in 1959.\n  The elderly poverty rate dropped to its lowest figure ever --ever--to \n10.5 percent. Of people over the age of 65, only 10.5 of them are in \npoverty. That is tremendous. By far, that is the best of any country in \nthe world. In 1966, 28.5 percent of American elderly lived in poverty. \nThat was before Medicare came into being. Medicare has kept a lot of \npeople off the poverty rolls. In 1995, the elderly poverty rate \ndeclined to 10.5 percent. That is a new record low for elderly \npoverty--ever--not in the last decade or two, but ever. Not only do we \nhave seniors poverty rate declining, but child poverty has dropped to \nits lowest level in 20 years, also. So seniors and children are doing \nbetter. We are doing better by them.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. You mentioned that the poverty rate for the elderly was \nat a level of 28 percent, or more than 28 percent in 1966.\n  Mr. REID. Almost 29 percent.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Almost 29 percent was the rate of poverty for the \nelderly; 29 percent of the elderly lived in poverty as recently as \n1966. What did it drop to?\n  Mr. REID. It dropped to 10.5 percent.\n  Mr. CONRAD. To 10.5 percent. You know, sometimes we say, well, the \nGovernment doesn't do anything that has much value. But here is a case \nwhere the portion of our elderly population that lived in poverty has \nbeen reduced from 29 percent of the elderly to 10.5 percent. That is a \ndramatic improvement in the lives of real people. I think that is \nsomething people can be proud of. I think Bill Clinton and his economic \nplan, which has led to an economic resurgence in this country, ought to \nget some of the credit. This President deserves some of the credit.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I heard a Senator come to the floor of the Senate a while \nago and say, ``For this President to claim credit for the good news \nabout the economy is like a rooster claiming credit for the sunshine.'' \nThere are some here who are unwilling to give this President credit for \nanything.\n  I read this, a few moments ago, in Money magazine, who understands. \nBarron's, Business Week, and Reuters give the President credit. Do you \nthink this President would not have been given the blame for an economy \nthat was faltering and failing?\n  Let me read, if I might, a comment by the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve, Alan Greenspan. He said:\n\n       The deficit reduction in President Clinton's 1993 economic \n     plan was an unquestioned factor in contributing to the \n     improvement in economic activity that occurred thereafter.\n\n  That is language from an economist. It could be clearer, I suppose. \nBut he said ``unquestioned factor.'' The President's plan is an \n``unquestioned factor'' in contributing to the improvement in economic \nactivity that occurred thereafter.\n\n  Paul Volcker, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said:\n\n       The deficit has come down, and I give the Clinton \n     administration and President Clinton himself a lot of credit \n     for that. I think we are seeing some benefits.\n\n  The Philadelphia Inquirer, in a series they did, said:\n\n       What the GOP won't admit is that the President also helped \n     the economy grow. Clintonomics showed enough fiscal \n     discipline that it helped produce the lower interest rates, \n     which, in turn, spurred economic growth.\n\n  I still hear people, who are Members of the Senate, come to the floor \nand say, ``Well, the only people who care about the Federal deficit are \nwe conservatives, we Republicans.''\n\n[[Page S11501]]\n\n  The people who care about the Federal deficit are the people who \nstood up and owned up to a vote in 1993 and said, ``I will cast an \nunpopular vote in order to reduce this Federal deficit and get interest \nrates down and put this country back on track.'' Some of our colleagues \nwho did that are not here. They lost their seats as a result of that. \nBut the fact that we did that in 1993, according to all of these \nsources--don't just listen to me, but to these sources--the fact that \nwe did that created the circumstances that allowed the American economy \nto grow and produce the kind of news we heard yesterday. Once again, \nthis President is providing leadership in the right direction, and this \ncountry is moving ahead and in the right direction, rather than \nlanguishing or moving backward. That is the point I wanted to make \ntoday.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator read that quote from Barron's and from \nMoney magazine again?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Money magazine article was in August, last month. It \nsays the following----\n  Mr. REID. And things have gotten even better since then.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  It says this:\n\n       The majority of Americans are better off on most pocketbook \n     issues after 3\\1/2\\ years under President Clinton, who has \n     presided over the kind of economic progress any Republican \n     President would be proud to post.\n\n  Barron's magazine said:\n\n       In short, Clinton's economic record is remarkable. Clinton \n     also rightfully boasted that our economy is the healthiest it \n     has been in 30 years.\n\n  Finally, Business Week--and these are not publications that would \nnormally be supportive of a Democratic President--Business Week said:\n\n       Inflation is low, growth is good, and the dollar is \n     strengthening. America is in its best economic shape in 20 \n     years.\n\n  So if one doesn't want to listen to us because they say, ``Well, \nobviously you are partisan on that,'' these publications are not \npartisan voices who evaluate this economy and say that America is \nfinally on the right track. It is growing, moving ahead, reducing \npoverty, increasing employment, reducing inflation, reducing interest \nrates. That is good for this country.\n  The point today is, again, in an era of so much bad news and in a \nsociety which entertains people with other people's dysfunctional \nbehavior and bad news, it is time to trumpet a little bit that we are \nfinally moving in the right direction--deficits down, unemployment \ndown, employment up, inflation down. It is finally important for us to \nsay that we have turned the corner, and America is moving ahead.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If the Senator will yield, I just want to comment on the \nquestion of who gets credit and who gets blame.\n  The blame game is very popular, especially just before an election. \nSome are holding this President responsible for anything that has \nhappened anywhere in the country during his time as President, even if \nit relates to things for which the President has very little influence \nor control.\n  The national economy is one place where the President does have \nsignificant influence and control. I just say to my colleague, the \nSenator from Nevada, that facts are stubborn things. President Reagan \nsaid that: ``Facts are stubborn things.'' My colleague from North \nDakota says there are others that are not partisan voices who are \nconfirming that this President's economic plan is working.\n  I would say that even those of us who are partisans can report facts \nand report them accurately. I would be prepared to debate any of my \ncolleagues at any time and any place on the question of the facts \npresented here. Every single one of these facts is verifiable by \nanybody who cares to check. These numbers indicate clearly this \nPresident's economic plan has worked. The deficit is down each and \nevery year of the Clinton administration, and down dramatically.\n  The head of the Federal Reserve says to us that it is unquestioned \nthat the President's economic plan contributed to this improvement. \nThis improvement has radiated through this economy, improving incomes. \nThe Senator from Nevada reports the biggest increase in personal income \nin a decade; the biggest reduction in poverty in 27 years.\n  All I can say to my friends across the aisle is if they had a \nPresident with this economic record they would be running a campaign of \n``It's morning in America.'' They ran that campaign when the debt and \nthe deficits were skyrocketing. Now we have a case where not only is \nthe economy improving, income is improving, investment is improving, \nunemployment is being reduced, inflation is being reduced, and the \ndeficit is declining--but this President has done it without writing \nthe hot checks adding to the deficit--adding to the debt. That was \nbeing done during the 1980s.\n  So this is even a more remarkable accomplishment--to have this \neconomy showing this resurgence and this strength even while President \nClinton is bringing the deficit down each and every year--bringing the \ndeficit down 60 percent. It took a vote that occurred here in 1993 on \nthe Clinton economic plan, and it passed by one vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to the Senator in one second. But think \nhow much better the economy would be if we were not having to pay the \ninterest on the debt that accumulated during principally the Reagan and \nBush years. I mean we would have no deficit.\n  Will the Senator acknowledge that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is absolutely right. It is very interesting. \nIf we didn't have to pay the interest on the debt that was accumulated \nduring the Reagan and Bush years, just those years, we would have a \nbalanced unified budget today. That is a fact.\n  Mr. REID. I say also the document about which we speak today is not \nsomething that was prepared by the Democratic National Committee, or \nthe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. This came from the Census \nBureau. These are facts. And as the Senator from North Dakota has \nindicated, facts don't lie. These are the facts.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a moment? If we go back 6, 7, \nor 8 years--6 years, for example--and think of where we were, deficits \nat record highs and increasing each year. There were the junk bonds, \nfailed savings and loans; the derision with almost a financial casino \nin the country with the taxpayers paying the bill from S's that go \nbelly up, junk bonds that were nonperforming, people going to prison, \nthe placing of junk bonds under circumstances that were not legal. Do \nyou remember when we were, 6 or 7 years ago, deep in debt, and getting \ndeeper?\n  The point we are making now is that this country has turned around. \nIt didn't happen just by accident. It happened because a set of Federal \npolicies were put in place that said here is what we should do: We \nshould turn the corner, and move in this direction--cut spending. This \nPresident proposed that; cut spending.\n  We have 250,000 roughly fewer Federal employees on the public payroll \ntoday than when this President took office. A quarter of a million \nFederal workers, who were working when this President took over from a \nRepublican President, are no longer working for the Federal Government. \nIt is the smallest Federal Government in decades in real numbers.\n\n  Mr. REID. Since John Kennedy.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Since John Kennedy was President.\n  I want to add one more bit of context to this. It is not my intention \nto come to the floor--nor is it the intention of Senator Conrad, or \nSenator Reid, or others who will join us--and say that we on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, or this President, President Clinton, are \ninfallible, that we have not made mistakes, that we are solely \nresponsible for everything that is good. That is not my point. It is \nnot my point.\n  But my point is when others come to the floor and continue to kick \nand flail away at every tiny little thing they can find wrong, hold it \nup, and say, ``Isn't this ugly,'' and entertain us for hours with this \ntoday because, ``Gee, this is awful.'' Let us put in context where this \ncountry is headed, and who had the courage and the plan to move it in \nthat direction. This President deserves some credit for that. I can \nname names. I will not do it. But I could just for fun go down a list \nof people here and what they said in 1993. They said this President is \ngoing to lead us into a recession; this plan will not work; this plan \nwill bankrupt America; this plan will lead to slower growth; this\n\n[[Page S11502]]\n\nplan will lead to less employment; this plan is in the wrong direction. \nIt turns out that every single one of those people were dead wrong--not \njust wrong but dead wrong.\n  This economic plan put this country on the right path so that \ndeficits came way down, interest rates came down, unemployment came \ndown, new jobs went up, and inflation came down. They were wrong. This \nplan worked.\n  I mean, I have people in my hometown who are the kind of people who \noppose everything for the first time. We all know people like that; \njust sit around and play pinochle and complain. No matter what somebody \nproposes. It is wrong; it will not work; and it can't work. This \ncountry was not built by complainers. While they were playing cards and \ncomplaining other people were out building, and doing.\n  This President came to office with a mission. He said here is a plan. \nAnd this plan he said, I think, will restore vitality to the American \neconomy, and move us in the right direction. And it was surprising that \nsome people found that the Democratic President provided leadership in \na way that cut Federal spending, cut Federal programs, reduced the \ndeficit, and put the country back on track, but he did.\n  I think the purpose of this discussion today is to put that in full \ncontext so that we can talk about something that ought to be good news \nfor everyone--Republicans and Democrats--that every American ought to \nbelieve that it is better for us, no matter who gets credit if our \ncountry is moving in the right direction, because internationally we \nnow must compete with tough, shrewd international competitors in a game \nwhere there are winners and losers, and the losers suffer the British \ndegree of slow economic decline and the winners experience new jobs, \nhope, and opportunity. That is why it is so important to have this \neconomic strength and why it is important that we are finally back on \ntrack with an economy that is stronger.\n  Mr. REID. I want to finish with two thoughts:\n  One, we had the lowest drop in elderly poverty. We talked about that; \nthe biggest drop in child poverty; and, the largest drop in the poverty \nrate of households in 30 years.\n  There are statistics that relate to the State of Nevada. Bank lending \nincreased by $10.5 billion. Home building increased by 25 percent per \nyear during the years of President Clinton. Almost 5\\1/2\\ times as much \nnew manufacturing jobs were created; 261,000 workers are protected by \nfamily and medical leave. We have new police officers, and that is \ngoing up. A lot of good things have happened.\n  What I say to my two colleagues on the floor today and the Presiding \nOfficer is to build just briefly on what the Senator from North Dakota \njust said. I think with the Presidential election winding down and 5 or \n6 weeks until it is over, I hope that, if we gain nothing else from our \nexperiences during these past 2 years, we should recognize how much \nbetter things would be if we had a Congress that was willing to work, \nwhere you had a conference and where both parties were in on the \nconference; where instead of having the majority run roughshod over the \nminority you had people working together for the good of the country.\n\n  As it has happened in years gone by in this great body and the one \ndown the Hall in the Capitol, I hope, if we learn nothing more, it is \ntime that we develop and urge a thirst for bipartisanship here because \nof what has happened in spite of the polarization that is taking place \nhere in Congress. Think about how much better it would have been had we \nworked together on these issues.\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I was going to make another point. When I \ngot up this morning I went to get the Washington Post. Right on the \nfront page is the reporting of what we are talking about here today. \nThe headline on the front page of the Washington Post is, ``Household \nIncome Climbs.''\n  The subheadline is, ``Census Bureau Also Reports Poverty Rate Drop.''\n  So if anybody is watching this and wondering if this is an accurate \nrecitation of what the Census Bureau is reporting, you can just turn to \nyour local newspaper and you will find these news reports all across \nAmerica.\n  ``Median household income rose 2.7 percent * * * after being adjusted \nfor inflation.''\n  Inflation is running about 3 percent. So incomes actually went up \nabout 6 percent last year--biggest increase in a decade. Over the same \nperiod, the Washington Post reports the poverty rate declined from 14.5 \nto 13.8 percent. The number of people in poverty fell by 1.6 million.\n  That is the statistic the Senator from Nevada was using--the largest \ndecrease in 27 years. The largest decrease in poverty in America in 27 \nyears. That is the statistic both the Senator from North Dakota and the \nSenator from Nevada were using. If we need evidence this plan is \nworking, here it is right here in this morning's newspaper.\n  Let me just conclude:\n\n       The benefits of economic growth were spread widely through \n     the economy--in nearly all occupations, all education levels \n     and all income categories.\n\n  That is the kind of economic results you would like to have, and this \neconomic plan is delivering those results. We ought to stay the course. \nWe ought to stick with this plan. Absolutely the worst thing we could \ndo is take a riverboat gamble and go back to the old days of supply-\nside economics in which somehow, as Senator Dole said last year, you \ncut taxes and you are supposed to get a big, big revenue increase. As \nSenator Dole said last summer--he said, you know, we tried that in the \neighties. That was the idea that Newt and the House Republicans had. We \nsaid everything would be all right. Well, it wasn't.\n  That was Senator Dole speaking just last summer, and only when he \nfound himself 20 points behind in the polls did he decide a different \npolicy would make sense. And if anybody is wondering whether his plan \nadds up, I just give you two numbers. We are projected to spend $11.3 \ntrillion over the next 6 years. Our income is projected to be $9.9 \ntrillion. Those two do not match up. You cannot spend $11.3 trillion \nand have income of $9.9 trillion and add up.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Is that under the Dole plan?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That means you are going to add to the debt.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask the Senator a question. Is that the projected \nincome under the Dole plan?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is the projected income under current law, that we \nwould spend $11.3 trillion, we would have income of $9.9 trillion. And \nwhat does Senator Dole say? The first thing he wants to do is cut the \nincome by $550 billion. Now you have a $2 trillion gap between spending \nand income. That is how you raise the debt. That is how you raise \ndeficits. That is how you put this economy right back in the ditch.\n  If we are going to go back to a policy of debts, deficit and decline, \nthat is the path to take.\n  I might just say Senator Dole says cut the income $550 billion. That \nwould create a $2 trillion gap between our spending and our income. You \nwould then think, well, he is going to propose $2 trillion of spending \ncuts to make up for it. Oh, no. He is not even close. He has about $700 \nbillion of specific spending cuts that he has recommended, and if you \nlook at the spending cuts what you find is he is saying we ought to cut \njust one category of Federal spending about 30 percent. And the \ncategory he has chosen is what Senator Reid from Nevada knows well--\ndomestic spending. He wants to cut it 30 percent, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Education.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Law enforcement.\n  Mr. REID. Environment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Environmental cleanup, roads, bridges, airports. He wants \nto cut those 30 percent. In fact, by the sixth year, he would cut them \n40 percent.\n\n  If anybody in this country thinks the way we should build for the \nfuture is to cut, in the sixth year of Senator Dole's plan, education \n40 percent, cut law enforcement 40 percent, cut the construction of \nroads, bridges and airports 40 percent, sign up to the Dole plan \nbecause that is precisely what he is recommending to the American \npeople. That would be a disaster for the economic future of this \ncountry. And even with those cuts he is nowhere close to adding up. \nInstead, we are going to get a huge increase in the debt. That will \nincrease interest rates. That will slow the economy. That will put our \neconomy in the ditch. That is a policy of\n\n[[Page S11503]]\n\ndebt, deficits and decline, and we ought to avoid it at all cost.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield, indicating that one of the \nthings we have not talked about here today with the Clinton plan is \nsomething that we recognized very clearly in Nevada. As a result of the \nClinton economic plan, in Nevada nine times more Nevada families \nreceived a tax cut than an increase. It happened all over the United \nStates. In addition to that, businesses got tax breaks in the Clinton \nplan of 1993. We fail to talk about it. In the little State of Nevada, \nalmost 7,000 small businesses got a tax break when we passed the \ndeficit reduction plan.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield just on that point?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I asked my staff to find out in North Dakota what \nhappened because we continually are told these are the big taxers and \nthe big spenders. I have reported what happened to spending. Every year \nunder the Clinton administration spending as a share of our national \nincome has gone down--each and every year.\n  Big spending? I do not think so. This President has reduced spending \nmeasured against our national income. And on the tax side, in my State \nof North Dakota, as a result of the 1993 plan, 29,000 people got a tax \ncut because of the expansion of the earned-income tax credit that was \nincluded in the Clinton plan; about 1,400 people got an income tax rate \nincrease. And who were they? They were couples earning over $180,000 a \nyear and individuals earning over $140,000 a year. So 20 times as many \npeople got a tax reduction as got a tax increase.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield, one of the concerns I have \nabout the proposal now for a substantial across-the-board tax cut \noffered by Senator Dole is that it is so at odds with what is required \nof leadership at this point. I said on the floor yesterday, and I will \nsay it again, I admire Senator Dole. I think the service he has given \nto this country is something most Americans should be thankful for and \ngrateful for. He has been a good public servant.\n  I said yesterday I would not trade one Senator Dole and his \nexperience for all 73 House Republican freshmen who boasted they had no \nexperience and came here and proved it quickly.\n  I admire Senator Dole, but the fact is a test of leadership in our \ncountry is are you willing to do what is necessary for this country? \nAre you willing to propose what is necessary? President Clinton came in \n1993 and made a proposal that was not popular. He knew and we knew \npeople are not going to belly up to this one and say, well, sign me up; \nplease let me have some of that--spending cuts and tax increases.\n  We knew that was not going to be politically popular. We knew it was \ngoing to be hard to do. It turned out to be extraordinarily hard to do. \nIt turned out it passed in this Chamber by a tie-breaking vote being \ncast by the Vice President. So it turned out to be enormously \ndifficult. Why? Because it was not popular. It was tough medicine. It \nwas needed to put the country back on course. That is the test of \nleadership.\n  Mr. REID. And it was very partisan.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It turned out to be very partisan, regrettably. I wish it \nwould have been a bipartisan effort to say, if we have to do some heavy \nlifting, let us all lift. But that was not the case. In any event, what \nhas happened now is that Senator Dole, who has always stood here in \nthis Chamber and said I do not agree with those who say let us have a \nbig across-the-board tax cut and the deficits, the heck with the \ndeficits, let us not care what happens as a result of it, he has always \nbeen one who stood in the well of the Senate and said these things do \nnot make any sense. This does not make any sense. Now he has been \nconvinced apparently to propose an across-the-board tax cut which will \nsubstantially reduce the revenue and substantially increase deficits. \nAnd do not trust me on that. Trust the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan \norganization or nonpartisan organization run jointly by a former \nRepublican Senator and Democratic Senator who say this is going to \nvastly inflate the Federal deficit.\n  It seems to me, given the economic story we have talked about today, \nthe question is, do we want to move in that direction again: swollen \ndeficits, slower growth, more unemployment? Or do we want to continue \nwith the plan that has worked for our country?\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend, in closing, we have heard a \ndiscussion here this afternoon about the economy and how the glass is \nhalf full rather than half empty. I have heard on the Senate floor, \nover the past month or so, the same type of discussion as it relates to \ncrime in America; that is, ``the glass is half empty, it is not half \nfull,'' when we should recognize that the violent crime rate has \ndropped for adults. We are making progress with the approximately \n40,000 new police officers throughout America. We are making great \nprogress. We should talk about the positive effect of how crime is \nbeing attacked in this country rather than continually dwelling on the \nnegative.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns).

Mr. President, it is not going to be the subject I \nintended to address, but I could not help hearing some of the remarks \nfrom the other side about how onerous it would be if we were to allow \nthe American family to keep more of what it earns in its checking \naccount via tax relief. I am going to talk for just a second about it.\n  An average family in my State gets to keep 47 percent of its gross \nincome. In 1950 those people got to keep 80 percent. Now they can only \nkeep 47 percent after they get finished paying their Federal tax bill, \nState, local, the cost of Federal regulations, and extra costs they pay \nin interest payments because of the national debt that has been drummed \nup by an ever-increasing and larger Federal Government here in \nWashington.\n  Mr. President, 47 percent is what is left at the end of the day. I \nwill say as long as I am here that any effort to bring relief to those \naverage families and to allow more of their earnings to stay in their \nchecking accounts is laudable and correct, because we have pushed the \naverage family to the wall. That which we ask them to do, get the \ncountry up in the morning, feed it, house it, shelter it, take care of \nits health, is virtually impossible to do today with what is left in \nthat checking account after some Government bureaucrat marches through \nit.\n  It is not my purpose to discuss it here this afternoon. But lowering \nthe economic pressure on the average family in our country would do \nmore to end the stress and the anxiety and the behavioral problems in \nour middle-class families than any other thing we can do. You can track \nthe stress in those families and track it day by day, month by month, \nyear by year, as we ratcheted up the tax pressure on those families. \nYou can see the effect it has had on them--smaller families, no savings \nin their savings accounts, lower SAT scores, more members of the family \nhaving to work just to keep up; in some of them, not only both parents \nworking but both parents having two jobs.\n  I am absolutely mind boggled that we would be arguing that it would \nbe some evil and sinister thing to lower the tax pressure on the \nAmerican family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11503-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11503-S11511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RE-CREATE A MELTDOWN\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we are hours away from the end of the \nfiscal year. There are leadership meetings occurring everywhere. I have \nbecome convinced that the other side has concluded it is to their \npolitical advantage to try to re-create a meltdown here.\n  We have learned from reading in the paper that the now famous Dick \nMorris, political consultant to the White House, spent 5 months \nplanning the last shutdown, and we see the exact same characteristics \nas we come to trying to bring the year to a logical and bipartisan \nclosure. Let us remember that, unlike a year ago, we have 60,000 troops \nin harm's way right now in Iraq and Bosnia. We have just watched a \nhurricane sweep across our eastern shores, and we have families \ndesperately trying to dig out. We are 6 weeks from an election, and we \nought to get the electioneering out of the\n\n[[Page S11504]]\n\nHalls of Congress, come to closure here, lower the anxiety level for \nall those families involved, keep the Federal Government on course and \nmove the campaigning to the elections.\n\n  Our majority leader, I believe, has done everything humanly possible \nto keep this in a bipartisan manner, keep tempers cool. He has come out \nhere on the Senate floor and offered a resolution that would keep that \nsafety net under our troops and under our disaster-stricken families. \nHe has offered both sides six amendments and then come to closure on \nWednesday night at a logical hour.\n  What was the response? ``No way.''\n  He then offered to start a debate on a resolution that would keep the \nsafety net under the Government this past Tuesday with no limits on the \namendments in process but an agreement that we would finish in an \norderly manner by Wednesday night. What was the answer? ``Absolutely \nnot.''\n  Then he said, let's take the Department of Defense appropriations \nconference report and, with a continuing resolution, you know, a safety \nnet under the Government, omnibus spending vehicle attached to it. ``No \nway.''\n  So, option after option is presented, denial after denial occurs, and \nthe clock is running and the troops are still in harm's way.\n  The White House has indicated that it wants to make the illegal \nimmigration bill, which is a very, very large piece of legislation on \nwhich hours and hours and hours have been expended, wants to make this \na center point, some sort of a leverage to bring us to the brink. I am \nreading from the Los Angeles Times: ``Clinton seeks to halt further \nlimits on noncitizens. Holdup of appropriation would vex GOP members \nanxious to hit campaign trail.''\n\n       Washington--Setting up a confrontation with Republican \n     leaders, the White House indicated Thursday that President \n     Clinton will not sign a must-pass spending bill [that is the \n     safety net] until the GOP agrees to amend separate \n     immigration legislation.\n\n  There will be others who will speak to this, but the White House said \nyou have to take out the Gallegly amendment. The Gallegly amendment \nleft States the right to choose to allow legal immigrants in schools or \nnot, and it has been argued and argued and argued. But the Republican \nleadership of the Senate and House said, ``OK. In an effort to maintain \nthe safety net, in an effort to bring a bipartisan conclusion to the \n104th Congress, we will remove it.'' So, they did. After they did it, \nthe White House says, ``No, that is not enough. Now we want more \nchanges in it before we will agree to sign it.''\n  This reminds me of the system that apparently Dick Morris organized a \nyear ago. Let me read from one of our daily papers, the Washington \nheadline. It says:\n\n       Immigration and Naturalization Service officials have \n     learned that about 5,000 of the 60,000 immigrants naturalized \n     in six days of mass ceremonies in Los Angeles last month \n     concealed past criminal records that might have disqualified \n     some of them from citizenship. . . .\n       Of the 5,000 who proved to have criminal records . . . \n     their alleged crimes ranged from serious offenses, such as \n     murder and rape, that would disqualify them from citizenship \n     to minor violations that would not.\n\n  This article says, ``Clinton administration election year program to \nnaturalize 1.3 million new citizens during this fiscal year ending \nOctober 1 * * * ''\n  In other words, it is a rush, it is a political plan we have here to \nrush people through so fast that the FBI cannot even provide the \ntraditional background check that would have spotted these murderers \nand rapists who are now U.S. citizens because of this political \nprogram.\n  Right here, it reads:\n\n       Because of the rush to naturalize citizens, none of this \n     FBI data was available to the Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service before the ceremony.\n\n  What kind of nonsense have we gotten ourselves into here? What price \nare these elections worth?\n  It reads that:\n\n       Prior to the inception of citizenship, USA officials said \n     the INS generally waits until it receives the result of an \n     FBI check on applicants for naturalization before granting \n     them citizenship.\n\n  But that was pushed aside because the politics of this program was \nmore important.\n  Now we come to this illegal immigration bill, and all of a sudden, it \nhas become bigger than running the Government, and one cannot help but \nmiss the connection that we have throttled up this immigration bill, we \nhave used it as a wedge against keeping an orderly transition of \nGovernment, a safety net under these troops that are overseas, our \nseniors, our children's programs, school programs, all set aside for \nthe politics of the moment.\n  The idea of strategically using immigration and naturalization \npolitically, the idea of a political plan for posturing to destabilize \nour troops, disaster victims, is not a very pretty picture. No wonder \nthere is so much cynicism about this process that goes on in our \nCapital City.\n\n  Mr. President, we have been joined by the senior Senator from Utah, \nby the chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. Senate, by an \nindividual who has been deeply involved in this process since its \ninception. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have to say I am very disappointed. The \nClinton administration is playing political games with the illegal \nimmigration reform bill. This is one of the most important bills of \nthis whole Congress. The Congress has worked very hard on this very \nnecessary legislation.\n  On August 2, 1996, President Clinton wrote to Speaker Gingrich. The \nonly item on which he said he would veto the immigration bill was the \nGallegly provision on the free public education of illegal aliens. The \nprovision was, in fact, contained in a draft conference report proposal \ncirculated on the evening of September 10 by Republican conferees.\n  At no time in the next 2 weeks, as this draft proposal was \ncirculated, was I advised that the administration wanted to remove \ntitle V of that proposal, dealing with restrictions on benefits for \naliens.\n  Indeed, the administration mentioned the Gallegly provision was \nreally the big item to them; that if we took Gallegly out, the \nPresident would sign the bill.\n  In order to accommodate this administration and facilitate passage of \nthis very tough illegal immigration bill, the Republican conferees \ndropped the Gallegly provision outright, and I argued for the dropping \nof that provision, mainly because I wanted to get this bill through \nbecause there are excellent provisions in this bill that are \ndesperately needed.\n  Additional changes were made to accommodate other concerns expressed \nby some Members on the other side of the aisle. For example, illegal \naliens' use of Head Start programs, English as a second language \nprograms, and job-training programs would not count in the \ndetermination of whether the alien had become a public charge and, \ntherefore, subject to deportation. A legal immigrant's use of emergency \nmedical services would not be subject to deeming.\n  But the administration is now engaging in a shell game. Even though \nwe removed the one item the President said would lead to a veto and \nmade still other changes in the September 10 draft, and even though the \nPresident had 2 weeks to weigh in and did not do so, the administration \nis now calling upon its congressional allies to slow down and even \nderail this bill unless wholesale changes are made to it. These changes \nare coming out of left field. By so demanding, the President is acting \nas the ``Guardian in Chief'' of the status quo.\n  These tactics make me wonder whether the President really favors \ntough anti-illegal-immigration legislation. Why did he wait until after \nthe conference to make these demands as a condition of his support for \nthe bill?\n  The American people want Congress and the President to deliver on \nthis subject. The Congress is prepared to do so. Is the President?\n  Let me go over just a few of the items in the conference report that \nthe President is helping to delay action on.\n  This is the illegal immigration conference report. On border control \nand illegal immigration control, we provide for 5,000 new Border Patrol \nagents, which are dramatically needed at this time if we are going to \nmake any headway in this battle; 1,500 new Border Patrol support \npersonnel; and 1,200 new Immigration and Naturalization Service \ninvestigators, which are very badly\n\n[[Page S11505]]\n\nneeded. They will not be there unless this bill passes.\n  We provide for improved equipment and technology for border control; \nfor an entry-exit control system to keep track of the aliens who are \nsupposed to leave the United States; and for additional and improved \nborder control fences in southern California. All of that is included \nin just part of this bill.\n\n  Let me go on.\n  With regard to alien smuggling, document fraud, and illegal \nimmigration enforcement, we provide:\n  Increased criminal penalties for alien smuggling and document fraud;\n  New document fraud and alien smuggling offenses;\n  New Federal prosecutors to investigate and prosecute immigration \nviolations;\n  That alien smuggling penalties will be calculated for each alien a \nsmuggler has smuggled in;\n  Wiretap authority in alien smuggling and document fraud cases; and\n  A new civil penalty for illegal entry.\n  We also make it unlawful to falsely claim U.S. citizenship for the \npurpose of obtaining Federal benefits, which has been going on now for \nyears, and it is time to bring a stop to it. This bill will do it, and \nthis President is stopping this bill.\n  With regard to removal of illegal aliens, we streamline the removal \nprocedures so it can happen, so it can be done. Illegal aliens who are \nremoved will be inadmissible for certain periods.\n  We revise expedited exclusion provisions of the Terrorism Act to \nensure that those with valid asylum claims receive adequate protections \nfrom persecution. We take care of those with valid asylum claims.\n  You can see, these are just a few more of the things that this bill \ndoes, all of which are absolutely critical to solving this illegal \nalien problem in our country. Let me just go on.\n  With regard to criminal aliens--and we have plenty of those in this \ncountry right now; they are causing an awfully high percentage of the \ncrimes in our country today. We have expanded the definition of \n``aggravated felon'' for the purposes of the Immigration and \nNationality Act. We have mandatory detention of most deportable \ncriminal aliens. We have improved removal of deportable criminal \naliens.\n  We eliminate loopholes under which criminal aliens have stayed within \nthe United States. We improve the identification of deportable criminal \naliens. We increase the Immigration and Naturalization Service \ndetention space by 9,000 beds, something they tell us absolutely has to \nhappen or we are going to have an even greater crisis on our hands than \nwe have now.\n  We also have additional financial resources for the detention of \ncriminal aliens and other detainees, which is absolutely critical if we \nare going to fight and win this battle with regard to illegal \nimmigration. Let me go a little bit further.\n  With regard to interior enforcement, we provide that State and local \nauthorities will be able to perform immigration control functions, \nincluding transporting illegal aliens to INS detention facilities \nacross State lines, something that currently we have difficulty doing. \nA lot of States, just to get these people out of their States and get \nthem into detention facilities, would pay for the costs \nthemselves. Many States would provide the sheriffs' deputies and others \nto get these people out of their States. We provide they can do that, \nof course, with the cooperation and help of the INS.\n\n  We ensure at least 10 active-duty INS agents in each State. We \ncertainly think that is critical. Of course, in the major border \nStates, we have many more than that.\n  We improve legal border crossing.\n  We have increased border inspectors to speed up legal border \ncrossing.\n  We have commuter-lane pilot projects for frequent border crossers.\n  As you can see, all of these various provisions that we have in this \nbill are absolutely crucial if we are going to make any headway against \nthis problem of illegal immigration.\n  I have to tell you that it took this Congress to do some of these \ntough things. I want to personally compliment the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wyoming, Senator Simpson, for working so hard as subcommittee \nchairman to get it done, and the whole Judiciary Committee, because it \nwas there that we really worked out the difficulties between the \nDemocrats and the Republicans, and I think came up with a pretty \nsuperior bill, which now has become primarily the bill that came out of \nconference.\n  I want to compliment Lamar Smith and Mr. Gallegly and Mr. McCollum, \nand others over in the House who have played a tremendous role in this \nmatter.\n  In the Senate, of course, Senator Simpson and everybody on the \nJudiciary Committee deserves enormous credit. On the other side of the \naisle, Senator Kennedy and Senator Feinstein have really played \nsignificant roles, although Senator Feinstein is primarily working with \nus today to try to get the bill through. She has done an excellent job. \nShe has fought hard for her State. She realizes California, Texas, \nArizona, Florida--all of these Southern States, these border States--\nhave to have the bill. So she is fighting to get it. At the same time \nshe is fighting her guts out, this administration is trying to undercut \nher and undercut what we have done.\n  It is an amazing thing that we have been able to bring 535 people \ntogether in the legislature, at least a majority of them, to pass a \nbill that will make a difference in this country.\n  This conference report passed overwhelmingly in the House for good \nreason. People over there are concerned about what is happening. And it \nwill pass overwhelmingly here if we can get it up. Frankly, the only \nlogjam in getting it up happens to be the President of the United \nStates and his cohorts who are all over Capitol Hill trying to ruin \nthis illegal immigration bill.\n  To me, I cannot understand that kind of reasoning. I cannot \nunderstand that type of activity. I cannot understand the President \ndoing this. I cannot understand why they are not working with us to get \nthis bill through, especially since we made every effort to get the \nGallegly amendment out of that bill.\n  To be honest with you, the Gallegly amendment was not as bad as some \npeople have been making out. It was a rule of Federalism. All Mr. \nGallegly and California wanted is for the States to have a right to \ndetermine whether or not they will educate illegal alien kids, at a \ntremendous cost--$2 billion to $3 billion in California.\n  I do not think there is a State in this Union that would decide not \nto do so, even California, in spite of what some out there would like \nto do. But the fact of the matter is, it was not a bad amendment in \nterms of Federalism. It would not have hurt anybody, in my opinion. We \neven modified it to try to please the President, so we grandfathered K \nthrough 6 and 7 through 12. We provided a safety valve so we could rip \nit out of the bill at a future time, with expedited consideration by \nthe Congress. But that was not good enough.\n  Finally, it came down to literally just ripping it out of the bill, \ncalling it up maybe separately, but ripping it out of the bill to \nsatisfy this President who said he would not veto this bill if we got \nrid of Gallegly. No sooner did we do that, and last night they come up \nhere and said, we want title 5 out of the bill. Title 5 is a pretty \nimportant provision of this bill. As a matter of fact, it contains a \nnumber of very important provisions if we are going to get a handle on \nillegal immigration in this country. It is incredible to me that they \nwould do that after they gave their word, it seemed to me, with regard \nto the Gallegly amendment and taking it out of the bill.\n\n  Mr. President, I see my time is up. Let me just finish by saying \nthis. This is an important bill. It is one of the most important bills \nin this country's history. We can no longer afford to allow our borders \nto be just overrun by illegal aliens. There are some indications that \nthis administration has been soft on letting people into this country, \nmost of whom vote Democratic once they get here as noncitizen illegals. \nFrankly, a lot of our criminality in this country today happens to be \ncoming from criminal, illegal aliens who are ripping our country apart. \nA lot of the drugs are coming from these people.\n  This bill will play a significant role in making a real difference \nfor the benefit of our country, and I am calling upon the President and \nthe people at the White House to get off their duffs\n\n[[Page S11506]]\n\nand start helping us to get it passed and quit this type of activity. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks by the Senator \nfrom Utah. I now yield up to 10 minutes to the senior Senator from \nMissouri and the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on VA-HUD.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia. I \nappreciate the opportunity to explain to some of my colleagues, and \nthose who might be interested, what is going on with the appropriations \nprocess.\n  I think all of us know that the time has come to shut down this \nsession of Congress. We have a couple of very important things pending.\n  The fine chairman of the Judiciary Committee has just described what \nneeds to be done on a problem that everyone recognizes, and that is the \nproblem of illegal immigration. Can we move forward on that bill? I \nthink it is one of the key elements of a resolution of this session of \nthe Congress. But everybody knows that before we leave town we have to \nprovide the appropriations measures to keep the Government running and \nto keep programs going which the Federal Government has undertaken as a \nresponsibility.\n  I understand that perhaps an hour or so ago the Democratic leaders on \nthis side and on the House side had another one of their infamous non-\ninfomercials, a news conference in which the facts were not necessarily \nthe absolute requirement of any of the discussions. I believe they were \ntalking about how the Republicans intend to shut down the Government \nagain.\n  Let me be clear about one thing, Mr. President. The distinguished \noccupant of the chair chairs an important appropriations subcommittee. \nThe appropriations bills are extremely important, and we work on those \nappropriations bills on a bipartisan basis.\n  I have the pleasure of serving as chairman of the Veterans' \nAdministration, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies \nSubcommittee. And on that subcommittee, I am greatly aided and assisted \nby my ranking member, Senator Barbara Mikulski, a Democrat from \nMaryland.\n  Now, we often have disagreements on those measures, but we work them \nout here on the floor. We can, in this body, pass measures that are \ngreatly objectionable because of the right of any Senator to \nfilibuster. So we, in essence, need to have 60 votes for a \ncontroversial provision in any measure. And we customarily operate on \nthe basis of courtesy to take into consideration the views of the \nminority.\n  In this VA-HUD bill, we went a long way because there were a lot on \nthis side of the aisle who were not thrilled about AmeriCorps, the \nnational service program. Yet, as an accommodation to those who felt \nstrongly about it--Senator Mikulski was an original sponsor of it; it \nhad the strong backing of the administration--we put $400 million in \nthat bill for AmeriCorps. We carried it over to conference with the \nHouse. And the House, many on our side, felt even more strongly in \nopposition. We made the point that we fought the battle and we won \nbecause we knew it was important to Members on the Democratic side \nhere, to the President. We included that in the bill.\n  Our bill has some very, very difficult things. Allocating scarce \nfunds for housing, for urban affairs, for the Veterans Administration, \nfor EPA, for NASA, for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. We \nworked all those out. During the course of those conversations, we had \nnot only the budget requests from the White House in front of it, but \nwe were assured that the White House had conversations with and \nexpressed their views to the members on the minority side in our \ncommittee.\n  We came up with what I think was a good bill. It passed \noverwhelmingly. It had some additional things on it this time. It \nbecame not just an appropriations bill, it is an authorizing bill, a \nnew entitlement bill. But we got it through.\n  Yesterday, at about 10 o'clock, the President signed the VA-HUD bill. \nHe signed it, signed it into law. It is law. The appropriations bill is \nthe law for spending for those key agencies for the coming fiscal year.\n  Imagine my surprise when I was summoned to a meeting of the \nnegotiators on the omnibus appropriations bill to handle the unresolved \nissues in appropriations. I was told by Mr. Panetta, a representative \nof the White House, that they wanted to put $160-plus million in the \nVA-HUD bill. I said, ``Excuse me, I believe the President just signed \nthe bill yesterday.'' They said, ``Well, the President had some \nreservations and he wanted more money.''\n\n  There are a lot of things, Mr. President, on which I wanted more \nmoney. We did not put enough money into the preservation of low-income \nhousing. We need to do more in terms of an investment to make sure we \nhave an affordable housing stock, that we have the stock of housing \nthat is either publicly owned or reflects public assistance through \nsection 8 programs in this country. If we had more money in the budget \nI could find some very, very important places to put it in terms of \nhousing, in terms of science, space, and environment, giving more money \nto the States for their State revolving funds.\n  The White House said, ``But we want to add some more money to your \nbill.'' I said, ``This is the bill that you signed about 26 hours \nago.'' They said, ``No, we had reservations.''\n  Mr. President, I heard of the old trick of moving the goalposts. Some \nmay like the analogy of the Peanuts cartoon strip, where every fall \nLucy promises to hold the football for Charlie Brown. She says she will \nnot move the ball this year, but every year she takes the ball away.\n  We are beginning to learn very slowly, too slowly I am afraid, that \nthis administration does not negotiate in good faith. This \nadministration has some other game they are playing. It is not designed \nto achieve a reasonable accommodation between the parties, between the \nlegislative and executive branch, to move forward on appropriations.\n  Now, if there is a shutdown, let me assure you it will be a shutdown \nengineered by the White House and their allies in Congress. This is \nwhere the responsibility will lie.\n  Why do we have a number of bills that are not signed? Mr. President, \nyou and I have been here while we went through the process. Now, a lot \nof people may not understand what we say by the term ``filibuster by \namendment.'' But for those who do not understand the procedures of the \nSenate, unless you have a unanimous consent agreement, unless there is \nan agreement before you start out on a bill, you can continue to add \nthings and add things and add things. You can never come to closure. As \nRepublicans we have 53 votes. If we wanted to cut off debate we have to \nhave 60 votes. We cannot stop people from talking or filibustering by \nadding amendment after amendment after amendment. That is what was done \non Treasury-Postal. I worked on the Treasury-Postal bill in the \nprevious Congress as the ranking member, and it funds some very \nimportant things--White House, Treasury, Customs, GSA, things like that \nare very, very important. There are not 50 different amendments that \nneeded to be offered to that bill.\n  I remember one of the measures we voted on was a measure to establish \na new Federal responsibility, a new Federal responsibility relating to \nguns in schools. Mr. President, if there is one area where the Federal \nGovernment has not been before, it is in local law enforcement. I \nsuggest that the Federal Government has fallen short in those \nresponsibilities which are properly the Federal Government's \nresponsibility.\n  We fought--and when I was the ranking member, Senator DeConcini was \nthe chairman of the committee, my good friend from Arizona--we fought \nagainst cutting back on the Customs work in interdiction, to stop drugs \ncoming into this country. We have cut too much in the Federal law \nenforcement agencies. We certainly do not need to be setting up new \nFederal responsibilities which directly overlap and are totally \ninconsistent with local law enforcement responsibilities.\n\n  But that amendment was voted on on the Treasury-Postal appropriations \nbills, after 3 days on the floor, a bill\n\n[[Page S11507]]\n\nwhich should take at most 2 days to debate those issues, that genuinely \nrelated to appropriations for Treasury-Postal accounts. We had so many \namendments still hanging out that the majority leader had to withdraw \nthe bill.\n  We went on to Interior, to try to get a resolution for those. Then \nthe amendments kept coming out of the woodwork. If anybody does not \nunderstand it, I can tell you unless you have 60 votes and can invoke \ncloture continually, you can continue to hold this place hostage by \noffering amendments or talking as long as you want.\n  Now, we have made a good-faith effort across the board to get the \nappropriations bills done. I have no interest in going back and \nreopening one of the appropriations bills that has been signed. More \nand more ideas keep floating in from the White House. They want to add \nthis. They want to add that. They want to write their own legislation. \nIt is as if they never worked in a government where there was a strong \nopposition party--in this case, a party in control of the Congress.\n  I came from Missouri where I served as Governor for 8 years with a 2-\n1 Democratic majority in both houses. I learned early on, I had to \nlearn, that bipartisan cooperation, comity, honesty in dealing with the \nother side was essential to make the process move. We do not have that \nhere. It is perhaps the fact that the President comes from a one-party \nState.\n  All I can say is we are doing our work on appropriations. We are \ngoing to move forward on appropriations. I hope our leaders will make \nthe best offer they can, trying to guess what the White House's latest \ndemands are to accommodate as many as they can. If they will not, we \nshould do a continuing resolution and get out of town.\n  One last piece of business that we have from the small business \ncommittee, since my colleagues on the other side are not present I will \nnot at this point ask unanimous consent to proceed to H.R. 3719. That \nis vitally important if we are to keep the lending programs, 5047(a) \nprogram, SBIC program working, for the Small Business Administration. \nIt is being held up on the minority side. I will come back and explain \nin detail why the SBA and small business in this country needs that \nmeasure. I hope the hold is lifted so we could pass this measure, many \nof the provisions of which have already been passed in this body.\n  I acknowledge and appreciate the work of the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his remarks. \nThe moving goalposts, as he has described, become clearer and more \nevident with each passing hour here in the Nation's Capitol. \nUnfortunately, the anxiety level of those--not suffered by us--by the \nfamilies of the troops overseas and flood victims and all those people \ndependent on the system, needing the safety net we are trying to put in \nplace.\n  We have been joined by the senior Senator from Wyoming who is the \npreeminent authority on legal and illegal immigration and has been \nundergoing this moving goalpost now for some period of time. I am glad \nhe could join us.\n  I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank my colleague from Georgia, Senator Coverdell. I \nthink it is tremendous that you have arranged this bit of time to share \nwith the American people so we each get to step forward and tell the \ntheory of the moving of the goalpost. To me it is the moving of the \nstadium. I think they moved the end zones, the stadium, and as far as I \nknow, the campus. We will review this for a minute.\n\n  I have been doing this stuff for 31 years. It is called legislating. \nYou do it with Democrats if you are a Republican, and hopefully if you \nare a Democrat, you do it with Republicans. It cannot work any other \nway.\n  Over the years of my time here I have served as chairman or ranking \nmember with some very unique partisan people. Senator Al Cranston with \nthe Veterans' Affairs; Gary Hart, nuclear; Ted Kennedy, Senator \nKennedy, with Immigration and Judiciary; Joe Lieberman, Bob Graham, \nnuclear; Jay Rockefeller.\n  These are the things that I have done. It has always been done with \ncivility. It has always been done openly and honestly. I can't function \nin an atmosphere where people lie. That is what is happening here, and \nI am appalled by it. Let me tell you, it isn't about Ted Kennedy, who \nis one of my most delightful friends, and I have the highest respect \nfor him. Let me tell you what happened yesterday. Get it down. The \nadministration, the White House--remember, they told us if we would \ntake the Gallegly amendment off the immigration reform bill, it wasn't, \n``Well, I might,'' but it was, ``I will probably sign it.'' It was said \nthat way. We didn't have any reason to believe they would not sign it \nat the White House.\n  Last night, in good faith, myself, Senator Kennedy, Howard Berman, a \nDemocrat from California who I delight in and enjoy very much, \nCongressman Lamar Smith, who is just one of the most splendid young men \nI know, who does a tremendous job with the chairmanship of immigration, \nthe four of us sat down to see if we could give a little on title V \nbecause the latest request from the White House was, ``If you get rid \nof title V, we will complete all the work on the CR and sign it by \ntonight at midnight.'' The only thing wrong with that is nobody had \never agreed to give up title V--not Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the \ncommittee, not Senator Kyl, a member of the subcommittee, not Senator \nFeinstein, who has been an absolute stalwart in working with me; she \ndeserves extraordinary credit for doing strong, strong legislative work \nin an atmosphere of high emotion from her State. She and Senator Boxer \nare more affected than anybody else in this place. They have stepped up \nto the plate, and it is a great honor to work with them.\n  So we are going to get down to title V. I said we are going to go to \ncloture next Monday on that bill, and we have about 70 votes in our \npocket, which will get you cloture in any ballpark here; you need 60 \nvotes. So most of the Republicans would vote for cloture, and thanks to \nthe work of Senator Feinstein and others on that side of the aisle, we \nwould get cloture because there are 15 to 20 Democrats who will get \ncloture for us and help with that. So here we are.\n  On August 2, the President wrote a letter to the Speaker to express \nconcern about a single provision of the immigration bill, which was \nauthorizing the States to deny a free public education to illegal \naliens. The President threatened to veto the conference report if that \nprovision or anything like it was included. No other provision was \nopposed in that way.\n  After several weeks of hard, considerable debate and efforts to \ndevelop an acceptable compromise--admittedly, it was done, I think, in \ntoo much of a partisan way, but it was done and everybody knew what \nhappened; everybody has seen the conference report--we agreed to delete \nthe provision that was very popular in the House and had considerable \nsupport in the Senate. Yet, within the last day or so, the White House \nand Democrat allies have moved the goal posts. They have been \nattempting to obtain even further changes. All the time there is \nsomething new.\n  You have had it reported here. I have never seen anything like it in \n31 years of legislating. It would be bad enough if this were done by \nanother veto threat, and early in the session. But this time the \nPresident is attempting to blackmail this Congress into accepting the \nchanges he wants in the immigration bill, as well as changes in several \nother bills. Get this one: You could tell by the tenor of the \ndiscussion when the White House person entered the room last night that \nwhat they were really trying to do was get the stuff they could not get \nin the welfare bill and get it out of the immigration bill and correct \nthe deficiencies in the welfare bill. I am not having any part of that. \nThe President signed the welfare bill. I commended him on that. I \nthought that was great. He got flack and he wants to change some of it. \nBut he isn't going to do it on this watch and, surely, he is not going \nto do it with an immigration bill. I can assure you of that.\n\n  Then we have this threat to refuse to sign the CR. We have the threat \nto close the Government. Let me tell you, that won't work this trip \nbecause we are going to stick around to see that the Government does \nnot shut down, because we are going to shovel this back and say there \nis nothing in there that would shut the Government down.\n\n[[Page S11508]]\n\n The Democrats and the Republicans in the House and the Senate, trying \ntheir best, did what they could. If they fail, then the Republicans, \nwhich is the duty of leadership, produce a bill. If the President wants \nto veto it, do so.\n  So here we are. You can see the scenario--oh, it is so vivid. \nTuesday, we will have to think about closing the Government. Guess who \nwill take the flack for that? Those bone-headed Republicans that let it \nhappen the last time. That is not going to happen this trip because \nthere is nothing in there to veto. It is called doing the business of \nthe United States. It is done by people like Mark Hatfield and Senator \nRobert Byrd, and by people like Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond, and \nit is done by people like Senator Feinstein and Senator Simpson; it is \ndone that way over here. Maybe the White House does not understand \nthat, but I understand it.\n  So now what are the changes that we want here? Oh, well, title V, get \nrid of title V. Why would you want to get rid of title V? I will tell \nyou what is in it.\n  Without the requirements that sponsors earn at least 140 percent to \n200 percent of the poverty line, welfare recipients will be in a \nposition to sponsor immigrant relatives, even though they will be \nunable to provide the support for that relative that they have \npromised. These immigrant relatives will then be able to qualify for \nwelfare programs costing the United States billions of dollars.\n  That is in title V.\n  Without the amendments making a ``public charge'' deportation \neffective, immigrants who go on welfare soon after their entry will be \nable to continue to receive it indefinitely, without fear of \ndeportation.\n  That is in title V.\n  Without ``deeming''--in other words, considering that the petitioner \nand his or her income is that of the immigrant--for immigrants now in \nthe country, many immigrants will continue to receive welfare, even \nthough their middle-class or wealthy relatives who sponsored them are \nperfectly able to provide needed support.\n  That is in title V.\n  Without the new welfare verification requirements, illegal aliens, \nwho claim to be U.S. citizens and just stand there and say they are, \nwill continue to receive assistance, such as AFDC, Medicaid, and public \nhousing.\n  That is in title V.\n  Without the provision authorizing full reimbursement to States--\nlisten to this one--now being forced by Federal mandate to provide \nemergency medical services to illegal aliens, the heavy burden of that \nmandate will continue to grow.\n\n  That is in title V.\n  Without the provisions expediting removal of illegal aliens from \npublic housing--which is the work of Senator Reid and what he has been \ntalking about for years--illegals will continue to occupy public \nhousing, displacing U.S. citizens and lawful resident aliens.\n  That is in title V.\n  Without the prohibition on States treating illegal aliens more \nfavorably than U.S. citizens, States will be able to make illegals \neligible for reduced in-State tuition at taxpayer-funded State \ncolleges.\n  That is in title V, together with all the stuff to clean up their use \nof unemployment compensation, their use of the Social Security system, \nand much, much more.\n  That is what is in title V.\n  There we are. I thank Senator Feinstein for being most courageous in \nthe face of the onslaught that I am sure she is going to get. I want to \ncommend Senator Kennedy, who worked with me until 2 in the morning to \ndo a package, which must have drawn such a great big chuckle this \nmorning when it got down to the White House. I have been doing this a \nlong time, and I have always done it with absolute honesty. I have done \nit with orneriness, with passion, and I have done it with glee, with \ngrief, but I didn't lie. This is appalling, absolutely appalling.\n  If the trick is simply to shut down the Government, well, that is \nnothing. I never spent a nickel's worth of time figuring out how to do \na bill that would go to the President so he would veto it so he would \nlose California. That has never been in my scenario--never would be; \ndon't care about that. I care about doing something about illegal \nimmigration. We couldn't do anything about legal immigration. That is \nfor another date.\n\n  Ladies and gentleman, this is a strong, potent, powerful bill. And, \nif all goes well, it will be voted on; Monday at 2 o'clock on a cloture \nvote. And cloture will carry. The debate will be cut off, and after the \nhours of postcloture and debate are over, we will do that on through \nthe night, we will vote. We will do an immigration bill, and place it \non the President's desk. I hope and pray that he will sign it. But it \nisn't crafted to blow up in his face, and it was not crafted by people \nwho come to Congress, as they have been doing in these last days who \nstand in front of you and do something different than they said they \nwould do before. And I am sick of it.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am grateful to the Senator from \nWyoming for coming and sharing these last 2 days with us, and the \nAmerican people. It is quite an alarming story.\n  We have been joined by the senior Senator from New Mexico, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, and I yield up to 10 minutes to the \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you, very much, Mr. President. I thank the \nSenator from Georgia.\n  Let me thank Senator Simpson for his forthrightness and the way he \nconducted himself as a Senator. The fact that he has been honest, and \nthe fact that he has been diligent in everything he has done around \nhere, lends great credence to what he is talking about here today.\n  Frankly, let me just pledge to the Senator--not that I can be of any \nhelp, but I agree with everything he has said here on the floor. In \nfact, I think there is a lot of game playing going on right now, not \nonly with reference to that bill but also the immigration bill. But \nthere are a lot of other things going on about who is going to be \nresponsible for closing down the Government. Everybody is on that kick. \nWe have a few hours, and we have to get our work done. That is what the \nSenator has been talking about--getting our work done. There isn't \nanybody trying to close the Government down. And the President is \ngetting almost everything he has asked for in major expenditures in \nterms of education, and in terms of the environment. What is there to \nclose the Government down over? It can't be the kinds of things he was \ntalking about last year. It must be something very strange that is in \nsomebody's craw around here. And I wonder just precisely who it is and \nwhat the agenda is.\n  I do not think we ought to be threatening each other with closing \ndown the Government, or using tricks, or gimmicks to try to blame it on \nsomebody. We can get this job done, and get it done right. Every piece \nof legislation that is ever dreamed up can't get passed. With 200 \namendments around here that have nothing to do with appropriations, we \ncan't fix all of those in the last 72 hours of the U.S. Congress.\n  I didn't come down here to talk on that. I came to take on the \neconomy and a few of the contentions presented on the floor of the \nSenate by some on the Democratic side about the status of the economy. \nIf I get enough time when I am finished analyzing what really has \nhappened and whether there is really anything to brag about in terms of \nhow the economy has proceeded in the last year or two, if I have enough \ntime, what I have to say will fit right into why Senator Dole has a new \neconomic plan.\n  Let me first suggest that yesterday some Census data came out that \npermitted the President of the United States and some Members of the \nother party to tell the American people that things are really going \nright, and that the economic facts are really on the side of staying \nthe course that the President has set for America.\n  One of the things that they talked about has to do with real median \nhousehold incomes. Listen to this. They are saying the real median \nhousehold income rose. And so they are saying we are on the right \ntrack. It is going up.\n\n  Let us get the numbers and let us get the facts. It rose from $33,178 \nin 1994 to $34,076--not a significant increase, but an increase. But \nwhat was not said was\n\n[[Page S11509]]\n\nthat even as it has increased, it is still lower than it was in 1990 \nunder President Bush. It was only higher in 1995 relative to the low \nlevels it fell to in the early 1990s. It increased in 1995 because it \nwent down after 1990 during this era that the President claims is a \ngreat economic era and we ought to maintain the status quo. Under the \nBush administration it was $34,914, which is almost $900 higher than it \nis now. The year 1995's level only rose from 1994 because it was \nrecouping some of the ground lost in the preceding years.\n  Arguments are also being made that Census data shows a lessening of \nincome inequality in 1995. They note that the income share of the top \nquintile has gone down some, thus bridging that gap between the poor \nand the rich, or the rich and the poor. Let us look at that.\n  In 1995, there is seemingly something to brag about because the top \nquintile's income share went from 49.1 percent to 48.7 percent, four-\ntenths of a percent down. What isn't said is that the income \ndistribution was much more fair in 1992--at that point, the top \nquintile had only 46.9 percent of the total income pie. Thus, income \ninequality was much less when the President was inaugurated, it then \nworsened significantly, and then eased back fractionally last year. For \nthis, we should tell America the economy is doing splendidly? When in \nits best status under President Clinton, income inequality is still \nworse than the last year of the previous Presidency.\n  I do not choose to make this a battle among Presidents in a partisan \nfashion. But I do choose to say that when I left the White House \nyesterday at a bill signing, I heard our President make these \nstatements. Somebody wanted my comments. I will tell the Senate what I \nsaid to that newsperson. I said, ``I do not want to comment now, \nbecause I want to go back and look at the facts because something \nintuitively tells me that there is another side to this story.'' I came \nback and asked: Is there? I just told you that, indeed, there is.\n  Let me take another one. We are talking about trying to have the \nlower income people get a bigger share of the economic pie when \ncompared with the wealthier people. So bragging is going on that in \nfact the bottom quintile did increase its share a little bit in 1995, \nin terms of the size of the income pie that they took in. There again, \nit is interesting to note that that the bottom quintile's income share \nwas higher in the last year of Bush Administration than it is now \nduring the bragging year. It only went up in 1995 because their share \nwent down so far during the first 2 years of this administration.\n  But most importantly, there is another aspect of the Census report \nwhich concerns me greatly - real median earnings for full-time workers \nin America are still going down--not up. The very same survey that \nyielded some limited good news about 1995 median incomes says the \nfollowing: For men in 1995, real median earnings were down 0.7 percent, \nand for women, real median earnings were down 1.5 percent--not up; \ndown. In fact, real median earnings have fallen in every year of the \nClinton administration for both men and women.\n  That brings me to what I would have been saying on the floor in light \nof some of the discussions about the Dole economic plan. And I am going \nto run out of time. But it is a perfect entre to say to those who want \nto listen, that the distinguished Republican majority leader who is \nrunning for President of the United States had two options on the \neconomy when he decided to run. One was to say, ``The status quo is \nneat. Let us just stay on the status quo for the next 4 years, if I am \nelected President.'' That would have put him right alongside of our \nPresident saying things are really going very well. Or he could ask \nsome experts for the best we can put together. ``Can we do better? \nShould we do better?'' He did that. And the answer given by eminent \neconomists--not wild-eyed economists with new theories, but mainstream \nNobel laureate economists--was, ``We can do better and we should do \nbetter.'' Then the question was asked: ``How do we do it?'' And, \ninterestingly enough, what our candidate for President has been busy \ntrying to do is to argue for the six-point plan they recommended, a \nplan which would produce some economic figures that would be truly \nworthy of boasting about. I am not here saying he has presented his \nmessage magnificently. But, I believe that if the details of his plan \ngot out to the public more fully, it would change the election as \npeople identified increasingly with his vision of America.\n\n  Mr. President, I have just summarized for the Senate what the \nsituation is with reference to incomes for men and for women in the \nyear 1995. And even though some Members on the other side of the aisle \nand the President have touted an increase in real median household \nincomes in the year 1995, I remind the Senate that is the case only as \ncompared with 1994. But if you look to 1990 during the Bush \nadministration, median household income was higher than it is today. \nFurthermore, throughout every year of the Clinton administration, real \nearnings for full-time workers have fallen. They grew by minus seven-\ntenths of a percent for men, and minus 1.5 for women. That means we are \nnot making any real headway in what people are earning for the time \nthey spend working trying to get ahead.\n  It also means that income inequality is not getting any less. The \nPresident has championed the fact that the wealthy people's share of \nthe total income pie came down in 1995. While this small move toward \nlessened income inequality is welcome, this gain is small in comparison \nto significant widening of income inequality which has occurred during \nhis Presidency. In fact, the income distribution is far more unequal \ntoday than it was in 1992, the last year of the Bush Presidency.\n  Coupled with these above facts, there are other striking economic \nwoes that now face the U.S. economy. We are experiencing the slowest \ngrowth rate of any recovery in the last 50 years. We have the lowest \nproductivity growth during any Presidential term in the last 50 years. \nTax burdens for middle income individuals have risen sharply under this \nPresident. The personal savings rate is now at its lowest average level \nof any President's term in 50 years. With this unfortunate backdrop, it \nis no wonder that many Americans wonder why they are working harder and \ngetting less for their work.\n  Senator Dole, as I indicated in my earlier remarks, looked to five or \nsix of the best economists around and they suggested it need not be \nthis way; that we ought to be able to do it better. What they \nsuggested, he adopted after a few months of study and discernment.\n  The conclusions reached were that Senator Dole and his running mate \nshould not run for the White House, based upon trying to keep the \nAmerican economy as it is now and keep the fiscal policy as it is now \nand the tax policy as it is now and the regulatory policy as it is now \nand the education policy as it is now, because to do so is to extend \nthis very serious negative backdrop of the American economy for working \nmen and women. The wealth machine that is enumerated in the gross \ndomestic product is not getting big enough each year for those people \nworking to get more for what they do, rather than stagnating or getting \nless.\n  Essentially, Senator Dole concluded, as I urged him to do, that we \nought to try to do better, and that meant he had to come up with an \neconomic plan that experts would say would do better. One that would \nensure that the earnings of all Americans and median household incomes \nwould be up in 7 or 8 years as compared with 1992 or 1996 or 1995.\n  These economists recommended six things. Six things are his plan. \nWhere people have learned about these and understand them, they opt for \nthis economic direction instead of the status quo. First, he suggests \nthat to get there we ought to adopt a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget. Clearly, I believe it is fair to say that whomever \nis President next year can cause that to happen, for it would already \nbe out there in the States with ratification working had this President \nwanted it, for all he had to do was say the word and one or two--I \ncannot remember which--Democrats would have clearly gone with him.\n\n  The next key item is a program to balance the budget by the year \n2002. Might I say in that regard that there are some who insist that he \ntell us how, our candidate for President Dole, tell us precisely how he \nwould do that. Mr. President and fellow Senators, he\n\n[[Page S11510]]\n\nis not President, he does not have OMB with a couple hundred staff. He \ncannot produce a 1,000-page document. But he has said essentially here \nare some things I would do. There are two parts to it and they are both \neasily understood. Adopt this year's Republican budget and implement \nit, and then reduce spending over the next 6 years, 1 percent a year \nfor a total of 6 percent over 6 years.\n  Now, what do you get for that is what the American people ought to \nask. And they get the next part of this reform. And it is tax rates are \ncut 5 percent a year for 3 years--a 15-percent reduction in tax rates. \nLet me spell out what this means for ordinary citizens. A married \ncouple with two children earning $30,000 would save $1,272 per year. A \nmarried couple with two children earning $50,000 would save $1,657 per \nyear. A retired couple with no children earning $60,000 would save \n$1,727 per year.\n  This is money that average citizens in our sovereign States would \nkeep. Money that now gets sent to Washington in taxes. They could keep \nand spend this money however they see fit, instead of under the Federal \nGovernment's budget and programs.\n  In addition, the capital gains tax, which is an onerous imposition \nupon the sale of assets and the sale of investments would be changed to \nbe 50 percent of what it is now, or 14 percent. All our industrial \npartners in the world tax these kinds of asset sales much less than we \ndo, and they make their money and their resources work better for them, \nand make the economy more vibrant. We must do the same. This is a \ndirect effort to cause growth to occur more. It would make productivity \ngo up, for there is more to invest and more to be saved.\n  His fourth point was to do away with the IRS as we know it.\n  Furthermore, in his first term, he intends to reform the entire tax \nstructure, to press hard for savings and investments which are now \npenalized under the code because, for the most part, they are taxed \ntwice.\n  And that left two other major points, for you can see this plan of \nhis is not just a tax cut, tax reform plan.\n  The two remaining issues are very important. Modify the regulations \non business in America so that you keep those that are needed and \neffective, and you reduce those that are not effective and not needed. \nNow, how does that help? To the extent that we are spending money for \nexcess compliance, it cannot go into the pockets of our working people. \nIt cannot be part of real growth for it goes into unnecessary \nexpenditures that cool the economy rather than let it grow.\n  On that score he recommends in this plan that the best economists in \nAmerica helped prepare, that the justice system, the civil justice \nsystem should be also amended, modified and made more responsive by \neliminating some of the drag and costliness of litigation that is truly \nnot necessary for the American people's well-being. Such litigation \nextracts an enormous cost from the economy, which goes to attorney's \nfees and court costs, public punitive damages and things like that that \nalmost everybody thinks are significantly out of hand. To the extent \nthat cost is put on the economy, there is less there for wage earners \nto get in their paychecks and for small business to earn as the \nbusinesses grow.\n  And then last but definitely not least, if you are going to have more \nproductivity in America and begin to reduce income inequality \nsignificantly and permanently, we must reform our education system. \nOthers have different solutions. They say ``why don't you tax the rich \nmore?''. Well, let me give you a very living example that it does not \nwork, because we have taxed the rich more under this President's \neconomic policies and, lo and behold, the spread between the rich and \nthe poor got bigger. I just told you that in my previous remarks.\n\n  It did not get littler; it got bigger. In fact, the President is \nbragging today because in 1 out of the last 3 years, income inequality \ncame down a bit, but it never was as favorable as it was in the last \nyear of President Bush's term. So, that is not a solution.\n  Almost everybody says we have to do a better job of training some \nAmericans who are not getting educated very well, not getting trained \nvery well, and thus do not get in the mainstream and cannot earn good \nmoney on good jobs. One of the economists advising our nominee, the \nRepublican nominee, is a Nobel laureate named Dr. Becker, from the \nUniversity of Chicago. His expertise is the development of the human \nside, that is people development in a capitalistic society. The \nrecommendation is that President-elect Dole be bold, and he say boldly \nand firmly: We are going to make education in the ghettos and in the \nbarrios and in the areas where our young people are getting inferior \neducation, we are going to change that even if we have to give them \nscholarships to move out of that area to get educated in another \nschool.\n  There would be a whole reshuffling, reorganizing, reforming of how we \neducate those who are getting poor education in this system, for \nwhatever reason. While we are busy about that, the way we train post-\nhigh-school kids and young people for living jobs in the workplace, \nthat we take the money we are spending and, instead of throwing it \naround in hundreds of programs, that we focus it clearly in a \ncompetitive way, with a lot of choice on the part of the recipients, in \nan improved job training program.\n  Now, Mr. President, for those who would choose to say this plan \ncannot be done, I merely suggest that they do not know Robert Dole. \nThey do not know these marvelous economists, full-blooded, true-blue \nAmericans, mainstream, but the best, who say the status quo of today is \nnot good enough. A status quo where real median household incomes are \nworse than in 1990, where, for men and women who are employed full \ntime, average earnings are still coming down, not going up. That means, \ncontrary to the braggadocio of this administration about what kind of \njobs are coming on, that facts seem to indicate many of the new jobs \nare cheap jobs, where the administration would suggest they are not. \nThat fact that I just gave you would indicate, since there are more \njobs but median real earnings are still coming down rather than up for \nfull-time workers, it would mean they are not getting better jobs, in \nterms of the new entrants in this job market.\n  So, when you add all these up, I conclude--and since the issue was \nraised on the floor today I thought I would give my version to whatever \nAmericans are listening and to whatever Senators truly care--I think it \ncan be done, I think we can do better than today's status quo.\n  Let me suggest, for those of us who have been trying to move this \nhuge battleship, the battleship of Federal expenditures, which turns \never so slowly in this huge ocean of demands, of people wanting more \nfrom their Government, it moves slowly. But for those of us who want to \ncontinue the movement in the direction of balancing the budget, we can \nsay to those who will listen to us about the Dole plan: If we cannot do \nit, we cannot prove balance, then we will not do the plan. If we cannot \nprove balance, we will not have the tax cuts. If we cannot prove that \nwe know how to turn the expenditure ship in the direction of balance, \nthen obviously we will not carry out this plan.\n  I thank the Senate for the time, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I have an agreement from the other side to have 5 more \nminutes under my control of the time for the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor, and if I can find time later in the \nafternoon, I will complete this.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. If I might, Mr. President, tell the Senator from New \nMexico that after her 5 minutes, it will go to a period of morning \nbusiness until 5 and there will be ample time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if that \nis----\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could I be recognized for a period of time following the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas for a period not to exceed 5 minutes, \nwith the understanding that an equal amount of time should be offered \nto Senator Bob Graham of Florida. The purpose for the Senator from \nVirginia and the Senator from Florida is to introduce a bipartisan bill \nfor consideration by the next Congress.\n\n[[Page S11511]]\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. If I might respond to the Senator from Virginia, I am \ngoing to ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes to be accorded to the \nSenator from Texas, and then under----\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield and let me just \nask if he would consider letting Senator Domenici finish with 3 minutes \nand then giving me my 5 minutes, and then I think perhaps Senator Byrd \nis going to ask for some time. So we could work something out so that \neveryone would have an opportunity with Senator Warner as well.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do not ask for me to have 3 minutes because I want to \nuse the regular order as best we can, and I need more than 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The Senate is now in a period \nof morning business.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Let me ask unanimous consent that the hour of \ncontrolled business under the Senator from Georgia be expanded 5 \nminutes--and we talked to the other side of the aisle--so the Senator \nfrom Texas may finish her remarks. I will then ask unanimous consent \nthat the period for morning business be extended until the hour of 5 \nwith statements limited to 5 minutes each, which I believe will accord \nthe Senators from Virginia and Florida their opportunity.\n  Mr. WARNER. And the Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Yes. So I ask unanimous consent that the period I \ncontrol be expanded for 5 minutes and that that time be dedicated to \nthe Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. And I shall not object, but I would like to be recognized \nfollowing the distinguished Senator from Virginia and the Senator from \nFlorida about whom he has referred. I would like then to be recognized \nfor such time as I may consume. That time would be probably 30 minutes, \n35 minutes, or some such. I want to speak about the great senior \nSenator from Georgia, who will be leaving us, and I do not want to be \ncramped for time. But I will not overstay my welcome on the Senate \nfloor. So I would like to be recognized at that point for not to exceed \nsuch time as I may consume, which probably will not be more than 30 \nminutes, but it could be 35.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. If I might respond to the Senator from West Virginia, \nI do not know the purpose for which the leader asked for morning \nbusiness to be extended until 5.\n  I am advised that is certainly appropriate, and I am glad to accord \nthe Senator from West Virginia the appropriate time he is seeking.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, could the Chair restate the entire \nunanimous-consent request as it applied to the Senator from Texas, the \nSenator from Virginia, the Senator from Florida, and the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will ask the Senator from Georgia to \nrestate his unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I am asking unanimous consent the time I control be \nextended 5 minutes to accord the Senator from Texas 5 minutes; \nfollowing that unanimous consent, that 5 minutes be granted to the \nSenator from Virginia, followed by the Senator from Florida for 5 \nminutes, and then to be followed by the Senator from West Virginia for \nup to 30 minutes, and that the hour of morning business be extended \nuntil the hour of 5:30 with statements limited to 5 minutes each.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I do not want \nto be limited to 30 minutes. But I will be very considerate of the \ndesires of others to speak.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I would amend the unanimous consent to extend the \nSenator of West Virginia the time that he needs, but that there be a \nperiod of morning business to extend 30 minutes at the conclusion of \nhis remarks with statements limited by each Senator to up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I hope \nnot to, will the Senator from Georgia add at the end of the statement \nby the Senator from West Virginia 20 minutes. I had 20 minutes earlier \nin the day which was taken for another purpose. I would request 20 \nminutes at the conclusion of the Senator from West Virginia in morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I would have to check, I say to the Senator from \nFlorida. I would have to check with the leadership before I could agree \nto that position. But I have agreed to the 5 minutes in accordance with \nthe Senator from Virginia. The Senator is included in that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will withdraw my objection at this time, \nbut I want to alert the Senate that at some time I will be reinitiating \nmy request for 20 minutes for purposes other than that which I am going \nto speak in conjunction with my colleague and friend from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11503-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11511-S11512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to commend the senior Senator \nfrom Wyoming for an outstanding job on a bill that really will put \nteeth in the laws against illegal immigration into our country. He has \nbeen working for months in a bipartisan way to make sure that before \nthe end of this session we did a meaningful job of addressing a \nterrible problem in my State and for the whole country, and that is an \ninflux of illegal aliens that is causing the taxpayers of my State and \nour country millions of dollars.\n  The senior Senator from Wyoming worked until late in the night last \nnight trying to make sure that this bill stays together. All we have \nheard from the White House is that the White House objected to the \nGallegly amendment, and beyond that would sign the bill that was indeed \na bipartisan bill in both Houses of Congress.\n  Today, we have a change of mood, and all of a sudden now the bill \nthat will stop, or at least give us a chance to stop, the illegal \nimmigration into our country is now being held up by the White House \nsaying, no, we want you to take out title V. Now, title V would, in \nfact, take out the enforceability of the welfare reform bill that also \npassed this body and this Congress overwhelmingly.\n  It is time for us to have an integrity in the system that says once \nyou come to an agreement, it is an agreement, our word is good, and we \ngo forward. We cannot have the goalposts changing every time we make an \nagreement. I believe that Senator Lott has really tried to work with \nhis colleagues on the other side of the aisle to offer them all of the \noptions to do what is the responsible thing that we must do in order to \nfund Government before October 1 when the fiscal year ends.\n  A week ago, Senator Lott asked Senator Daschle if he would like to \nhave a continuing resolution offered in which there would be six \namendments on each side, and then we would pass the continuing \nresolution that would fund Government. That was rejected. Then another \noffer was made. Let us start debate on Tuesday on a continuing \nresolution to make sure that we do the responsible thing and keep \nGovernment going. Unlimited amendments on either side, but we finish by \nWednesday night. That was rejected. The last offer was a Department of \nDefense appropriations conference report that all the other spending \nbills that are now outstanding would be put together with, and that has \nnot yet been accepted.\n  The time has come for it to be called what it is. That is a delay \ntactic, an inability to come to an end, a closure so that we can all do \nwhat is responsible, and that is fund Government.\n  I think Senator Lott is trying very hard. Senator Hatfield was up \nuntil 4:30 in the morning this morning trying to negotiate in good \nfaith with the White House and both sides of the aisle and both sides \nof this Capitol, trying to do the right thing, but has been thwarted at \nevery step either by delay tactics during the process of handling\n\n[[Page S11512]]\n\nthe appropriations bills for the last few months or delay tactics right \nnow.\n  Mr. President, we are trying. Our leadership is trying. We want a \nbill for illegal immigration that all of us have agreed to. Now is not \nthe time for the White House to step in and change the level of \nnegotiation. We were finished with negotiation. We agreed that the \nGallegly amendment would be done separately. Now, all of a sudden, \ntitle V is supposed to be taken out of the bill and that takes a very \nimportant part out of the bill. I have a State that has 1,250 miles of \nborder with Mexico. We are under siege, not only with illegal aliens \nbut with drugs coming across the border and we need relief.\n  Mr. President, I know my time is up. I am asking that the President \nof the United States work in good faith with Congress. We are trying to \ndo the responsible thing. We do not have much more time. We have made \noffers but have been unable to gain their acceptance. Mr. President, \nnow is the time for responsibility on a bipartisan basis. It is a two-\nway street.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Warner and Mr. Graham pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2143 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, immediately \nupon the conclusion of the remarks of the Senator from West Virginia, I \nmight have 30 minutes to speak on another subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized for such time as he may \nconsume.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, we are rapidly approaching that season when \nwe shall witness the departure of many of our colleagues who have \nelected not to serve beyond this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I was the 1,579th Senator of 1,826 men and women who \nhave served in the U.S. Senate from the beginning. I have seen many \nfine Senators come and go. As I think back over the years, something \ngood might well have been said about most, if not all, of these \nSenators. We are prone, of course, to deliver heartfelt eulogies, \nspeeches declaring our regrets that our colleagues choose to leave the \nservice of this body.\n  About all of these Senators whom I have seen depart the Senate, some \ngood could be said, unlike Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus, the Roman \nemperor who served from 180 to 192 A.D., one of the few Roman emperors \nabout whom nothing good could be said.\n  I don't think that any of the Senators that I can recall at the \nmoment who voluntarily retired with honor from this body were Senators \nabout whom nothing good could be said. But shortly, we will witness the \ndeparture of one of the truly outstanding United States Senators of our \ntime, and when I say ``of our time,'' I mean my time as a Member of \nCongress for 44 years, a Member of this body for 38 years. The \ndeparture of Sam Nunn will be an irreparable loss. Someone might be \nable to take his place over a period of years.\n  I remember the death of Senator Russell, Richard Russell of Georgia, \non January 21, 1971, 25 years ago. In the course of those 25 years, \none-quarter of a century, I have to say that I have not seen the \nlikeness of Richard Russell, except in Senator Samuel Augustus Nunn.\n  So it may be another 25 years, it may be 50 years before we see the \nlikeness of Senator Nunn.\n  I pay tribute to this distinguished colleague who is retiring from \nthe Senate after 24 years--illustrious years. There are many things \nthat one can say about Sam Nunn, as he has been consistently \nproductive, growing in stature year by year to become, without doubt, \nthe leading Senate voice on national defense security and alliance \nissues--the leading voice. His accomplishments, of which there are \nmany, are notable and derive from an approach to his work which is \nunfailingly thorough and well-focused. He is blessed with an \nexceptional intellect, and in Senator Nunn's case that sharp intellect \ncombines with a much rarer talent for harnessing creative visions to \npractical techniques. Sam Nunn has been especially successful as a \nlegislator in this body because of his ability to reduce complicated \nissues to an understandable scope, while avoiding oversimplification. \nThen he works patiently and persistently to build bipartisan support.\n\n  Indeed, his many ideas and initiatives are often shared and supported \nby his colleagues across the aisle. In a day when bipartisanship is as \nrare as platinum and gold and rubies, and certainly as valuable, Sam \nNunn epitomizes that for which so many of us strive, and often fail to \nachieve--bipartisan consensus which the people so desire and which \nfuels large majorities behind legislative endeavors. The ingredients of \nvision coupled with practicality, and balance between liberal and \nconservative views, mark his spectacularly successful career as a \nSenator and are textbook examples for the younger Members of this body \nand the newer Members of this body in the years to come to heed and to \nemulate.\n  Sam Nunn hails from Georgia, where commitment to the Nation's defense \nruns deeply, and from whence some of our greatest legislators on \nnational defense have emerged. He has upheld the great Georgia \ntradition so ably begun by his granduncle Representative Carl Vinson, \nwith whom I served in the House of Representatives before coming to the \nSenate, and his predecessor, Senator Richard B. Russell.\n  While Senator Nunn has only served as the chairman or ranking member \nof the Armed Services Committee for 12 years, his record of achievement \nand the reverence in which he is held in this body are comparable to \nthat--and I know--comparable to that of the great Russell. This is a \nfeat of enormous distinction. The State of Georgia has to be extremely \nproud to have given such talented sons to our Republic, men who have so \nwell borne the mantle of responsibility to protect the defense of our \nNation and promote its fighting forces.\n  Now, if you ask Sam Nunn what he regards as the most important of his \nmany, many achievements in affecting and directing U.S. policy in the \nnational defense arena, I doubt--and I have never asked him this \nquestion--but I doubt that he would mention the more widely publicized \nof his achievements, such as his role in developing the Stealth \nfighter; or the many initiatives he authored to reduce the dangers of \nwar in the Russian-American relationship; or the meaningful measures \nenacted to reduce and make safer the world's inventories of nuclear \nweapons and fissile materials; or even his role in broadening and \ndeepening American leadership in NATO, in Bosnia, in the Persian Gulf, \nor in Haiti. It is in the less heralded, less glamorous but critically \nimportant area of the morale and welfare of our men and women in \nuniform that is at the top of the list that Sam Nunn might himself cite \nas his most noteworthy achievement in the defense area.\n  Senator Nunn was the key player in meeting the needs of the All \nVolunteer Force so that we could attract and retain the kind of men and \nwomen who could effectively manage and lead our forces across the globe \nin all environments. He constructed a benefits package for the men and \nwomen who fought so well in the Kuwait Desert in Operation Desert \nStorm. He crafted the post-cold war transition measures that address \nthe needs of our military personnel as they make their way from the \nfront lines of the cold war back into American civilian society.\n  He has worked tirelessly to instill a sense of pride and loyalty in \nour uniformed men and women that is of such great value to the Nation. \nAs Edmund Burke said on March 22, 1775,\n\n       It is the love of the people; it is their attachment to \n     their government, from the sense of the deep stake they have \n     in such a glorious institution, which gives you your army and \n     navy, and infuses in both that liberal obedience, without \n     which your army would be a base rabble, and your navy nothing \n     but rotten timber.\n\n  Now I have been privileged to serve with Sam Nunn as a member of the \nArmed Services Committee and with Sam Nunn as its leader. Senators are \nnot renowned for their managerial skills, but the Armed Services \nCommittee under Sam Nunn's leadership has been superbly managed.\n\n[[Page S11513]]\n\n  In my 44 years in Congress, I have yet to see a chairman of any \ncommittee who excelled Sam Nunn. In my humble judgment, he is the best \ncommittee chairman that I have ever seen in these 44 years in Congress, \nincluding myself. I worked hard at being a good chairman. But Senator \nNunn, to me, represents the ideal, the model, the paragon of excellence \nas a chairman.\n  Unusual among authorization committees in the Senate, he produced, \nfrom 1987 through 1994, eight straight authorization acts, each of \nwhich continued major initiatives to build a better managed, sounder \nDepartment of Defense. He was the key figure behind the so-called \nGoldwater-Nichols Reorganization Act, which decentralized power in the \narmed services, giving more on-the-ground authority to our unified \ncommanders in the geographic areas where they had to prepare forces to \nfight in various contingencies. He developed the legislation which \nproduced the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, which cut \nthrough the political snarls involved in closing bases, and has been a \nmost effective tool in downsizing the DOD establishment in a fair and \norderly way.\n  Over the years our uniformed leaders have consistently looked to Sam \nNunn as their champion, as a strong but sensitive force, who empathized \nwith their special needs and could be counted on to take the kind of \naction appropriate to best enhance the morale of the men under their \ncommand. He did not fail them.\n  Perhaps some of the most creative ideas that Sam Nunn willed into \nreality came in the knotty area of reducing the quantum of danger in \nthe Russian-American relationship. He championed, together with John \nWarner, programs to increase communication between the American and \nRussian leadership, and thus reduce the possibilities of tragic, \naccidental nuclear war. Together with Richard Lugar, he crafted a \nsuccessful program to dismantle nuclear weapons possessed by the states \nof the former Soviet Union. He led the Senate Arms Control Observer \nGroup for many years, as my appointee to that group when I was Majority \nLeader, traveling frequently to Geneva, leading delegations of Senators \nto ensure that progress on the INF and START Treaties had the knowledge \nand support of the United States Senate. He traveled extensively to \nRussia, and in turn Russian legislative leaders traveled to the United \nStates, to exchange views and develop cooperative solutions to \nproblems, thereby increasing the level of confidence and understanding \nbetween these two superpowers. Lately he has developed additional \ninitiatives, again with a leading Republican counterpart, Senator \nDomenici, to tackle the problem of terrorist actions against the United \nStates. All in all, Sam Nunn, when he leaves this Chamber and walks out \nof this door for the last time as a Member of this body, can take \nimmense pride in his long, intense and patient efforts in the \nsuperpower relations arena. Those hard-won initiatives have had a \nsubstantial impact on the measure of safety in our world. It is indeed \nno exaggeration to say that the world today is a safer place in part \nbecause of the monumental efforts of one man, the senior Senator from \nthe State of Georgia--Sam Nunn.\n  These achievements and the quality of his dedication and work on \ndefense, alliance and international issues, ranging from NATO to arms \ncontrol and reduction, anti-terrorism, and joint U.S.-Russian threat \nreduction and communications measures have propelled his glorious \nreputation far beyond the Senate. He is known internationally and he is \nviewed universally as an expert in the defense field. He is well known \nin official circles around the globe and is widely sought for his wise \ncounsel.\n  Is it not remarkable that in my time there would have been two \nchairmen of the Senate Armed Services Committee, two ``tall men, who \nlived above the fog in public duty and in private thinking''--Senator \nRichard Russell and Senator Samuel Nunn--both experts in the field of \nnational defense. Both of whom sought for their wise counsel,--sought \nout on this floor,--sought out before the bar of the Senate, in the \nwell, sought out in foreign capitals for their wise counsel.\n  It is not an overstatement to say Sam Nunn's reach and impact have \nbeen international and characterized by workable, sound proposals and \nbrilliant judgment. The global scope of his work has set him apart from \nthe vast majority of men who have served in this body and is a \ntestimony to his dedication to the addressing of the burning issues of \nsanity and order in our world today.\n  While Sam Nunn will undoubtedly be remembered for his Senate service \nin the area of national defense, as if that were not enough, his energy \nand creativity have also been evident in many other areas. The range of \nhis thinking and his talents as a legislator and policy maker encompass \neverything from health care, to student loans, to insurance industry \nreform. In his farewell address, announcing his retirement, in Georgia \non October 9, 1995, he dwelled extensively on the need for America to \nput our youth first, to work on protecting our children from street \nviolence and drugs. He spoke eloquently of the need to reverse the \nsaturation of our TV airwaves with programs of sex and violence. He \nfocused on the need to reinvigorate our educational system in order to \nreincorporate great numbers of American citizens back into the working \nculture of our nation. He has developed successful legislation to lay \nthe groundwork for a nationwide ``civilian service corps'' by offering \neducation benefits in exchange for public service. As the cochairman of \nthe Strengthening of America Commission, a bipartisan group of \nbusiness, educational, labor and academic leaders, he has proposed an \nimpressive plan to make radical changes in the income tax code to \nrefocus our economy on savings and investment and away from \nconsumption.\n  Most importantly, and as my fellow Senators well know, Sam Nunn's \nsuccess is in large part attributable to his hard rock integrity.\n  A religious man, he does not go around wearing his religion on his \nsleeve; he does not go around making a big whoop-de-do about his \nreligion, but he is a religious man, a moral man. Sam Nunn is known as \na man whose judgment can be trusted. How many times have I heard \nSenators come to the Senate floor to vote on a measure and ask: ``How \nis Sam voting on this one?'' He is a leader in this body, in spite of \nthe fact that he has not especially sought to lead. He has not been \nelected to a leadership position, but he has grown into a leadership \nposition. He is a natural leader. His is the best type of leadership, \nbecause it is a leadership that is born of strong character. Horace \nGreeley said: ``Fame is a vapor; popularity an accident; riches take \nwings. Those who cheer today, may curse tomorrow. Only one thing \nendures: character.''\n\n  Sam Nunn epitomizes that great trait, character. The Senate will feel \nthe loss of Sam Nunn and feel it deeply. His legacy and achievements \ncertainly will grow with time. I am personally deeply sorry that he has \nchosen to go. He will leave an empty place in the Senate.\n  Napoleon rejoiced that the ``bravest of the brave,'' Marshal Ney, had \nescaped and had returned across the Dnieper River, even though he had \nlost all of his cannons. Napoleon ordered that there be a salute to \ncelebrate the escape and the return of Ney. And he said, ``I have more \nthan 400 million francs in the cellar of the Tuileries in Paris, and I \nwould have gladly given them all for the ransom of my old companion in \narms.''\n  Had Sam Nunn been an officer in the Grand Army of France, Napoleon \nwould have given everything he possessed for another Sam Nunn.\n  His great natural talents will continue to bring him to the forefront \nof the national policy discussion, and he will, I know, continue to \nachieve great things in a variety of new settings.\n  I have never really felt about a man in the Senate--other than \nSenator Richard Russell--as I have felt about Sam Nunn. I was the \nmajority whip in the Senate when Sam Nunn came to the Senate, and I \nurged that he be placed on the Senate Armed Services Committee. As a \nmember of the Steering Committee, I cast my vote to put Sam Nunn on \nthat committee. That is where he wanted to serve. I watched him grow. I \nhave had some differences, from time to time--minor, of course--with \nSam on some issues. That is not the point. Sam has fulfilled my idea of \nwhat a Senator ought to be.\n\n  There were 74 delegates chosen to attend the Constitutional \nConvention.\n\n[[Page S11514]]\n\n The Convention met behind closed doors from May 25 to September 17, \n1787. Fifty-five of those 74 delegates who were chosen participated, \nand 39 of the 74 signed the Constitution of the United States. I can \nsee in my mind's eye a Sam Nunn in that gallery. I might well imagine \nthat, as they met from day to day, if Sam Nunn had been a participant, \nthey would have come, as they come here when Members of this body \ngather in the well, and asked, ``What does Sam Nunn think about this?'' \nI have no difficulty in imagining that. In such an august gathering as \nwas that Convention, which sat in 1787, with George Washington, the \nCommander in Chief at Valley Forge and the soon-to-be first President \nof the United States, I can imagine that it would have been the same \nthere. They would have said, ``What does Sam Nunn think? How is he \ngoing to vote?\"\n  The First Congress was to have convened on March 4, 1789. And only 8 \nSenators--less than a quorum--of the 22 were there on March 4, 1789. \nFive States were represented--New Hampshire, Connecticut, \nMassachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Georgia. And the Senator from Georgia \nwho attended that day was William Few.\n  It could very well have been Sam Nunn as a Member of that first \nSenate, serving with Oliver Ellsworth, Maclay and Morris, and others. \nAnd as they met to blaze the pioneer paths of this new legislative \nbody, the U.S. Senate, I have no problem in imagining that, often, \nthose men would have turned to Sam Nunn and said, ``How are you going \nto vote, Sam?'' ``How is Sam going to vote?''\n  I think every Member of this body shares with me that feeling about \nSam Nunn. He could have been an outstanding U.S. Senator at any time in \nthe history of this Republic--not this democracy. When the Convention \ncompleted its work, a lady approached Benjamin Franklin and said, ``Dr. \nFranklin, what have you given us?'' He didn't answer, ``A democracy, \nMadam.'' He said, ``A republic, Madam, if you can keep it.''\n  Now, what is there about Sam Nunn that makes him this kind of man? He \nis not the typical politician that one conjures up in his mind when \nthinking about Senators and other politicians. Senator Nunn is not \nglib. He doesn't jump to hasty conclusions.\n  He does not rush to be ahead of all of the other Senators so that he \nwill get the first headline. He thinks about the problem, and he \nlogically, methodically, and systematically arrives at a decision. Then \nhe carefully prepares to put that decision into action.\n  I suppose that had he lived at the time of Socrates, who lived during \nthe chaos of the great Peloponnesian wars, Sam would have been out \nthere in the marketplace debating with Socrates, about whom Cicero said \nhe ``brought down philosophy from Heaven to Earth.'' Sam would have \nbeen a hard man for Socrates to put down because he has that talent, \nthat knack of thinking, an organized thinking, and the consideration of \na matter logically, carefully, and thoroughly. He is truly a man for \nall seasons. His wisdom, his judgment, and his statesmanship have \nreflected well on the profession of public service at a time when \nfierce ``take-no-prisoners politics'' has embroiled the Nation to \nalarming degrees.\n  Napoleon did not elect to go into Spain, and Wellington was concerned \nthat Napoleon himself might lead. Wellington later told Earl Stanhope \nthat Napoleon was superior to all of his marshals and that his presence \non the field was like 40,000 men in the balance. Sam Nunn, the 1,668th \nSenator to appear on this legislative field of battle, is like having a \ngreat number in array against or for your position.\n  I was looking just this morning over the names of those Senators who \nare leaving, and examining their votes on what is called pejoratively \nthe Legislative Line-Item Veto Act of 1995. Of those Senators who are \nleaving, seven voted against that colossal monstrosity, for which many \nof those who voted will come to be sorry. If this President is \nreelected, he will have it within his power to make them sorry. He is \njust the man who might do it.\n  Among the departing Senators, Sam Nunn is one of those who opposed \nthat bill. Senator Heflin, Senator Johnston, Senator Pell, Senator \nPryor, Senator Cohen, Senator Hatfield, and Senator Nunn voted, to \ntheir everlasting honor, against that miserable piece of junk.\n  Just wait until this President exercises that veto and see how they \ncome to heel--h-e-e-l. They will rue the day. But Sam Nunn voted \nagainst it.\n  For the outstanding quality of his character as well as for the \nbrilliance of his service, this Senate and the Nation are eternally in \nhis debt. He will always command, in my heart and in my memory, a place \nwith Senator Richard Russell.\n\n     God, give us men. A time like this demands\n     Strong minds, great hearts, true faith, and ready hands;\n     Men whom the lust of office does not kill;\n     Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy;\n     Men who possess opinions and a will;\n     Men who have honor; men who will not lie;\n     Men who can stand before a demagog\n     And damn his treacherous flatteries without winking.\n     Tall men, sun-crowned, who live above the fog\n     In public duty and in private thinking;\n     For while the rabble, with their thumb-worn creeds,\n     Their large professions and their little deeds,\n     Mingle in selfish strife, lo. Freedom weeps,\n     Wrong rules the land and waiting justice sleeps.\n     God give us men.\n     Men who serve not for selfish booty,\n     But real men, courageous, who flinch not at duty.\n     Men of dependable character; men of sterling worth.\n     Then wrongs will be redressed and right will rule the earth.\n     God, give us men.\n\nmen like Samuel Augustus Nunn.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. McConnell). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, if Senator Nunn would care to make any \ncomments, I would be pleased to defer to him.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Will the Senator yield for a moment? I ask unanimous \nconsent to follow the Senator's 30 minutes with 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NUNN. I am left speechless after listening to my friend Robert \nByrd. So I will reserve my time. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11512-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11514-S11519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONFERENCE REPORT TO ACCOMPANY ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION REFORM AND IMMIGRANT \n                       RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we will soon begin a debate on the \nconference report entitled ``Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996.'' I am concerned that, when we commence \nthat debate, we are not going to be in as advanced a position as we \nshould be, for several reasons--two in particular.\n  One of those is that, when this legislation was considered in the \nHouse of Representatives, a provision was attached which would have \ngiven to individual States the prerogative of denying public education, \nelementary and secondary education, to the children of illegal \nimmigrants. That provision became so inflammatory that it tended to \nfocus total attention on this legislation on that single provision. \nThat provision has now been eliminated. It has been withdrawn. \nTherefore, we are now focusing for the first time on the totality of \nthis legislation.\n  A second reason why we are not in as advanced a position as we should \nbe for legislation which is as significant as this, has to do with the \nprocess by which this conference committee prepared its report. First, \nit was an elongated process that took many weeks and months to reach \nthe conclusion that is now before us. But it was also essentially a \nclosed process. Not only were many of the members of the conference \ncommittee not given the opportunity to participate, at the conclusion \nof the conference they were not even allowed to offer amendments to try \nto modify provisions which were found to be objectionable. So we have a \nproduct today which has not had the kind of thoughtful dialog and \ndebate which we associate with a conference report which is presented \nto the U.S. Senate for final consideration.\n  For this reason, I joined those who urge that objectionable \nprovisions in\n\n[[Page S11515]]\n\nthis act--and I will use the bulk of my time to attempt to outline what \nI consider some of those objectionable provisions--be excised, be \neliminated, from this conference report, or, failing to do so, then \nthat the conference report, regrettably, be rejected.\n  I speak to this position based on some principles of fundamental \nfairness to all of those who will be affected by this legislation \nentitled ``Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act \nof 1996.'' I speak not only for the legal immigrants who will feel the \nfull weight of this report, which is supposed to deal not with legal \nimmigrants, but, by its title, with illegal immigration; but I also \nspeak of the apparent, and not so apparent, adverse effects that this \nwill have on the States and local communities in which most of the \npersons affected live.\n  This Congress has spent an enormous amount of time discussing \nimmigration. I fully support the mandates which were passed to help \nassure that individuals do not enter this country illegally. The U.S. \nGovernment has a fundamental responsibility to enforce the laws which \nthis Congress passes. Unfortunately, we have failed to do so as it \nrelates to our immigration laws, and, thus, we have millions of illegal \naliens within our society.\n  I am proud of the fact that this legislation includes steps such as \nstrengthening our Border Patrol. These are the hard-working officers \nwho are our first line of defense against illegal immigration. I do not \ncontest, but, in fact, fully support, better enforcement and funding to \nprevent illegal immigration, including those steps that would \ndemagnetize jobs as a reason why illegal aliens come to the United \nStates.\n  Our Government has brought an unfair and strenuous burden to many \nStates in the form of allowing thousands, in some cases millions, of \nillegal immigrants to enter within their borders. Florida has been \nparticularly affected because of its unique geographic location, its \ndiverse population, its temperate climate.\n  Our Government, for several decades, has made Florida the gateway to \nimmigrants arriving from South America and the Caribbean basin. A large \nmajority of those who seek to be called Americans are Floridians. These \nnew arrivals, those who come legally, those who come playing by the \nrules, are, in large part, law-abiding citizens. They work hard, they \npay taxes, they ask nothing of our Government other than the \nopportunity to eventually be called a citizen of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  But on occasion, as may happen to native-born Americans, a \ncircumstance arises where assistance is needed. In the past, our State \nand local communities have scraped by doing all that was possible to \nassist these newcomers. The Federal Government was frequently a partner \nof States and communities in providing assistance in unexpected \nemergency conditions.\n  Mr. President, we are now faced with the prospect of trying to \ncontinue our humanitarian efforts without that Federal partner and, \nthus, with even fewer resources available from the National Government \na greater demand for those resources from the States and local \ncommunities which are affected.\n  In some ways, we have come to the conclusion that eliminating even \nminimal benefits to legal immigrants will somehow solve our illegal \nimmigration problem. This is not true. In reality, it only hurts those \nwho follow the rules, those who made every effort to enter the United \nStates in a lawful, orderly, documented manner, and it hurts our \ncommunities, it hurts those cities and towns that provide services to \nlegal immigrants and now will receive no assistance from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  This, Mr. President, is wrong. We speak so often of the Federal-State \npartnership. The Federal Government, in this case, is no longer a \npartner to our States and communities. This is unfair--and for many \nreasons, of which I will only discuss a few this evening.\n  It is within the purview and responsibility of Congress to act to end \nand to avoid further extension of this unfairness. My State of Florida \nbrought suit in the Federal courts, brought suit on the basis that our \nState had been asked to shoulder hundreds of millions of dollars of \nresponsibilities for legal and illegal immigrants, responsibility which \nshould have been a national obligation.\n  As the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals explained in its 1995 decision, \nChiles versus the United States:\n\n       The overall statutory scheme established for immigration \n     demonstrates that Congress intended whether the Attorney \n     General is adequately guarding the borders of the United \n     States to be ``committed to agency discretion by law'' and, \n     thus, unreviewable. Florida must seek relief in Congress. \n     We conclude that whether the level of illegal immigration \n     is an ``invasion'' of Florida and whether this level \n     violates the guarantee of a republican form of government \n     presents nonjusticiable political questions.\n\n  Essentially, what the court was saying is, do not come to us for \njustice. You must seek justice in the political arm of the Federal \nGovernment, the Congress of the United States.\n  I state tonight, Mr. President, that the legislation which is before \nus is not just and does not treat our communities and our States \nfairly.\n  What are some of the bill of complaints against this legislation, \nthat it is unfair to the States and communities of America? Let me list \na few of those complaints.\n  This legislation extends a concept which has been in our immigration \nlaw and which was used extensively in the immigration changes made as \npart of the welfare reform bill passed earlier in this session of \nCongress, referred to as ``deeming.''\n  What is deeming? Deeming, essentially, is a concept that states that \nthe income of the individual who sponsored a legal immigrant into the \nUnited States is deemed--d-e-e-m-e-d--deemed to be the income of the \nperson who was sponsored. This concept of deeming is now applied to \npersons who came into the United States in the past, when the concept \nbehind the law of sponsorship was different, where the sponsor's \naffidavit of sponsorship was not legally enforceable.\n  The rules have changed on these law-abiding citizens in the middle of \nthe game. The sponsor who put his name behind a legal immigrant coming \nto the United States under the rules that existed up to 5 years ago is \nnow being told retroactively, ``You have just taken on very significant \nnew financial responsibilities.''\n  Under the welfare bill, these new deeming restrictions only apply to \nnewly arrived immigrants. Under this conference report, deeming is \napplied retroactively to legal immigrants who came to the United States \nwithin the last 5 years. As a result, sponsored legal immigrants who \ncame into the United States under the old rules stand to lose access to \ndozens of programs, including prenatal care, nonemergency Medicaid, \nHead Start and job training.\n  These provisions will require a further cost shift to the States who \nwill now have to shoulder the burden of these Federal programs which \nwill no longer be available.\n  Another item in that bill of particulars of unfairness is Medicaid. \nEven though the welfare bill contains no immigrant restrictions on the \nuse of emergency Medicaid, the conference report provides that if a \nlegally sponsored immigrant has an emergency and uses Medicaid, the \nsponsor becomes liable for the entire cost of care, without limitation.\n  What does this mean, Mr. President? This means that if a sponsor has \nbrought in a legal immigrant and that legal immigrant is hit by a truck \nor contracts cancer or any of the other items that might result in a \nserious emergency circumstance, the sponsor would be legally \nresponsible for all of those medical costs. Realistically, most \nsponsors would not be able to pay, and, therefore, what will happen? \nThis will just become another uncompensated burden on the hospital or \nhealth care provider.\n  While I support the idea that sponsors should be required to provide \nhousing, food, or even cash assistance to immigrants who have become \nunable to provide for themselves, even the most responsible sponsor may \nnot always be able to finance health care, care for illness or serious \ndisease or injury.\n  Mr. President, as I said, we are going to apply, retroactively, \nstandards to those persons who have sponsored legal aliens, such as \ntheir parents or a child, into the United States and now, \nretroactively, are going to have to take on additional responsibilities \nwhich were unknown to them at the time that they entered into that \nsponsorship relationship.\n\n[[Page S11516]]\n\n  Also, I will discuss some of the changes which have been made in \nMedicaid, the program that provides health care to indigent Americans, \nwhich today is available to legal--legal--aliens. I underscore that \ndifference between those persons who are here because they follow the \nrules and those persons who are in the country because they broke the \nrules. We are talking now exclusively about people who are here \nlegally.\n  One of the changes that has been made in the Medicaid Program states \nthat a sponsor, including those who are being swept up in this \nretroactive provision, will now have to be financially responsible for \nthe emergency medical services provided under Medicaid to those persons \nwho they have sponsored into this country. If their mother that they \nsponsored contracts cancer, or a child is hit by a car and suffers a \nserious injury, those kinds of costs now will become the responsibility \nof the sponsor. Even more egregious, if the sponsor is unable to meet \nthose expenses, it then becomes an obligation of the provider to accept \nthose costs as unreimbursed medical expenses. In most cases, they are \ngoing to end up being the unreimbursed medical expenses of an emergency \nroom in a public hospital.\n  One final part of this is that if the sponsor can't pay, and if the \nperson who they sponsored can't pay, then that sponsored individual \nwill be barred from becoming a naturalized citizen of the United States \nuntil the bill is paid, which means that this child, who may have \nsuffered this injury in youth, is going to be permanently precluded \nfrom becoming a U.S. citizen, unless they are able to achieve a \nfinancial status to pay off this emergency medical bill.\n  A third problem with this legislation, Mr. President, relates to the \ntreatment of communicable diseases. This conference report, I find, \nunbelievably, provides that under no circumstances will the Federal \nGovernment provide funding for the treatment of HIV and AIDS-infected \npatients who are legal immigrants. This, I thought initially, this must \nhave been a misprint. But when you read the conference report on page \n239, it states explicitly,\n\n       The exception for treatment of communicable diseases is \n     very narrow. The managers intend that it only apply where \n     absolutely necessary to prevent the spread of such diseases. \n     The managers do not intend that the exception for testing and \n     treatment for communicable diseases should include treatment \n     for the HIV virus or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.\n\n  I represent a State where we have many persons who come from areas of \nthe world--many within this hemisphere--which have a high incidence of \nHIV and AIDS. What this bill says is if a person is in this country as \nassailees, refugees, parolees, or whatever status, is found to have HIV \nor AIDS, the Federal public health service cannot use its resources to \ntreat those persons. Mr. President, I find this to be unbelievable. Are \nwe just going to ignore this deadly disease and hope that, for \nhumanitarian reasons, or public health concerns, the State or local \nagency will again shoulder this national obligation for persons who are \nin this country under national immigration laws?\n\n  The Medicaid provisions, the deeming provisions, and sponsor \naffidavits are currently nothing more than a means of shifting costs to \nStates, local government agencies, and our Nation's hospital system. \nSimply, if people are sick and cannot afford to pay for coverage of a \ndisabling condition, somebody will absorb those costs. The question is \nwhether the Federal Government will help to pay a portion of that cost, \nor whether such cost will be shifted entirely to States, local \ngovernments, and health care providers.\n  This bill does not protect the health care providers, even though it \nis the Federal Government's health care policy which requires the \nhealth care provider to render such medical assistance.\n  The Federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act requires that \nall persons who come to a Medicare-participating hospital for emergency \ncare be given a screening examination to determine if they are \nexperiencing a medical emergency, and if they are found to be \nexperiencing such a medical emergency, that they receive stabilizing \ntreatment before being discharged or moved to another facility.\n  Federal law requires all hospitals that have emergency rooms, that \nreceive Medicare participation, must provide those services, without \nregard to the ability of the person who has presented themselves for \nsuch care to pay. And now we are saying that the Federal Government is \ngoing to be a ``deadbeat dad'' by sticking those health care providers \nwith the full cost, without a Federal sharing and participation.\n  Mr. President, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the \nNational Association of Counties, and the National League of Cities, \nhas written on April 25 of this year, in anticipation of just exactly \nwhat is before us now, with the following statement:\n\n       Without Medicaid eligibility, many legal immigrants will \n     have no access to health care. Legal immigrants will be \n     forced to turn to State indigent health care programs, public \n     hospitals, and emergency rooms for assistance, or avoid \n     treatment altogether. This will in turn endanger the public \n     health and increase the cost of providing health care to \n     everyone.\n\n  For the Medicaid caseworker as well as all other State and Federal \nprograms he or she must now learn immigration law as well and the \nMedicaid system.\n  As a study by the National Conference of State Legislatures notes, \nthis conference report would require an extensive citizenship \nverification made for all applicants to the Medicaid Program.\n  In addition to the costs to determine eligibility, States will also \nhave infrastructure, training and ongoing implementation cost \nassociated with the staff time needed to make a complicated deeming \ncalculation. The result will be a tremendous, costly and bureaucratic \nunfunded mandate on State Medicaid Programs.\n  Mr. President, another item in the bill of particulars of unfairness \nof this immigration bill relates to parolees and their inability to \nwork. I would put this in the specific context of an agreement which \nthe United States had entered into with Cuba.\n  Under that agreement which was intended to avoid another repetition \nof the mass rafting explosion which we have experienced on several \noccasions since Fidel Castro came to power in Cuba, the United States \nnow allows 15,000 Cuban immigrants per year to enter the United States. \nApproximately 10,000 of those who have arrived per year under this \nagreement have been under the category of parolees.\n  Under this bill, as parolees they will be prohibited from working in \nmost jobs 1 year after they arrive here. How can that be? It can be \nbecause the conference report provides that after 1 year of entry into \nthe United States, a person who is legally in this country, classified \nas a parolee for humanitarian reasons, would be ineligible to obtain or \nmaintain the following:\n  They could not receive any State or Federal grants; any State or \nFederal loan; any State or Federal professional license; and, believe \nthis, Mr. President: They could not receive a State driver's license or \na commercial license.\n  Where are these legal immigrant parolees going to work without a \ndriver's license, without a work permit, without a commercial license? \nWho will assume the burden of caring for these legal immigrant parolees \nwho are in our country? Of course, the cost of their care will shift to \nthe local community, even though it was through Federal Government \naction--and in the case of the United States-Cuban agreement, Federal \nGovernment foreign policy considerations, which brings them to this \ncountry in the first place, and then tells them that they cannot drive \nand that they cannot hold a job.\n  The conference report that is before us is a huge cost shift to State \nand local governments that will impose an administrative burden and \nhuge unfunded mandate on State governments to verify eligibility for \napplicants.\n  Mr. President, one of the first priorities of this 104th Congress was \nS. 1, the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995. It was a top priority of \nthe House of Representatives. It passed both bodies in the first 100 \ndays of this session.\n  The purpose section of the Unfunded Mandate Act stated that the:\n       Purposes of this act are to strengthen the partnership \n     between the Federal Government and State, local, and tribal \n     governments to end the imposition in the absence of full \n     consideration by Congress of Federal mandates on State, \n     local, and tribal governments without adequate Federal \n     funding.\n\n\n[[Page S11517]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, this conference report breaks every premise and breaks \nevery basis of the unfunded mandate law because this conference report \non immigration requires all Federal, State, and local means-tested \nprograms, as well as programs such as State driver's licenses, State \nlicensing departments, for State occupational licenses as well as any \ngrant or funding to first determine whether the individual applying is \nan eligible immigrant.\n  The National Conference of State Legislatures just yesterday, \nSeptember 26, 1996, indicated that the mandates of this conference \nreport will:\n\n     impose new unfunded mandates on State and local governments \n     regarding deeming requirements for determining immigrant \n     eligibility for all Federal means-tested programs. These \n     provisions create new unfunded Federal mandates, defying the \n     intent of the S. 1, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.\n       This bill requires States to deem many immigrants currently \n     residing in the United States who do not have enforceable \n     affidavits of support. These requirements will place an \n     excessive administrative burden on States by shifting massive \n     costs to State budgets. As we have consistently stated on \n     numerous issues, if the Federal Government expects States to \n     administer Federal programs related to Federal \n     responsibilities, full Federal funding must be provided.\n\n  What are some examples of this massive shift? Let me use the example \nof my own home State of Florida.\n  For professional and driver's licenses, the State of Florida \nestimates that it will cost approximately $31 million to verify and \nrecertify 13.7 million driver and professional licenses. This figure \ndoes not include State administration and initiation costs, nor does \nthe figure include the amount it will cost to verify new applications \nfor these licenses. This is just the cost to verify those that are \nalready outstanding.\n  Occupational licenses: To determine eligibility for occupational \nlicenses based on immigration status, it is estimated that $16 million \nannually will be passed on to the small businesses of my State of \nFlorida.\n  AIDS patients: Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami alone cares for \nbetween 1,500 and 2,000 noncitizen AIDS patients annually. The \nestimated cost to treat noncitizen AIDS patients for this one hospital \nwill be at least $4 million a year.\n  Mr. President, in summary, this conference report violates basic \nconcepts of fairness and adds new and, in many cases, retroactive \nrestrictions on legal immigrants. It imposes cost shifts to local and \nState governmental agencies in order to comply with its unfunded \nmandates. It violates the legislation which we passed and which we have \ntaken great pride in: The Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995.\n  If this is not an unfunded mandate, what could be an unfunded \nmandate?\n  As currently drafted, the conference report would have the following \nnegative consequences: It shifts costs to States, local governments, \nand hospitals; it imposes an administrative unfunded mandate on State \nMedicaid programs; and it is not cost effective.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nimmediately after my remarks a series of documents, including letters \nfrom the National Association of Counties, from the National Conference \nof State Legislatures, editorials which have appeared criticizing \nsections of this immigration conference report, and a letter from the \nGovernor of Florida outlining the impact that this will have on our \nState.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, for the reasons stated, I urge that this \nSenate, before it takes up at this late hour important legislation \nwhich will have the kind of far-reaching effect that this immigration \nbill will have, that we consider carefully the impact that this is \ngoing to have on the States and communities that we represent.\n  I urge that we either delete those provisions from this conference \nreport or that the conference report be rejected.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back the remainder of \nhis time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                         NACo National Association\n\n\n                                                  of Counties,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 26, 1996.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I am writing to urge you to exclude \n     from the conference agreement on immigration (H.R. 2202) \n     provisions that mandate new federal requirements for \n     certificates and drivers licenses, and adds new deeming \n     requirements to determine immigrant eligibility for federal \n     means tested programs. The National Association of Counties \n     (NACo) considers these provisions to be unfunded mandates as \n     a well as a preemption of local authority. While NACo shares \n     the goal of solving the problems posed by illegal \n     immigration, we urge you to oppose the bill if these \n     provisions are not deleted from the conference report.\n       Although the birth certificate and drivers' license \n     provisions have improved somewhat by extending the \n     implementation date and making a general reference to federal \n     grant funds, these changes are minimal. Extending the \n     implementation date may avoid the Unfunded Mandates Reform \n     Act threshold of $50 million a year, but it masks the fact \n     that county and state governments will still have to bear the \n     brunt of these expenses. Additionally, these are documents \n     that fall clearly under the jurisdiction of state and local \n     governments. Mandating federal standards on these documents \n     preempts state and local authority and is a hardship on \n     citizens and noncitizens alike.\n       The deeming requirements in the conference agreement go \n     beyond the stringent requirements in the Personal \n     Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n     1996 (P.L. 104-193). This law already made the affidavits of \n     support enforceable and extended deeming to federal means \n     tested programs for immigrants with new affidavits of \n     support. The conference agreement, however, would also \n     applying deeming to current legal residents who do not have \n     enforceable affidavits of support. By making this retroactive \n     change, the bill places additional administrative burdens on \n     counties and shifts more costs from the federal programs to \n     county general assistance programs.\n       NACo appreciates your consideration of these issues. We \n     urge you again to removed these provisions from the \n     conference agreement, or vote against the legislation if they \n     continue to be included.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Larry Naake,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            National Conference of\n\n\n                                           State Legislatures,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 26, 1996.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the National Conference \n     of State Legislatures, we again urge you to exclude from the \n     conference agreement on immigration legislation, H.R. 2202, \n     provisions that (1) federalize the current state and local \n     driver's license and birth certificate issuance process and \n     establish federal document content standards for both, and \n     (2) impose new unfunded mandates on state and local \n     governments regarding deeming requirements for determining \n     immigrant eligibility for all federal ``means-tested'' \n     programs. These provisions create new unfunded federal \n     mandates, defying the intent of S. 1, the Unfunded Mandates \n     Reform Act. They unnecessarily preempt traditional state \n     auhtority. The provisions also create a ``one size fits all'' \n     administrative process, contradicting the entire spirit of \n     devolution. Furthermore, NCSL believes that these provisions \n     will create an identification nightmare for citizens and \n     legal immigrants. We share with you the goal of managing and \n     resolving issues regarding illegal immigration. However, \n     should these provisions remain in the conference report, NCSL \n     urges you to to oppose the bill.\n       We have noted in previous communications that \n     federalization of the driver's license and birth certificate \n     processes is unnecessary, inappropriate and a misguided \n     intrusion into a traditional state and local government \n     responsibility. The conference agreement does improve on \n     language from S. 1660, allowing states to be exempted from \n     using Social Security Numbers on driver's licenses if they \n     satisfy certain federal requirements, moving the \n     implementation date to the year 2000, and alluding to some \n     federal grant funds that may be available to help states pay \n     for the new mandates. However, these are minimal changes at \n     best. We see no compelling public policy reason for the \n     federal government to strip states of their authority \n     regarding driver's licenses and birth certificates nor to \n     endorse an identification mechanism fraught with potential \n     for fraud and abuse. The bill still places enormous unfunded \n     federal mandates on state and local governments.\n       The deeming requirements in the immigration reform \n     legislation go well beyond those in the recently enacted \n     welfare reform legislation. The welfare reform law already \n     makes new affidavits of support legally enforceable and \n     extends deeming requirements to all federal means-tested \n     programs for sponsored immigrants with the new affidavits. \n     This bill requires states to deem many immigrants currently \n     residing in the U.S. who do not have enforceable affidavits \n     of support. These requirements will place an excessive \n     administrative burden on states and shift massive costs to \n     state budgets. As we have consistently stated on numerous \n     issues, if the federal government expects states to \n     administer federal programs related to federal \n     responsibilities, full federal funding must be provided.\n       We appreciate your consideration of our positions. We urge \n     you again to exclude the\n\n[[Page S11518]]\n\n     aforementioned provisions from any conference report or \n     oppose the report should they be included.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 William T. Pound,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                   The Governor of\n\n\n                                         the State of Florida,\n\n                                               September 23, 1996.\n     Hon. Bill McCollum,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bill: I'm pleased to hear that you and Clay Shaw are \n     conferees on the comprehensive immigration bill (H.R. 2202) \n     as immigration policy certainly continues to be of major \n     importance to Floridians.\n       We've previously discussed my opposition to provisions \n     which deny critical assistance to legal tax paying residents \n     of this country who have come here through the legal process \n     and have been law abiding members of our society. As you're \n     well aware, I have been particularly concerned about these \n     provisions and their impact on our Cuban community and am \n     still hopeful that Cuban/Haitian entrants will continue to be \n     given access to all programs as they were under Fascell/\n     Stone. The fiscal impact of the new restrictions on our State \n     and local governments is still being assessed but will \n     obviously be an additional burden.\n       However, I want to comment on what I see as major conflicts \n     and discrepancies in this conference version language. It \n     appears that the language of H.R. 2202 prohibiting any public \n     benefit to certain legal immigrants is even more restrictive \n     than the new welfare law which as a significant impact on \n     Florida and other states with large immigrant populations.\n       It has been over month since the President signed the \n     welfare bill into law. In those weeks, Florida has moved \n     aggressively forward in preparing its state plan and has \n     submitted it to HHS in order to begin implementation by \n     October 1. We have made every effort to provide for a \n     reasonable transition to allow affected families to explore \n     their options and make other arrangements for future needs. \n     Further sweeping restrictions for legal immigrants will \n     require more alterations in administrative processes and will \n     certainly complicate and frustrate an orderly implementation \n     of the law and create disruption in medical care, children's \n     services and other programs in our State.\n       I certainly understand and appreciate some of the \n     enforcement provisions of the bill which are directed at \n     controlling immigration. As you know, Florida has recently \n     entered into a unique partnership with the federal government \n     to combat illegal immigration--the Florida Immigration \n     Initiative--and continues to strive to assist where the State \n     has a role in controlling our borders.\n       It is my hope that you and the other conferees will focus \n     on these enforcement tools and delete the provisions \n     restricting assistance to legal immigrants in light of the \n     welfare reform restrictions which are already being \n     interpreted and acted upon in many instances.\n       I appreciate your continued attention to our concerns in \n     Florida. Please call on me if I can be of any assistance to \n     your efforts.\n       With best regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n     Lawton Chiles.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                       Stop the Immigration Bill\n\n                         (By The Miami-Herald)\n\n       Republicans in Congress eliminated one of the more onerous \n     provisions of the immigration bill yesterday. Resisting \n     pressure from presidential hopeful Bob Dole, they struck out \n     language that would have kept the children of illegal \n     immigrants out of public schools.\n       It was a wise and humane move, but not nearly wise nor \n     humane enough: The deletion simply turned a terrible, mean-\n     spirited bill into a very bad one.\n       It is every country's duty to control its borders and to \n     insist on orderly immigration, but this bill oversteps duty. \n     Its most xeonophobic provisions subvert cherished American \n     traditions, including the offer of asylum to the persecuted \n     and the guarantee of equal rights to all.\n       The bill would summarily--without meaningful access to \n     counsel--exclude asylum seekers who arrive in the United \n     States undocumented. This is heartless. It also violates our \n     international obligations, established by treaty, regarding \n     refugees.\n       Men and women fleeing oppression are often forced to seize \n     the moment. They don't have the leisure to gather visas and \n     passports. They arrive fearful and scared; often they are \n     unable to speak English well enough to make their plight \n     understood. The United States takes in a tiny share of the \n     men and women who ask for asylum across the world. Last year, \n     it amounted to less than 1 percent of asylum seekers. We can \n     afford to help them, and we should be glad to do it.\n       The reunification of families divided by legal immigration \n     would also be encumbered by the bill, which requires \n     sponsors--to have incomes significantly higher than present \n     law demands.\n       In addition, the bill goes well beyond the recently enacted \n     welfare reform legislation in limiting the access that legal \n     immigrants have to government programs. For example:\n       Legal immigrants would be deported if they receive certain \n     types of government assistance--child care and housing among \n     them--for more than 12 months during their first seven years \n     in the United States.\n       After a year in the United States, people who have been \n     paroled and who are not yet legal residents--would become \n     ineligible for means-tested assistance, as well as for \n     grants, professional or commercial licenses, even driver's \n     licenses.\n       These provisions make the immigration bill unacceptable. It \n     deserves a veto. President Clinton should not try to wash his \n     hands of responsibility, as he did with the most Draconian \n     elements of last summer's welfare reform. That bill was not \n     perfect, he essentially said then, but it was the best we \n     could.\n       The immigration reform is certainly not the best we can do, \n     and we should not settle for it.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                          Immigration Politics\n\n       In an effort to salvage the illegal immigration reform \n     bill, congressional Republicans finally backed off their plan \n     to penalize the school children of illegal immigrants--and \n     bucked Bob Dole, their presidential candidate, in the \n     process. Unfortunately, the bill they struggled to save is \n     still a severely flawed piece of work.\n       Though the proposal to allow states to deny public \n     education to illegal immigrants was a cornerstone of the \n     House-passed version, it faced a Senate filibuster and a \n     presidential veto. Anxious to save both face and the \n     remainder of the bill, Republicans agreed to uncouple the \n     education proposal from the rest of the bill and vote \n     separately on each.\n       Dole belatedly endorsed the move in a letter to conferees. \n     But earlier this month, he tried to strong-arm his former \n     colleagues into retaining the controversial amendment in an \n     attempt to torpedo the immigration reform bill--one he had \n     supported when he was in the Senate--to keep Clinton from \n     scoring political points. That's not just hard-ball. That's \n     irresponsible. Congressional Republicans deserve some credit \n     for defying Dole, even if they acted out of political self-\n     interest. The Republicans want to take an immigration bill, \n     even a watered-down one, back home to their constituents \n     before election time.\n       Though improved, the bill has other problems which still \n     merit that presidential veto. The conference report gives \n     virtually unchecked authority to the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service to turn away immigrants, with false \n     papers or none, who seek asylum from genocide, political \n     death squads or other forms of persecution. Though the \n     conferees softened this summary exclusion procedure by \n     inserting a meager administrative review, that is still not \n     sufficient. Also included are restrictions on benefits to \n     legal immigrants more onerous than those contained in the new \n     welfare bill. These defects overshadow the bill's \n     constructive provisions, such as a doubling of the number of \n     Border Patrol officers.\n       The Clinton administration has voiced tepid concern and has \n     so far withheld its promise of support. But undoubtedly eager \n     to claim victory himself, Clinton cannot be counted on to \n     veto the bill even with these glaring problems. On illegal \n     immigration reform, like welfare, he might not be that far \n     behind Dole on the pander meter.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Immigrant Bashing\n\n       Congress is waging its usual election-year war on \n     immigrants. Although we suspect, in this case, the real \n     target of the new immigration ``reform'' bill making its way \n     through Congress is Bill Clinton.\n       Yes, Republicans have stripped from the bill--in the face \n     of a Clinton veto threat--a provision that would allow states \n     to throw the children of illegal immigrants out of school, \n     presumably to run wild and ignorant in the streets.\n       But the measure that remains is still far too punitive in \n     its treatment of both legal and illegal immigrants, too \n     lenient on U.S. employers who hire illegals and too willing \n     to grant the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service \n     chilling new authority.\n       This week, legal immigrants around the nation were being \n     told that they are no longer eligible for food stamps, thanks \n     to the recently enacted welfare reform bill. The anti-\n     immigrant measure would continue that trend of denying legal \n     immigrants public assistance when they are in trouble. These \n     are people who have permission to be here, who hold down jobs \n     when they can get them and who pay taxes and otherwise \n     support the economy.\n       One particularly mean-spirited provision, for instance, \n     would even deny legal immigrants Medicaid assistance for the \n     treatment of AIDS or HIV-related illnesses. Let them suffer, \n     chortle the bashers in Congress.\n       And what about unscrupulous employers who hire illegal \n     immigrants for slave wages, thus encouraging still more \n     undocumented aliens to flock to this country? Congress \n     couldn't be bothered to crack down too hard on such \n     practices. Tougher penalties for such practices were deleted \n     from the bill.\n       One of the most ominous provisions of the bill would grant \n     an unprecedented degree of autonomy to the INS. Under the \n     measure, no court, other than the U.S. Supreme Court, would \n     be authorized to grant injunctions against that police agency \n     when it acts in a legally questionable manner. That's an \n     immunity not afforded the IRS, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement \n     Agency or any other federal police force. Giving it to the \n     INS would constitute a frightening precedent.\n\n[[Page S11519]]\n\n       The bill isn't all bad. It authorizes a much-needed \n     increase in the size of the U.S. Border Patrol. It would \n     establish new, more efficient procedures for verifying the \n     status of legal immigrants. It would provide tougher \n     penalties for document fraud and for those who smuggle aliens \n     into the country.\n       But there are so many harsh, immigrant-bashing provisions \n     in the bill that, on balance, it deserves a veto. This is an \n     issue that cries out for resolution after the election--when \n     lawmakers are less inclined to use the immigration issue as a \n     political football.\n       If President Clinton vetoes the measure, Republicans are \n     sure to paint him as ``soft'' on illegal immigrants. Indeed, \n     Bob Dole is already hitting on that very theme because of the \n     president's unwillingness to purge the classrooms of the \n     children of illegal aliens.\n       But as a matter of principle, Clinton should stand up to \n     the Republicans this time and refuse to participate in their \n     immigrant-bashing.\n       This is another case where politics makes for bad public \n     policy.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                      A Dangerous Immigration Bill\n\n                      (New York Times, Editorial)\n\n       As the White House and members of Congress make final \n     decisions this week about a severely flawed immigration bill, \n     they seem more concerned with protecting their political \n     interests than the national interest. The bill should be \n     killed.\n       Debate over the bill has concentrated on whether it should \n     contain a punitive amendment that would close school doors to \n     illegal-immigrant children. But even without that provision, \n     it is filled with measures that would harm American workers \n     and legal immigrants, and deny basic legal protections to all \n     kinds of immigrants. At the same time, the bill contains no \n     serious steps to prevent illegal immigrants from taking \n     American jobs.\n       Its most dangerous provisions would block Federal courts \n     from reviewing many Immigration and Naturalization Service \n     actions. This would remove the only meaningful check on the \n     I.N.S., an agency with a history of abuse. Under the bill, \n     every court short of the Supreme Court would be effectively \n     stripped of the power to issue injunctions against the I.N.S. \n     when its decisions may violate the law or the Constitution.\n       Injunctions have proven the only way to correct system-wide \n     illegalities. A court injunction, for instance, forced the \n     I.N.S. to drop its discriminatory policy of denying Haitian \n     refugees the chance to seek political asylum.\n       On an individual level, legal immigrants convicted of minor \n     crimes would be deported with no judicial review. If they \n     apply for naturalization, they would be deported with no \n     judicial review. If they apply for naturalization, they would \n     be deported for such crimes committed in the past. The I.N.S. \n     would gain the power to pick up people it believes are \n     illegal aliens anywhere, and deport them without a court \n     review if they have been here for less than two years.\n       The bill would also diminish America's tradition of \n     providing asylum to the persecuted. Illegal immigrants \n     entering the country, who may not speak English or be \n     familiar with American law, would be summarily deported if \n     they do not immediately request asylum or express fear of \n     persecution. Those who do would have to prove that their fear \n     was credible--a tougher standard than is internationally \n     accepted--to an I.N.S. official on the spot, with no right to \n     an interpreter or attorney.\n       Scam artists with concocted stories would be more likely to \n     pass the test than the genuinely persecuted, who are often \n     afraid of authority and so traumatized they cannot recount \n     their experiences. Applicants would have a week to appeal to \n     a Justice Department administrative judge but no access to \n     real courts before deportation.\n       The bill would also go further than the recently adopted \n     welfare law in attacking legal immigrants. Under the \n     immigration bill they could be deported for using almost any \n     form of public assistance for a year, including English \n     classes. It would make family reunification more difficult by \n     requiring high incomes for sponsors of new immigrants. The \n     bill would also require workers who claim job discrimination \n     to prove that an employer intended to discriminate, which is \n     nearly impossible.\n       A bill that grants so many unrestricted powers to the \n     Government should alarm Republicans as well as Democrats. \n     This is not an immigration bill but an immigrant-bashing \n     bill. It deserves a quick demise.\n\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we do have a very important piece of \nlegislation that has been in the making for quite some time. I know \nSenators on both sides of the aisle are very interested in it and have \nbeen working on it in committee and in conference. This is the water \nresources conference report.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of the conference report to accompany S. 640.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the House to the bill (S. 640) \n     to provide for the conservation and development of water and \n     related resources, to authorize the Secretary of the Army to \n     construct various projects for improvements to rivers and \n     harbors of the United States, and for other purposes, having \n     met, after full and free conference, have agreed to recommend \n     and do recommend to their respective Houses this report, \n     signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of September 25, 1996.)\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider the \nconference report to accompany S. 640, the Water Resources Development \nAct of 1996. This measure, similar to water resources legislation \nenacted in 1986, 1988, 1990, and 1992, is comprised of water resources \nproject and study authorizations, as well as important policy \ninitiatives, for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works Program.\n  S. 640 was introduced on March 28, 1995, and was reported by the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee to the full Senate on November \n9, 1995. The measure was adopted unanimously by the Senate on July 11, \n1996. On July 30 of this year, the House of Representatives adopted its \nversion of the legislation.\n  Since that time, we have worked together with our colleagues from the \nHouse of Representatives and the administration to reach bipartisan \nagreement on a sensible compromise measure. Because of the numerous \ndifferences between the Senate- and House-passed bills, completion of \nthis conference report has required countless hours of negotiation.\n  To ensure that the items contained in this legislation are responsive \nto the Nation's most pressing water infrastructure and environmental \nneeds, we have adhered to a set of criteria established in previous \nwater resources law. Mr. President, let me take a few moments here to \ndiscuss these criteria--that is--the criteria used by the conference \ncommittee to determine the merit of proposed projects, project studies, \nand policy directives.\n  On November 17, 1986, almost 10 years ago, under President Reagan, we \nenacted the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. Importantly, the \n1986 act marked an end to the 16-year deadlock between Congress and the \nexecutive branch regarding authorization of the Army Corps Civil Works \nProgram.\n  In addition to authorizing numerous projects, the 1986 act resolved \nlongstanding disputes relating to cost-sharing between the Army Corps \nand non-Federal sponsors, waterway user fees, environmental \nrequirements and, importantly, the types of projects in which Federal \ninvolvement is appropriate and warranted.\n  The criteria used to develop the legislation before us are consistent \nwith the reforms and procedures established in the landmark Water \nResources Development Act of 1986.\n  Is a project for flood control, navigation, environmental \nrestoration, or some other purpose cost-shared in a manner consistent \nwith the 1986 act?\n  Have all of the requisite reports and studies on economic, \nengineering, and environmental feasibility been completed for major \nprojects?\n  Are the projects and policy initiatives consistent with the \ntraditional and appropriate mission of the Army Corps?\n  Should the Federal Government be involved?\n  These, Mr. President, are the fundamental questions that we have \napplied to the provisions contained in the pending conference report.\n  As I noted at the outset, water resources legislation has been \nenacted on a biennial basis since 1986, with the exception of 1994. As \nsuch, we have a 4-year backlog of projects reviewed by the Army Corps \nand submitted to Congress for authorization.\n  The measure before us authorizes 33 flood control, environmental \nrestoration, inland navigation, and harbor projects which have received \na favorable report by the Chief of Engineers.\n\n[[Page S11520]]\n\n Fourteen other water resources projects are included for \nauthorization, contingent upon the Congress receiving a favorable \nChief's report by December 31 of this year. The estimated Federal cost \nof this bill is $3.8 billion.\n  I would like to note that almost one-fourth of the cost of this bill, \nor an estimated $890 million, is specifically dedicated to \nenvironmental restoration and protection. In terms of projects, \nprograms and policies, this is far and away the most environmentally \nsignificant Water Resources Development Act to have been assembled by \nthe Congress.\n  What are some of the important new policy and program initiatives \nincluded in the bill? First, we have included a provision proposed by \nthe administration to clarify the cost-sharing for dredged material \ndisposal associated with the operation and maintenance of harbors.\n  Currently, Federal and non-Federal responsibilities for construction \nof dredged material disposal facilities vary from project to project, \ndepending on when the project was authorized, and the method or site \nselected for disposal.\n  For some projects, the costs of providing dredged material disposal \nfacilities are all Federal. For others, the non-Federal sponsor bears \nthe entire cost of constructing disposal facilities. This arrangement \nis inequitable for numerous ports.\n  In addition, the failure to identify economically and environmentally \nacceptable disposal options has reduced operations and increased cargo \ncosts in many port cities. Regrettably, this is the case for the Port \nof Providence in Rhode Island.\n  Under this bill, the costs of constructing dredged material disposal \nfacilities will be shared in accordance with the cost-sharing formulas \nestablished for general navigation features by section 101(a) of the \n1986 Water Resources Development Act. This would apply to all methods \nof dredged material disposal including open water, upland and confined. \nThis provision will allow ports like the one in Providence to compete \non an equal footing.\n  We have also expanded section 1135 of the 1986 act in this bill. \nCurrently, section 1135 authorizes the Secretary of the Army to review \nthe structure and operation of existing projects for possible \nmodifications--at the project itself--which will improve the quality of \nthe environment. The 1986 act authorizes a $5 million Federal cost-\nsharing cap for each such project and a $25 million annual cap for the \nentire program.\n  The revision included here does not increase the existing dollar \nlimits. Instead, it authorizes the Secretary to implement small fish \nand wildlife habitat restoration projects in cooperation with non-\nFederal interests in those situations where mitigation is required off \nof project lands.\n  Third, we have included a provision to shift certain dam safety \nresponsibilities from the Army Corps to the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency [FEMA]. This change, proposed by Senator Bond and \nsupported by the two agencies, authorizes a total of $22 million over 5 \nyears for FEMA to conduct dam safety inspections and to provide \ntechnical assistance to the States.\n  Next, a provision has been included to address the administration's \nproposal to discontinue Army Corps involvement in shore protection \nprojects. The provision directs continued beach and shoreline \nprotection, restoration and renourishment activities which are \neconomically justified. I want to credit Senators Mack and Bradley, in \nparticular, for their efforts on this matter.\n  Mr. President, this legislation includes landmark Everglades \nrestoration provisions. On June 11 of this year, the administration \nsubmitted its plan to restore and protect the Everglades.\n  The conferees have worked closely with the Florida delegation to \nmodify and improve the administration's proposal to reverse damage done \nto this critical natural resource.\n  The provision we have agreed to would: expedite the Corps study \nprocess for future restoration activities; formally establish the South \nFlorida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force; authorize $75 million for the \nimplementation of critical projects through fiscal year 1999; and \nauthorize important modifications to the existing Canal-51 and Canal-\n111 projects.\n  Mr. President, I would like to highlight an important cost-sharing \nreform made necessary by current budget circumstances. The non-Federal \nshare for flood control projects has been increased from the current 25 \npercent to 35 percent. The fact of the matter is that Corps of \nEngineers's construction dollars are increasingly scarce.\n\n  In order to meet the very real flood control needs across the nation, \nwe are forced to require greater participation by non-Federal project \nsponsors. Importantly, the bill also includes prudent, yet meaningful \nability-to-pay eligibility reforms for poor areas.\n  Also provided here is a pilot program to demonstrate the benefits of \nprivatizing the management of wastewater treatment plants through long-\nterm lease arrangements. Over the past 25 years, Congress has made a \nconsiderable investment in protecting water quality by working with \nStates and cities to ensure the proper treatment and disinfection of \ndomestic sewage. Federal appropriations exceeding $65 billion under the \nClean Water Act and $10 billion through the Department of Agriculture \nhave supported grants and loans for the construction of sewage \ntreatment plants.\n  But in recent years, the flow of funds from the Federal level has \nslowed while needs at the local level have increased. The most recent \nsurvey by EPA indicates that the cost to build and maintain needed \nsewage collection and treatment facilities across the country exceeds \n$130 billion. We can't close that gap with Federal tax dollars and \nlocal governments are hard-pressed to keep up.\n  One source of funds that remains virtually untapped is private \nfinancing and operation of these facilities. Although many cities are \nreceiving their drinking water from privately owned utilities, this is \na much rarer occurrence for the ownership and operation of sewage \ntreatment plants.\n  To encourage privatization, as it is sometimes called, President Bush \nissued an Executive order establishing a Federal policy for the sale of \nsewage plants now owned by cities to entities in the private sector. A \npolicy change is necessary, because the law now requires that any \nFederal assistance received to build the plant must be repaid from the \nproceeds of the sale. The Executive order requires that only the \nundepreciated value of the grant be repaid.\n  However, sales are not the only means to encourage private investment \nin these facilities. Another option is a long-term lease. This approach \nmay be more advantageous than a sale because sewage plants that remain \nin the ownership of municipal government agencies are subject to less \nstringent pollution control regulations than those that are owned by \nprivate entities.\n  There has only been one outright sale under the Executive order, but \nseveral communities including Wilmington, DE, and Cranston, RI, are \nlooking at long-term lease arrangements.\n  To encourage this approach, the conference report provides that the \nrequirement to repay grants that applies under the Clean Water Act and \nthe Executive order in the case of a sale would not apply to leases if \ntwo conditions are met. First, the municipal agency must retain \nownership of the facility.\n\n  And second, EPA must determine that the lease furthers the purposes \nand objectives of the Clean Water Act. Our principal aim here is to \nassure that privatization does not lead to disinvestment. When the \nFederal Government provided the grant to build the plant, we required \nthe city to collect rates sufficient to maintain the plant and keep it \nin good working order.\n  The law and the Executive order also require that the consumer \ncharges supporting maintenance and reinvestment be imposed in a fair \nand reasonable way. The administrator is to look to these and other \nrequirements of the Clean Water Act to ensure that privatization does \nnot undermine the purposes for which the grant and loan programs to \nfinance the construction of sewage treatment plants were first enacted.\n  Mr. President, nothing in this legislation directs EPA to approve any \nparticular lease arrangement. As I have said, the city of Cranston in \nmy home State has developed what I believe to be an excellent proposal. \nMayor Traficante is to be commended on the innovative approach that he \nis taking\n\n[[Page S11521]]\n\nto hold down the costs of municipal government for the people of his \ncity.\n  Cranston has worked closely with EPA to develop the details of its \nlease and we very much appreciate the assistance that EPA has provided. \nThere has been a question on whether Cranston would be required to \nrepay part of its grant in the event the lease is completed. This \nlegislation would answer that question, but only if EPA determines that \nlease arrangement serves the purposes and objectives of the Clean Water \nAct.\n  Again, Mr. President, in the area of environmental protection, one of \nthe most difficult water quality problems is the discharge of untreated \nsewage into rivers, lakes, and estuaries from combined sanitary and \nstormwater sewers. Sewage treatment plants are designed to handle all \nof the wastewater generated by a community during dry weather periods.\n  But for the 1,200 communities that have systems with connections \nbetween the stormwater and domestic sewage pipes, large storm events \ncan overwhelm the capacity of the treatment works and lead to \ndischarges of untreated wastewater. This problem is one of the most \nsignificant unresolved issues in water quality today.\n  We have this problem in Rhode Island. The intermittent discharges \nfrom our combined sewer overflows have led to closures of swimming \nbeaches and shellfishing beds. Rhode Island is well on the way to \ncorrecting the problem, but it will be an expensive undertaking.\n  In fact, the solution--a planned underground tunnel to hold \nstormwater runoff until it can be treated--is the biggest \npublic construction project ever planned for the State, with expected \ncosts exceeding $450 million. The bill includes an authorization of \nmodest Federal assistance to Rhode Island to solve this problem and to \npay for the water quality mandate imposed by the Federal Clean Water \nAct.\n\n  Mr. President, this legislation is vitally important for countless \nStates and communities across the country.\n  For economic and life-safety reasons, we must maintain our harbors, \nports and inland waterways, flood control levees, shorelines, and the \nenvironment.\n  Despite the fact that this package represents a 4-year backlog of \nproject authorizations, it is consistent with the overall funding \nlevels authorized in previous water resources measures. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the conference report.\n  Before I yield the floor, Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute \nto just a handful of the many individuals responsible for this \nimportant legislation. First, I would like to thank Senators Warner, \nSmith, Baucus, and Moynihan for their hard work as conferees.\n  Likewise, we could not have reached agreement this year without the \nefforts of House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman \nBud Shuster, his ranking minority member, Jim Oberstar, Representative \nSherwood Boehlert, and their excellent staff.\n  We have worked closely with the administration, Mr. President, and I \nwant to recognize the valuable input of Assistant Secretary Martin \nLancaster. Secretary Lancaster and his team, including Deputy Assistant \nSecretary Mike Davis, Jim Rausch, Gary Campbell, Milton Reider, Bill \nSchmidtz, John Anderson, Susan Bond, and others have aided us \nimmeasurably.\n  Finally, I want to thank the Senate staff who have worked so hard on \nthis bill. On Senator Baucus's staff, I extend my appreciation to Jo-\nEllen Darcy and Tom Sliter. On the Republican side, I want to thank \nstaff members Ann Loomis, Chris Russell, Steve Shimberg, Linda Jordan, \nStephanie Brewster, Dan Delich and Senate legislative counsel, Janine \nJohnson.\n  I again urge the adoption of the conference report and yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senate now has before it the \nconference report to accompany S. 640, the Water Resources Development \nAct of 1996. I would like to compliment the conferees on the fine work \nthey have done in bringing this conference report to the Senate for \nresolution before the 104th Congress adjourns.\n  A great deal of work has been done by the House and Senate \ncommittees, working together, to reach this point. Everyone involved \nhas been diligent in applying sound criteria for determining the \nworthiness of individual projects.\n  I particularly want to commend the conferees for deleting the House \nprovision that would have increased the navigation season on the \nMissouri River. The operation of the Missouri River is a controversial \nissue in my State. The Corps of Engineers is currently in the middle of \na comprehensive review to determine the best way to manage the river \nfor all interests, including recreation, navigation, irrigation, \nhydropower and water supply.\n  For Congress to intervene at this stage of the reevaluation, to \npredetermine its outcome, would have been counterproductive to a fair \nand equitable resolution of this issue. I thank the House conferees for \nreceding to the Senate on this issue.\n  There are some laudable provisions in this conference report, most \nnotably the changes in flood control policy. With tighter Federal \nbudgets, there is a growing need for local interests to become even \nmore committed to their projects. The conference report changes the \ncurrent Federal cost share for flood control projects from 75 percent \nto 65 percent.\n  It also reforms the so-called ability-to-pay provisions of current \nlaw to make them more meaningful. It requires floodplain management \nplans and the consideration of nonstructural alternatives to \ntraditional flood control facilities. Finally, the conference report \nrequires the corps, for the first time, to provide levee owners with a \nmanual describing what they must do in order to maintain a levee to \ncorps specifications.\n  Another important provision of the bill directs the Secretary to \nprovide increased emphasis on recreation opportunities at corps \nfacilities. And it recognizes the problem of funding disposal \nfacilities for dredged materials and allows that cost to be considered \nwhen calculating the overall cost of a navigation project.\n  Mr. President, while all of these provisions are important \nimprovements to current law and corps policy, I have one overriding \nconcern with this conference report and that is its cost. This bill \nauthorizes $3.8 billion in new Federal spending.\n  When the Senate considered this bill earlier this year, I voiced \nconcern that the cost of the bill at that time--$3.3 billion--was at \nodds with our efforts to balance the budget. Since that time, the cost \nof the bill has grown. I have long supported investments in our \ninfrastructure, including our water infrastructure. They are necessary \nif America is to retain its competitive advantage and keep a sound base \nof manufacturing jobs.\n  But we need to make choices about these investments, hard choices. \nAnd while the majority of the projects in this bill are worthy ones, \nthe truth is that we simply cannot afford them all at this time.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are at the end of a very long road in the \nprocess of enacting the 1996 Water Resources Development Act \nauthorizing various water resources projects to enhance flood \nprotection, navigation, environmental protection, and related Corps of \nEngineers projects. Special thanks and congratulations are in order for \nthe Chairman of the full committee, Senator Chafee and his ranking \nmember, Senator Baucus and the Subcommittee Chairman, Senator Warner. \nThey and their excellent staff have carried the difficult burden of \nsorting through in a bipartisan manner these very complex and sensitive \nissues--issues that are of vital concern to many in this country but \nparticulary for my State of Missouri.\n  For States like Missouri, who rely greatly on water resources, this \nlegislation is crucial to provide safety, economic development \nopportunities, and cost-effective navigation on our inland waterway \nsystem. Since 1928, for every dollar the corps has spent on flood \ncontrol, 8 dollars' worth of damages have been avoided. This 8 to 1 \nbenefit to cost ratio does not account for the economic development and \njob creation benefits that flood protection provides. Recent flooding \nhas highlighted the need to maintain this commitment and keep the Corps \nof Engineers engaged in partnering with Missouri citizens in this \nregard. This is a safety, jobs, and international competitiveness \nissues pure and simple.\n\n[[Page S11522]]\n\n  Again, I applaud the efforts of the chairman and urge strongly \nsupport for this bipartisan legislation.\n\n\n                    THE EpA LONG ISLAND SOUND OFFICE\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to note the critical \nimportance of this legislation, the Water Resources Development Act, to \nthe future of Connecticut's most valuable natural resource, Long Island \nSound.\n  Included in the bill is a provision reauthorizing the EPA's Long \nIsland Sound Office [LISO], which was established by legislation I was \nproud to sponsor 6 years ago, and which is now responsible for \ncoordinating the massive clean-up effort ongoing in the Sound. Quite \nsimply, the LISO is the glue holding this project together, and I want \nto express my deep appreciation to the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee--Senators Chafee and \nBaucus--for their help in making sure this office stays open for \nbusiness.\n  Mr. President, the Long Island Sound Office has been given a daunting \ntask--orchestrating a multibillion dollar, decade-long initiative that \nrequires the cooperation of nearly 150 different Federal, State and \nmunicipal agents and offices. Despite the odds, and the limited \nresources it has had to work with, the LISO is succeeding. Over the \nlast few years, the EPA office has developed strong working \nrelationships with the State environmental protection agencies in \nConnecticut and New York, local government officials along the Sound \ncoastline and a number of proactive citizen groups. Together, these \nmany partners have made tremendous progress toward meeting the six key \ngoals we identified in the Sound's long-term conservation and \nmanagement plan.\n  The plan's top priority is fighting hypoxia, which is caused by the \nrelease of nutrients into the Sound's 1,300 square miles of water. \nThanks in part to the LISO's efforts, nitrogen loads have dropped 5,000 \npounds per day from the baseline levels of 1990, exceeding all \nexpectations. In addition, all sewage treatment plants in Connecticut \nand in New York's Westchester, Suffolk, and Nassau counties are now in \ncompliance with the no net increase agreement brokered by the LISO, \nwhile the four New York City plants that discharge into the East River \nare expected to be in compliance by the end of this year. And the LISO \nis coordinating 15 different projects to retrofit treatment plants with \nnew equipment that will help them reduce the amount of nitrogen \nreaching the Sound.\n  The LISO and its many partners have made great strides in other \nareas, such as cracking down on the pathogens, toxic substances, and \nlitter that have been finding their way into the Sound watershed and \nonto area beaches. A major source of toxic substances are industrial \nplants, and over the last few years the LISO has helped arrange more \nthan 30 pollution prevention assessments at manufacturing facilities in \nConnecticut that enable companies to reduce emissions and cut their \ncosts. Also, New York City has recently reduced the amount of floatable \ndebris it produces by 70 percent, thanks to the use of booms on many \ntributaries and efforts to improve the capture of combined sewer \noverflows.\n\n  With Congress' help, the LISO will soon be able to build on that \nprogress and significantly broaden its efforts to bring the Sound back \nto life. This week the House and Senate approved an appropriation of \nthe $700,000 for the Long Island Sound Office, doubling our commitment \nfrom the current fiscal year. These additional funds will be used in \npart to launch an ambitious habitat restoration project. The States of \nNew York and Connecticut have been working with the LISO and the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service to develop a long-term strategy in this area, \nand they have already identified 150 key sites. The next step is to \nprovide grants to local partnerships with local towns and private \ngroups such as the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and The Nature \nConservancy, which would focus on restoring tidal and freshwater \nwetlands, submerged aquatic vegetation, and areas supporting anadromous \nfish populations.\n  The funding will also be used for site-specific surveys to identify \nand correct local sources of non-point source pollution. This effort \nwill focus on malfunctioning septic systems, stormwater management, and \nillegal stormwater connections, improper vessel waste disposal, and \nriparian protection. All of these sources contribute in some way to the \nrelease of pathogens and toxic compounds into the Sound, a problem that \nis restricting the use of area beaches and shellfish beds and hurting \nour regional economy.\n  Finally, the LISO will continue to build on the successful public \neducation and outreach campaign it initiated last year. In New York, \nthe LISO has already been in contact with public leaders in 50 local \ncommunities, held follow-up meetings with officials in 15 key areas, \nand scheduled on-the-water workshops for this fall. The LISO is \nplanning to conduct a similar effort to reach out to Connecticut \ncommunities in 1997.\n  All of this could have been put in jeopardy, however, if we had not \nacted to extend the LISO's authorization, which is set to expire next \nweek. The clean-up project is a team effort, with many important \ncontributors, but it would be extremely difficult for those many \npartners to work in concert and keep moving forward without the \nleadership and coordination that the LISO has supplied. So I want to \nthank my colleagues, especially my friends from Rhode Island and from \nMontana, for passing this provision before the LISO's authorization \nlapsed.\n  The people of Connecticut care deeply about the fate of the Sound, \nnot only because of its environmental importance but also because of \nits importance as one of our region's most valuable economic assets. \nWith the steps we've taken this week, we have reassured them that we \nremained committed to preserving this great natural resource, and that \nwe are not about to sell Long Island Sound short.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11519-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11522-S11527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EVERGLADES RESTORATION PROVISION\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nconference report on the Water Resources Development Act and, in \nparticular, the provision in the bill relating to the restoration of \nFlorida's Everglades. I want to especially thank the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, Mr. Chafee. The Senator from Rhode Island \nclearly understands the unique nature of the Everglades problem and, on \nbehalf of all Floridians, I extend my appreciation for his efforts on \nbehalf of this legislation.\n  It is no secret, Mr. President, that the Everglades are a resource \nunique and precious to all Americans. This ``river of grass''--\nextending from the Kissimmee chain of lakes through to Florida Bay and \nthe Florida Keys--is the primary source of south Florida's drinking \nwater, critical to our cultural heritage and essential to our continued \neconomic well-being. As the Everglades go, Mr. President, so goes south \nFlorida. How best to craft a balance between the urban, agricultural, \nand environmental interests presents one of the greatest challenges \nfacing this generation of Floridians.\n  This Congress has already demonstrated its unwavering commitment to \nthis resource by appropriating $200 million in direct funding for \nEverglades restoration during consideration of the farm bill earlier \nthis year. This move represents the single-largest funding commitment \nto the Everglades in history and is indicative of the interest this \nCongress has in ensuring that this important resource is passed on to \nfuture generations.\n  It has not always been so. In an effort to provide flood control for \nthe rapidly-growing region, Congress in 1948 authorized the massive \ncentral and southern Florida project. The goal of this effort was to \ndrain the swamp through a series of canals extending from Lake \nOkeechobee to the sea. The result was thousands of acres opened to \nagriculture and development and an unprecedented economic expansion in \nthe region.\n  This was not, however, without a significant cost. The reallocation \nof water resulting from the project disrupted the natural hydroperiod \nof the Everglades. Wildlife populations plummeted and fresh water flows \nwere diminished. Critical resources like Florida Bay--a once-vibrant \nbody of water that sustained both a healthy environment and a strong \ncoastal economy--began to wither on the vine. As Florida's coastal \ncommunities felt the effect of this harm, an effort began to rethink \nthe\n\n[[Page S11523]]\n\nproject and how it relates to the new realities in south Florida.\n  In 1992, Mr. President, Congress directed the Army Corps of Engineers \nto perform a Comprehensive Review Study--restudy--of the C project \nwith an eye toward capturing the millions of acre-feet of fresh water \ncurrently being lost to tide every year and reallocating this resource \nwithin the south Florida ecosystem. This restudy presents the \nopportunity to integrate scientifically sound environmental restoration \ninto the mix of priorities in south Florida in a balanced, equitable, \nand responsible manner.\n  Due to the complexity of this task and the difficulty coming to \nconsensus on solutions, it began to appear that this restudy would last \nat least several years into the next century. This, Mr. President, was \nsimply unacceptable. The citizens and water users in south Florida have \na legitimate interest in knowing the specifics of the restoration \neffort sooner rather than later. The Congress has a legitimate interest \nin knowing how much all of this is going to cost the Federal \nGovernment. And the State of Florida--which has committed to become a \n50/50 partner with the Federal Government in this effort--has a \nlegitimate interest in knowing the size and duration of its commitment \nto Everglades restoration.\n\n  In fact, the State of Florida recognized the need for balance and \nconsensus several years ago. The Governor's Commission for a \nSustainable South Florida--an ad-hoc coalition of 46 interest groups \nand governmental entities across the spectrum in south Florida--was \ncreated to seek out restoration goals and projects which everyone \nagreed would accelerate the restoration without harming the various \nwater users. The commission recently unanimously approved a remarkable \ndocument which details 40 specific projects. This blueprint will \nincrease the pace of restoration while taking into account the water-\nrelated needs of all parties in the region. The corps has indicated \nthat if it were able to work from this consensus document, it could \ncome to closure on the restudy within 3 years.\n  Thus began, Mr. President, our efforts this year. After much \nnegotiation and effort, my colleague from Florida, Senator Graham and I \nwere able to arrive at the package we are considering today.\n  Specifically, Mr. President, the legislation before us requires the \ncorps to submit a comprehensive plan for restoration of the Everglades \nby July 1, 1999. This plan will include a list of specific projects for \nauthorization by Congress and will include the necessary engineering \nand design. Clearly, this will require a monumental effort by the corps \nas it works to complete its work by this deadline. We have been \nrepeatedly assured by the corps that it can be done without \nshortcutting necessary engineering and planning.\n  The legislation further contains $75 million in authority for the \nCorps of Engineers to construct projects deemed critical to the \nrestoration effort. The report language accompanying this bill \nindicates five projects which ought to be top priority for the corps as \nit exercises this authority. These projects are universally accepted in \nsouth Florida as projects which can be carried out within the next 3 \nyears and which will significantly accelerate the restoration effort.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, this bill establishes in law the South Florida \nEcosystem Restoration Task Force. This is an intergovernmental body \nwhich includes representatives from the Federal Government, State and \nlocal entities and the two Indian tribes present in the Everglades. The \ntask force is based largely on the successful arrangement currently \noperating in south Florida and will provide a forum for exchanging \ninformation, taking public comment and input, and coordinating the \noverall restoration effort.\n  Mr. President, we believe this package represents a significant step \nforward in the continuing effort to restore the Everglades and provide \na sustainable economy for all the residents of south Florida. I again \nexpress my sincere appreciation to Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus--\nand the Environment Committee staff--for their outstanding support and \nleadership on this effort. I urge my colleagues to support the \nconference report.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 640, the \nWater Resources Development Act of 1996 [WRDA]. Congress last passed a \nWRDA bill in 1992, and I am pleased that we are able to pass this \nlegislation that authorizes spending for many important water projects.\n  A provision in this bill authorizes the Secretary of the Army to \nacquire, from willing sellers, permanent flowage and saturation \neasements for lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of the \nBuford Trenton Irrigation District, ND. These flowage easements are to \ncompensate landowners for land that has been affected by rising ground \nwater and the risk of surface flooding due to the operation of the \nGarrison Dam on the Missouri River. The corps began operation of this \nDam in 1955.\n  In acquiring these easements, this provision specifies the Secretary \nshall pay an amount based on the unaffected fee value of the lands, \nmeaning the value of the lands as if unaffected by rising ground water \nand the risk of surface flooding. The intent of Congress is for the \nSecretary to acquire these easements based on the current fair market \nvalue of the land, and not the value of land before Garrison Dam was \noperational. I would like to submit a copy of a letter I sent to the \ncorps requesting a clarification of their intent in implementing this \nprovision, and a copy of the corps' response stating the Secretary \nshall appraise these easements at their current fair market value, as \nif the lands are not affected by rising ground water and the risk of \nsurface flooding.\n  I applaud this provision that justly compensates these landowners for \ndamage to their land from rising ground water and the risk of surface \nflooding due to the operation of the Garrison Dam.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to express my position to a \nprovision in this bill that raises the non-Federal cost-share \nrequirement for Corps of Engineers flood control projects from 25 \npercent to 35 percent. it is my understanding that this provision does \nnot apply to flood control projects that have previously been \nauthorized, or are authorized in this bill.\n  I am concerned that this provision will have a detrimental impact on \nsmaller communities in North Dakota that are in need of flood control \nprojects. I understand the motivation to save the Federal Government \nmoney by requiring local partners to contribute more to these flood \ncontrol projects. However, this provision will place a significant \nfinancial burden on communities in North Dakota that are in dire need \nof flood control projects but do not possess the resources or the tax-\nbase to raise this additional cost share.\n  Also, some communities in my State, such as Grand Forks, are \ncurrently cost-sharing feasibility studies for flood control projects \nwith the corps. These communities have committed significant funds \nbased on the fact any flood control project that resulted from the \nstudy would be cost-shared at a 75-to-25 Federal/non-Federal ratio. \nThis provision places a financial burden on communities like Grand \nForks that are currently financing feasibility studies and budgeting \nfor a cost share of 25 percent on flood control projects. It is my hope \nthe Congress would recognize the negative impact this provision has on \ncommunities like Grand Forks and allow flood control projects to be \nconstructed under the current 25 percent non-Federal cost-share, should \nthe community demonstrate an inability to meet the 35 percent cost-\nshare requirement.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank the chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, Senator Chafee, and the \nranking member of the committee, Senator Baucus, for their efforts in \ncompleting this important legislation during the 104th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two letters be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 26, 1996.\n     H. Martin Lancaster,\n     Assistant Secretary for Civil Works, Department of the Army, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Assistant Secretary Lancaster: I am writing in regard \n     to the Water Resources\n\n[[Page S11524]]\n\n     Development Act of 1996 (WRDA). I would like to know the \n     intent of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in implementing \n     Section 336 of this bill.\n       As you know, Section 336 of the conference version of the \n     WRDA bill authorizes the Secretary of the Army to acquire, \n     from willing sellers, permanent flowage and saturation \n     easements for lands within or contiguous to the boundaries of \n     the Buford Trenton Irrigation District in North Dakota. These \n     flowage easements are to compensate landowners for land that \n     has been affected by rising ground water and the risk of \n     surface flooding due to the operation of the Garrison Dam on \n     the Missouri River.\n       In acquiring these easements, this provision specifies the \n     Secretary shall pay an amount based on the unaffected fee \n     value of the lands, meaning the value of the lands as if \n     unaffected by rising ground water and the risk of surface \n     flooding. The intent of Congress is for the Secretary to \n     acquire these easements based on the current fair market \n     value of the land, as if unaffected by rising ground water \n     and the risk of surface flooding. Implementing this provision \n     as Congress intends will justly compensate these landowners \n     for damage to their land due to the operation of the Garrison \n     Dam.\n       I am requesting an assurance from the Corps that, for the \n     purpose of acquiring these flowage easements, this land will \n     be appraised at the current fair market value, as if \n     unaffected by the operation of Garrison Dam.\n       Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to \n     hearing from you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Department of the Army, Office of the Assistant \n           Secretary, Civil Works, 108 Army Pentagon,\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 1996.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: This letter is written in response to \n     your letter dated September 26, 1996, regarding the Army \n     Corps of Engineers intent in implementing Section 336 of the \n     conference version of the proposed Water Resources \n     Development Act of 1996.\n       In implementing section 336 and the acquisition of flowage \n     easements from willing sellers, the Corps shall appraise such \n     easements at their current fair market value as if the lands \n     are not affected by rising ground water and the risk of \n     surface flooding.\n       I hope this letter addresses your concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n     John H. Zirschky,\n       Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil \n     Works).\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak in \nsupport of the Water Resources and Development Act of 1996. This \nlegislation authorizes funding for a number of critical flood control \nprojects in Pennsylvania, whose need was once again demonstrated by the \ndevastating flooding that occurred in January 1996. It will provide \nessential protection to existing commercial and residential \ndevelopments, reducing losses attributable to floods, lowering flood \ninsurance, and creating opportunities for economic growth.\n  I have worked closely with Senator Santorum, as well as Chairman \nChafee, Chairman Warner, and Senator Baucus, to ensure that this \nlegislation reauthorizes the Saw Mill Run project in Pittsburgh, \nauthorizes Army Corps of Engineers funding for upgrades to the storm \nwater pumping station at the Wyoming Valley levee raising project in \nLuzerne County, and authorizes a flood control project for the Plot and \nGreen Ridge neighborhoods in Scranton.\n  The flood protection project at Saw Mill Run will alleviate flood \ndamage in the West End section of Pittsburgh, bringing relief to \nresidents who have been hard hit by overbank flooding and creating \nopportunities for economic development in the Saw Mill Run corridor. \nDuring my visit to the project site with the mayor of Pittsburgh, Tom \nMurphy, on November 21, 1995, he and I discussed the city's commitment \nto protecting its vulnerable riverside communities and to providing the \ncity's share of the development funds. I am pleased that this project \ncan go forward and that we were able to secure $500,000 for \nconstruction-related costs in the fiscal year 1997 energy and water \nappropriations legislation.\n  The Wyoming Valley levee raising project is necessary to the \ncompletion of the flood control project of 1986, so that the families \nand businesses of Wyoming Valley will not have to withstand the \ndevastation of flooding as they did in 1972 from Tropical Storm Agnes. \nThis January's flooding forced more than 100,000 people to evacuate \ntheir homes and businesses and resulted in President Clinton's \ndeclaring it a disaster area. Such a flood control project is vitally \nimportant to the affected communities along the Lackawanna River and is \ndeserving of significant attention from the Congress. This February, \nthe corps approved the General Design Memorandum and has begun to \ndevelop the mitigation measures for the downstream communities. This \nlegislation incorporates an amendment offered on my behalf in the \nSenate managers' amendments which directs the corps to take \nresponsibility for funding the upgrades to the storm water pumping \nstations.\n  Finally, I have worked closely with Senator Santorum, Congressman \nJoseph McDade, Chairman Chafee, and Scranton Mayor Jim Connors on \nlegislation authorizing the modification of the ongoing project for \nflood control along the Lackawanna River in Scranton to include the \nDiamond Plot and Green Ridge neighborhoods. These neighborhoods have \nbeen consistently damaged by flooding, including in 1985, 1986, 1993, \nand 1996. On March 11, 1996, I convened a meeting in the city council \nchambers so Federal, State, and local officials, the Army Corps, and \nresidents could discuss the potential for a Federal flood control \nproject. I came away from that meeting even more impressed with the \nneed for the Federal Government to respond with a substantial flood \ncontrol effort to protect the lives and property of the residents.\n  The conference report authorizes the flood control project in the \nPlot and Green Ridge areas, with the cost-sharing element to be worked \nout between the Army Corps of Engineers and the city of Scranton. This \nis a creative solution to a difficult problem and I am hopeful that the \ncity and the Commonwealth will work together to develop a strategy for \nproviding the non-Federal share of the project costs. It is worth \nnoting that the fiscal year 1997 energy and water appropriations bill \ncontains $600,000 for initial planning and design work of the Plot/\nGreen Ridge projects, which means that additional time will not be lost \non protecting the residents of those areas.\n  Mr. President, thousands of families and businesses in Pennsylvania \nwere adversely affected by in this January's floods, and one of my \npriorities has been that Congress respond with sufficient funding for \njustified Army Corps projects. I remain concerned with the time it \ntakes to make progress on various corps projects in Pennsylvania and \nwill continue to explore ways to streamline the construction process. \nIn the meantime, this legislation allows much-needed flood control \nprojects to go forward and thus deserves our support.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am pleased today to support the \nWater Resources Development Act of 1996 and I would like to \ncongratulate the conferees of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee for their fine work supporting the Senate's position on this \nbill.\n  I also want to thank the conferees for supporting my amendments to \nthat bill. Specifically, the committee supported research and \ndevelopment programs to improve salmon survival and supporting the \ncontinuing presence of the dredge fleet in the Columbia River.\n  By now everyone in the country knows the immense challenges we in the \nNorthwest face concerning salmon survival in the Columbia and Snake \nRivers. The puzzle of salmon survival is a complex one which has its \nroots in not only the water projects on the Columbia and Snake Rivers \nbut also on the coasts and in the open ocean. Although a great deal of \nmoney has been spent on salmon survival, I was surprised in hearings \nbefore the Drinking Water, Fisheries and Wildlife Subcommittee that \nsometimes basic research into salmon survival is either not done or \nwaits until adaptive management techniques are implemented.\n  The intent of my amendment was to ensure that basic research into \nmarine mammal predation, spawning and rearing areas, estuary and near \nocean survival, salmon passage, light and sound guidance of salmon, \nsurface collection, transportation, dissolved gas monitoring, and other \ninnovative techniques to improve fish survival does not have to wait \nuntil an adaptive management experiment is initiated.\n\n[[Page S11525]]\n\nAdaptive management should be a response to sound science not a \nsubstitute for it. A $10 million authorization is provided for this \nresearch.\n  The amendment would also ensure a continuing authorization for \nadvanced turbine development. One of the most overlooked sources of \nrenewable energy in the Nation's energy arsenal is hydroelectric power. \nNew research into turbine design has been for the most part overlooked. \nWith the environmentally and fish friendly turbine design research \nauthorized by this bill we can ensure that innovative, efficient, and \nenvironmentally safe hydropower turbines will be providing us with the \nnext generation of power into the 21st century. A $12 million \nauthorization is provided for this research.\n  Finally, the Water Resources Development Act includes language which \nensures the continued presence of Army Corps of Engineers hopper \ndredges in the Pacific Northwest. I thank the conferees and Chairman \nChafee for including language in the bill which directs the Secretary \nto not reduce the availability or utilization of Federal hopper dredge \nvessels on the Pacific coast below 1996 levels. I appreciate the \nconferees working closely with me to develop language that would ensure \nthat the necessary resources remain available to keep the Columbia \nRiver channel open to commerce of up river cities, including Idaho's \ninland port of Lewiston.\n  I wholeheartedly support this legislation and I thank the conferees \nfor their consideration of my concerns.\n\n\n             WHITE RIVER BASIN LAKES, ARKANSAS AND MISSOURI\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, section 304 of this legislation includes \n``recreation and fish and wildlife mitigation'' as purposes of the \nWhite River Basin Lakes project approved June 28, 1938 (52 Stat. \n1218.). There are some in my State who have voiced strong concern that \nthis provision may impact adversely the currently authorized project \npurposes of flood control, power generation, and other purposes. They \nfear that the outcome may be loss in generation capacity or energy \nproduction which would increase the costs to ratepayers and adversely \naffect the region's citizens.\n  The Senate language, however, explicitly authorizes these new \npurposes ``to the extent that the purposes do not adversely impact \nflood control, power generation, or other authorized purposes of the \nproject.'' Is it the intent of the Senators from Arkansas, who \nsponsored this provision, that this provision forbids any adverse \nimpacts on currently authorized projects?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator from Missouri is correct. We drafted this \nlanguage to explicitly preclude adverse impacts to flood control, power \ngeneration, and the other project purposes. It is the clear intent of \nthis legislation to recognize the contribution of tourism and \nrecreation to the economies of our respective States and to take such \nactions as may be proper to protect that contribution. It is equally \nclear that such action can occur only as long as the primary project \npurposes, previously established by law and practical application of \nthat law, are fully protected.\n  It should be remembered that prudent use of our Nation's water \nresources is not limited to a few specific purposes that are mutually \nexclusive of one another. In addition, we must also recognize that, at \ntimes, the establishment and protection of priorities are also proper \nelements of public policy. Such is the case here. It is true that the \ntourism and recreation industries have grown beyond the expectations of \nanyone associated with the original construction of flood control and \npower generation facilities along the White River. However, this does \nnot mean that our continuing support for flood control and efficient \npower generation has diminished in any degree.\n  I have long been one of the strongest supporters in the U.S. Senate \nof hydro-electric power generation. It is one of the most efficient and \nenvironmentally based sources available to our ever-growing demand for \nenergy. Reasonable electric rates are critical to economic development \nand a comfortable standard of living for our people. I understand the \nconcerns of those involved with power generation along the White River \nthat the inclusion of recreation as a project purpose may somehow \nimpair their access to an efficient and affordable energy source. Let \nme clearly state that these concerns are totally unnecessary.\n  The provision before us plainly prohibits any adverse impact to power \ngeneration. We clearly recognize the customary practices employed by \nthe Corps of Engineers and power generators along the White River which \nhave achieved proper resource conservation, energy output, and \nratepayer equity. In no way should those practices be impaired or \nrestricted by this provision. Instead, we have made certain that power \ngeneration, along with flood control and other prior purposes and \npractices, will remain intact.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Arkansas to \nexpress thanks to the Committee on Environment and Public Works for \nincluding the language in section 304 of the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act relating to the project purposes of the White River \nBasin Lakes in Missouri and Arkansas. This is a significant development \nfor the tourism and recreation industries in our States.\n  In Arkansas, tourism has become the second leading industry, directly \nbehind agriculture, in terms of its impact on State and local \neconomies. Nowhere is it felt more strongly than in the White River \nBasin. And it is not just the local economies that feel the impact. The \ntax revenues generated return to the Federal treasury an amount far \nexceeding the Federal investment.\n  The White River Basin Lakes were authorized during an era when our \nNation's needs and economies were quite different from today. While \nthe Congresses of the 1940's were visionary and accomplished many \npositive things for our Nation in terms of flood control, and later \npower generation, it would have been impossible for them to imagine the \ndevelopment of tourist industries, such as Branson, MO, that would be \naffected by these lakes. It would have been impossible to know that \nmillions of visitors each year would spend untold millions of dollars \non recreation related goods and services.\n\n  I am aware of the concerns of power suppliers in both States who \nworry that this language will somehow subordinate power generation at \nthese dams to recreation interests. Mr. President, as we read this \nlanguage, it is absolutely clear that flood control and power \ngeneration will not be adversely affected by any actions that this \nlegislation authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to undertake. This \nlanguage simply grants a place at the table to recreation, tourism and \nfish and wildlife interests. It allows the Corps of Engineers to \nconsider impacts on these interests when making decisions about the \nmanagement and operation of these lakes. This is long overdue.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I too am concerned that this language not adversely \nimpact flood control, power generation capacity, energy production, \nFederal revenues or other authorized purposes. Has the Senator from \nArkansas been in contact with the Corps of Engineers to this regard?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. My office has contacted representatives of the Corps of \nEngineers and they share our interpretation that this provision, as \ndrafted, cannot adversely impact ratepayers. As stated by my colleague \nfrom Arkansas, we have no intention that this provision will raise \nrates, affect energy production or federal revenues or any other \nproject purposes currently authorized. Conversely, it is our strong \nview that there are measures that can be taken to assist the tourism \nand fish and wildlife interests that do not impact adversely the \nexisting project purposes. It is not our intention to have this \nprovision result in loss of generation capacity or increase exposure to \nratepayers. It was for this reason that we drafted the language in such \nan explicit manner.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, is it the interpretation of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Committee that the clear priority project \npurposes remain flood control, power generation capacity, energy \nproduction, Federal revenues, and those other purposes authorized \nsubject to the 1938 law and that the additional authorization included \nin this legislation shall be secondary should there be any conflict \nbetween them, and the current operation of the projects for the \npurposes of flood control and power shall remain project priorities?\n\n[[Page S11526]]\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator from Missouri is correct. The project \npriorities are clear.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the consideration of the \nSenators from Arkansas, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma and the chairman \nof the Committee. Hydropower is critical to the citizens and economies \nof our states. I understand that power producers have been working \nalready with fish and wildlife specialists to accommodate their \ninterests. As this project proceeds, I will watch with great interest \nto see that fish and wildlife interests can be served additionally \nwithout undermining the clear and explicit intent of this provision.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I notice that the chairman of the Senate Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works is on the floor. I would like to engage \nhim in a short colloquy.\n  As you know, section 336 of the Water Resources Development Act of \n1996 authorizes $34 million for the Secretary of the Army to acquire, \nfrom willing sellers, permanent flowage and saturation easements for \nlands within and contiguous to the boundaries of the Buford Trenton \nIrrigation District, North Dakota. These flowage easements are to \ncompensate landowners for land that has been affected by rising ground \nwater and the risk of surface flooding due to the operation of the \nGarrison Dam on the Missouri River. The corps began operation of this \ndam in 1955.\n  In acquiring these easements, this provision specifies the Secretary \nshall pay an amount based on the unaffected fee value of the lands, \nmeaning the value of the lands as if unaffected by rising ground water \nand the risk of surface flooding. Would the chairman agree that it is \nthe intent of Congress that the unaffected fee value of the land be \nbased on the current fair market value of the land as if unaffected by \nrising ground water and the risk of surface flooding, and not the value \nof the land before the Garrison Dam was operational?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would agree with the Senator that the intent of \nCongress is to compensate these landowners, as necessary, for damages \ndue to the operation of the Garrison Dam using the current fair market \nfee value of the land. The Secretary shall value the land using current \nfair market rates as if the land has not been affected by rising ground \nwater and the risk of surface flooding, and would compensate the \nlandowners based on this price assessment. The Secretary should not \nvalue this land at the pre-project rate.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the chairman for clarifying the intent of \nCongress regarding the purchase of flowage easements for lands in and \nadjacent to the Buford Trenton Irrigation District. I also want to \nthank the chairman for his efforts in passing this important \nlegislation during the 104th Congress.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will Senator Chafee, the distinguished chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, yield for a question?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I first want to thank the chairman as well as Senator \nBaucus, the ranking Democrat, and Senator John Warner, the chairman of \nthe Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, for their \ndetermination to bring the Water Resources Development Act to \nconference. They have crafted a bill and a conference report that will \nmean for my State of California strong economic progress by opening our \nports to more international trade, protecting our people from natural \ndisasters while providing opportunities to preserve and enhance the \nenvironment.\n  I would like to focus on one provision of the bill involving the \nAmerican river watershed. Mr. President, subparagraph D of this \nprovision states:\n\n       The non-Federal sponsor shall be responsible for . . . 25 \n     percent of the costs incurred for the variable flood control \n     operation of the Folsom Dam and Reservoir.\n\n  Therefore, I interpret this to say that the local, non-Federal share \nof the costs of the variable flood control operation of Folsom Dam is \nnot to exceed 25 percent.\n  It is also my understanding that it is the intent of the conferees \nthat the remaining 75 percent of the costs associated with the variable \nflood control operation of Folsom Dam and Reservoir be the \nresponsibility of the United States and that such costs shall be \nconsidered a nonreimbursable expense. In other words, these costs \nshould not be passed on to the water and power ratepayers of \nCalifornia. May I ask the chairman if my understanding of the language \nis correct?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes, the intent here is to ensure that the costs \nassociated with the variable flood control operation of Folsom Dam and \nReservoir be shared between the non-Federal project sponsor and the \nFederal Government. The cost of the provision of interim flood \nprotection to the citizens of Sacramento is to be shared.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for this \nclarification, and ask if he would yield for a question on another \nprovision.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Water Resources Development Act authorizes \nconstruction of the San Lorenzo River flood control project. The \nauthorization includes critical habitat restoration, which is to done \nin conjunction with the flood control portion.\n  It is my understanding that the Army Corps of Engineers has completed \nthe prerequisite studies for this restoration under the section 1135 \nenvironmental restoration program. In addition, the fiscal year 1995 \nand 1997 energy and water appropriations bills direct funding for this \nproject through the section 1135 program. Further, it is my \nunderstanding that the intent of the conferees that the authorization \nof this project will allow the use of section 1135 studies as well as \nfunding so that there is no further delay in the engineering, design, \nand construction of this project. Is my interpretation correct?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes, the intent here is to include the habitat \nrestoration work as part of the authorized project. Studies which have \nbeen completed by the Secretary for the habitat restoration should be \nput to use. Similarly, appropriations approved by Congress for the \nproject should be made available to avoid unnecessary delay.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the chairman for his responses and for his \ncontinued leadership in water resource development and environmental \nprotection.\n\n\n                            The La Farge Dam\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for \nthe conference language in the 1996 Water Resources Development Act \nreauthorization [WRDA] that deauthorizes the La Farge Dam and Lake \nproject. I wish to commend the hard work of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland [Mr. Chafee], the Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], the Senator \nfrom Virginia [Mr. Warner], and their staff in completing the \nconference on this measure in a timely fashion prior to the adjournment \nof the 104th Congress. I have also been very pleased with the collegial \nwork that has taken place among the Members of the Wisconsin \ndelegation--Representative Gunderson, Senator Kohl, and myself--in \nsteadfastly pursuing this deauthorization this year.\n  As I stated when this measure passed the Senate in July 1996, I am \npleased that the Congress is finally acting to end this controversial \nproject and to seek a new beginning for the Kickapoo Valley. We are \nfinally able to say to the people of the Kickapoo Valley that the \nFederal Government can act to improve their lives and correct a \nsituation that has long been the symbol, to many in the area, of a \nbroken promise. This legislation will allow the property to be managed \njointly by a local government panel comprised of local, State and \ntribal representation. It will be the first time in our State's history \nthat these three different levels of government will work together to \nmanage a property to preserve its ecological integrity while allowing \nthe public access to the outstanding recreational opportunities.\n  I wanted to briefly review the details of the conference agreement \nwith respect to this project. Under this legislation, the 8,569 acres \nof land purchased by the Federal Government for the construction of the \nLa Farge Dam and Lake project will be transferred to two owners: The \nState of Wisconsin and the Ho Chunk Nation, a federally recognized \ntribe in my State. The Ho Chunk Nation will receive no more than 1,200 \nacres in the transfer of culturally and religiously significant sites, \nand the State will receive the rest.\n\n[[Page S11527]]\n\n  This transfer will occur once the State and the tribe enter into a \nmemorandum of understanding [MOU]. That MOU must ensure that the \nproperty is developed only to enhance outdoor recreational or \neducational purposes, described how the lands will be jointly managed, \nprotect the confidentiality of sites of cultural and religious \nsignificance to the Ho Chunk as appropriate, and establish the terms by \nwhich the agreement will be revisited in the future.\n  I am particularly pleased that the conference committee was able to \ninclude a $17 million authorization for improvement projects at this \nsite, an authorization which was supported by the Wisconsin delegation \nand the local community. These improvements include: Reconstruction of \nthe three roads; remediation of old underground storage tanks and wells \non the abandoned farms; and the stabilization of the old dam site.\n  Next month, members of a gubernatorially appointed negotiating panel \nwill meet with representatives of the Ho Chunk Nation to begin the MOU \nnegotiating process. Bolstered by the passage of this legislation, I \nknow they will try to work as swiftly as possible to complete their \ntask.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I again want to express my gratitude to \nthe members of the conference committee for their assistance in working \nwith the delegation on this matter. I believe that this legislation \nwill result in a truly landmark arrangement for the management of a \npublic recreational area. I look forward to the final establishment of \nthe Kickapoo Valley reserve, and the protection of this truly \noutstanding resource.\n  I first introduced legislation, S. 2186, to achieve this goal on June \n14, 1994, and reintroduced that measure as S. 40 on January 4, 1995. It \nis a great pleasure to see this measure finally enacted.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the conference \nreport be considered adopted, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that statements relating to the report be placed at this \npoint in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11522-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11527-S11528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--CONFERENCE REPORT TO ACCOMPANY H.R. 3539\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous-consent that the Senate turn \nto the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 3539, \nthe FAA reauthorization bill, and the reading of the conference report \nbe waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The acting leader.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I know there will be an objection after I \nmake my statement, and I regret that. We have worked long and hard to \nbring this FAA reauthorization bill to the floor. I have worked years \non it, along with the occupant of the Chair. We have security in there. \nWe have funding for airports. We have the money to cover letters of \nintent. All of this is extremely important. And one item in this bill \nis going to bring it down.\n  I wish it was not in there. I wish we did not have it, but it is \nthere. And I hope that those that object to that portion of it would \njust give us an up-and-down vote. The House did that. And why we could \nnot have an up-and-down vote--based on the content of the bill, if you \nare opposed to all of this, all the funding for the airports, all the \nsecurity, and opposed to all the money going to your airports, opposed \nto essential air service, all these things, then you have to vote no on \nthe whole bill for this one item.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could just make a comment before there \nis objection, if there is in fact going to be objection, to be heard \nfurther in support of my unanimous-consent request. I want to thank the \nSenator from Kentucky for his good work on this legislation. It has \nbeen a long time coming. He and Senator McCain and Senator Stevens and \nothers have worked very hard.\n  You have an outstanding bill here. In less than 72 hours the Federal \nGovernment's authority to provide critical funding to airports across \nthe country and our national air transportation system will expire \nunless we pass this FAA reauthorization bill. I am talking about over \n$9 billion annually for the national needs, such as air traffic \ncontrol, repair, maintenance and modernization of our air traffic \ncontrol equipment, repair and construction of runways, taxiways, and \nother vital aviation infrastructure, the purchase of critical \nfirefighting equipment at our Nation's airports. And the list goes on. \nI mean, this is also very much a question of safety.\n  Mr. FORD. No question about it.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the recent tragic aircraft accidents, and \ncontinuing reports of power outages and equipment failures in our air \ntraffic control centers, have raised questions about the safety of our \nNation's air transportation system and the effectiveness of the Federal \nGovernment in safeguarding the traveling public.\n  We must do our part to reassure the traveling public that we have the \nworld's safest air transportation system. This comprehensive \nlegislation will go a long way in reassuring the public that the system \nis safe, and ensure the FAA will have a stable, predictable, and \nsufficient funding stream for the long term. Again, the FAA bill will:\n  Ensure that the FAA and our Nation's airports will be adequately \nfunded by reauthorizing key FAA programs, including the Airport \nImprovement Program, for fiscal year 1997;\n  Ensure that the FAA has the resources it needs to improve airport and \nairline security in the near term;\n  Direct the National Transportation Safety Board to establish a \nprogram to provide for adequate notification of and advocacy services \nfor the families of victims of aircraft accidents;\n  Enhance airline and air travelers' safety by requiring airlines to \nshare employment and performance records before hiring new pilots;\n  Strengthen existing laws prohibiting airport revenue diversion, and \nprovide the FAA with the tools they need to enforce Federal law \nprohibiting revenue diversion;\n  Most important, provide for thorough reform, including long-term \nfunding reform, of the FAA to secure the resources to ensure we \ncontinue to have the safest, most efficient air transportation system \nin the world.\n  To assure air travelers and other users of our air transportation \nsystem that safety is paramount, the bill:\n  Requires the FAA to study and report to Congress on whether certain \nair carrier security responsibilities should be transferred to or \nshared with airports or the federal government;\n  Requires the National Transportation Safety Board [NTSB] to take \naction to help families of victims following commercial aircraft \naccidents;\n  Requires NTSB and the FAA to work together to develop a system to \nclassify aircraft accident and safety data maintained by the NTSB, and \nreport to Congress on the effects of publishing such data;\n  Ensures that the FAA gives high priority to implement a fully \nenhanced safety performance analysis system, including automated \nsurveillance;\n  Bolsters weapons and explosive detection technology through research \nand development;\n  Improves standards for airport security passenger, baggage, and \nproperty screeners, including requiring criminal history records \nchecks;\n  Requires the FAA to facilitate quick deployment of commercially \navailable explosive detection equipment;\n  Contains a sense of the Senate on the development of effective \npassenger profiling programs;\n  Authorizes airports to use project grant money and passenger facility \ncharges [PFC] for airport security programs;\n  Establishes aviation security liaisons at key Federal agencies;\n  Requires the FAA and FBI to carry out joint threat and vulnerability \nassessments every 3 years;\n  Requires all air carriers and airports to conduct periodic \nvulnerability assessments of security systems; and\n  Facilitates the transfer of pilot employment records between \nemploying airlines so that passenger safety is not compromised.\n  The bill also expands the prohibition on revenue diversion to cover \nmore instances of diversion and establishes\n\n[[Page S11528]]\n\nclear penalties and stronger mechanisms to enforce Federal laws \nprohibiting airport revenues from leaving the airport. ``It is \nfundamental that we reverse the disturbing trend of illegal diversion \nof airport revenues to ensure that airport revenues are used only for \nairport purposes,'' said McCain.\n  ``We must do our part to reassure the traveling public that we have \nthe world's safest air transportation system,'' concluded McCain. \n``This comprehensive legislation will go a long way in reassuring the \npublic that the system is safe, and ensure the FAA will have a stable, \npredictable, and sufficient funding stream to be the long term.''\n  Each of these elements of H.R. 3538 is essential to fulfill Congress' \nresponsibility to improving our country's air transportation system.\n  Clearly, Congress, the White House, DOT, the FAA, and others \nthroughout the aviation industry have been under close scrutiny \nregarding the state of the U.S. air transportation system.\n  The traveling public has told us they are worried about the safety \nand security of U.S. airports and airlines, and the ability of the \nGovernment to alleviate these concerns. Recent tragic events suggest \nthat this apprehension is justified, and we have been strongly \nencouraged to correct the problems in our air transportation system. \nThe FAA bill will go a long way toward making the system safer and \nbetter in every way.\n  The American people demand we get this done, and they deserve no \nless.\n  It really alarms me that we have cut it this close. It looks like \nthere may be objection. In fact, the recent tragic aircraft accidents \nand the continuing reports of power outages and equipment failures in \nour air traffic control centers have raised all kinds of questions that \nwe are trying to address with this bill.\n  So I think we need to move it forward. There are so many good parts \nof this bill. It is so essential. It does have so many safety \nramifications that I hope that we could move it forward in a unanimous \nway.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Reserving the right to object for a moment, let me just \nsay that I am intrigued by the conversation and am concerned about the \nairline safety issues, the funding. I am very concerned about those \nissues. I want this bill to pass too.\n  So why in the world, yesterday, just yesterday, under the guise of a \ntechnical correction to the Railway Labor Act, was an unacceptable and \nvery controversial special interest provision added to this bill? It \nwas not because of airline safety. It was not because of funding for \nthe airports. And it was not a technical correction.\n  The provision makes a significant change in Federal law to give \nFederal Express an edge in its current attempt to stop some of its \nemployees from joining a union. That is what is so all-fired important \nhere and had to be put in yesterday in a bill that we are being told \nhas to pass because of airline safety. That is the issue. Let us just \nget this out of there. That is what that provision is about. It has \nnothing to do with airline safety.\n  Mr. President, because of what really has happened here, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is noted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11527-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11528-S11529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PRESIDIO PROPERTIES ADMINISTRATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I also want to comment, if I could, on the \nobjections that we heard earlier today to the omnibus parks bill, \ncommonly referred to as the Presidio bill. I might say to the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, this is not a unanimous- 6Ysent request. I just want to \nmake a brief statement.\n  Mr. FORD. That is fine.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be glad to yield further.\n  Mr. FORD. Go ahead.\n  Mr. LOTT. On the Presidio bill there has been objection now from our \nDemocratic colleagues to turning to that omnibus bill. We had tried to \ndispense with the reading and recommit the conference report back to \nthe conference in order to take care of a provision in there that had \nraised concern, the tax provision. And I thought at one point, I guess \n24 hours ago now, that we were going to be able to get agreement on \nboth sides of the aisle to recommit that conference report and take \ncare of the problem and then move this very important parks bill \nforward that affects 41 States, contains 126 separate provisions \nrelating to parks and public lands.\n  This is the most important parks bill we have had in probably 4 \nyears. It does have a lot of very important areas involved that need to \nbe preserved, from battlefield sites to the Sterling Forest site that \naffects the New Jersey and New York area, the tall grass project out in \nKansas, as well as the Presidio, and some very important projects in \nthe State of Alaska. I know the distinguished Presiding Officer \ncertainly cares an awful lot about that and the chairman of the \ncommittee.\n\n  So I do not understand what is going on here. I understand from the \nadministration that they have a list of their preferred projects, that \nthey say, ``Oh, well, we'll take these and no more.'' Well, probably \nthose projects that they say they cannot be included, they are good \nprojects, most of them, they are projects from Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  There has been a continuing effort to work out something on this. I \nam astounded we are going to leave and not get this done. But we are \nnot going to be able to put this whole bill in the continuing \nresolution. If we do not move it separately as an omnibus bill, then we \nwill have no parks bill this year.\n  There was an effort maybe just to include one or two projects. I \nunderstand that has been objected to from the administration. I do not \nknow where we go from here on this very important legislation but time \nis certainly running out.\n  I think it is once again going to be a tragedy, like the FAA \nreauthorization. In an effort to force an effect, a unionization of a \ncompany, they are going to bring down the whole FAA infrastructure. I \ndo not understand that. And now in order to block two or three minor \nprojects, we are going to have the whole parks bill go down?\n  Here is another thing about that. It is the continuing process of how \nwhen we meet objections the goalposts move. We were told on the illegal \nimmigration, the Gallegly section is the problem. ``We'll veto it over \nthat.'' Well, we took it out. They said, ``Wait a minute. We have some \nother problems.'' Same thing on this bill. We were told there were \ncertain projects, three or four that were major problems. The chairman \ntook them out. Then they said, ``Oh, well. No. We have 50 other \nprojects that we have problems with.''\n  Mr. President, we have to have, in these final hours of the session, \ngood faith, and we have to be prepared to stick with what we say we \nhave to have when that is done, and not keep saying then you have to \nhave something else. It is a very disappointing way to wind up this \nsession.\n\n  I yield to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Relative to reviewing the list of 126, it affects \nSenators from Oregon, Utah, Virginia, California, Alaska, Louisiana, \nMississippi, Maine, Vermont, Idaho, Washington, Missouri, to name a \nfew, and in some cases, parks in every State. These are States affected \nby the administration's announcement last night they wanted 46 more \nout. These are the States that are affected. This is after an extended \nhearing process. We reported these out, and we have withdrawn those the \nadministration initially listed as objections that they would veto.\n  I have personally met with my conferees by telephone relative to \ntrying to clear this, and as the leader has pointed out, a technical \ncorrection in the House has been taken care of. We can pass this. We \ncan move it right now if there is no objection. Otherwise, we will have \nto wait for another session, the 105th Congress, to start this process \nthat we spent over 2 years on, which benefits virtually every State in \nthe Union with very meaningful projects, including the Presidio and \ncleaning up the San Francisco Bay area.\n  I urge the leader to continue to work in every manner, because time \nis running out on the biggest and most important parks public land \npackage in two decades. We are ready to move forward and pass this \nlegislation. If we cannot proceed, it would truly be a shame, because \non both sides, Democrats and Republicans will not see--\n\n[[Page S11529]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thought there was going to be a meeting last night \nbetween key players on both sides of the aisle to meet with the \nadministration and see if some compromise could be worked out. I am \ntold that meeting never occurred.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The majority leader is correct. We were ready to have \nthe meeting, and we were advised by the White House representative that \nthey had no authority and were not familiar with the specifics of the \nbill and they wanted us to submit a bill, items which we would agree to \ntake out.\n  As chairman of that committee I feel a responsibility, bipartisan, \nboth Democrats and Republicans, to try to represent them in a \nconference mode as opposed to arbitrarily taking out their sections to \naccommodate the administration.\n  We have, for Senator Heflin, who is retiring, Selma to Montgomery \nHistoric Trail designation, the historic black college funding; for \nSenator Simon and Senator Moseley-Braun, the Illinois and Michigan \ncanal, Calumet Ecological Park study; for Senator Johnston and Senator \nBreaux, Civil War Center, Louisiana University, the Laura Hudson \nVisitor Center; Senators Kennedy and Kerrey, and retiring Congressman \nStudds, Boston Harbor Islands park establishment, Blackstone heritage \narea, New Bedford establishment.\n  I cannot understand why, after all this work, there is still \nobjection. I encourage the majority leader to continue to work on, and \nI stand ready to try to meet the objections of my colleagues. I \nunderstand there is a hold now from the administration, and I think it \nis fair to say we have an obligation, certainly, relative to a process \nhere, and as an authorizer, if the White House is going to line-item \nveto everything, we might as well go out of business.\n  I encourage the majority leader to continue the effort because we are \nnot very far away, and I stand ready to be here all night if necessary, \ncome in and meet with any group, to try to address this.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. One, on the parks bill, I want to commend Chairman \nMurkowski and other members on the Energy Committee who worked hard to \nmake this happen. This is a large bill, and unfortunately now it has a \nlot of items throughout the year that many of us have been working on \nfor a long, long time.\n  The Senator from Alaska has been generous enough to withdraw one of \nthe bills he felt very strongly about, that was important to his State, \nso we could get it signed. I asked him to do that. I appreciate his \nwillingness to do it.\n  The Senator from Minnesota dropped an item. Again, we heard it being \nin there meant it would be vetoed, so we dropped two or three of the \nmost contentious items. We dropped a project in Utah that, again, other \npeople talked about would bring a certain veto.\n  Now, all of a sudden--we thought we had really taken away the veto \nobjective so we could pass this bill. I committed to the Senator from \nCalifornia that I would try to help pass the Presidio bill this year. I \nwant to maintain that commitment. I would like to pass this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to work together. This bill has been put \ntogether in a bipartisan fashion. I have not counted up the number of \nDemocrat and the number of Republican bills, but there are a lot on \nboth sides of the aisle that impact parks all across the country and \nmost of the States across the country. It would really be a shame to \nhave that much work and that much time invested in that bill not to see \nit passed this year.\n  I compliment my colleague from Alaska and also the majority leader. I \nhope we will find a way to be able to work out the differences and pass \nthis bill and get it signed into law before we adjourn the 104th \nCongress.\n  Let me make an announcement on behalf of the majority leader. I \nannounce there will be no further rollcall votes tonight. The Senate \nobviously will be working tonight, in various conferences, trying to \nwork out differences both on the continuing resolution and on the \nimmigration and the parks bill. There will be work done tonight but \nthere will be no further rollcall votes tonight.\n  I announce on behalf of the majority leader the Senate will reconvene \nat 10 a.m. tomorrow morning and we will try to give as much advance \nnotice to all Senators prior to any recorded rollcall votes. As of now, \nthere has not been one ordered, but Senators should stand on notice \nthere may well be a recorded rollcall vote in the event we are able to \ncome to an agreement on the continuing resolution, the parks bill or \nthe immigration bill.\n  I thank my colleague from Kentucky.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if I may be recognized for 1 minute relative \nto advising my colleagues of the status of the parks omnibus package.\n\n  It is my understanding that the appropriations subcommittee chairman \nhas indicated it will not include specific items taken from the park \nomnibus bill and put on the appropriation CR. Now, that is a matter \noutside the control of the Senator from Alaska as chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resource Committee. I think that has been clearly \nstated, and it has been reinforced by the Speaker of the House.\n  What I am encouraging, obviously, is that we proceed with this \npackage. I agree, if it is in the interests of my colleagues to put the \npackage on the appropriations as an entire package, I have no objection \nto that. Otherwise, the alternative is to proceed as we have, try to \naddress the objections from the other side, and get on with it.\n  For those who think we will cherry pick it out and put specific \nportions on the appropriations CR and pass it there, that is not going \nto be an available alternative. We will simply lose for this year and \nhave to start again. I hope that will not happen.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we are getting into a position where \neverybody seems to think we have to get out. Our salary still goes on. \nWe still get paid whether we are here or not. I think we might as well \nstay here and earn our keep. We do not have to get out tomorrow. We do \nnot have to get out Monday. We do not have to get out next Friday. We \ncan go ahead and pass a continuing resolution and we could stay here \nand pass some bills or we can give a short-term continuing resolution \nfor 3 or 4 days and we can work things out.\n  But we appear to be pushed up against a wall: you have to get out, \ngot to do this, or it is dead. There is no such thing, unless the \nmajority leader wants to take us out, and then things are dead.\n\n  I feel like we are being pushed awfully hard here just because \ntomorrow night we want to get out or Monday we want to get out. I \nunderstand everybody wants to go home and campaign. Let them go home \nand campaign, and the rest of us can stay here and work. That suits me \nfine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11528-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FAA REAUTHORIZATION CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. FORD.

It \nwas to be in there because nothing should be narrower or wider. Nobody \nshould get anything when they pass the ICC legislation.\n  So I understand where we are coming from, and I understand whose \nfight it is in. I hate to be in the catch-22.

If we have to vote on it and we pass \nit, then it goes to the President. That is the end of it.\n  If you want to stay around a while, keep objecting to this one, file \na cloture petition, we will get cloture and get our 30 hours and do our \nthing around here, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11529-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11529-S11531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE BOUNDARY WATERS CANOE AREA WILDERNESS\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the \npeople\n\n[[Page S11530]]\n\nof northern Minnesota about an issue that symbolizes for us the \ndifference between what the role of government should be and what it \nhas become. I am speaking, of course, about the current struggle to \nrestore the rights of the citizens to have reasonable access to the \ncherished Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness [BWCAW].\n  My colleague from northern Minnesota, Congressman Jim Oberstar, and I \nhave unfortunately spent our days fighting a campaign of distortions \nand misinformation by a national coalition of special interest groups \nthat want this national treasure for themselves: their private research \nterritory not to be touched by what they view as the unclean, ignorant \ncitizens of northern Minnesota. I believe a brief history of this \ncontroversy is needed if we hope to carry on an honest and reasonable \ndebate on how best to resolve it.\n  In 1978, 1 million acres in northern Minnesota were designated by \nCongress as our Nation's only lakeland-based Federal wilderness area. \nBy establishing the BWCAW, Congress rightfully acknowledged the need to \nprotect the tremendous ecological and recreational resources within the \narea, with the understanding that it was to be a multiple-use \nwilderness area, as first envisioned by Senator Hubert Humphrey in \n1964.\n  When Senator Humphrey included the Boundary Waters as part of the \nNational Wilderness System, he made a promise to the people of \nMinnesota, saying ``The wilderness bill will not ban motorboats.'' It \nis safe to say that without that commitment to the people of northern \nMinnesota, this region would not be a wilderness area today.\n  In 1978, additional legislation was passed making further \nenhancements to the protection of the Boundary Waters, such as a \njustified ban on commercial activities like logging and mining. The \n1978 law also limited recreational uses. For instance, motorboat users \ncould only use 18 of the 1,078 lakes within the region.\n  Under the 1978 law, however, motorboat users were given the right to \naccess some of these motorized lakes through three portage trails. \nTrucks and other mechanized means could be used to transport boats, \ncanoes and people across the three portages from one lake to another. \nWhile many northern Minnesotans believed the 1978 law unduly restricted \ntheir boating privileges, they were comforted that these three \nmechanized portages would continue to allow reasonable access for \neveryone--from the young and the old to the strong and the weak--into \nmany of these motorized lakes.\n  The intent of Congress was altered in 1993 when environmental \nextremists succeeded in a lawsuit to close these portages to mechanized \ntransport. As a result of this court order, visitors can only transport \ntheir boats now by carrying them on their backs or with pieces of \nequipment which are pulled like a wagon. That is great fun for the \nyoung and strong, but wrenching work for those who are elderly, \ndisabled, or traveling with children.\n  To illustrate the importance of allowing mechanized transport of \nboats over these portages, I wanted to show these pictures taken at \nTrout portage, one of the portages in question.\n  As you can see, the physical requirements of dragging boats across \nthese portages have placed an obvious roadblock to the open access \nguaranteed to the public by law.\n  What is worse is that this court order came as the result of \nlegalistic trickery by the radical environmentalists who filed the \nlawsuit--a deception they readily admit to and describe in great detail \nin a book they wrote entitled ``Troubled Waters.''\n  According to their book, the compromise worked out between the \nattorneys representing the radical environmentalists and the people of \nnorthern Minnesota, which was adopted in the 1978 law, allowed portages \nto use mechanized transport if the U.S. Forest Service determined that \na feasible nonmotorized alternative could not be established.\n  In 1989, the Forest Service, after careful study, did in fact make \nthat determination, thereby keeping the portages accessible to all.\n  But unbeknownst to the people of northern Minnesota, and apparently \nthe U.S. Congress, the term ``feasible'' did not have the same meaning \nin environmental law as it does in everyday English.\n  According to ``Troubled Waters,'' a ``feasible'' alternative could, \nunder law, permit something that was possible only from an engineering \nstandpoint, regardless of whether it would take longer, be less \nconvenient, or even be, and I quote the preservationists' own words, \n``downright tortuous.''\n  The extreme environmentalists go on in their book to describe how \ntheir attorney did not even bother to tell the attorney representing \nthe interests of northern Minnesota about their sleight-of-hand \ngamesmanship.\n  In other words, they purposely salted the deal with words they knew \nthey would later challenge in court.\n  It was under this narrow interpretation of the word ``feasible'' that \na federal appeals panel ordered the portages closed, after reversing a \nlower court decision which determined that a group of healthy, able-\nbodied people could not always transport these boats using muscle power \nand portage wheels. And so for four years, these portages have been \neffectively restricted from use by the elderly and disabled.\n  By the way, the word ``feasible'' means that the Ely football team or \ndog sleds can maybe help do this, but in other words it restricts an \naverage person's ability to be able to get access to the park.\n  Since the court decision, the number of motorboats transported across \nthese portages has significantly decreased.\n  Even more telling are the letters I have received from Minnesotans \nwho have been shut out of the land they once called home.\n  John Novak, a veteran from Ely, MN, wrote me about his frustration \nwith the closing of the portages, saying:\n\n       I was good enough to go into the armed services for our \n     country for 3 years back in the forties. Now that I am \n     disabled, I am not good enough to get in the Boundary Waters \n     Canoe Area Wilderness.\n\n  I received another letter from a young man from Virginia, MN, named \nJoe Madden who wrote ``I went to visit the Boundary Waters with my \ngrandfather. We wanted to go fishing in Trout Lake, but we could not \nget there because we could not get my grandpa's boat over the \n     portage. Can you please open it up so Grandpa and I could \n     go fishing?\n\n  These are just two of the many letters and requests sent to me by \naverage, hard-working Minnesotans who have seen the promises made to \nthem long ago by the Federal Government broken and forgotten over the \nyears--people who rightfully believed that the Government was meant to \nwork for them, but found out just the opposite.\n  It is these people--the men, women, and children of northern \nMinnesota--whose crusade Jim Oberstar and I have carried to the Halls \nof Congress in trying to reopen the three portages in the Boundary \nWaters.\n  In the 104th Congress alone, there have been a number of developments \nbringing us to the point at which we find ourselves today.\n  Eight Minnesota State legislators--all Democrats--asked me to request \na field hearing on this issue.\n  The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee then held a field \nhearing in International Falls, MN, on issues surrounding the Boundary \nWaters and Minnesota's Voyageurs National Park.\n  A second field hearing was held in St. Paul at the request of my \ncolleagues from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone and Congressman Bruce \nVento.\n  This year, Congress has held three committee hearings in Washington \non bills introduced by Congressman Oberstar and me to reopen the \nportages, and provide the public greater input into how the Boundary \nWaters and Voyageurs National Park are managed in the future.\n  At each of these hearings, a major display of opposition was \norganized by the extreme environmental special interests groups and \ntheir allies in Congress against our bills.\n  As a result, Senators with little knowledge or legitimate interests \nin the Boundary Waters were scripted to pronounce the bills dead on \narrival and to make unbiased charges that we introduced our legislation \nfor political reasons--criticisms which ignored the clear bipartisan \nnature of our work.\n  This organized campaign of disinformation and propaganda placed a \nsignificant obstacle against our hopes to move these bills through the \ncommittee process, leaving us and the taxpayers of Minnesota, who we \nrepresent,\n\n[[Page S11531]]\n\nwith few legislative options to resolve the problems facing the people \nof northern Minnesota.\n  While many contentious issues surround the management of these two \nnational treasures, no issue more perfectly symbolizes the failure of \nthe Federal Government to live up to its proper role of serving the \npeople than that of the three portages.\n  The same radical environmental individuals engaged in Senator \nWellstone's mediation effort have claimed that any portage changes are \n``non-negotiable.'' And yes, the same environmental lawyer who came up \nwith the word ``feasible'' is part of this mediation \neffort. Congressman Oberstar and I persuaded the managers of the \nconference committee considering the omnibus parks bill to include a \ncompromise provision which would reopen the Trout, Prairie, and Four-\nMile portages to the elderly, disabled, and everyone who did not have a \nwashboard stomach.\n\n  We hoped that at long last, the people of northern Minnesota would \nfinally have their voices heard in Congress.\n  But once again, those same special interest groups--who had fooled \nthe people of northern Minnesota in 1978, closed the portages in 1993, \nand used their influence to block our bills from the committee process \nthis year--struck again, soliciting letters of opposition from Senators \noutside of Minnesota and even a veto threat from the White House.\n  The compromise was pulled out of the conference report late Tuesday \nnight--and the people of northern Minnesota were shut out once again.\n  I am disappointed by this turn of events--not so much for myself and \nCongressman Oberstar, though we have put much time and effort to get \nthe portages reopened--but rather for John Novak, Joe Madden, and the \nthousands of northern Minnesotans who were counting on this Congress to \nbegin righting the wrongs of the last two decades.\n  You see, we in Minnesota still honestly believe in the words of \nPresident Lincoln that this is a ``government of the people, by the \npeople, and for the people.''\n  These words and the principles of democracy they embody have been \npassed down from generation to generation--the uniquely American idea \nthat Government should work in the interests of the people, not against \nthem.\n  But somewhere down the line, that idea was forgotten by those Federal \nofficials and bureaucrats who have been serving the radical \nenvironmental cabal, rather than for those hard-working taxpayers in \nnorthern Minnesota who ask for so little.\n  It is not surprising that the people of northern Minnesota are \nquestioning just whom the Federal Government really serves.\n  It was President Clinton--yes, the same President Clinton whose White \nHouse threatened to veto the portages compromise--who said ``There is \nnothing wrong with America that cannot be fixed by what is right with \nAmerica.'' In taking up the cause of the people of northern Minnesota, \nI embrace those words and only slightly modify them to say ``There is \nnothing wrong with the federal government that cannot be fixed by what \nis right with the American people.'' And it is what is right about our \nfellow Americans that keeps me hopeful that we will indeed resolve this \nissue in a way that best suits those Minnesotans who I am proud to \nrepresent in the Senate.\n\n  We may not have the money that the radical environmentalists do, or \nhave at our disposal the highly-paid lobbyists and lawyers who are \nworking against us--but we do have something more important than all of \nthat. We have the truth on our side. And we are working for the same \nthing every American wants from our government: accountability to the \npeople.\n  Accountability means balancing the protection of our pristine \nwilderness with the rights of the people to enjoy our natural \nresources. It means restoring the promises made in the past and \nestablishing a partnership with the people to ensure those promises \nwill be honored in the future. And it means keeping the Federal \nGovernment in check to guarantee that it works for the best interests \nof the people.\n  We who love the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness are working \ntoward--and will continue to work toward--those goals. I am pleased to \nhave a commitment from the distinguished chairman of the Senate Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee for an early markup of this common-\nsense reform effort in the next Congress. We will not stop our efforts \nuntil the principles of democracy are embodied in the future management \nof this beautiful national treasure. The people of northern Minnesota \nwill have their voices heard in Congress, past injustices will be \nremedied, and the promises made so long ago by Senator Humphrey will be \nkept.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

JEFFREY A. COOK\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to discuss an issue I have with \nthe Armed Services Committee.\n  On May 15, 1995, I wrote a letter to the chairman of the Committee, \nmy friend from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond.\n  This was a very important letter.\n  It concerned the nomination for promotion of Navy Capt. Jeffrey A. \nCook.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              Charles E. Grassley,\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Strom: I am writing to raise questions about the \n     pending promotion of Navy Captain Jeffrey A. Cook to the rank \n     of rear admiral (lower half).\n       My questions about Captain Cook's fitness for promotion \n     pertain to his service as the A-12 class desk officer during \n     the period 1987 to 1990. In that capacity, he was the chief \n     engineer for the A-12 stealth bomber program and the \n     principal adviser for engineering matters to the A-12 program \n     manager, Captain Lawrence G. Elberfeld.\n\n\n                      a-12 criminal investigation\n\n       The main source of my concern about Captain Cook's \n     qualification for promotion are the results of a criminal \n     investigation. The investigation was conducted by the Chicago \n     Field Office of the Defense Criminal Investigation Service, \n     Department of Defense Inspector General (IG). The report on \n     the investigation is dated April 20, 1994, and carries the \n     designation 9011045M-20-SEP-90-40SL-E5A/D.\n       The purpose of the criminal investigation was to examine \n     allegations that ``U.S. Navy and DOD [Department of Defense] \n     officials may have concealed or conspired to conceal, or \n     otherwise thwart, the dissemination of adverse A-12 program \n     information to the DOD and to Congress.''\n       The investigation found several specific instances in which \n     former Secretary of the Navy H. Lawrence Garrett and other \n     Navy A-12 program officials ``withheld, concealed, and/or \n     suppressed adverse A-12 program information'' from cognizant \n     DOD and Navy oversight personnel and from Congress. Both Mr. \n     Garrett and Captain Elberfeld are accused of withholding \n     relevant documents and material during an official inquiry \n     and subsequent congressional oversight hearings. Worse still, \n     the report suggests that Mr. Garrett may have in fact \n     destroyed important evidence during the criminal phase of the \n     investigation.\n       Based on the results of the investigation, the Inspector \n     General concluded there were reasonable grounds to believe \n     that Federal criminal law had been violated. Therefore, all \n     the detailed information related to the actions of Secretary \n     Garrett were referred to the Department of Justice for \n     possible prosecution. Similarly, the case against Captain \n     Elberfeld was referred to the Office of the Judge Advocate \n     General of the Navy for possible court-martial. Captain \n     Elberfeld was suspected of violating various articles of the \n     Uniform Code of Military Justice, including article 907--\n     pertaining to false official statements. In both cases, a \n     decision was made not to prosecute.\n\n\n             captain cook's possible role in a-12 cover-up\n\n       Now, this is the issue that must be addressed on the \n     pending nomination: Did Captain Cook allow himself to be \n     drawn into the web of deceit spun out by former Secretary \n     Garrett and Captain Elberfeld? Was Captain Cook a willing or \n     unwilling participant in\n\n[[Page S11532]]\n\n     the scheme to withhold and conceal adverse information on the \n     A-12 program?\n       On the surface, Captain Cook's performance appears to have \n     been exceptional. He is the only Navy official I know of who \n     was critical of the program, and the investigators say he is \n     the only person who was ``open and cooperative'' during the \n     probe. His criticism came in the form of several briefings in \n     which he ``identified severe technical problems with the A-12 \n     program.'' These briefings are discussed in the IG's \n     investigative report. His criticism was very much to his \n     credit.\n       While his critical technical assessments were commendable, \n     I fear they may have been nothing more than a clever \n     bureaucratic ``cover-your-fanny'' operation. This is the \n     scenario I visualize. Captain Cook would present a briefing \n     identifying ``severe technical problems,'' but in the face of \n     opposition and pressure from Captain Elberfeld and more \n     senior officers, Cook would quickly back down. Without \n     further protest, Captain Cook would then join Captain \n     Elberfeld in pumping out false and misleading status reports \n     on the A-12. In the end, I think, Captain Cook acquiesced in \n     the scheme to conceal adverse information on the program.\n       The incidents described on pages C29 to C31 of the \n     investigative report seem to lend credence to idea that \n     Captain Cook went along with the coverup.\n       On April 16, 1990, Captain Cook provided one of his \n     briefings to a group of senior officers, including Vice \n     Admiral Richard C. Gentz, Commander of the Naval Air Systems \n     Command. In the briefing, he identified ``severe technical \n     problems'' that could ``slip'' the program for at least one \n     year. After hearing that piece of bad news, Admiral Gentz \n     told Captain Elberfeld to ``re-assess'' the A-12 program and \n     report back to him with solutions within 24 hours. As I \n     understand it, Captain Cook helped Captain Elberfeld \n     prepare a ``revised'' technical update briefing for \n     Admiral Gentz. This is where Captain Cook seems to have \n     taken a 180 degree turn in his thinking. He did an about-\n     face and worked with Elberfeld late into the night, \n     twisting and distorting the facts, turning his own \n     assessment upside down, helping Elberfeld put a favorable \n     spin on the status of the program. After their night of \n     handy work, Admiral Gentz felt the one-year ``slip'' was \n     unnecessary, leaving the money spigot wide open. That \n     particular piece of work came at a very critical point in \n     the program. (Refer to page C-31)\n       Captain Cook also participated in the confiscation and \n     suppression of a devastating report on the A-12 program. This \n     incident occurred in February 1990 and is described on pages \n     C-29 to C-30 of the investigative report.\n       The highly critical evaluation was prepared by Mr. Ed \n     Carroll, a civilian production analyst assigned to the Office \n     of the Secretary of Defense. His report predicted a one-year \n     ``slip'' in the program. The Carroll report was \n     ``confiscated''--allegedly for a security violation--and \n     ``relinquished'' to Captain Cook. He subsequently turned it \n     over to one of his subordinates, Mr. John J. Dicks. When \n     investigators discovered the Carroll report buried in A-12 \n     program office files, attached to it was a handwritten note \n     by Dicks. The note stated in part: ``Keep this package quiet \n     and close controlled.'' As a result of Cook's actions, the \n     highly critical Carroll report never saw the light of day. \n     The handling of the Carroll report suggests to me that \n     Captain Cook could have played a role in concealing adverse \n     information on the A-12 stealth bomber.\n\n\n               holding captain cook to a higher standard\n\n       Strom, as I said, compared to other A-12 program officials, \n     Captain Cook's performance was exceptional. It makes him look \n     like a hero. But in making that comparison, we are holding \n     him to a negative standard. A candidate for promotion to rear \n     admiral must be held to a much higher standard--a standard of \n     excellence. When that is done, I don't think Captain Cook \n     measures up.\n       There is a fundamental principle of leadership: ``Seek \n     Responsibility and Take Responsibility for your Actions.''\n       At the time, the A-12 was a top priority Navy program. As \n     chief engineer on the project, he had identified a major \n     technical problem that posed a very real threat to the \n     viability of the whole program. It was a ``show stopper''--a \n     problem that had to be fixed. He was responsible for \n     developing a sound and timely solution to the problem. He had \n     a responsibility to follow through. He was fully accountable \n     for that problem. A man in his position should not wait for \n     his superiors to tell him what to do. He needed to take the \n     initiative and solve it--with the approval, of course, of his \n     superiors. However, when those over him balked at his \n     solutions but at the same time refused to even address ``show \n     stopper'' problems, then he had a responsibility to confront \n     them and push it up the chain of command. For example, he \n     would have sent a written report up the chain of command to \n     the top DOD acquisition ``czar''--if necessary, laying out \n     his view of the problem.\n       Unfortunately, Captain Cook's protests ended where they \n     began--in his briefings. Had he pushed them further up the \n     chain of command, he would have run the risk of ruining his \n     career. Doing the right thing almost always involves risks \n     and even danger. Doing what must be done takes courage, \n     commitment and integrity. Had Captain Cook pursued the more \n     risky solution, he would have set an example of excellence. \n     No aspect of leadership is more powerful that setting a good \n     example. Had he done it, Cook would have been a role model \n     for all to respect. Strom, we must judge Captain Cook against \n     such a standard of excellence.\n       A candidate for promotion to rear admiral should \n     demonstrate certain outstanding leadership qualities \n     including courage, competence, candor, commitment, and \n     integrity. In my mind, Captain Cook failed to demonstrate \n     those skills as chief engineer on the A-12 project. His \n     superior officers told him to do the wrong thing, and he did \n     it. He failed to stick to his beliefs. He failed to act on \n     the information he had. He failed to demonstrate a solid \n     commitment to solving the engineering problems that he had \n     identified and for which he was accountable.\n\n\n                  overall impact of a-12 mismanagement\n\n       The failure of former Secretary Garrett, Captain Elberfeld, \n     Captain Cook and others to confront major technical problems \n     on the A-12 in an open, honest, and timely way has had a \n     profound, long-term negative impact on the Navy.\n       The A-12 was supposed to begin replacing the Navy's aging \n     fleet the A-6 bombers in 1994. That was last year. Well, \n     there are no A-12 bombers in the fleet and never will be. All \n     the money spent on the A-12--nearly $3.0 billion--was wasted. \n     We have absolutely nothing to show for it.\n       The A-12 program was terminated for default in January \n     1991. Former Secretary of Defense Cheney killed the program \n     because it was way over cost and way behind schedule, and no \n     one could tell him how much money it would take to finish it. \n     To make matters worse, the two A-12 contractors--McDonnell \n     Douglas and General Dynamics--are suing the Government for \n     billions. And the Government's case is weak. It's very \n     difficult to blame the contractors for what happened when top \n     Navy officials like Garrett, Elberfeld, and Cook all knew the \n     program was in deep trouble but did nothing about it. They \n     just kept shoveling more money at the contractors in the form \n     of fraudulent progress payments--payments made for work \n     that was not performed. In all probability, we are going \n     to end up spending even more money on a dead horse--mainly \n     because people like Garrett, Elberfeld and Cook didn't do \n     their jobs. Had any one of them done the right thing, the \n     A-12 might be in the fleet today.\n       Strom, I only ask that you review the IG's investigative \n     report and determine what role, if any, Captain Cook played \n     in the scheme to withhold and conceal adverse information on \n     the A-12 program.\n       I also ask that Captain Cook's performance not be evaluated \n     against the performance of the other A-12 program officers. I \n     respectfully request that he be judged against a much higher \n     standard of excellence. Please let me know what you decide.\n       Your consideration in this matter is greatly appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E. Grassley,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this letter raised several very serious \nquestions about Captain Cook's fitness for promotion to the rank of \nadmiral.\n  Specifically, my questions about Captain Cook pertained to his \nservice as chief engineer on the A-12 stealth bomber project that was \nterminated for default in January 1991.\n  The A-12 project collapsed because of an unresolved engineering \nproblem--uncontrolled increases in the weight of the airplane.\n  It was a ``show stopper,'' and Captain Cook was up to his ears in the \nwhole mess.\n  As the weight of the airplane grew, the schedule kept sliding, and \nthe price kept going up.\n  Eventually, this top priority Navy program was buried in a massive \ncost overrun.\n  This kind of mismanagement was bad enough by itself.\n  But A-12 mismanagement became a criminal enterprise when senior Navy \nofficials attempted to conceal and cover up the cost overrun with lies.\n  They attempted to hide the problem from the Secretary of Defense and \nthe Congress.\n  This behavior triggered a criminal investigation by the Inspector \nGeneral [IG] of the Department of Defense.\n  The IG concluded that Federal criminal laws were violated, and the \ncase was referred to the Justice Department for prosecution.\n  The investigation found several specific instances in which the \nSecretary of the Navy at the time, H. Lawrence Garrett, and A-12 \nprogram officials\n\n[[Page S11533]]\n\n``withheld, concealed, and/or suppressed adverse A-12 program \ninformation'' from the Secretary of Defense and the Congress.\n  That is a quote from the IG's criminal report.\n  I also believe the IG report shows that Captain Cook may have \nparticipated in the scheme to conceal and suppress adverse information \nabout the program.\n  These are very serious allegations.\n  They need to be addressed and resolved.\n  Maybe the Committee conducted an investigation and cleared him, but I \ndo not know that. The Committee has never bothered to tell me about it.\n  So I was very surprised and very disappointed to find Captain Cook's \nname on a July 1996 list of ``United States Navy Flag Officers.''\n  He has been confirmed and ``frocked.''\n  That means he wears an admiral's insignia but is still paid as a \ncaptain.\n  Once an admiral's billet opens up, he will assume the full duties and \nresponsibilities of an admiral.\n  Mr. President, I think the Committee owes me an explanation.\n  Mr. President, on September 27, I wrote a second time--1\\1/2\\ years \nlater--to Senator Thurmond, asking for a response.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this second letter printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 1996.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Strom, I am writing to follow up on my letter of May \n     15, 1995, regarding the nomination for promotion of Navy \n     Captain Jeffrey A. Cook.\n       In my letter to you of May 15, 1995, I raised several very \n     serious questions bearing on Captain Cook's fitness for \n     promotion to the rank of admiral. My questions were based on \n     a criminal investigation conducted by the Inspector General \n     of the Department of Defense. These questions pertained to \n     his service as chief engineer on the A-12 stealth bomber \n     project that was terminated for default in January 1991. \n     These questions suggest that Captain Cook may have \n     participated in a scheme to conceal adverse information on \n     the A-12 from both the Secretary of Defense and Congress.\n       In view of these allegations and since I never received a \n     response from you, I was very surprised and disappointed to \n     find Captain Cook's name on July 1996 list of ``United States \n     Navy Flag Officers.'' This list indicates that he has been \n     confirmed and ``frocked.'' Once an admiral's billet becomes \n     available, he will assume the full duties and \n     responsibilities of the rank.\n       Would you be kind enough to explain how your Committee \n     resolved the questions raised in my letter of May 15, 1995. \n     Had I known that your Committee was prepared to proceed with \n     this nomination, I would have liked to have had an \n     opportunity to raise my objections on the floor. Strom, we in \n     the Senate have a Constitutional responsibility to nurture \n     topnotch leadership in the Armed Forces. Officers who meet \n     those high standards should be praised and promoted. Those \n     who fail to meet the high standards should be weeded out.\n  I would appreciate a response to my letter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E. Grassley,\n                                                      U.S. Senate.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Had I known the committee was prepared to confirm \nCaptain Cook, I would have asked for an opportunity to raise my \nobjections on the floor.\n  Mr. President, we in the Senate have a constitutional responsibility \nto nurture topnotch leadership in the Armed Forces.\n  Officers who meet those standards should be praised and promoted.\n  Those who fail to meet those high standards should be weeded out.\n  Based on what I know right now today, I do not think Captain Cook \nmeets the highest standards nor should have been promoted to admiral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams).

I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Murkowski pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2150 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to one of the \nfinest men I have had the privilege to serve with in the U.S. Senate. I \nrefer to my very good friend, the senior Senator from Wyoming, Alan \nSimpson, who is retiring from the Senate. Al Simpson comes from a \nfamily with a rich Wyoming heritage.\n  Mr. President, from territorial days to the present, the Simpsons \nhave made Wyoming justifiably proud of their distinguished public \nservice. His father, Milward, served as Governor and then came to the \nSenate in 1962. Like his father, Al has a wonderful sense of humor, \neven if it is sometimes a bit ribald. He calls a sense of human ``the \nuniversal solvent against the abrasive elements of life.'' I know of no \none who lives up to that motto like my friend, Al Simpson.\n  Al has other sterling qualities that have made him one of the best-\nliked members of the Senate on either side of the aisle. His personal \nwarmth, his integrity, his loyalty, his sense of fairness, and his \nwillingness to listen to the concerns of his colleagues were attributes \nthat allowed him to do a superb job as assistant Republican leader for \n10 years.\n  Bob Dole could not have had a more loyal ``deputy'' than Al. \nPresident George Bush never had a more loyal friend than Al. Al spent \ncountless hours on the floor of the Senate and in the media as an \nadvocate and defender of his friend, President Bush.\n  I have served many years in the military and in combat as well and I \ncan attest that Al is the kind of loyal friend who you would want by \nyour side in battle. That includes legislative battles, too. For 18 \nyears--at my initial urging--he served with me on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. We have been through a great deal of controversial \nlegislation and nominations together. We have worked together side by \nside with never a cross word and always the highest level of mutual \nrespect and friendship.\n  When he leaves the Senate, he will leave behind a legacy of great \nlegislative achievements, particularly in the area of immigration. \nEarly on, Al was willing to take on the tough job of being the \nRepublican's subcommittee leader on immigration. While serving as \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, I appointed Al as chairman of the \nImmigration Subcommittee. No one appreciates his work more than I. \nImmigration issues are often emotionally charged. It takes a very \ntalented legislative leader to shepherd significant immigration \nlegislation through Congress. Al has done it with great effectiveness \nthroughout his career, and in this last week of the 104th Congress he \nonce again is about to lead us in the passage of an illegal immigration \nreform bill of which he can be very proud. He authored the Senate bill, \nand his influence on the final conference report is without peer.\n  He is tough, but fair, and his word is his bond. Accordingly, he is \njustly recognized by his colleagues on both sides of the aisle as an \nincredibly skillful legislator.\n  He is married to one of the most gracious, attractive ladies I have \nknown. As Al tells it, Ann Simpson got more votes for him than he did \nfor himself. She is much more than an effective campaigner. She has \nmade wonderful contributions to her State and the Nation through her \nwork on mental health issues, through her efforts on behalf of Ford's \nTheater, and in her work for the University of Wyoming, particularly \nthe art museum there.\n  I know that cowboy Al Simpson is not going to ``ride off into the \nsunset.'' He will maintain an active, stimulating life. His first \nventure will be a professorship at Harvard University. I am sure his \nstudents will be treated to some unforgettable Al Simpson stories which \nwill evoke both laughter and warmth.\n\n[[Page S11534]]\n\n  I will deeply miss that daily dosage of Al's humor and warmth. \nHowever, I am confident that we will continue to see each other and the \nreal friendship which we have will endure.\n  God bless both Al and Ann Simpson in all their endeavors.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I certainly join with the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee in that tribute to Senator Simpson. I \nthink we will all miss his daily dose of wit. And I certainly share \nthose sentiments.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I wish to thank the able Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11533-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11534-S11536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE GAG RULE AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Senator Wyden and I want to take a few minutes right now to \ntry to brief our colleagues, as well as our constituents and others, \nwho have been interested in the issue on the status of the so-called \ngag rule amendment. That is not perhaps a very glamorous name for what \nwe are talking about, so let me describe that briefly. Then we will try \nto provide a report, as I said, about the status of the negotiations \nand how we might try to conclude this matter.\n  People have heard the distinguished majority leader speak on several \noccasions about the effort to resolve this question. I think we are \nvery close to it and want to report that to our colleagues. First of \nall, what we are talking about is an assurance for physicians that they \nare able to communicate freely with their patients about their \npatients' health and about the medical care or treatment options that \nmight be important for their patients' health.\n  When these physicians are a part of a plan, like an HMO, for example, \nthey are constrained in certain ways with respect to what the plan \nprovides in the way of coverage and, therefore, in the way of \ntreatment. So this issue has evolved.\n  To what extent can the HMO limit the physicians in their \ncommunications with patients? Well, virtually no one wants to create \nthat kind of a conflict, at least intentionally, because clearly the \nphysician has an obligation to his patient, and we all want the \npatients to have the maximum degree of care. So we want to ensure that \nthis communication is not inhibited. What we have been involved in over \nthe last several days is trying to craft legislation that is not overly \nbroad but still ensures that degree of protection.\n  We have also tried to ensure that this is done to the maximum extent \npossible at the State level. We are not interested in some kind of a \nnew Federal mandate or new Federal program here. But, of course, we do \nat least need to get the process started here so that the States who \nhave not yet adopted statutes--and many have--but for those who have \nnot done so yet, that there would be an incentive for them to provide \nthe kind of protection for the kind of communication which we are \ntalking about.\n  We also want to ensure that there is a conscience clause provision \nhere that enables physicians who, for moral or religious beliefs, do \nnot want to get into certain discussions, that they would not have to \ndo so, and, likewise, that a provider, an HMO or other kind of insurer \nthat may have based its benefits on its beliefs, including religious \nbeliefs, be protected as well.\n  So these are not necessarily easy issues, but I think in terms of a \ngeneral concept, there has not been a great deal of disagreement. But \nnevertheless, trying to put this all together at this time of the year \nhas not been real easy.\n  I want to thank several people for their involvement in this, in \nparticular the majority leader, who has been most patient in waiting \nfor us to try to get this resolved; the assistant majority leader, who \nhas been personally involved in discussions on this to try to craft it \nin the right way; Senator Dan Coats, who has been involved; and several \nothers who have expressed an interest and given their input.\n\n  Senator Wyden and I have developed a series of drafts. Our most \nrecent draft, we think, is a very good product which achieves this goal \nbut with the minimum of difficulty. As we speak, even this draft is \nbeing revised to some extent to try to reflect the views of other \nSenators.\n  I urge that anyone who has an interest in this issue and would like \nto give us their views, or who has heard about a particular version of \nthis and would like to know what the actual most current version of it \nis, that they please communicate with us because we would be most \npleased to share our ideas with them and to get their ideas as well.\n  The majority leader would very much like to get this wrapped up. We \nwould, too. Therefore, again, I thank those who have been involved. We \nstand ready to try to wrap it up if people will give us their views. \nBut I think we have come to a point now where there are not very many \nissues that prevent us from doing this. I really urge any Senators who \nhave an interest to help us bring this to conclusion.\n  Under the previous agreement, at this time I yield the floor to \nSenator Wyden.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I want to thank the Senator from Arizona for not just his \nvery thoughtful statement, but for all of the effort over these last \nfew weeks. He and I got to know each other in the House and enjoyed \nworking together, and it has been a pleasure to work with my friend \nfrom Arizona on it. I share Senator Kyl's view that we have had a \nnumber of Senators--I see Senator Nickles is here and Senator Coats on \nthe Republican side; Senator Kennedy, for example, on the Democratic \nside--that have been working some very long hours and working in good \nfaith to try to deal with this. I believe we are now very close in \nterms of dealing with the issue.\n  I just want to spend a minute and try to outline the problem and then \ntalk a bit more about some of the remedies that Senator Kyl has talked \nabout.\n  The reason this issue is so important is that managed care is the \nfastest growing part of American medicine. Now, health care, we know, \nis a multibillion dollar industry. The fastest growing part of it is \nmanaged care. I want to make it clear that there is a lot of good \nmanaged care in our country. I come from a part of our Nation, the \nState of Oregon, that has been a pioneer in the managed care field. We \nhave seen good managed care. If you want to see 21st century medicine, \nyou can come to my State and see a lot of it in action every day.\n  But, unfortunately, too often we have seen that financial concerns, \nconcerns about expensive treatments or referrals, have replaced what is \nthe important essence of American health care, which is free and \nunfettered communication between doctors and patients.\n  These limitations are what is known as gag clauses. A health \nmaintenance organization may say to the doctors, ``We're watching you \nin terms of those expensive treatments.'' Or the health maintenance \norganization will say to the doctors, ``We're keeping track of the \nreferrals that you're making,'' with an idea that perhaps a doctor who \ntells about an additional provider outside the network is doing \nsomething detrimental to the plan.\n  We can have differences of opinion--and Senator Kyl and I have talked \nabout this before--on a lot of health care issues. Reasonable people \nsurely differ with respect to the role of the Federal Government, the \nrole of the private sector. There are lots of issues in American health \ncare that there can be legitimate differences of opinion on.\n\n  I offer up the judgment that what should never be in dispute is the \nimportance of patients and families to get all the facts, to get the \ntruth, to get all the information about the various issues relating to \ntheir medical condition and the treatments that are available. In fact, \nI think 21st century health care is about getting information over the \nInternet. The kind of legislation we are talking about today is going \nto be built around empowering patients to get the information so as \nthey look at the various options that they might consider for their \ntreatment, they can do it on the basis of having all the facts.\n  Now, Senator Kyl has outlined briefly a few of the issues that we \nhave focused on in some depth. Let me just add to them very briefly. \nThe first is on the matter of the regulatory framework and the role of \nthe Federal Government and the States. What Senator Kyl and I have \ndone, in very blunt, straightforward terms, is make it clear\n\n[[Page S11535]]\n\nthe States will take the lead with respect to carrying out this \nstatute. Congress has done this before in a number of areas, done it in \nthe Medigap area, done it in the maternity stay legislation. The \nlegislation that we offer up and is based on our discussion, basically \nmakes it clear when a State acts in a way that is rationally connected \nto the purposes of this statute, the State is going to be in a position \nto take the lead.\n  Second, we know there are many who are concerned with respect to an \nissue that comes up in this body quite often, and that is reproductive \nhealth issues, in the matter of abortion specifically. We have sought \nto make sure that each individual practitioner or doctor can exercise \nwhat amounts to a ``conscience clause'' and be able to express that for \nreligious or moral reasons, there are certain matters--abortion--that \nthey would not be comfortable discussing. We also thought to make it \nclear that plans would have certain rights, particularly to make it \nclear to their individual practitioners, doctors, and others, that the \nplan did not offer abortion services.\n  There are other ideas that may be worth exploring, built principally \non the concept of disclosure. Plans ought to know they are not going to \nbe subject to unexpected legal consequences, and the consumer ought to \nbe in a position to get full disclosure of exactly what their plan \noffers. I believe we have made considerable headway in that regard.\n  We believe, with a bit more work and the kind of good faith we have \nseen over these last few weeks--and it is important to note that the \nsame spirit exists in the House. Dr. Ganske of Iowa and Congressman \nMarkey, like Senator Kyl and I, have been working on a bipartisan \nbasis, with the idea that these gag clauses have no place in 21st \ncentury American health care.\n  Mr. President, 21st century American health care ought to be built \naround the idea that when patients and families sit down with their \nphysician, their physician would give them all the facts, all the \ninformation they need, to make these choices.\n  I want to thank Senator Kyl. He knows when I offered this the first \ntime we got a majority of votes in the U.S. Senate, but the point is to \nget something that is going to bring the entire Senate together, to \nbring all the Members together around a proposition of full consumer \ndisclosure and consumer empowerment. I think we can do that.\n\n  We are putting the States in the lead. This is not an example of \nFederal micromanagement or Federal Government run wild. We are going to \nmake sure that plans and practitioners, who, for religious or moral \nreasons, have concerns about discussing abortion, and others, would be \nprotected. I think we do it in a way that is sensitive to legitimate \nconcerns of many in the field for managed care plans. For example, we \nhave important provisions on utilization review. Those managed care \nplans ask for those. That is part of our compromise.\n  Let me at this time yield, because I know there are a number of \nSenators who have been working in good faith and want to participate in \nthis. Therefore, I yield back to Senator Kyl and our other colleagues \nwho have been putting some long hours on this. I am looking forward to \nstaying with this until we get these protections for consumers and \ndoctors, and do it in a fair way.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, before the distinguished acting majority \nleader speaks to this, I thank Senator Wyden for his bipartisan \ncooperation and make the point with all of the things we have to do \nhere at the end of the session to finish the Nation's business, the \nassistant majority leader, the Senator from Oklahoma, is right in the \nmiddle of all of that, yet he has taken the time to personally be \ninvolved to improve this legislation.\n  If we are able to craft an agreement here, it will be in no small \npart due to the ideas that he brought into the debate to ensure, for \nexample, that the State control was preeminent and that some of the \nother protections that we have in here are here.\n  Again, I want to thank him, as well as Senator Coats, for all of \ntheir contributions to this effort, too. It has gotten us much closer \nto the goal line than we otherwise would have been.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, to the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenator from Oregon, flattery will get you everywhere, and may well end \nup getting an amendment.\n  Let me state, Mr. President, my thoughts. Originally, I will tell my \nfriends and colleagues that I thought this was not the right way or the \nright time to legislate such an important matter. I am very dubious at \nthe outset when I see legislative actions taking play the last day or \ntwo of the session, when measures have not had time to have hearings \nand have the benefit of congressional thought, hearings, markup, input \nfrom people on all sides.\n  This is important legislation. I will tell my colleague from Oregon \nwho originally introduced this and had the assistance of the Senator \nfrom Arizona, the thrust of it I would concur. I also want to \ncompliment the Senators from Oregon and Arizona for their willingness \nto be flexible, to understand that some of us did have serious \nconcerns, concerns about making sure we protect the rights of States. \nThey have shown a willingness to do that. Some States have acted. We \nwant to compliment those States. We do not want to preempt their \nactions.\n  Also, dealing with religious institutions, I think, we still have a \nlittle way to go there. I know we will confer more tonight, and maybe \ntomorrow we can bring that to a conclusion. I, for one, want to make \nsure we would not be mandating to, for example, a religious \ninstitution, a Catholic hospital, or something that might have a clause \nthat physicians that would work within this institution would not \nprovide assistance to suicide, for example. I do not want to pass \nlegislation in the wee hours that might outlaw or ban that particular \nclause or section of their contract.\n\n  I want to be careful. I know we are probably on about the ninth \ndraft. I think the legislation has been improved significantly.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues who have worked so hard, including \nSenator Coats, as well as Senator Wyden and Senator Kyl, for their \ninput on this legislation, and just state to my colleagues that we will \ncontinue working in good faith, and if we are able to resolve some of \nthe few remaining differences, it may well be that we can have some \nlegislation that would be acceptable, and maybe as an amendment to the \ncontinuing resolution or as independent legislation. So I compliment my \ncolleagues for their willingness and their patience to work with some \nof us, and we will continue working.\n  I see an effort by many to legislate a whole agenda in the last two \ndays of Congress. I urge people to be maybe a little more patient and \nwait for next year. The continuing resolution is growing, and that, to \nme, is not really the best way to legislate. So I urge our colleagues \nto realize that they don't have to do everything on this one bill. I \nalso urge my colleagues to speak out on the public lands bill that \nSenator Murkowski has been working so hard on. There is no reason for \nus not to be able to pass this package, which I believe will probably \nhave an overwhelming vote of support by both Houses of Congress.\n  I think the administration is, unfortunately, moving the goal posts. \nWe removed the major veto threats in that legislation in the last 24 to \n48 hours. Yet, now they are finding more objections. I even say that \nmaybe that is not in good faith, and that bothers me. There has been a \nlot of work by Members on both sides of the aisle. That bill was a \nbipartisan bill, and it should pass. I know the Senator from Minnesota \nreluctantly dropped an amendment that was very important to him. The \nSenator from Alaska dropped an amendment that was very important to \nhim, and others were able to make concessions so we could pass an \nomnibus bill that is important to most of the Members in this body. It \nwould be unfortunate indeed if we didn't pass this bill before we \nadjourn this Congress.\n  Finally, I want to say something on the immigration bill. The \nadministration sent signals that they would sign that if we dropped the \nGallegly amendment. We did drop the Gallegly amendment. Now there have \nbeen additional requests for additional modifications. I find that, \ntoo, moving the goal posts. I hope we will take up the immigration bill \nand pass it, as amended, without the Gallegly amendment. I think we\n\n[[Page S11536]]\n\nwill have an overwhelming vote in both Houses--well, the House already \npassed it by an overwhelming vote. I think in the Senate we will, as \nwell. I urge colleagues to be patient and not try to pass everything on \ntheir legislative agenda in the next two days.\n  Let us work together and finish the unfinished appropriations bills, \nthe continuing resolution, do it responsibly. Again, I thank my \ncolleague from Oregon and my colleague from Arizona for their \nwillingness to be at least flexible enough for some of us who had \nconcerns about their amendments. Perhaps we can get that resolved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I want to tell the Senator from Oklahoma that we very much \nappreciate his involvement in this. I only asked for 5 additional \nminutes because I want to go back to negotiating with him and his staff \non it. As you know, Senator Kennedy has done yeoman work on this and \nhas been very involved in this as well. I think we are going to have \ngood input and involvement on both sides of the aisle if we try to \nfinish it up.\n  I think it is important that the Senate and the country understand \nthat what we are talking about is ensuring that straightforward, honest \nconversation could take place between doctors, nurses, chiropractors, \ntherapists, and their patients. That is all we are talking about here--\ninformation, and those honest, straightforward discussions. Right now, \nbecause of these gag clauses, that kind of communication so often can't \ntake place. That is not right. That is what we are going to try to \nchange.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senate for the additional time. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11534-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, last week the Senate took a few moments to \npass a resolution honoring the service of Sergeant-at-Arms Howard \nGreene, who is leaving after a 28 year career with this body. I was \naway from the Senate floor during the discussion of that resolution, \nbut I did not want this Congress to adjourn without having had the \nopportunity to share my appreciation for Howard Greene's service to the \nSenate, and for his personal friendship during my tenure here.\n  Mr. President, much of the important work which we do here in the \nSenate could not be accomplished without the dedication of the \nprofessional staff members who serve the Senate, and Howard Greene has \nbeen the consummate professional. His love for the Senate; his keen \nunderstanding of its workings and its constitutional role; his \ndiscretion and his tact, have gone hand-in-hand with Howard Greene's \nfundamental decency and sense of public service to make him one of the \nSenate's greatest assets for many, many years. I doubt that there is a \nsingle Member of this body who has not benefited from Howard's counsel, \nhis industry, his knowledge of the Senate, or his friendship. I know \nthat I have gained a great deal from each.\n  I am especially proud that Howard is a fellow Delawarean, and have \nalways believed that his sense of public service embodies the \nbipartisan tradition that is the hallmark of our State. As Sergeant-at-\nArms, or Secretary to the majority, or in any of the roles he has \nundertaken during his long career here, Howard has been a source of \nwisdom and assistance, counsel and comfort to all Senators, Republican \nand Democrat alike. He has been a fundamental believer in the idea that \nonce the election is over, we are all public servants, and he has \nworked tirelessly to enable us to fulfill the trust that the people of \nour States have placed in us.\n  Mr. President, the halls of Congress are filled with idealistic young \npeople who have come to Washington hoping for a career in public \nservice.

Mr. President, these last few days mark the last that we \nwill have the pleasure of working with some of the most talented and \ndedicated Senators to have served in the U.S. Senate. That's because 13 \nof our finest Members will be retiring this year.\n  Recently, former Senator Warren Rudman wrote that ``As a Senator I \nhad enjoyed sitting down with colleagues like George Mitchell, Sam \nNunn, Bill Bradley, Joe Biden, and Ted Kennedy and saying, `We have a \nproblem here--let's find a way to solve it.' They were Democrats, to \nthe left of me politically, but just because we saw things differently \nI didn't question their morality or their patriotism. I didn't come to \nWashington to cram things down people's throats or to have people cram \nanything down my throat. I thought the essence of good government was \nreconciling divergent views with compromises that served the country's \ninterests.''\n  All of the Senators retiring at the end of this Congress have set \ntheir moral compasses in the direction of compromises to best serve the \ncountry's interests. In doing so, they have served their constituents, \nthe U.S. Senate and the Nation well.\n  They understood that the arbitrary labels many are so insistent to \nplace on each other, in the end, fall short and are inadequate to \ndescribe an individual's commitment to country. That in fact, to weigh \na life, a community's future or a country's needs, a different type of \nscale is required.\n  In a pluralistic society such as ours, there are many ways to \nconfront a problem and arrive at a solution. These fine Senators \nrecognized that their job was to reach a principled position amidst all \nof these often conflicting choices. Henry Kissinger put it another way \nsaying, ``The public life of every political figure is a continual \nstruggle to rescue an element of choice from the pressure of \ncircumstance.''\n  They saw that the preoccupation with these labels is what grips us in \ngridlock. And that paralysis can cripple a nation's ability to solve \nits problems and move forward. With their fine guidance we have been \nable to move beyond gridlock on issues of great importance to the \neveryday lives of all Americans from health care reforms to important \nbudget and spending questions, energy, immigration, the elderly, and \njudicial matters.\n  When judging the choices they've made, I believe history will look \nback on their service with great respect and admiration. Over and over \nagain, when confronted with conflict or when called upon for \nleadership, they insisted that their decisions answer the larger \nquestions: Will it stand the test of time for our country? Will our \ncountry gain strength from this decision? Time and again, their \nguidance has resulted in policies that have come to define our country \nand the common vision we hold as a nation.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to extend my personal thanks to \nSenators Sam Nunn, Nancy Kassebaum, Howell Heflin, David Pryor, \nClaiborne Pell,\n\n[[Page S11537]]\n\nJim Exon, Hank Brown, Alan Simpson, Paul Simon, Bill Bradley, Mark \nHatfield, Bennett Johnston, and Bill Cohen for a job well done and my \nwishes for continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11536-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SECTION 405 OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT OF 1965\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to address a situation \nresulting from the Department of Education's interpretation of section \n435 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 [HEA] which has adversely \nimpacted many schools in Florida and across the country. In 1990, \nCongress amended the act to prohibit institutions from continuing their \nparticipation in the Federal Family Education Loan [FFEL] Program if \ntheir cohort default rate is equal to or above the threshold percentage \nfor the 3 consecutive years ``for which data is available.'' Along \nsimilar lines, this year Congress passed additional legislation which \nrequired that any school terminated from the FFEL program will no \nlonger be eligible to receive Pell Grants for its students.\n  However, the Department of Education has taken the position that this \nlaw will be enforced using default rate data for years 1991, 1992, and \n1993. Schools have already received their prepublished 1994 rates, many \nwhich are below the current threshold requirement, and some are even \nhalf of what they were in years prior. Despite this achievement, the \nDepartment has terminated or is currently terminating schools based on \ntheir 1991, 1992, and 1993 rate--not on their 1994 rate--because the \nDepartment does not consider the 1994 rate to be ``available'' until it \nis published. Based upon their technicality, the Department is \nessentially punishing schools which have implemented costly default \nmanagement programs and achieved the desired result of the law--\nreducing their cohort default rate.\n  Mr. President, the intent of this law was for schools to educate \ntheir students about the importance of repaying their loans, and \nestablished a 3-year period within which a school must take proper \nmeasures to reduce its cohort default rate. It is perfectly acceptable \nfor Congress to enact legislation to protect taxpayers from the costs \nassociated with high default rates, and current law does so by \nrequiring those involved in the Federal student loan process to educate \nstudents about the importance of repayment. However, I do not believe \nthat Congress intended for schools which have reduced their default \nrate to be terminated from these programs.\n  Given this late hour, it is unlikely that legislation addressing this \nsituation will be enacted prior to the close of the 104th Congress. \nTherefore, I ask the Department to do everything in its power to use \nthe most recent data when evaluating the eligibility status of these \ninstitutions. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11537-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11537-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT OF THE RAILROAD RETIREMENT BOARD FOR FISCAL YEAR 1995--MESSAGE \n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 172\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith the Annual Report of the Railroad Retirement \nBoard for Fiscal Year 1995, pursuant to the provisions of section \n7(b)(6) of the Railroad Retirement Act and section 12 (1) of the \nRailroad Unemployment Insurance Act.\n                                                  William J.

Also transmitted is a \nsection-by-section analysis. This legislative proposal is vital to \nAmerican workers, offering them a meaningful and flexible opportunity \nto balance successfully their work and family responsibilities.\n  The legislation would offer workers more choice and flexibility in \nfinding ways to earn the wages they need to support their families \nwhile also spending valuable time with their families. In particular, \nthe legislation would allow eligible employees who work overtime to \nreceive compensatory time off--with a limit of up to 80 hours per \nyear--in lieu of monetary compensation. In addition, the legislation \ncontains explicit protections against coercion by employers and abuses \nby unstable or unscrupulous businesses.\n  The legislation also would amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of \n1993. This statute currently allows eligible workers at businesses with \n50 or more employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected \nleave to care for a newborn child, attend to their own serious health \nneeds, or care for a seriously ill parent, child, or spouse. Although \nenactment of this statute was a major step forward in helping families \nbalance work and family obligations, the law does not address many \nsituations that working families typically confront. The enclosed \nlegislation would cover more of these situations, thereby enhancing \nworkers' ability to balance their need to care for their children and \nelderly relatives without sacrificing their employment obligations. \nUnder the expanded law, workers could take up to 24 hours of unpaid \nleave each year to fulfill additional, specified family obligations, \nwhich would include participating in school activities that relate \ndirectly to the academic advancement of their children, accompanying \nchildren or elderly relatives to routine medical appointments, and \nattending to other health or care needs of elderly relatives.\n  I urge the Congress to give this legislation favorable consideration.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the breaking of the \ncolor barrier in major league baseball by Jackie Robinson; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n               The Jackie Robinson Commemorative Coin Act\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and 64 \ncolleagues, I rise today to introduce the Jackie Robinson Commemorative \nCoin Act. It is appropriate and important that the Congress honor \nJackie Robinson, a true American hero who rose above prejudice and \nsegregation to become a pillar of our national pastime--and a leader in \nthe fight for racial equality. The bill would authorize the U.S. Mint \nto commemorate the 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's historic and \nheroic act of breaking baseball's color barrier.\n  Mr. President, the life story of this great American citizen is so \nuplifting. It is a story of a pioneer, a man of many many, ``firsts.''\n  As a young boy growing up in New York, I was consumed by baseball \nlike so many others. I have a personal connection to Jackie Robinson \nand the legendary Brooklyn Dodgers. Those were certainly the banner \ndays for baseball, in New York and elsewhere. Jackie Robinson, one of \nthe all stars with the legendary Brooklyn Dodgers, stood as tall as one \nof New York's skyscrapers themselves.\n  Jackie Robinson's courage, quiet determination and competitive spirit \nwere evident throughout his life. At UCLA, Jackie Robinson was the \nfirst four-letter man excelling at football, basketball, track, and \nbaseball.\n  Although he was far along the path to a promising future in sports, \nJackie Robinson had to leave college after 3 years to support his \nmother. He realized that coming to his mother's aid in a time of need \nwas a more compelling priority. Jackie Robinson was a giving, unselfish \nman, and devoted son.\n  In 1942, Jackie Robinson faced another noble calling. He joined the \nArmy to serve his country during World War II. In his 3 years of \nservice, Jackie rose to the rank of 2d lieutenant and attended Officers \nCandidate School. The atmosphere of segregation in the Army inspired \nhim to forge ahead and begin a quiet but lifelong determined effort to \nfight discrimination.\n\n  After the Army, Jackie Robinson returned to his true dream--playing \nbaseball. Despite the color barrier, Jackie Robinson persisted. Jackie \nRobinson experienced the ugly face of bigotry firsthand playing for the \nNegro Baseball League in 1945. It was commonplace to have hotel and \nrestaurant doors shut in his face. He withstood vicious taunts and \nthreats from fans. Even some of his own teammates would not acknowledge \nhim.\n  But those affronts and experiences did not diminish Jackie Robinson's \nspirit. Eventually, his excellence and determination prevailed. In 1946 \nhe joined the Montreal Royals minor-league team in the Dodgers \norganization. That same year, he was recognized as the MVP of the \nleague, the first of many baseball honors.\n  In 1947, Jackie Robinson became prominent in the history of our \nNation and its great pastime. He penetrated the color barrier in \nbaseball when he was brought up to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers. This \nbreakthrough reverberated throughout all professional sports and is \nacknowledged today as a watershed event in the continuing struggle for \nracial equality.\n  Mr. President, in late 1947, Jackie Robinson was named Rookie of the \nYear, actually the first so-named in the major leagues. Then in 1949 he \nwas named MVP of the National League. Throughout his 11-year career \nwith the Dodgers, Jackie Robinson won batting titles, set fielding \nrecords, and was feared as a base stealer.\n  Another first occurred in 1962 when Jackie Robinson became the first \nAfrican-American to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame located \nin Cooperstown, NY.\n  Mr. President, for many of us, especially, those of my generation, \nJackie Robinson is synonymous with baseball. He dazzled and electrified \ncrowds with his energetic performances on the field. Time and time \nagain, he brought fans to their feet. At the same time, he united a \nwhole city with his personal enthusiasm, and baseball excellence. But, \nJackie Robinson, the man transformed his greatness on the baseball \ndiamond to greatness in his community, hitting homeruns for his fellow \nman. In many ways, Jackie Robinson united our Nation through all of his \nachievements.\n  After retiring from professional baseball, he entered a life of \nservice to his\n\n[[Page S11541]]\n\ncommunity. He donned the many hats of businessman, community leader, \nand civil rights activist. His dedication to bringing down social \nbarriers thrived. He provided affordable housing to low-income families \nthrough the Jackie Robinson Development Corp. He helped spur economic \ndevelopment in Harlem by founding the Freedom National Bank, now a \nprosperous financial institution. As vice president for personnel at a \nwell-known fast-food chain, he championed the cause of increasing \nbenefits for workers and their families.\n  Mr. President, Jackie Robinson remains an inspiration to this Nation \nand a commemorative coin will serve as a fitting tribute to this great \nman. In the spirit of honoring our greatest American heroes, I am \nintroducing this bill which would authorize silver dollar commemorative \ncoins to be minted in 1997 celebrating the 50th anniversary of breaking \nthe color barrier in American baseball by Jackie Robinson. Once the \nMint has recovered its costs, profits would go to the Jackie Robinson \nFoundation, a public, not-for-profit organization.\n  The focus of the Jackie Robinson Foundation is to make educational \nand leadership development opportunities available to minority youths \nof limited financial resources. Full 4-year college scholarships are \nawarded to those youths who meet the selection criteria of the \nfoundation. These criteria are based on academic achievement, community \nservice, leadership potential, and financial need.\n  The successes of the foundation's primary goal are undeniable. Since \nits inception, over 400 young adults from all parts of this Nation have \nbenefited from participation with most students obtaining degrees in \nengineering, science and related fields. And furthermore, the \ngraduation rate of the foundation participants is 92 percent, one of \nthe best in our country.\n\n  The Jackie Robinson Foundation was established by Mrs. Rachel \nRobinson a year following Jackie Robinson's untimely death. She has \nworked tirelessly to keep his inspiration alive through her gentle \nstrength and relentless determination. Jackie Robinson once said of his \nwife of 26 years--``strong, loving, gentle, and brave, never afraid to \neither criticize or comfort.'' Rachel Robinson is truly an incredible \nwoman. I can attest to that.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from New York, Floyd \nFlake for his leadership and dedication in this matter. I would also \nlike to extend a deep appreciation to all cosponsors for their \nincredible support in realizing this effort. I owe a special debt of \ngratitude to the Honorable Robert Rubin, Secretary of the Treasury and \nPhilip Diehl, Director of the U.S. Mint for their support.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2136\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I wonder if my friend from New York will make sure I \nam added as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I am delighted. I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMurkowski be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG:\n  S. 2137. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to make misuse \nof information received from the National Crime Information Center a \ncriminal offense; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n THE NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION CENTER DATABASE PROTECTION ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I introduce the National Crime \nInformation Center [NCIC] Database Protection Act of 1996. This \nlegislation will make it a Federal offense to purposely misuse the NCIC \ndata base.\n  The NCIC was originally established in order to centralize \ninformation about outstanding warrants and criminal history of citizens \nof the United States. This data-base allows law enforcement agencies \nacross the United States to have access to any information regarding \nsuspected criminals within their jurisdictions. It is an indisputable \nfact that the NCIC has helped apprehend thousands of criminals over the \nyears, including Timothy McVeigh, who allegedly bombed the Oklahoma \nCity Federal building. By providing instantaneous and accurate \ninformation about individuals with criminal pasts, NCIC has helped \nreduce recidivism and identify those people who are dangerous to \nsociety.\n  It also is an indisputable fact that those individuals whose names \nare included on the data-base have a right to privacy. They have a \nright to feel secure that their information will be available only to \nlaw enforcement and that the information will be accessed only when it \nis necessary for law enforcement to perform their prescribed duties.\n  Over the past several years, there have been instances when the NCIC \nhas been used by individuals other than law enforcement officers to \ncheck the backgrounds of individuals who are not having a routine \nbackground check or under suspicion of a crime. In some cases, law \nenforcement officers themselves have used the data-base improperly. For \ninstance, NCIC was used by a drug gang in Pennsylvania to identify \nnarcotics agents. The gang got the NCIC information through a corrupt \npolice officer.\n  NCIC was used by an Arizona law enforcement official to locate his \nex-girlfriend and kill her. The data-base has also been used by private \ndetectives doing background investigations on political candidates.\n  Unfortunately, these chilling tales are becoming far too common and \nthere is no ready mechanism under which the perpetrators of these \ncrimes can be prosecuted for misusing the NCIC data-base.\n  There is an obvious need for a law that states in no uncertain terms \nthat the NCIC should not be readily available to any non-law \nenforcement officers or for any unofficial purposes. We need to send a \nmessage that those who are caught violating the privacy of others \nthrough NCIC will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to support this legislation and join in my \noutrage at the ease with which NCIC information is available to \ncriminals. Our Nation's private citizens are not safe from those who \nwould exploit their personal information.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the provisions in the bill be included \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2137\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MISUSE OF INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM THE NATIONAL \n                   CRIME INFORMATION CENTER.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 101 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 2077. Misuse of information received from the National \n       Crime Information Center.\n\n       ``Whoever obtains information from the National Crime \n     Information Center without authorization under law or uses \n     information lawfully received for purposes not authorized by \n     law shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more \n     than 3 years, or both.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The chapter analysis for chapter \n     101 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n\n``2077. Misuse of information received from the National Crime \n              Information Center.''.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG:\n\n  S. 2138. A bill to clarify the standards for State sex offender \nregistration programs under the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against \nChildren and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n   THE JACOB WETTERLING CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN AND SEXUALLY VIOLENT \n                OFFENDER REGISTRATION AMENDMENTS OF 1996\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I introduce the Jacob Wetterling \nCrimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration \nAmendments of 1996.\n  The current Jacob Wetterling Act is an effective and responsible way \nto keep track of sexually violent predators, especially those who prey \non our children. This act requires States to implement a program \nthrough which these types of offenders, once on parole, must register \ntheir places of residence with State and local law enforcement \nagencies. I have always supported the premise behind this provision in \nthe 1994 crime bill, as I believe it provides law enforcement with the \ninformation necessary to locate prior offenders, should they strike \nagain.\n\n[[Page S11543]]\n\n  I was particularly pleased to support this provision because New \nHampshire has had an exemplary sex offender registration program for \nseveral years. In fact, the Department of Justice has complimented the \nGranite State's program as one of the best in the Nation.\n  Despite my support of the Jacob Wetterling Act, I call on the Senate \nto amend this legislation because it has come to my attention that this \nact has established parameters for compliance that are too restrictive. \nIn fact, according to the Department of Justice, while most States have \nestablished successful sex offender registration programs, not one is \nin compliance with the narrowly drawn provisions outlined in the bill.\n  This fact is particularly distressing considering that the penalty \nfor non-compliance is the loss of 10 percent of that State's Edward \nByrne Memorial Grant funds. States that already run successful \nregistration programs do not deserve such a penalty.\n  The amendments that I propose will allow States to be in compliance \nwith Jacob Wetterling while retaining their own unique system of \nregistering sexually violent offenders.\n  First, this legislation would allow States to devise their own way of \nregistering paroled offenders. Current law requires States to conduct a \nmail registration system, which is costly. In New Hampshire and other \nStates, the current system requires offenders to register in person at \ntheir local police departments. My amendments would allow these States \nto retain their current, successful systems.\n  Second, my bill would amend the current provision that requires \nStates to create a board of experts, whose purpose is to determine \nwhether an offender should be labeled as sexually violent and required \nto register. My amendment would allow States to make this determination \nthrough an assessment of the individual for purposes of a sentencing \nenhancement determination. My own State of New Hampshire is an example \nof the latter situation in that all people required to register have \nbeen designated as sexually violent by a psychiatrist at the time of \nsentencing. In New Hampshire, no State board needs to be created.\n  Finally, my bill would allow sex offenders to first register with \nlocal law enforcement agencies, who then pass the information to the \nState, the FBI, and other appropriate agencies.\n  These amendments simply recognize that it is not the role of the \nFederal Government to devise each State's system for dealing with its \nparoled offenders. Each State's methods and needs are different. The \nFederal Government should not mandate that each of them conduct \nidentical programs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the provisions in the bill be included \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2138\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AMENDMENT OF STANDARDS FOR STATE SEX OFFENDER \n                   REGISTRATION PROGRAMS.\n\n       Section 170101 of the Violent Crime Control and Law \n     Enforcement Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-322) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(1), by striking ``with a designated \n     State law enforcement agency'' in each of subparagraph (A) \n     and subparagraph (B);\n       (2) in subsection (a)(2), by inserting before the period \n     the following: ``, or pursuant to an assessment for purposes \n     of a sentencing enhancement determination'';\n       (3) in subsection (a)(3)(C), by inserting before the period \n     the following: ``, or means a person who has been convicted \n     of a sexually violent offense and has received an enhanced \n     sentence based on a determination that the person is a \n     serious danger to others due to a gravely abnormal mental \n     condition'';\n       (4) in subsection (b)(1)(A)--\n       (A) in clause (ii), by striking ``give'' and all that \n     follows through ``days'' and inserting ``report the change of \n     address as provided by State law''; and\n       (B) in clause (iii), by striking ``shall register'' and all \n     that follows through ``requirement'' and inserting ``shall \n     report the change of address as provided by State law and \n     comply with any registration requirement in the new State of \n     residence'';\n       (5) by amending paragraph (2) of subsection (b) to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(2) Transfer of information to state and the federal \n     bureau of investigation.--The officer, or in the case of a \n     person placed on probation, the court, shall forward the \n     registration information to the agency responsible for \n     registration under State law.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to require the \nuse of child safety restraint systems approved by the Secretary of \nTransportation on commercial aircraft, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n               The Children's Airline Safety Act of 1996\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President I introduce legislation that would \nprotect our Nation's small children as they travel on aircraft. We \ncurrently have Federal regulations that require the safety of \npassengers on commercial flights. However, neither flight attendants \nnor an infant's parents can protect unrestrained infants in the event \nof an airline accident or severe turbulence. A child on a parent's lap \nwill likely break free from the adult's arms as a plane takes emergency \naction or encounters extreme turbulence.\n  This child then faces two serious hazards. First, the child may be \ninjured as they strike the aircraft interior. Second, the parents may \nnot be able to find the infant after a crash. The United/Sioux City, IA \ncrash provides one dark example. On impact, no parent was able to hold \non to her/his child. One child was killed when he flew from his \nmother's hold. Another child was rescued from an overhead compartment \nby a stranger.\n  In July 1994 during the fatal crash of a USAir plane in Charlotte, \nNC, another unrestrained infant was killed when her mother could not \nhold onto her on impact. The available seat next to the mother survived \nthe crash intact. The National Transportation Safety Board believes \nthat had the baby been secured in the seat, she would have been alive \ntoday. In fact, in a FAA study on accident survivability, the agency \nfound that of the last nine infant deaths, five could have survived had \nthey been in child restraint devices.\n  Turbulence creates very serious problems for unrestrained infants. In \nfour separate incidences during the month of June, passengers and \nflight attendants were injured when their flights hit sudden and \nviolent turbulence. In one of these, a flight attendant reported that a \nbaby seated on a passenger's lap went flying through the air during \nturbulence and was caught by another passenger. This measure is \nendorsed by the National Transportation Safety Board and the Aviation \nConsumer Action Project.\n  We must protect those unable to protect themselves. Just as we \nrequire seatbelts, motorcycle helmets, and car seats, we must mandate \nrestraint devices that protect our youngest citizens. I urge my \ncolleagues to support\n\n[[Page S11544]]\n\nthis legislation that ensures our kids remain passengers and not \nvictims.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Exon, and Mr. \n        D'Amato):\n  S. 2140. A bill to limit the use of the exclusionary rule in school \ndisciplinary proceedings; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     THE SAFER SCHOOLS ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I come to the floor, Mr. President, along with my \ncolleague, Senator Feinstein, from California, to introduce legislation \nthat will help keep our kids safe from gun violence in school. It is \nlate in the session to do this, but I am joined in this effort by the \nSenator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. \nExon, and the Senator from New York, Mr. D'Amato. I want to describe \nwhat this legislation is and why it is necessary at this point.\n  Yesterday, in the Washington Post, there was a tiny little paragraph \nat the bottom of a section called ``Around the Nation.'' It is the \nsmallest of paragraphs describing the fate of a man named Horace \nMorgan. Horace Morgan was a teacher who, as reported in yesterday's \nnews, was killed trying to break up a fight at a school for problem \nstudents in Scottdale, GA. He was fatally shot by a teenager. He had \ntaught English and language arts at the De Kalb County Alternative \nSchool for 10 years. This teacher died of multiple gunshot wounds. A \n16-year-old student was arrested. This was not headlines. It was not \nthe front section. It was not on the front page--a tiny little \nparagraph in the newspaper about a teacher being shot in school, a \nteacher named Horace Morgan dying of multiple gunshot wounds.\n  The point is that it is not so uncommon that it warrants headlines in \nthis country when a student shoots and kills a teacher. About 2 years \nago, Senator Feinstein and I wrote the Gun-Free Schools Act, which is \nnow law. The Gun-Free Schools Act says there shall be zero tolerance on \nthe issue of guns in schools--no excuses, no tolerance. Guns do not \nbelong in schools. Schools are places of learning. Students cannot \nbring guns to school to threaten other students. Bring a gun to school \nand you will be expelled for 1 year--no tolerance, no excuses, no ifs, \nands or buts. No guns in schools. Bring a gun, you are expelled for a \nyear. That is now the law.\n  A week ago yesterday, I came to the Senate floor and again spoke on \nthe issue of guns in schools. I did this because, as I was shaving in \nthe morning getting ready for work, I heard a news piece on NBC \ntelevision that so infuriated me I wanted to address it right away. The \nnews story was about an appellate court in New York that had ruled a \nstudent who brought a gun to school should not have been expelled for a \nyear because the security aide who found the gun did not have \nreasonable suspicion to search the student.\n  The facts of this case made me so angry because it simply stands \ncommon sense on its head. In 1992, Juan C. was stopped by a school \nsecurity aide who said he saw a bulge resembling the handle of a gun \ninside Juan's leather jacket. The aide grabbed for the bulge, which was \nindeed a loaded .45 semiautomatic handgun.\n  Juan was expelled for school for one year. This internal disciplinary \naction is consistent with the requirements of the Gun-Free Schools Act. \nJuan was also changed with criminal weapons violations.\n  The family court that heard Juan's criminal case ruled that the \nsecurity guard did not have reasonable suspicion to search this \nstudent. As a result, the court refused to admit the gun as evidence of \nJuan's guilt, relying on the judicially created mechanism known as an \nexclusionary rule.\n  The New York appellate court took this decision to ridiculous lengths \nby applying the exclusionary rule to the internal school disciplinary \naction against this student. In essence, this court was saying that the \nsecurity aide in the school was to blame for catching this young \nstudent red-handed bringing a gun to school. They said he should not \nhave been expelled and ordered his record expunged of any wrongdoing in \nthe matter.\n  This is the most ludicrous decision from a court. If this ruling is \nallowed to stand, teachers and school administrators who know that a \nstudent is packing a gun will be powerless to act without a \n``reasonable suspicion''--whatever that now is--that the gun exists. In \nsome cases, like this one, it tells school officials to look the other \nway when they know a student is carrying a loaded gun.\n  I do not understand this thinking. What on Earth has happened to \ncommon sense? When you and I board an airplane, we voluntarily consent \nto security checks in order to preserve the safety and security of \nourselves and other passengers. Now we have a court that says, ``Oh, \nbut you can't have that same level of security with respect to kids in \nschool. Yes, you can remove a gun from a passenger who is going on an \nairplane because it is unsafe, but you cannot remove a gun from the \njacket of a 15-year-old who is carrying a loaded .45 semiautomatic \npistol into a school.'' What has happened to common sense?\n  I am introducing a piece of legislation today that is painfully \nsimple. So simple, in fact, that it ought not to have to be introduced. \nIt simply says that you cannot exclude a gun as evidence in a \ndisciplinary action in school. This bill returns to schools the most \nbasic and necessary of disciplinary tools--the ability to keep \nclassrooms safe from gun violence for the students who want to learn.\n  Let me emphasize that this bill does not violate the constitutional \nrights of kids. School officials who conduct unreasonable or unlawful \nsearches will not be exonerated by this legislation, and people who \nhave been aggrieved will be free to pursue any judicial or statutory \nremedies available to them. What they are not free to do--once they \nhave been found with a gun--is slip through a school's disciplinary \nprocess and return to school where they can continue to threaten other \nkids and teachers. I do not want that kid in school with my children. I \ndo not want that kid in school with the children of the Presiding \nOfficer or any other citizen of this country. When a kid puts a \nsemiautomatic pistol, loaded, in his waistband or jacket and heads off \nto school, if my children or the children of any American citizen are \nin that school, I want that kid expelled and out immediately.\n  If our court system does not understand that, then there is something \nwrong with our court system. Never again, in this country, should we \nhave a circumstance where a court says that, even though a student is \ncaught red-handed with a loaded gun, the security guard who finds it \nshould pat the kid on back and say, ``Sorry, I really should not have \nseen that. You go to class now.''\n  No wonder people are angry in this country about a system that \nexcuses everything. I know people will say to me, ``How dare you \npersonalize this? How dare you criticize a judge?'' But who is a judge? \nJudges are public servants, paid for with public money. I want judges \nto make thoughtful, reasonable decisions.\n\n  When judges, just as when other public officials come up with \ndecisions that defy all common sense, we have a right to be publicly \ncritical. Certainly in this case we have a right to offer legislation \nto say there ought not be one school district in America that has any \nother than zero tolerance for guns in schools. There ought not be one \njudicial jurisdiction in this country that is able to say to any school \nboard, any principal, or any teacher, that a kid bringing a gun to \nschool ought to be sent back to a classroom because someone had no \nright to find the gun.\n  If we have a right to ensure the security of passengers who get on \nairplanes in this country, and we do, then we have a right to ensure \nthe safety of teachers and children in our public schools. If we do not \nhave that right, if we cannot take the first baby step in making sure \nthat places of learning are safe, then we cannot take any step in \nimproving our educational system in America.\n  I offer this bill in the spirit of bipartisanship. There are \nRepublicans and Democrats who have joined me in offering it. I recall a \ncouple years ago, at the end of a legislative session just like we are \nnow, when Senator Feinstein and I were trying very hard to save the \nprovision that we had put in law saying we ought to adopt a zero \ntolerance on guns in schools. At the time, I shared a story with my \ncolleagues. I know it is repetitious but it is important, so I am\n\n[[Page S11545]]\n\ngoing to tell it again. I do not know about the subject of guns in \nschools so much from my hometown because I come from North Dakota, a \ntown of 300, a high school class of nine; a small school. We did not \nhave so many of the problems that so many schools have now.\n  But a few years ago I toured a school not very far from this Capitol \nbuilding. That school had metal detectors and security guards. A month \nlater, a student at that school bumped a student who was taking a drink \nat a water fountain and the student taking the drink, after he was \nbumped, pulled out a pistol, turned around, and shot the other student \nfour times. The name of the young man who was shot is Jerome. He \nsurvived; critically wounded, but he survived. I visited with Jerome \nafter that. He has since graduated.\n  But I was trying to understand, what is happening here? What is \nhappening that a child who bumps another child in a lunchroom finds \nhimself facing a loaded pistol and is shot four times? I do not even \nbegin to understand it. But I do not need to begin to understand it to \nknow that we ought, in every circumstance, under every condition, \ndecide to fight to make certain that people are not bringing guns into \nour schools. Our schools ought to be safe havens, places of learning \nwhere our young boys and girls come, believing they are going to learn \nduring that day and be safe while they are learning.\n  That is why we introduced the legislation 2 years ago. I am very \nsurprised we are here on the floor of the Senate talking again about \nthis issue, but we are here because of a court decision that stands \nlogic on its head. When they do that, I will come to the floor again, \nand again, and again, and introduce legislation that restores some \ncommon sense on this issue.\n  Mr. President, let me say again that I appreciate the opportunity to \nwork closely with the Senator from California on this issue. Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor, and I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2140\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Safer Schools Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC 2. SAFER SCHOOLS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 14601(b)(1) of the Gun-Free \n     Schools Act of 1994 (20 U.S.C. 8921(b)(1)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``under this Act shall have'' and inserting \n     the following: ``under this Act--\n       ``(A) shall have'';\n       (2) by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; \n     and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) beginning not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of the Safer Schools Act of 1996, shall have in \n     effect a State law or regulation providing that evidence that \n     a student brought a weapon to a school under the jurisdiction \n     of the local educational agencies in that State, that is \n     obtained as a result of a search or seizure conducted on \n     school premises, shall not be excluded in any school \n     disciplinary proceeding on the ground that the search or \n     seizure was in violation of the fourth amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States.''.\n       (b) Report to State.--Section 14601(d) of the Gun-Free \n     Schools Act of 1994 (20 U.S.C. 8921(d)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``the State law required \n     by'' and inserting ``each State law or regulation''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``subsection (b)'' and \n     inserting ``subsection (b)(1)(A)''.\n       (c) Report to Congress.--Section 14601(f) of the Gun-Free \n     Schools Act of 1994 (20 U.S.C. 8921(f)) is amended by \n     inserting ``of subsection (b)(1)(A)'' before ``of this''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his \nleadership on this issue. I have been very proud to cosponsor the bill \nwith him, and it has been a very important bill in California.\n  I will never forget going to a school in Hollywood, CA, speaking to a \nfourth grade class and asking that class, What is your No. 1 fear?\n  Do you know what it was? It was getting shot in class or on the way \nto school. I didn't believe it, so I asked the class: Well, how many of \nyou have even heard gunshots? In the fourth grade of this Hollywood \nelementary school, every single hand went up.\n  Then I remember going to Reseda High School and embracing a mother \nwhose son had been shot in a hallway for no reason at all, just shot \ndead by another student. That is when I came back and sort of firmed up \nmy resolve to really try to do something about it.\n  In 1993--this is the year before we passed this bill, gun-free \nschools--the Oakland school officials confiscated 60 guns; Fresno \nschool officials confiscated 43 guns; San Jose, 175 guns; Los Angeles, \n256 guns; Long Beach, 37 guns; and San Diego, 30 guns.\n  These are the schools of California. Who can learn when a youngster \nhas a .45 in their pocket? I don't think your son or daughter could \nlearn. I know my son or daughter or granddaughter couldn't learn in a \nschool if guns are present. So this is a good bill.\n  I share the frustration of Senator Dorgan. I wasn't shaving that \nmorning, but I did read the New York Times, and what I saw in the New \nYork Times amazed me, because what it said was that no school security \nguard, seeing a bulge in a youngster's pocket, could go up to that \nyoungster and say, ``What do you have in your pocket?''\n  If you see a bulge in somebody's pocket, you can have a reasonable \nbelief that they are carrying a weapon, particularly in a day and age \nwhere we have 160,000 students a year going into schools with weapons. \nThat is a reasonable belief if there is a bulge.\n  We know for a fact that many schools now have metal detectors, that \nmany schools routinely search backpacks. What does this court finding \ndo to these routine searches? I think it decimates them.\n  So we have submitted to you a bill which we hope will correct this. I \nknow that gun-free schools work. In Los Angeles, when they put in a \ngun-free-school bill, gun incidents went down by 65 percent. In San \nDiego, gun incidents in school were cut in half.\n  What we contend is that any school that takes Federal money should \nhave a zero tolerance policy for guns in that school. That means you \nbring a gun to school, you are expelled for 1 year. No ifs, ands, or \nbuts, you go out. The superintendent has the ability to be able to see \nthere is some alternative placement if that is available and to provide \ncounseling for the youngster. But the point of this is, it has to be \nenforced. For the New York City Family Court to strike down a gun being \nentered into evidence that was confiscated by a bona fide security \nperson in the course of their duties on school grounds to me just \nboggles my mind.\n  Let me talk just for a moment about what happens if this ruling \nstands and if we don't address it legislatively. I think it is really a \nshot in the back of school districts that are attempting to eliminate \ngun violence in their schools. How many school security guards and \nteachers will now hesitate to be just a little bit more vigilant in \nprotecting the millions of good, innocent kids who are in our schools? \nHow many overworked and underpaid teachers, fearful for their safety, \nwill decide that this is the last straw and simply turn away from \nteaching if they can't go out there and say, ``I think you may have \nsomething in your backpack that is contraband. Open it up.'' Or, \n``Susie,'' or ``Jeff, what is that bulge in your pocket? Let me see \nwhat you have in your pocket.''\n  This raises the whole kind of commonsense aspect: Should a youngster \nin a school have the same privacy rights that a youngster in a home \nwould have? I don't think so. I think a minor should be subject to \nsearch for contraband, to search for possession of a weapon, and if we \nlet our laws in this country bend over so backward that a security \nguard or a teacher can't say, ``Show me what you have in that pocket,'' \nor ``Show me what I think you have in that backpack,'' or ``I have \nreason to believe you may have something you shouldn't have in your \nlocker; I am going to open it up and look at it,'' I think any effort \nto protect youngsters in schools will go right out the window.\n  So I think that what we are trying to do today--Senator Dorgan, \nmyself, I know I talked with Senator D'Amato about this. I know he has \nsaid, ``Let's work together.'' I am delighted to see he is on this bill \nas well.\n  It is extraordinarily important that we get guns out of our schools, \nand this\n\n[[Page S11546]]\n\ncourt decision was just a major setback, because what it said is, you \ncan't enter the gun into evidence, you can't make it stick. I cannot \nfathom how any judge could do this.\n  I am not entirely sure that the remedy we present today is the full \nremedy that we need. I think it may even need beefing up in itself. But \nI think it is a real start in the right direction, and I think it is \nextraordinarily important that Senators on both sides of the aisle \nreally state to the public their belief that guns must not be brought \nto school, that knives must not be brought to school, that drugs, for \nthat matter, should not be brought to school, and that we reinforce \nthis in every way, shape or form we can legislatively.\n  I am very, very pleased and proud to join with the Senator from North \nDakota, once again, in hopes that this body will take prompt action in \nthe early part of the next session. My hope also is, as this case \nproceeds on appeal, that common sense may reign. I cannot believe that \nthe Framers of the Constitution of the United States of America wanted \na situation whereby a youngster could be search-proof in a school for a \nweapon of destruction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 2141. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permit \ncertain tax free corporate liquidations into a 501(c)(3) organization \nand to revise the unrelated business income tax rules regarding receipt \nof debt-financed property in such a liquidation; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                   CHARITABLE GIVING TAX LEGISLATION\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to \nstrengthen tax incentives to encourage more charitable giving in \nAmerica. The legislation would represent an important step and \nencourage greater private sector support of important educational, \nmedical, and other valuable programs in local communities across the \ncountry.\n  Americans are among the most caring in the world, contributing \ngenerously to charities in their communities:\n  American families contribute, on average, nearly $650 per household, \nor about $130 billion, per year, to charities.\n  Approximately, three out of every four households give to nonprofit \ncharitable organizations.\n  However, charities are very concerned for the future, anticipating a \ndecline in Federal social spending to address urgent needs like \nchildrens' services, homelessness, job training, health and welfare, \njust as the need for help accelerates.\n  Nonprofit charities are very concerned about their ability to \nmaintain their current level of services, let alone expand to meet the \nincreasing demand for services. While charitable contributions grew by \n3.7 percent in 1994, contributions for human services, the area most \nclosely associated with poverty programs, dropped by 6 percent.\n  Private charities can never replace government programs for national \nsocial priorities. However, nonprofit charities across America play a \ncritical role in providing vital services to people in need. The \nFederal Government needs to take steps to ensure we are doing \neverything we can to encourage private charitable support to supplement \ngovernment programs and government support.\n  The Federal Government needs to take steps to encourage greater \nprivate sector support. Government must provide both the leadership and \nthe incentives to encourage more private, charitable giving through the \ntax code. Analysts believe the gift of closely held business stock is \nan underutilized source of potential funds for charitable activities \nthat warrants closer attention and legislative remedies.\n\n  A closely held business is a corporation, in which stock is issued to \na small number shareholders, such as family members, but is not \npublicly traded on a stock exchange. This business form is very popular \nfor family businesses involving different generations.\n  However, today, the tax cost of contributing closely-held stock to a \ncharity or foundation can be prohibitively high. The tax burden \ndiscourages families and owners from winding down a business and \ncontributing the proceeds to charity. This legislation would permit \ncertain tax-free liquidations of closely held corporations into one or \nmore tax exempt 501(c)(3) organizations.\n  Under current law, a corporation may have to be liquidated to \neffectively complete the transfer of assets to the charity for its use, \nincurring a corporate tax at the Federal rate of 35 percent. In 1986, \nCongress repealed the ``General Utilities'' doctrine, imposing a \ncorporate level tax on all corporate transfers, including those to tax \nexempt charitable organizations. Additionally, a charitable \norganization could also be subject to taxation on its unrelated \nbusiness income from certain types of donated property.\n  These tax costs make contributions of closely held stock a costly and \nineffective means of transferring resources to charity. If the Federal \nGovernment is going to find new ways to encourage charitable giving, we \nneed to look at these tax costs which undercut both the incentive to \ngive and the potential value of any charitable gift.\n  Governments at the Federal, State, and local level, are reducing \nspending in all areas of their budgets, including spending for social \nservices. Public charities and private foundations already distribute \nfunds to a diverse and wide ranging group of social support \norganizations at the community level. Congressional leaders have looked \nto private charities in our religious institutions, our schools and \ncommunities, to fill the void created by government cut-backs. However, \nvolunteers are already hard at work in their communities and charitable \nfunding is already stretched dangerously thin. Charities need added \ntools to unlock the public's desire to give generously. We need to \ncreate appropriate incentives for the private sector to do more.\n\n  In California and throughout the country, volunteer and charitable \norganizations, together, perform vital roles in the community and they \ndeserve our support. Allow me to provide a few examples, which could be \nrepeated in any town across America:\n  Summer Search: In San Francisco, the Summer Search Foundation is hard \nat work preventing high school students from dropping out of school. \nSummer Search helps students not only successfully complete high school \nbut, for 93 percent of the participants, go on to college. By \nincreasing charitable contributions, groups like Summer Search can help \nkeep kids in school and moving forward toward graduation and a more \nproductive contribution to the Nation.\n  Drew Center For Child Development: Dramatic increases in the number \nof child abuse and neglect cases, which now total nearly 3 million \nchildren in the United States, is deeply troubling for everyone. We \nmust do everything to prevent these cases, but cutbacks in Social \nServices block grants will impose new burdens on local communities. \nCharitable support can be a small part of the solution.\n  Drew Child Development, a child care and development center in the \nWatts neighborhood of Los Angeles, works directly with children and \nfamilies involved in child abuse environments. Unfortunately, these 130 \nfamilies in which the Drew Center supports is not the end of the story. \nThere are thousands of other families that could benefit from this \nchild abuse treatment program if more resources were available.\n  The Drew Center expects cuts in government funding. They anticipate \nthat they will have to cut counselor positions and turn needy families \naway. Stronger incentives for private sector giving would provide the \nDrew Center with some of the resources needed to combat this enormous \nproblem.\n  The Chrysalis Center: In 1993 I visited the Chrysalis Center, a \nnonprofit organization in downtown Los Angeles dedicated to helping \nhomeless individuals find and keep jobs. Chrysalis provides employment \nassistance, from training in job-seeking skills to supervised searches \nfor permanent employment. In 1995, the center helped over 750 people \nfind work, and has helped place more than 3,000 people in permanent, \nfull-time jobs in the last decade.\n\n  However, there are still an estimated 15,000 homeless individuals in \nthe Los Angeles area that are able to work. Most of these men and \nwomen, however, lack literacy skills and the resources to move from the \nstreets to full-time employment. With increased charitable \ncontributions, Chrysalis would be able to offer hope and opportunity \nfor thousands more.\n\n[[Page S11547]]\n\n  Today, I introduce tax incentive legislation to encourage stronger \nsupport for the Nation's vital charities. The proposal:\n  Eliminates the corporate tax upon liquidation of a qualifying \nclosely-held corporation under certain circumstances. The legislation \nwould require 80 percent or more of the stock to be bequeathed to a \n501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization; and\n  Clarifies that a charity can receive mortgaged property in a \nqualified liquidation, without triggering unrelated business income tax \nfor a period of 10 years. This change parallels the exemption from \nunrelated business income tax provided under current law for direct \ntransfers by gift or bequest.\n  Under the legislation, the individual donor would receive no tax \nbenefit from the proposal, as the tax savings generated would increase \nthe funds available for the charity.\n  By eliminating the corporate tax upon liquidation, Congress would \nencourage additional, and much needed, charitable gifts. Across \nAmerica, countless thousands have built successful careers and have \ngenerated substantial wealth in closely-held corporations. As the \nindividuals age and plan for their estate, we should help them channel \ntheir wealth to meet philanthropic goals. Individuals who are willing \nto make generous bequests of companies and assets, often companies they \nhave spent years building, should not be discouraged by substantially \nreducing the value of their gifts through Federal taxes.\n\n  While the Joint Tax Committee has not yet prepared an official \nrevenue cost, previous estimates suggest a 7-year cost of about $600 \nmillion.\n  However, the revenue estimate represents the expectation of \nsignificant transfer to charity as a result of the legislation. By the \nsame techniques used to estimate the tax cost to Treasury, we estimate \nbetween $3 and $5 billion in charitable contributions would be \nstimulated by this tax change. This tax proposal may generate as much \nas seven times its revenue loss in expanded charitable giving.\n  The legislation has been endorsed by the Council on Foundations, the \numbrella organization for foundations throughout the country, and the \nCouncil of Jewish Federations.\n  I am pleased to add my colleagues Mark Hatfield, of Oregon, Slade \nGorton of Washington and Max Baucus, of Montana, as co-sponsors of the \nlegislation. I encourage others to review this legislation and listen \nto the charitable sectors in your community. During this past year, the \nproposed legislation went through several different revisions in order \nto sharpen the bill's focus and target the legislation in the most \neffective manner. I want to encourage the review process to continue, \nso we may continue to build support and target the bill's impact for \nthe benefit of the Nation's nonprofit community.\n  With virtually limitless need, we must look at new ways to encourage \nand nurture a strong charitable sector. The private sector cannot begin \nto replace the government role, but if the desire to support charitable \nactivity exists, we should not impose taxes to deplete the value of \nthat support.\n  Tax laws should encourage, rather than impede, charitable giving. By \ninhibiting charitable gifts, Federal tax laws hurt those individuals \nthat most need the help of their government and their community.\n  I request unanimous consent to have the legislation and section-by-\nsection analysis printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2141\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize funds for construction of highways, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                  THE ISTEA INTEGRITY RESTORATION ACT\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, along \nwith my distinguished colleague from Florida, Mr. Graham, the ISTEA \nIntegrity Restoration Act. We have a number of cosponsors, I am pleased \nto say, whom I shall not list. But it is a bipartisan group.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \nand the distinguished Senator from Florida is a member of my \nsubcommittee, we do this on behalf of many Senators and invite others, \nhearing of this introduction at this time, to consider adding their \nnames as cosponsors.\n  This legislation is the product of 2 years of work on the part of \nmany Senators and, indeed, specifically a group of States, 21 in \nnumber, known as STEP-21. The goals of this group of States, referred \nto as STEP-21, are incorporated in this legislation. This group shares, \namong those goals, that of ensuring that our surface transportation \nsystem is prepared to respond to the economic challenges of the 21st \ncentury.\n  The current surface transportation authorization bill, known as \nISTEA--I might refer to it as ISTEA 1, and next year I, hopefully, will \nbe a part of the legislating group to provide for ISTEA 2--but ISTEA 1 \nexpires September 30, 1997. So it is imperative that the Congress of \nthe United States draft and legislate ISTEA 2 next year.\n  American products are reaching domestic and international markets in \nshorter times. Manufacturing plants are reducing inventories and \nrelying on just-in-time deliveries. I visited an industrial plant in my \nState, in Luray,\n\n[[Page S11548]]\n\nVA, which is primarily making blue jeans. I asked them, ``How do you \ncompete with the low-cost labor market in Asia? Indeed, how do you \ncompete with the European markets?'' They came straight to the point. \nNo. 1, the hard work delivered by the citizens of Virginia in that \nplant. But, No. 2, it is very clear, is turnaround time. We get an \norder in, we fill the boxes, we put it on the truck, and that truck \nturns around and goes back, back to the purchasers in a very short \nperiod of time. Mr. President, that turnaround time, that ability to \nturn goods around on the roads as they exist in America today that will \nexist even in better form tomorrow through improved bridges and other \nforms of transportation, that gives us an edge in this ``one world \nmarket'' to beat those other competitors.\n\n  Throughout Virginia, all types of industries tell me that their \nability to get the goods to domestic or international markets makes the \ndifference in their competitiveness here at home, indeed, and \nworldwide. In this one-world market, our existing modern transportation \nsystem is probably one of the major factors that gives us such a \ncompetitive edge as we have here today. But we must improve that for a \ntougher competitive environment of tomorrow.\n  We are a mobile society here in the United States, but our \ntransportation challenges are growing as we face an aging surface \ntransportation system. As we work to develop a national consensus on \ntransportation policy, I remain committed to a future that provides for \neasier access for every community to a modern, safer road system \ndesigned for ever-increasing volumes of traffic.\n  Responding to the congestion on our Nation's highways and the \nresulting lost productivity is a primary focus of the legislation we \nare introducing today, such that all in America can study it. And \ntomorrow, next year, we will begin work in response to the needs of our \ncountry.\n  It is not too early to begin the discussion, to ensure that the next \nmultiyear surface transportation bill provides a system that:\n  First, effectively moves people and goods--that is more effectively;\n  Second, provides for the safety of the traveling public, and this \nSenator and, indeed, my colleague from Florida have always stood in the \nforefront for provisions which add safety to our transportation system;\n  Third, fosters a healthy economy;\n  Fourth, ensures a consistent level of performance and service among \nthe 50 States and provides an equitable distribution of highway trust \nfunds that responds to the challenging demographics in America.\n  These are our national priorities that must be met.\n  The legislation Senator Graham and I are introducing today is a sound \napproach that meets these priorities.\n  With the completion of the Interstate Highway System, the mobility of \nAmericans has steadily increased.\n  Every day we commute longer distances to our jobs. We travel longer \ndistances for vacations or to visit friends and family.\n  In testimony before the Transportation and Infrastructure \nSubcommittee this year, Secretary of Transportation Pena indicated that \ngridlock on our Nation's highways wastes $30 billion annually. The \nISTEA Integrity Restoration Act addresses this critical problem by \nredirecting Federal dollars to our States on a more equitable basis.\n  Our legislation also builds upon the successes of ISTEA by: \npreserving public participation and the role of local governments in \ntransportation decision-making; continuing the national goal of \nintermodalism; expanding State and local authority to determine \ntransportation priorities; and, increasing the flexibility to use \ntransportation dollars on other modes of transportation that improve \nair quality, facilitates the flow of traffic or enhances the \npreservation of historic transportation facilities.\n  The ISTEA Integrity Restoration Act continues to move our surface \ntransportation policy forward. It responds to the single most glaring \nfailure of ISTEA by modernizing our outdated Federal apportionment \nformulas.\n  Virginia and many other States have historically been ``donor'' \nStates--sending more into the Highway Trust Fund that we receive in \nreturn.\n  This legislation addresses the needs of the ``donor'' States and also \nrecognizes the demands of our rural States and small States with dense \npopulations.\n  This bill is an honest, good-faith effort to reduce the extremes in \nthe funding formulas. It provides that all States should receive at \nleast 95 percent of the funds their citizens pay into the highway trust \nfund by way of the Federal gas tax.\n  We are introducing this legislation today, near the end of the 104th \nCongress, to stimulate discussion among the States, local governments \nand various interested groups on how the Congress should approach the \nreauthorization of ISTEA.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee, the subcommittee will \nhold extensive hearings next year of ISTEA reauthorization.\n  I pledge to work with all of my colleagues to craft a multiyear \nreauthorization bill that addresses the issues I have outlined. I \nwelcome all comments on the legislation I am introducing today as we \nshare the common goal of providing for an efficient transportation \nsystem for the 21st century.\n  I want to credit my distinguished colleague from Florida, because the \ntwo of us, along with others, have stood toe-to-toe on this floor \ntrying to bring into balance a more equitable system of allocation of \nthe public highway trust funds donated by our respective States. As I \nsaid, some of our States, like Virginia and Florida, are referred to as \ndonor States, meaning we send more to Washington than we get back. That \nmust be adjusted next year.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity this \nafternoon to join my friend and colleague from Virginia in the \nintroduction of this important legislation. I believe there are a \ncouple of historical notes that should be made at this time.\n  First is, we are introducing legislation to carry on a program which \nwill expire 368 days from today. By introducing this legislation today, \nwe are giving to our colleagues--but more important to the millions of \nAmericans who will be affected by this legislation--more than a year to \ngive full consideration to the policy proposals which we are advancing.\n  We are doing that at the very time that, here on the Senate floor, \nother important matters are being denied that kind of full attention \nand exploration. I commend the Senator from Virginia for his vision and \nhis farsightedness in making it possible for such a dispassionate, \nthoughtful consideration of this important legislation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague for \nhelping draft the first blueprint of this exciting challenge for \nAmerica.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The second historical point is consistent with what my \nfriend from Virginia has just said, and that is we are at a new point \nof departure for our surface transportation system. We could date the \ncurrent era with adoption of the Interstate Highway Act during the \nadministration of President Eisenhower. We have had a great national \nobjective over almost a half century, to link America with the highest \nstandards of highway engineering, design and construction and \nmaintenance. We have largely accomplished the task that we set out for \nourselves in the 1950's.\n  Now the question is, what will this generation's contribution be to \nAmerica's transportation for the first half of the 21st century? The \ndecisions that we will be making in 1997 will be an important step \ntoward answering that question of what we shall do for the future of \nAmerica's transportation.\n  I am pleased to cosponsor this important legislation which has a \nnumber of significant provisions. One of those provisions is the need \nfor equity in the funding of our highway system. In report after \nreport--and I bring to the Senate's attention just two of many. One, a \nreport in 1985, ``Highway Funding, Federal Distribution Formulas Should \nBe Changed,'' which was produced prior to the 1991 act upon which we \nare currently distributing our Federal highway funds, and then a second \ndated November of 1995, 4 years after\n\n[[Page S11549]]\n\nthe adoption of the 1991 Highway Act, which is entitled ``Highway \nFunding Alternatives for Distributing Highway Funds'' in which it \nstates that ``the formula process in the current law is cumbersome, \nyielding a largely predetermined outcome and partially relies on \noutdated and irrelevant factors.''\n  So, Mr. President, in spite of repeated reports pointing out \nshortcomings in our past and current distribution laws, we still are \nsubject to the criticism of being cumbersome, predetermined, and \noutdated and irrelevant in our distribution facts.\n  One of the important objectives of this legislation that we \nintroduced today is to bring greater rationality and modernity into our \ndistribution of highway funds while we also strive to give greater \nflexibility to the States that have the responsibility for \nadministering these funds.\n  I am glad that we commenced the debate today. I look forward to more \nthan a year of opportunity to move this idea into a form that can come \nbefore the Senate and our colleagues in the House for passage and to \nusher in a new postinterstate era for American highway transportation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. \n        Pressler, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 2144. A bill to enhance the supervision by Federal and State \nbanking agencies of foreign banks operating in the United States, to \nlimit participation in insured financial institutions by persons \nconvicted of certain crimes, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban affairs.\n\n\n                THE FOREIGN BANK ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today I introduce the Foreign Bank \nEnforcement Act of 1996.\n  This legislation proposes a number of important modifications to \nstatutes governing the activities of foreign banks operating in the \nUnited States. It reflects the recommendations of Federal and State \nbank regulators. It will enhance the ability of U.S. regulators to \noversee the 275 foreign banks from 61 countries now operating in the \nUnited States.\n  The world's financial system is increasingly interconnected, and \nforeign banks operate in the United States to a greater degree than \never before. These banks now hold more than $1 trillion in U.S. banking \nassets and make approximately 30 percent of the amount of all loans to \nU.S. businesses.\n  The integrity of the U.S. financial system is one of our most \nimportant national assets. This asset is threatened whenever any bank--\ndomestic or foreign--operating on our shores engages in misconduct or \nfraud. It is therefore imperative that U.S. bank regulators possess all \nof the tools necessary to supervise the U.S. operations of foreign \nbanks with the same care and attention as those of our domestic banks.\n  Over the past several years, the activities of rogue traders at banks \nand securities firms have shaken world financial markets. Last year, \nthe $1.3 billion in hidden losses from derivatives trading by Nicholas \nLeeson in Singapore brought down the venerable Barings Bank in Great \nBritain. In September 1995--and much closer to home--Federal bank \nregulators learned that Daiwa Bank's New York branch had incurred \nlosses of $1.1 billion from the unauthorized trading activities of just \none employee, Mr. Toshihide Iguchi, over a period of 10 years.\n  Mr. President, the Daiwa matter is particularly troubling. Although \nDaiwa senior management learned of these hidden trading losses of $1.1 \nbillion in July 1995, they concealed the losses from U.S. bank \nregulators for almost 2 months. Even worse, Daiwa senior management \ndirected Mr. Iguchi to continue his fraudulent transactions during July \nand August 1995 to avoid detection of the losses.\n  In November 1995, Federal and State bank regulators took the stern, \nbut entirely appropriate step, of terminating all of Daiwa Bank's \noperations in the United States. The bank also paid a criminal fine of \n$340 million, and two of its officials entered guilty pleas to criminal \noffenses.\n  In the wake of the Daiwa scandal, I asked the Federal Reserve to \nconduct a full inquiry into this matter and to examine our existing \nscheme for regulating the U.S. activities of foreign banks. The Banking \nCommittee also held a hearing in November 1995 on Daiwa and related \nmatters at which Federal and State bank regulators testified.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that we must learn from the Daiwa scandal. \nOver the past year, the Banking Committee has worked with Federal and \nState regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the New York State \nBanking Department, to identify any limitations in the existing laws \ngoverning the U.S. operations of foreign banks.\n  After reviewing the recommendations of Federal and State bank \nregulators, I today introduce the Foreign Bank Enforcement Act. This \nlegislation would make the following five changes to the statutory \nscheme now governing the U.S. operations of foreign banks.\n  First, it would clarify that the Federal Reserve possesses the \nstatutory authority to set conditions for the termination of a foreign \nbank's activities in the United States. Under the International Banking \nAct of 1978, the Federal Reserve may order the complete termination of \na foreign bank's branches and agencies in the U.S. This amendment would \nmake explicit that the Federal Reserve also may issue, on an \ninvoluntary basis, a termination order that sets specific conditions on \nthe termination of a foreign bank's U.S. activities. These conditions \nmight include requiring the terminated bank to maintain the records of \nits U.S. activities in the U.S., to make its officials available in the \nU.S. to facilitate U.S. investigatory efforts, and to escrow funds in \nthe U.S. to meet contingent liabilities after the foreign bank has left \nthe U.S.\n\n  Second, this bill would clarify the authority of federal banking \nagencies to remove convicted felons from the banking industry. Under \nSection 8(g) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the Federal Reserve \nand other Federal banking agencies may suspend and permanently bar from \nthe banking industry persons convicted of certain felonies. This \namendment would make clear that Federal banking agencies possess this \nauthority with regard to persons who are not actually employed by a \nbanking organization.\n  Third, the Foreign Bank Enforcement Act would expand the current \nautomatic bar on the employment of persons convicted of a crime \ninvolving dishonesty, breach of trust, or money laundering. Under \nSection 19 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, a person convicted of \nsuch crimes may not work for an insured depository institution without \nthe approval of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; it does not \nexpressly bar the future employment of a convicted person by a bank \nholding company, an Edge or Agreement corporation, or a U.S. branch or \nagency of a foreign bank. For instance, under the current Section 19, \nMr. Iguchi, the senior Daiwa official who caused the bank's $1.1 \nbillion trading loss, would not automatically be barred from working \nfor another U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank. This amendment \nwould close this loophole.\n  Fourth, this legislation would increase the ability of the federal \nbank regulators to obtain from foreign bank supervisors critical \nexamination and supervision-related information concerning foreign \nbanks operating in the U.S. Specifically, it would amend the \nInternational Banking Act of 1978 to provide explicitly that federal \nbank regulators may keep confidential critical bank-examination \ninformation obtained from foreign supervisors. This provision would not \nprotect such information from disclosure to Congress or to the courts \nand is similar to a provision in the securities laws that allows the \nSEC to maintain the confidentiality of information received from a \nforeign securities authority.\n  Finally, this bill would authorize Federal courts, upon a motion of a \nU.S. Attorney, to issue orders authorizing the disclosure of matters \noccurring before a grand jury to State bank regulators. Under current \nlaw, such disclosures may be made only to Federal bank regulators, and, \nas the Daiwa matter demonstrates, State bank regulators play an \nimportant role in the supervision of foreign banks operating in the \nU.S.\n  Mr. President, we must not allow loopholes in existing law to erode \nthe confidence of the American people in the integrity of our financial \nsystem.\n\n[[Page S11550]]\n\nCongress must provide Federal and State bank regulators with all of the \ntools necessary to supervise fully the U.S. operations of foreign \nbanks. The Foreign Bank Enforcement Act proposes a number of narrow, \nbut important, changes in existing law. It reflects the recommendations \nof the Federal Reserve and other bank regulators. I urge the swift \napproval of this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2144\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Foreign Bank Enforcement Act \n     of 1966''.\n\n     SEC. 2. UNAUTHORIZED PARTICIPATION BY CONVICTED PERSONS.\n\n       Section 19 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. \n     1829) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``Corporation'' and \n     inserting ``appropriate Federal banking authority''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(c) Definition.--For purposes of this section--\n       ``(1) the term `appropriate Federal banking authority' \n     means--\n       ``(A) the Corporation, in the case of any insured \n     depository institution, except as specifically provided in \n     subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D), or in the case of any \n     insured branch of a foreign bank;\n       ``(B) the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \n     in the case of any bank holding company and any subsidiary \n     thereof (other than a bank), uninsured State branch or agency \n     of foreign bank, or any organization organized and operated \n     under section 25A of the Federal Reserve Act or operating \n     under section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act;\n       ``(C) the Comptroller of the Currency, in the case of any \n     Federal agency or uninsured Federal branch of a foreign bank; \n     and\n       ``(D) the Office of Thrift Supervision, in the case of any \n     savings and loan holding company and any subsidiary thereof \n     (other than a bank or a savings association) or any \n     institution that is treated as an insured bank under section \n     8(b)(9); and\n       ``(2) the term `insured depository institution' shall be \n     deemed to include any institution treated as an insured bank \n     under paragraph (3), (4), or (5) of section 8(b) or as a \n     savings association under section 8(b)(9).''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION.\n\n       Section 15 of the International Banking Act of 1978 (12 \n     U.S.C. 3109) is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new subsections:\n       ``(c) Information Obtained From Foreign Supervisors.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (d), \n     the Board, the Comptroller, the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision shall not \n     be compelled to disclose information obtained from a foreign \n     supervisor if--\n       ``(A) the foreign supervisor has, in good faith, determined \n     and represented to such agency that public disclosure of the \n     information would violate the laws applicable to that foreign \n     supervisor; and\n       ``(B) the United States agency obtains such information \n     pursuant to--\n       ``(i) such procedure as the agency may authorize for use in \n     connection with the administration or enforcement of the \n     banking laws; or\n       ``(ii) a memorandum of understanding.\n       ``(2) Treatment under title 5.--For purposes of section 552 \n     of title 5, United States Code, this subsection shall be \n     considered to be a statute described in subsection (b)(3)(B) \n     of such section 552.\n       ``(d) Savings Provision.--Nothing in this section \n     authorizes the Board, the Comptroller, the Federal Deposit \n     Insurance Corporation, or the Office of Thrift Supervision to \n     withhold information from the Congress or to prevent such \n     agency from complying with an order of a court of the United \n     States in an action commenced by the United States or by such \n     agency.''.\n\n     SEC. 5.

DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN MATTERS OCCURRING BEFORE GRAND \n                   JURY.\n\n       Section 3322(b) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``State or Federal'' \n     before ``financial institution''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``at any time during or \n     after the completion of the investigation of the grand jury'' \n     before ``upon''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n          Summary of the Foreign Bank Enforcement Act of 1996\n\n\n                   section 2. employment prohibition\n\n       Section 19 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (``FDI \n     Act''), (12 U.S.C. 1829), prohibits anyone convicted of a \n     criminal offense from being employed by, or participating in \n     the affairs of, an insured depository institution unless they \n     receive the written consent of the FDIC. Section 19 covers \n     only employees of depository institutions and thus does not \n     currently prohibit the employment of convicted felons in a \n     bank holding company, Edge or Agreement Corporation, or in a \n     U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank. The Act would expand \n     the employment bar to these regulated entities and give \n     authority for regulatory review to the federal regulator with \n     oversight over the affected institution.\n\n\n                       section 3. removal actions\n\n       Banking regulators are empowered under Section 8(g) of the \n     FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(g)) to suspend or permanently \n     prohibit a person who is indicted or convicted of a felony \n     from participating in the affairs of a regulated institution. \n     Under 8(g), the regulatory order must be made against an \n     ``institution-affiliated party.'' The FDI Act clarifies that \n     even when the person resigns or is terminated by the \n     institution and is thus no-longer an ``institution-affiliated \n     party,'' the regulators may prohibit employment in regulated \n     institutions.\n\n\n                  section 4. international cooperation\n\n       Section 4 provides that communications from foreign \n     supervisors to U.S. banking agencies may be held \n     confidential. The provision, by making such protection \n     explicit in the law, would encourage foreign bank supervisors \n     to communicate more closely with their U.S. counterparts, \n     thereby contributing to better oversight of banks operating \n     internationally. The provision parallels the authority \n     already available to securities regulators, and would not \n     affect the ability of Congress or the courts to obtain such \n     information.\n\n\n             section 5. termination of foreign bank offices\n\n       The International Banking Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. \n     3105(e)(1)) authorizes the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC \n     to terminate a foreign bank's activities in the U.S. The Act \n     is unclear, however, about whether the termination order can \n     require the foreign bank to take actions such as \n     establishment of escrow accounts for the payment of potential \n     fines. Section 5 states explicitly that the regulators may \n     include appropriate terms and conditions in their termination \n     orders.\n\n\n                    section 6. grand jury disclosure\n\n       Under section 3322 of the U.S. Criminal Code, (18 U.S.C. \n     3322(b)) a federal court may authorize disclosure to federal \n     banking regulators of grand jury information used by law \n     enforcement authorities investigating federal banking law \n     violations. Section 6 expands the scope of this provision to \n     include disclosure of such information to state bank \n     regulatory authorities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. PELL (for himself and Mr. HATFIELD):\n  S. 2147.

Mr. President, at the request of the Library of Congress I \nam introducing, for myself and for the senior Senator from Oregon [Mr. \nHatfield], the Library of Congress Commemorative Coin Act, in \nrecognition of the 200th anniversary of the Library of Congress, which \nwill occur in the year 2000.\n  Established in 1800, the Library of Congress is our Nation's oldest \nnational cultural institution and has become the largest repository of \nrecorded knowledge in the world. It stands as a symbol of the vital \nconnection between knowledge and democracy.\n  The Library of Congress Commemorative Coin Act authorizes the \nSecretary of the Treasury to issue, in year 2000, 500,000 silver \ndollars and 500,000 half dollar coins commemorating the anniversary. \nThe proceeds of the sale of the coins will support not only the \nobservance of the bicentennial of the Library's creation, but also \ndigitization projects that will share the resources of the Library with \nthe Nation's schools and libraries.\n  James Madison said ``Learned institutions ought to be the favorite \nobjects of every free people. They throw the light over the public mind \nwhich is the best security against crafty and dangerous encroachments \non the public liberty.'' This bill commemorates the fact that the \nLibrary of Congress for two centuries has fulfilled James Madison's \nhope by dispensing the light of\n\n[[Page S11551]]\n\nknowledge over the Congress, the Nation, and the world.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mr. KERRY):\n\n  S. 2149. A bill to establish a program to provide health insurance \nfor workers changing jobs; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\nTHE TRANSITIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR WORKERS BETWEEN JOBS ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last month, President Clinton signed the \nKassebaum-Kennedy Health Insurance Reform Act. That legislation \nprovides portability of health insurance coverage. It said to American \nworkers and their families: you do not have to lose your health \ninsurance coverage because you lose your job.\n\n  That legislation is important. But for too many workers who lose \ntheir job, it could be an empty promise if the coverage is \nunaffordable. In fact, those between jobs typically have great \ndifficulty paying the cost of insurance coverage. In 1996, family \ncoverage costs an average of $6,900 a year, and individual coverage \ncosts $2,600.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will help fill this gap. It \nis a modified version of President Clinton's proposal to provide \ntemporary assistance for workers to keep their coverage between jobs. I \ncommend the President for offering this progressive, thoughtful \nprogram, and I commend my colleague, Senator John Kerry, for his \nleadership on this issue and his important contribution to the \ndevelopment of this legislation.\n  This is a logical and needed step in health insurance reform. The \nneeds of the unemployed are especially great. Since 1936, we have \nprovided a temporary program of income maintenance to workers who lose \ntheir jobs. Because of the high cost of health care, temporary \nassistance for health insurance during periods of unemployment is \nessential for American workers in 1996. Unemployment insurance alone is \nno longer sufficient.\n  Temporary health insurance assistance is especially critical as we \nface the economic changes associated with the new global economy and \nchanging corporate behavior. Corporations used to reduce their work \nforces only when they were in trouble. But now, no worker can count on \njob security, since the trend is for profitable companies to lay off \ngood workers to become even more profitable. Experts estimate that the \naverage worker entering the work force today will change jobs seven to \nnine times in a typical career. Some of these workers will choose to \nchange jobs, but others will be forced to. The Department of Labor \nestimates that in 1996 alone, 8.5 million workers will collect \nunemployment insurance for some period of time.\n  The legislation we are proposing today will provide financial \nassistance to help maintain health insurance coverage for workers and \ntheir families who are no longer eligible for on-the-job coverage \nbecause they have lost their job. To qualify, an individual would have \nto be eligible for unemployment insurance, would have to have had \nemployer-sponsored coverage for 6 months before becoming unemployed, \nand could not be eligible for employment-based coverage through a \nspouse or domestic partner or for Medicaid or Medicare.\n  In the month for which assistance is provided, the family income \nwould have to be 240 percent of poverty or less--about $37,440 for a \nfamily of four. Assistance would be limited to 6 months. The goal of \nthis program is to help workers in transition between jobs--not to \nprovide permanent coverage.\n  The program will be administered through the states. Typically, an \neligible individual will receive assistance in paying the cost of COBRA \ncontinuation coverage under current law. If the worker is not eligible \nfor COBRA, assistance will be available for any other policy that is \nnot more generous than the Blue Cross-Blue Shield standard option plan \navailable to Federal employees and Members of Congress.\n  There are a number of unanswered questions about the best way to \nstructure the program, and I look forward to working with my colleagues \nin the next Congress, with the administration, and outside experts to \nimprove it before it is passed. But the underlying principle is clear. \nNo family should lose its health insurance coverage because a \nbreadwinner is in transition between jobs.\n  The administration estimates that the cost of the program will be \napproximately $2 billion a year over the next 6 years, that \napproximately 3 million workers and their families will be helped to \nmaintain their coverage every year.\n  The program can be paid for largely by closing two of the most \nnotorious corporate tax loopholes--the title passage loophole and the \nrunaway plant loophole. The first loophole involves bookkeeping \ntransactions under which multinational corporations artificially shift \nincome to overseas operations to avoid U.S. taxes. The second loophole \nallows corporations to move jobs abroad, accrue large in foreign bank \naccounts, and avoid U.S. taxes. Closing these loopholes to help \nunemployed workers keep their health insurance coverage is an \nappropriate use of the revenue.\n  This program is a modest attempt to help American workers cope with \nthe disclosures of modern industrial life and the new global economy. \nBut it is also important to understand what it does not do:\n  It does not add to the deficit. The program will be fully financed. \nIn President Clinton's budget, it was paid for within his balanced \nbudget plan.\n  It does not impose additional burdens on employers or create an \nemployer mandate.\n  It is not an unfunded mandate on the States. The Federal Government \npays 100 percent of the cost of the program. If a State chooses not to \nadminister the program, it is not required to do so.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy health insurance reform bill passed the Senate \nby a strong bipartisan vote of 98 to 0, because it was clearly needed. \nThis additional improvement is also needed--to help see that the \npromise of health insurance portability is fulfilled in practice.\n  We have heard a great deal of talk about family values in this \ncampaign year. One of the most important expressions of family values \nis to help families keep their health insurance coverage when a \nbreadwinner is between jobs. For the millions of American workers who \nworry that their family will lose their health insurance if they lose \nthey job, this bill can be a lifeline, and I look forward to its \nbipartisan passage next year.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today Senator Kennedy and I are introducing \nthe Transitional Health Insurance Coverage for Workers Between Jobs \nAct. This bill would build on the recently passed Kennedy-Kassebaum \nhealth bill by providing funding to States in order to finance up to 6 \nmonths of health coverage for unemployed workers and their families.\n  The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill was an important step toward assuring \nportability of health insurance coverage. More than 20 million people \nwill benefit from that legislation and the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts deserves our thanks for his tireless efforts to achieve \nits passage. Unfortunately, however, although more people are now \nallowed to purchase health care coverage, many workers are still unable \nto afford this coverage. Those workers who have been laid off are most \nlikely not to be able to obtain coverage.\n  The bill we are introducing today would help temporarily unemployed \nworkers to afford health coverage for themselves and their families. It \nwould do so by providing Federal assistance to pay the premium for \nhealth insurance. A worker would be eligible who had employer-based \ncoverage in his or her prior job, is receiving unemployment benefits, \nand has income below certain levels. Families would have to earn no \nmore than $37,440 for a family of four to qualify for the subsidy. \nPeople who are eligible for Medicaid or Medicare would not be able to \nreceive this subsidy. Funds would be allocated to States based on the \nproportion of unemployed persons in the State who collected \nunemployment insurance [UI] benefits relative to all persons in the \nNation who collected UI benefits.\n  This bill is necessary because, in the real world, workers between \njobs still face mortgage or rent payments, utility bills, and other \nexpenses necessary to support themselves and their families in addition \nto health insurance costs. Many lack a source of income and have \nexhausted family savings and other resources during the period of \nunemployment. And unemployment insurance in most states barely pays\n\n[[Page S11552]]\n\nenough to cover rent and food--the average monthly UI benefit was only \n$692 in 1993. In today's increasingly turbulent economy, a secure job \nis difficult to find. This year in Massachusetts, for example, such \nmajor corporations as Digital, Raytheon, and Fleet Bank have laid off \nhundreds of workers. And over the last few years, most of the major \nhospitals in my State have significantly downsized their work force. \nThis bill will help workers as they move to new jobs.\n  I want to squarely address the issue of the cost of this program. The \nadministration has estimated the annual cost to be approximately $2 \nbillion. But I want to make clear that we are committed to fully \noffsetting the cost with other budget components. I am heartened that \nPresident Clinton was able to support establishing such a program in \nthe context of his fiscal year 1997 balanced budget request. Senator \nKennedy has described two corporate loopholes we propose to close. I \nlook forward to working with the administration and my colleagues to \nidentifying a budget offset that is acceptable to my colleagues for \nthis important program.\n  As Senator Kennedy said, this plan will not add to the deficit, does \nnot impose additional burdens on employers, and is not an unfunded \nmandate on States. I look forward to working with the administration \nand my colleagues to refine this bill and to pass it in the 105th \nCongress.\n       By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \n     Bennett, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Burns, Mr. Nickles, and Mr. \n     Stevens):\n\n  S. 2150. A bill to prohibit extension or establishment of any \nnational monument on public land without full compliance with the \nNational Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act, and \nan express Act of Congress, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                the public lands protection act of 1996\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nfor myself, Senator Craig, Senator Hatch, Senator Bennett, Senator \nGrams, Senator Nickles, Senator Campbell, Senator Burns, and Senator \nStevens to protect public lands from the type of assault visited upon \nthe people of Utah last week, when our President created a new national \nmonument containing 1.7 million acres. That was done without a process, \nwithout a process involving public hearings, without a process \ninvolving notification of the Utah delegation, and without courtesies \nextended in advance so the delegation could be responsive to the \nparticular delineations of the area suggested.\n  I think it is further important to point out the announcement of the \nPresident's action was not made in the State of Utah but in the State \nof Arizona. The withdrawal of land, 1.7 million acres, was in the State \nof Utah. One could curiously ask, for a Presidential proclamation, why \ngo to another State? It was clear that this action was not welcome in \nUtah. There would have been many school children to protest that \naction.\n  The legislation I introduce with my colleagues is called the Public \nLands Protection Act of 1996. It provides that no extension or \nestablishment of a national monument can be undertaken pursuant to the \nAntiquities Act without full compliance with the National Environmental \nPolicy Act, NEPA, and the Endangered Species Act, and an affirmative \nact of Congress.\n  Yet, by invoking the Antiquities Act, the President chose to ignore \nNEPA, ignore the Endangered Species Act, and take action almost as \nthough it were simply a Presidential mandate that was necessary. Some \nof us might suggest it was political expediency suggested by some of \nthe President's advisers that caused him to circumvent the process, the \npublic process.\n  We have had some tough conversations in the Congress. The California \nDesert Wilderness was an example, of contested legislation and \ncontested hearings. But the process went forward. We got the job done. \nThis action taken in Utah last week defies logic, defies principle, and \ndefies all semblance of courtesy. In effect, the President declared \nhimself to be above the law by unilaterally declaring that the action \nhe took, which unquestionably is a ``major Federal action'' within the \nmeaning of NEPA, did not require an analysis to determine its impact on \nthe environment. By specifically using the authority of the Antiquities \nAct, a statute enacted in 1906 to enable President Theodore Roosevelt \nto take action to protect unique features of our public land, the \nPresident conveniently sidestepped NEPA and the requirement to consider \nthe environmental consequences of his action.\n  We know President Clinton is no President Theodore Roosevelt. \nTheodore Roosevelt allowed a tremendous public dialog to take place \nbefore he invoked the Antiquities Act. President Carter invoked the \nAntiquities Act in my State in a massive land withdrawal. But there was \na long process. We didn't like it, but we participated. The people of \nUtah simply had the national monument dictated to them.\n  Further, by creating a national monument in the manner the President \nchose, he circumvented the Endangered Species Act, a law that the elite \nenvironmental lobbyists invoke at every turn to strike fear in the \nhearts of the American people that public land use for timber \nharvesting, oil and gas development, livestock grazing, and mining is \ncausing irreversible and intolerable damage to threatened and \nendangered species and their habitat and that such use of the public \ndomain should be eliminated altogether.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the Clinton administration kept the decision \nconcerning the national monument cloaked in secrecy until it was sprung \non the citizens of Utah by surprise. There was no consultation with the \nGovernor, no consultation with the congressional delegation, no \noutreach effort to the citizens, no interactive process with the public \nland users, and no consideration of any of the benefits of the lands \nthat have now been taken out of productive multiple use.\n  The President didn't want the democratic process, or the hearing \nprocess to go forward. It would have gone into the 105th Congress. We \nwould have resolved it.\n  I dare say, President Clinton's action is probably the most arrogant, \nhypocritical, and blatantly political exercise of Federal power \naffecting public lands ever, and the media seems to have bought it. \nPresident Clinton's and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt's war on the \nWest, in this unprecedented action, has almost the feel of Pearl \nHarbor. The President chose the most politically expedient and least \npublicly interactive route possible. The fact that he announced his \ndecision, as I stated, in Arizona speaks for itself.\n  My bill and that of my colleagues would bring an end to the use of \nthis old law to abuse Federal power and trample on States' rights. It \nis not needed anymore. We have the democratic process, we have NEPA, we \nhave the Endangered Species Act, and we have the checks and balances so \nthat a Presidential land grab is not in order.\n  Our bill is very straightforward. It provides that no extension or \nestablishment of a national monument can be undertaken pursuant to the \nAntiquities Act without full compliance with NEPA, full compliance with \nthe Endangered Species Act and an expressed act of Congress. What is \nwrong with that? That is the process. That is the democratic way.\n  This bill, when passed, would mean that there will be a public \nprocess and a deliberate, thoughtful analysis of the environmental \nconsequences of the proposed action. There will also be consultation \nunder the Endangered Species Act among the affected agencies on the \npotential effects on threatened and endangered species and their \nhabitat.\n  More important, Mr. President, by requiring an act of Congress before \na monument can be extended or established, the American people, the \naffected citizenry of the State involved, and interested public land \nusers will have an opportunity to voice their opinions during the \nprocess.\n  This can occur during the NEPA process, during the endangered species \nconsultation process and during legislative consideration of the act to \nextend or establish a national monument. No secret decision by the \nPresident's handlers and spin doctors and no campaign ploys, such as we \nhave seen with the Utah monument.\n  President Clinton's action in Utah ignored public sentiment. It \nignored the wishes of the citizens of Utah, of the public land users, \nof those who hold valid existing property rights and\n\n[[Page S11553]]\n\nthose who care deeply--deeply--about environmental stewardship. As our \ncommittee process continued, had it been allowed to continue, areas \nwould have been identified and put into wilderness that were agreed \nupon by the State of Utah, the Governor, the legislature and the \ncongressional delegation.\n  My bill would restore the public's voice in these matters and give \nmeaning to the concept of public participation.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nbill. I ask unanimous consent that the Record be left open until the \nend of the session to allow additional sponsors to join me on this \nmeasure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a bill being \nintroduced that has been forced by recent events. I'm talking about \nPresident Clinton's proclamation unilaterally declaring nearly two \nmillion acres of southern Utah a National Monument.\n  After the President's announcement, Senator Kempthorne and I \nintroduced the Idaho Protection Act. The bill would require that the \npublic and the Congress be included before a National Monument could be \nestablished in Idaho.\n  When we introduced that bill, I was immediately approached by other \nSenators seeking the same protection. What we see unfolding before us \nin Utah ought to frighten all of us. Without including Utah's Governor, \nSenators, congressional delegation, the state legislature, county \ncommissioners, or the people of Utah--President Clinton set off limits \nforever approximately 1.7 million acres of Utah.\n  Under the 1906 Antiquities Act, President Clinton has the authority \nto create a National Monument where none existed before. And if he can \ndo it in the State of Utah, he can do it in Idaho, or Montana, or \nCalifornia. In fact, since 1906, the law has been used some 66 times to \nset lands aside.\n  Just as 64 percent of the land in Utah is owned by the Federal \nGovernment, 62 percent of Idaho is also owned by Uncle Sam. Even New \nHampshire, on the East Coast, has 14 percent of its land owned by the \nFederal Government. What the President has done in Utah, without public \ninput, he could also do in Idaho or any of the States where the Federal \nGovernment has a presence.\n  The bill that is being introduced would simply require that the \npublic and the Congress be fully involved and give approval before such \na unilateral administrative act could take effect on our public lands.\n  Unfortunately, for the people of Utah, what the President has done \nthere, should be a wake up call to people across America. While we all \nwant to preserve what is best in our States, people everywhere \nunderstand that much of their economic future is tied up in what \nhappens on the public lands in our States.\n  In the West, where public lands dominate the landscape, issues such \nas grazing, timber harvesting, water use, have all come under attack by \nan administration seemingly bent upon kowtowing to a segment of our \npopulation that wants other uses off our public lands.\n  But in addition to those in the West, everyone wants the process to \nbe open and inclusive. No one wants the President, acting alone, to \nunilaterally lock up enormous parts of any State. That is not what \nIdahoans, or Utah natives or others. We certainly don't work that way \nin the West. There is a recognition that with common sense, a balance \ncan be struck that allows jobs to grow and families to put down roots \nwhile at the same time protecting America's great natural resources.\n  In my view, the President's actions are beyond the pale and for that \nreason--to protect others from suffering a similar fate, I am \ncosponsoring this bill.\n  Thank you and I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SIMPSON (by request):\n  S. 2151.

Mr. President, as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, I have today introduced, at the request of the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs, S. 2151, the ``Department of Veterans Affairs \nEmployment Reduction Assistance Act of 1996'' relating to the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs' authority to offer separation \nincentives to achieve reductions in employment levels. The Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs submitted this legislation to the President of the \nSenate by letter dated September 11, 1996.\n  My introduction of this measure is in keeping with the policy which I \nhave adopted of generally introducing--so that there will be specific \nbills to which my colleagues and others may direct their attention and \ncomments--all administration-proposed draft legislation referred to the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. Thus, I reserve the right to support or \noppose the provisions of, as well as any amendment to, this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record, together with the transmittal letter and the \nenclosed analysis of the draft legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2151\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this Act \n     an amendment is expressed in terms of an amendment to a \n     section or other provision, the reference shall be considered \n     to be made to a section or other provision of title 38, \n     United States Code.\n\n     SECTION 1.

DEPARTMENT PLANS; APPROVAL.\n\n       (a) If the Secretary determines that, in order to improve \n     the efficiency of operations or to meet actual or anticipated \n     levels of budgetary or staffing resources, the number of \n     employees employed by the Department must be reduced, the \n     Secretary may submit a plan to the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget to pay voluntary separation incentives \n     under this Act to employees of the Department who agree to \n     separate from the Department by retirement or resignation. \n     The plan shall specify the planned employment reductions and \n     the manner in which such reductions will improve operating \n     efficiency or meet actual or anticipated levels of budget or \n     staffing resources. The plan shall include a proposed period \n     of time for the payment of voluntary separation incentives by \n     the Department and a proposed coverage for offers of \n     incentives to Department employees, targeting positions in \n     accordance with the Department's strategic alignment plan and \n     downsizing initiatives. The proposed coverage may be based \n     on--\n       (1) any component of the Department;\n       (2) any occupation, occupation level or type of position;\n       (3) any geographic location; or\n       (4) any appropriate combination of the factors in \n     paragraphs (1), (2), and (3).\n       (b) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget \n     shall approve or disapprove each plan submitted under \n     subsection (a),\n\n[[Page S11554]]\n\n     and may make appropriate modifications to the plan with \n     respect to the time period in which voluntary separation \n     incentives may be paid or with respect to the coverage of \n     incentives on the basis of the factors in subsection (a) (1) \n     through (4).\n\n     SEC. 4. VOLUNTARY SEPARATION INCENTIVE PAYMENTS.\n\n       (a) In order to receive a voluntary separation incentive \n     payment, an employee must separate from service with the \n     Department voluntarily (whether by retirement or resignation) \n     during the period of time for which the payment of incentives \n     has been authorized for the employee under the Department \n     plan under section 3.\n       (b) A voluntary separation incentive payment--\n       (1) shall be paid in a lump sum at the time of the \n     employee's separation:\n       (2) shall be equal to the lesser of--\n       (A) an amount equal to the amount the employee would be \n     entitled to receive under section 5595(c) of title 5, United \n     States Code (without adjustment for any previous payment made \n     under that section), if the employee were entitled to payment \n     under that section; if the employee were entitled to payment \n     under that action; or\n       (B) if the employee separates--\n       (i) during fiscal year 1996 or 1997, $25,000;\n       (ii) during fiscal year 1998, $20,000;\n       (iii) during fiscal year 1999, $15,000;\n       (iv) during fiscal year 2000, $10,000;\n       (3) shall not be a basis for payment, and shall not be \n     included in the computation, of any other type of Government \n     benefit, except that this paragraph shall not apply to \n     unemployment compensation funded in whole or in part with \n     Federal funds;\n       (4) shall not be taken into account in determining the \n     amount of severance pay to which an employee may be entitled \n     under section 5595 of title 5, United States Code, based on \n     any other separation; and\n       (5) shall be paid from the appropriations or funds \n     available for payment of the basic pay of the employee.\n\n     SEC. 5. EFFECT OF SUBSEQUENT EMPLOYMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT.\n\n       (a) An individual who has received a voluntary separation \n     incentive payment under this Act and accepts any employment \n     with the Government of the United States within 5 years after \n     the date of the separation on which the payment is based \n     shall be required to repay, prior to the individual's first \n     day of employment, the entire amount of the incentive payment \n     to the Department.\n       (b)(1) If the employment under subsection (a) is with an \n     Executive agency (as defined by section 105 of title 5, \n     United States Code), the United States Postal Service, or the \n     Postal Rate Commission, the Director of the Office of \n     personnel Management may, at the request of the head of the \n     agency, waive the repayment if the individual involved \n     possesses unique abilities and is the only qualified \n     applicant available for the position.\n       (2) If the employment under subsection (a) is with an \n     entity in the legislative branch, the head of the entity or \n     the appointing official may waive the repayment if the \n     individual involved possesses unique abilities and is the \n     only qualified applicant available for the position.\n       (3) If the employment under subsection (a) is with the \n     judicial branch, the Director of the Administrative Office of \n     the United States Courts may waive the repayment if the \n     individual involved possesses unique abilities and is the \n     only qualified applicant available for the position.\n       (c) For the purpose of this section, the term \n     ``employment''--\n       (1) includes employment of any length or under any type of \n     appointment, but does not include employment that is without \n     compensation; and\n       (2) includes employment under a personal services contract, \n     as defined by the Director of the Office of Personnel \n     Management.\n\n     SEC. 6. ADDITIONAL AGENCY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE RETIREMENT \n                   FUND.\n\n       (a) In addition to any other payments which it is required \n     to make under subchapter III of chapter 83 or chapter 84 of \n     title 5, United States Code, the Department shall remit to \n     the Office of Personnel Management for deposit in the \n     Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Civil \n     Service Retirement and Disability Fund an amount equal to 15 \n     percent of the final basic pay of each employee of the \n     Department who is covered under subchapter III of chapter 83 \n     or chapter 84 of title 5 to whom a voluntary separation \n     incentive has been paid under this Act.\n       (b) For the purpose of this section, the term ``final basic \n     pay'', with respect to an employee, means the total amount of \n     basic pay that would be payable for a year of service by that \n     employee, computed using the employee's final rate of basic \n     pay, and, if last serving on other than a full-time basis, \n     with appropriate adjustment therefor.\n\n     SEC. 7. REDUCTION OF AGENCY EMPLOYMENT LEVELS.\n\n       (a) Total full-time equivalent employment in the Department \n     shall be reduced by one for each separation of an employee \n     who receives a voluntary separation incentive payment under \n     this Act. The reduction will be calculated by comparing the \n     Department's full-time equivalent employment for the fiscal \n     year in which the voluntary separation payments are made with \n     the actual full-time equivalent employment for the prior \n     fiscal year.\n       (b) The Office of Management and Budget shall monitor the \n     Department and take any action necessary to ensure that the \n     requirements of this section are met.\n       (c) Subsection (a) of this section may be waived upon a \n     determination by the President that--\n       (1) the existence of a state of war or other national \n     emergency so requires; or\n       (2) the existence of an extraordinary emergency which \n     threatens life, health, safety, property, or the environment \n     so requires.\n\n     SEC. 8. REPORTS.\n\n       (a) The Department, for each applicable quarter of each \n     fiscal year and not later than 30 days after the date of such \n     quarter, shall submit to the Office of Personnel Management a \n     report stating--\n       (1) the number of employees who receive voluntary \n     separation incentives for each type of separation involved;\n       (2) the average amount of the incentives paid;\n       (3) the average grade or pay level of the employees who \n     received incentives; and\n       (4) such other information as the Office may require.\n       (b) No later than March 31st of each fiscal year, the \n     Office of Personnel Management shall submit to the Committee \n     on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on \n     Government Reform and Oversight of the House of \n     Representatives a report which, with respect to the preceding \n     fiscal year, shall include--\n       (1) the number of employees who received voluntary \n     separation incentives;\n       (2) the average amount of such incentives;\n       (3) the average grade or pay level of the employees who \n     received incentives; and\n       (4) the number of waivers made under section 5 of this Act \n     in the repayment of voluntary separation incentives, and for \n     each such waiver--\n       (A) the reasons for the waiver; and\n       (B) the title and grade or pay level of the position filled \n     by each employee to whom the waiver applied.\n\n     SEC. 9. VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION IN REDUCTIONS IN FORCE.\n\n       Section 3502(f) of title 5, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``, the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs,'' after ``Defense'';\n       (2) in paragraph (3), by inserting ``, the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs,'' after ``Defense'';\n       (3) by striking paragraph (4); and\n       (4) by redesignating paragraph (5) as paragraph (4); and\n       (5) by amending such paragraph (4), as so redesignated, by \n     striking ``1996'' and inserting ``2000'' in lieu thereof.\n\n     SEC. 10. CONTINUED HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE.\n\n       Section 8905a(d)(4) of title 5, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A) by striking ``in or under the \n     Department of Defense'';\n       (2) in subparagraph (B)--\n       (A) by striking ``1999'' in clause (i) and (ii) and \n     inserting ``2000''; and\n       (B) by striking ``2000'' in clause (ii) and inserting \n     ``2001''; and\n       (3) in subparagraph (C) by inserting ``by the agency'' \n     after ``identified''.\n\n     SEC. 11. REGULATIONS.\n\n       The Director of the Office of Personnel Management may \n     prescribe any regulations necessary to administer the \n     provisions of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 12. LIMITATION; SAVINGS CLAUSE.\n\n       (a) No voluntary separation incentive under this Act may be \n     paid based on the separation of an employee after September \n     30, 2000;\n       (b) This Act supplements and does not supersede other \n     authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                         Analysis of Draft Bill\n\n       The first section provides a title for the bill, the \n     ``Department of Veterans Affairs Employment Reduction \n     Assistance Act of 1996.''\n       Section 2 provide definitions of ``Department'', \n     ``employee'', and ``Secretary.'' Among the provisions, an \n     employee who has received any previous voluntary separation \n     incentive from the Federal Government and has not repaid the \n     incentive is excluded from any incentives under this Act.\n       Section 3 provides that, when the VA Secretary determines \n     that employment in the agency must be reduced in order to \n     improve operating efficiency or meet anticipated budget or \n     staffing levels, the Secretary may submit a plan to the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget for payment \n     of voluntary separation incentives to Department employees. \n     The plan must specify the manner in which the planned \n     employment reductions will improve efficiency or meet budget \n     or staffing levels. The plan must also include a proposed \n     time period for payment of separation incentives, and a \n     proposed coverage for offers of incentives to Department \n     employees, targeting positions in accordance with VA's \n     strategic alignment plan. Coverage may be on the basis of any \n     component of the Department, any occupation or levels of an \n     occupation, any geographic location, or any appropriate \n     combination of these factors. The Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget shall approve or disapprove each plan \n     submitted, and may modify the plan with respect to the time \n     period for incentives or the coverage of incentive offers.\n       Section 4 provides that in order to receive a voluntary \n     separation incentive, an employee covered by an offer of \n     incentives must\n\n[[Page S11555]]\n\n     separate from service with the agency (whether by retirement \n     or resignation) within the time period specified in the \n     agency's plan as approved. For an employee who separates, the \n     voluntary separation incentive is an amount equal to the \n     lesser of the amount that the employee's severance pay would \n     be if the employee were entitled to severance pay under \n     section 5595 of title 5, United States Code (without \n     adjustment for any previous severance pay), or whichever of \n     the following amounts is applicable based on the date of \n     separation: $25,000 during fiscal year 1996 or 1997; $20,000 \n     during fiscal year 1998; $15,000 during fiscal year 1999; \n     or $10,000 during fiscal year 2000. These reductions in \n     incentive amount for each year an employee delays \n     separation would encourage eligible employees to take the \n     incentive at an earlier point.\n       Section 5 provides that any employee who receives a \n     voluntary separation incentive under this Act and then \n     accepts any employment with the Government within 5 years \n     after separating must, prior to the first day of such \n     employment, repay the entire amount of the incentive to the \n     agency that paid the incentive. If the subsequent employment \n     is with the Executive branch, including the United States \n     Postal Service, the Director of the Office of Personnel \n     Management may waive the repayment at the request of the \n     agency head if the individual possesses unique abilities and \n     is the only qualified applicant available for the position. \n     For subsequent employment in the legislative branch, the head \n     of the entity or the appointing official may waive repayment \n     on the same basis. If the subsequent employment is in the \n     judicial branch, the Director of the Administrative Office of \n     the United States Courts may waive repayment on the same \n     criteria. For the purpose of the repayment and waiver \n     provisions, employment includes employment under a personal \n     services contract, as defined by the Director of the Office \n     of Personnel Management.\n       Section 6 requires additional agency contributions to the \n     Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund in amounts equal \n     to 15 percent of the final basic pay of each employee of the \n     Department who is covered by the Civil Service Retirement \n     System to whom a voluntary separation incentive is paid under \n     this Act.\n       Section 7 provides that full-time equivalent employment \n     (FTEE) in the Department will be reduced by one for each \n     separation of an employee who receives a voluntary separation \n     incentive under this Act, and directs the Office of \n     Management and Budget to take any action necessary to ensure \n     compliance. Reductions will be calculated by using the \n     Department's actual FTEE levels. For example, if the \n     Department's FTEE usage in FY 1996 is 1,050 FTEEs, and 50 \n     FTEEs separate during FY 1997 using voluntary separation \n     incentive payments provided under this Act, then \n     the Department's staffing levels at the end of FY 1997 \n     shall not exceed 1,000 FTEEs. The President may waive the \n     reduction in FTEE in the event of war or emergency.\n       Section 8 requires the Department to report to the Office \n     of Personnel Management (OPM) on a quarterly basis: the \n     number of employees receiving incentive payments for each \n     type of separation; the average amount of incentive payments; \n     the average grade or pay of employees receiving incentive \n     payments; and other information OPM may require. This section \n     also requires the Office of Personnel Management to report by \n     March 31st of each year to the Senate Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Government \n     Reform and Oversight concerning the Department's use of \n     voluntary separation incentives in the previous fiscal year. \n     The report must show the number of employees who received \n     incentives, the average amount of the incentives, and the \n     average grade or pay level of the employees who received \n     incentives. The report must also include the number of \n     waivers made under the provisions of section 5 in the \n     repayment of incentives upon subsequent employment with the \n     Government, the reasons for each waiver, and the title and \n     grade or pay level of each employee to whom the waiver \n     applied.\n       Section 9 amends section 3502(f) of title 5 to authorize \n     the Secretary to allow an employee to volunteer for \n     separation in a reduction-in-force when this will result in \n     retaining an employee in a similar position who would \n     otherwise be released in the reduction-in-force. Section 9 \n     also changes section 3502(f)'s sunset date from 1996 to 2000.\n       Section 10 amends section 8905a(d)(4) to provide that \n     employees who are involuntarily separated in a reduction in \n     force, or who voluntarily separate from a surplus position \n     that has been specifically identified for elimination in the \n     reduction in force, can continue health benefits coverage for \n     18 months and be required to pay only the employee's share of \n     the premium. Section 10 also extends section 8905a(d)(4) \n     sunset provisions.\n       Section 11 provides that the Director of OPM may prescribe \n     any regulations necessary to administer the provisions of the \n     Act.\n       Section 12 provides that no voluntary separation incentive \n     under the Act may be paid based on the separation of an \n     employee after September 30, 2000, and that the Act \n     supplements and does not supersede other authority of the \n     Secretary.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                Secretary of Veterans Affairs,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 11, 1996.\n     Hon. Albert Gore, Jr.,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are submitting a draft bill \n     ``Department of Veterans Affairs Employment Reduction \n     Assistance Act of 1996.'' We request that it be referred to \n     the appropriate committee for prompt consideration and \n     enactment.\n       In the next several years, VA will undergo dramatic change. \n     VA believes that separation incentives can be an appropriate \n     tool for those VA components that are redesigning their \n     employment mix when the use of incentives is property related \n     to the specific changes that are needed within those \n     components and thus will reshape the agency for the future. \n     They can also be an invaluable tool for components that are \n     restructuring and reengineering, such as the Veterans Health \n     Administration and the Veterans Benefits Administration, as \n     they move towards primary care and new methods of delivering \n     services to veterans. Further, it is vital to provide for \n     consistent administration of any incentive programs that \n     prove necessary for different components, and to \n     appropriately limit the time period for any incentive offers.\n       This initiative is based on VA's experience with voluntary \n     separation incentives under the Federal Workforce \n     Restructuring Act of 1994. The Restructuring Act provided \n     Federal civilian agencies, including VA, with authority to \n     offer voluntary separation incentives for a 1-year period \n     that ended March 31, 1995. VA generally used these incentives \n     successfully to help avoid involuntary separations and to \n     achieve reductions in administrative overhead and supervisory \n     positions, and the Restructuring Act provided a useful \n     framework for consistent administration of incentive \n     programs in many different VA components.\n       This proposal would provide an overall system for the \n     limited use of voluntary separation incentives by VA. When \n     the Secretary determines that employment in particular \n     organizations must be reduced in order to meet restructuring \n     goals, the Secretary may submit a plan to the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget for payment of voluntary \n     separation incentives to Department employees. The plan must \n     specify how the planned employment reductions will improve \n     efficiency or meet budget or staffing levels. The plan must \n     also include a proposed time period for payment of \n     incentives, and a proposed coverage for offers of incentives \n     to agency employees on the needed organizational, \n     occupational, or geographic basis, targeting positions in \n     accordance with VA's strategic alignment plan. The Director \n     of the Office of Management and Budget would approve or \n     disapprove each plan submitted, and would have authority to \n     modify the time period for incentives or coverage of \n     incentive offers. We believe that these provisions for plan \n     approval will ensure that separation incentives are \n     appropriately targeted within the Department in view of the \n     specific cuts that are needed, and are offered on a timely \n     basis. Although the Department's full-time equivalent \n     employment would be reduced by one for each employee of the \n     Department who receives an incentive, we believe that service \n     to veterans will improve as a result of the reengineering \n     that is happening simultaneously within the system.\n       The authority for separation incentives would be in effect \n     for the period starting with the enactment of this Act and \n     ending September 30, 2000. The amount of an employee's \n     incentive would be the lesser of the amount that the \n     employee's severance pay would be, or whichever of the \n     following amounts is applicable based on the year of \n     separation in accordance with the agency plan; for employees \n     who retire, $25,000 during fiscal year 1996 or 1997, \n     $20,000 during fiscal year 1998, $15,000 during fiscal \n     year 1999, and $10,000 during fiscal year 2000.\n       These reductions in the incentive amount for each year an \n     employee delays separation would encourage employees to take \n     the incentives during the first year of eligibility. An \n     employee who receives an incentive and then accepts any \n     employment with the Government within 5 years after \n     separating must, prior to the first day of employment, repay \n     the entire amount of the entire amount of the incentive. The \n     repayment requirement could be waived only under very \n     stringent circumstances of agency need.\n       In order to further assist VA components in making needed \n     changes, the bill would authorize VA, under appropriate \n     conditions, to allow an employee to volunteer for separation \n     in a reduction-in-force when this will prevent the \n     involuntary separation of an employee in a similar position. \n     In addition, in order to minimize the impact of reduction-in-\n     force actions on employees, the bill provides that employees \n     who are involuntarily separated in reductions-in-force can \n     continue their health insurance coverage for 18 months while \n     continuing to pay only the premium that would apply to a \n     current employee.\n       This proposal would provide a very useful tool to assist in \n     reorganizing VA and reengineering services provided to \n     veterans, quickly, effectively, and humanely. We also believe \n     that it is a tool that will allow significant cost savings. \n     If the proposal is enacted, we will report, on an annual \n     basis, cost savings associated with separation incentives as \n     well as where such funds have been redirected to improve the \n     provision of services to veterans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SIMPSON (by request):\n\n[[Page S11556]]\n\n  S. 2152.

Albert Gore, Jr.,\n     President of the Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Transmitted herewith is a draft bill \n     ``To amend title 38, United States Code, to provide benefits \n     for certain children of Vietnam veterans who are born with \n     spina bifida.''\n       On March 14, 1996, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the \n     National Academy of Sciences released a report which \n     concluded that there is ``limited/suggestive'' evidence of an \n     association between exposure to herbicides and spina bifida, \n     a neural tube birth defect in which the bones of the spine \n     fail to close over the spinal cord, often causing \n     neurological impairment.\\1\\ Based on this conclusion, and \n     consistent with the spirit of the statutory standard \n     governing decisions regarding presumptions of service \n     connection for disabilities associated with exposure to \n     herbicides during active military service in the Republic of \n     Vietnam, as established by Public Law 102-4, I have \n     determined that a positive association exists between \n     exposure of a parent to herbicides during such service and \n     the birth defect of spina bifida.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ That report, Veterans and Agent Orange: Update 1996, also \n     concluded that ``limited/suggestive'' evidence of an \n     association exists between exposure to herbicides and cancer \n     of the prostate and acute/subacute peripheral neuropathy. \n     Based on these conclusions, I have determined, under \n     statutory guidelines set forth in section 1116(b)(3) of title \n     38, United States Code, that a ``positive association'' \n     exists between such exposure and the two conditions. Pursuant \n     to section 1116(b)(1), we intend to add such diseases to the \n     list of diseases for which a presumption of service \n     connection is established.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       This determination was made based on a recommendation of a \n     special task force I established to review the IOM report. \n     The task force noted that certain studies of Vietnam veterans \n     suggested an apparent increase in the risk for spina bifida \n     in their offspring. These included studies conducted by the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and, more \n     recently, a study of offspring of Air Force Ranch Hand \n     personnel. Although noting that scientific questions remain, \n     the task force indicated that spina bifida does appear to \n     meet the statutory standards set forth in Public Law 102-\n     4.\\2\\ The task force noted that VA currently has no authority \n     to establish presumptions of service connection for diseases \n     in the offspring of veterans, but concluded that, if such \n     authority existed, it would recommend, at this time, that \n     spina bifida in the offspring of Vietnam veterans be treated \n     in the same manner as prostate cancer and acute/subacute \n     peripheral neuropathy. Because VA currently has no authority \n     to provide benefits to these offspring, enabling legislation \n     is necessary.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ The standard for determining whether a positive \n     association exists with respect to herbicide exposure and \n     diseases in Vietnam veterans is set forth in 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1116(b)(3), as added by Public Law 102-4, which states, \n     ``An association between the occurrence of a disease in \n     humans and exposure to a herbicide agent shall be considered \n     to be positive for the purposes of this section if the \n     credible evidence for the association is equal to or \n     outweighs the credible evidence against the association.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       We recognize that the provisions of law that govern and, in \n     some instances, mandate, the addition of new disabilities for \n     which a presumption of service connection is provided do not \n     govern the present situation. However, the level of \n     association that we believe has been shown to exist is no \n     less compelling for the conditions suffered by these children \n     than for certain diseases in Vietnam veterans themselves for \n     which the Government has assumed responsibility. It seems \n     appropriate, therefore, and in the best interests of these \n     children, that the same benefit of the doubt as is required \n     to be given Vietnam veterans be given to their offspring, \n     whose birth defects may be a result of their father's or \n     mother's service to this country.\n       Historically, benefits for spouses and/or children have \n     been derivative, that is, based on the death or disability of \n     a veteran. The benefits proposed in this draft bill would \n     represent the first instance in which VA would be \n     authorized to provide benefits to a non-veteran based on a \n     possible relationship between that individual's disability \n     and a veteran's service. While this is unprecedented, we \n     believe it to be an appropriate extension of the principle \n     of providing benefits for disabilities that are incurred \n     or aggravated as a result of an individual's service on \n     active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States. When \n     sound medical judgment indicates a course of action, as it \n     appears to in this case, we believe that it is not only \n     reasonable, but responsible, to propose the enactment of \n     appropriate legislative remedies. We believe Congress, in \n     enacting the standards for compensation found in Public \n     Law 102-4, intended that the benefit of the doubt should \n     be applied in making judgments regarding the consequences \n     surrounding the use of herbicide agents and that benefits \n     be provided to individuals who have suffered injury as a \n     result thereof, a policy which should have equal force in \n     terms of providing benefits to the offspring of such \n     individuals.\n       The primary benefit proposed in the draft bill is \n     associated comprehensive medical care, which could be \n     provided directly by VA or by contract with non-VA providers. \n     Second, because of the likelihood that individuals who suffer \n     from spina bifida will encounter difficulties in pursuing \n     vocational goals, we believe it is appropriate to assist them \n     through the provision of vocational training benefits. \n     Finally, in recognition of other, special financial needs \n     these children are likely to have, we believe they should be \n     provided with a monthly stipend to help defray additional \n     expenses associated with their disabilities. The Secretary \n     would be required to base the amount of the stipend, or \n     allowance, on each child's level of disability, in accordance \n     with a special schedule established for this purpose. Under \n     the proposed framework, the Secretary would pay the allowance \n     based upon three levels of disability, resulting in monthly \n     levels of $200 per month for the lowest level of disability \n     assigned, $700 per month for the intermediate level of \n     disability assigned, and $1,200 per month for the highest \n     level of disability assigned.\n       In addition, this proposal includes a provision to offset \n     costs associated with these new benefits. This provision \n     would effectively reverse the U.S. Supreme Court decision in \n     Gardner v. Brown which held that monthly VA disability \n     compensation must be paid for any additional disability or \n     death attributable to VA medical treatment even if VA was not \n     negligent in providing that care. A detailed explanation of \n     the justification for this cost-saving measure appears in the \n     testimony of VA's General Counsel before the Senate Committee \n     on Veterans' Affairs on June 8, 1995.\n       This bill would affect direct spending and therefore is \n     subject to the pay-as-you-go provisions of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1990. Enactment of this legislation \n     would increase direct spending by $5.5 million in Fiscal Year \n     1997 and decrease direct spending by $291.5 million over a 5-\n     year period.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the submission of this proposal to the \n     Congress and that its enactment would be in accord with the \n     program of the President.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Jesse Brown.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 72\n\n       Whereas it is incumbent upon the Congress to oppose any \n     action that would have the effect of undermining the rule of \n     law or the faith of the American people in our jury system;\n       Whereas on May 28, 1996, former business partners of the \n     President were convicted of a total of 24 felony counts by a \n     jury of 12 Arkansas residents;\n       Whereas Susan McDougal and Jim Guy Tucker have been \n     sentenced for their crimes by a Federal district judge in \n     Little Rock, Arkansas, and their codefendant James McDougal \n     is awaiting sentencing by the same judge;\n       Whereas on September 4, 1996, Susan McDougal was held in \n     contempt of court for refusing to answer questions before a \n     Federal grand jury relating to (1) the knowledge of the \n     President with respect to the fraudulent transactions for \n     which she was convicted, and (2) the truthfulness of the \n     testimony of the President at her trial;\n       Whereas in a televised interview broadcast on September 23, \n     1996, the President stated that any request for a \n     Presidential pardon made by James or Susan McDougal or Jim \n     Guy Tucker would be reviewed in the normal course, thereby \n     leaving open the possibility that one or more pardons might \n     indeed be issued at some later date;\n       Whereas any Presidential pardon of James or Susan McDougal \n     or Jim Guy Tucker would seriously undermine the confidence of \n     the American people in our criminal justice system, by \n     essentially nullifying felony convictions of friends and \n     associates of the President rendered by a jury of 12 Arkansas \n     residents on charges initially brought by a grand jury \n     comprised of 23 other Arkansans; and\n       Whereas the September 23, 1996, remarks by the President \n     could be construed by his recently convicted friends and \n     associates as offering them an inducement to refuse to \n     testify honestly and openly about matters under investigation \n     by Federal law enforcement authorities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring, That it is the sense of the Congress that the \n     President should categorically disavow any intention of \n     issuing a Presidential pardon to James or Susan McDougal or \n     Jim Guy Tucker, and thereby affirm the principle that, in the \n     system of justice in the United States, no person is above \n     the law.\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I have been very disturbed by the \nrecent press reports detailing the President's willingness to pardon \nSusan McDougal and possibly other former business partners and friends \nwho have been convicted of defrauding the government.\n  The President's public willingness to suggest that a pardon may be \nforthcoming, at a time when Susan McDougal is facing contempt charges \nby a lawfully empaneled grand jury for not responding to questions \nabout the role and truthfulness of the President himself, undermines \nour judicial system and seriously questions his ability to fulfill his \nobligation to see that ``the laws be faithfully executed.''\n  As you will recall, Mr. President, Susan McDougal was convicted on \nseveral felony counts of defrauding the government. She was tried and \nconvicted by a jury of her peers in Little Rock, Arkansas and sentenced \nto 2 years in prison for her crimes.\n  While the President may not be pleased with the results of \nIndependent Counsel Kenneth Starr's, investigation, including the \nconviction of many of his friends and former associates, it is \noutrageous for the President to now allege prosecutorial misconduct on \nbehalf of Mr. Starr. At the request of Attorney General Reno, a three \njudge panel appointed an Independent Counsel, Kenneth Starr, to \ninvestigate fully any violation of Federal law relating in any way to \nJames B. McDouglal's, President William Jefferson Clinton's or Mrs. \nHillary Rodham Clinton's relationships with Madison Guaranty Savings & \nLoan Association, Whitewater Development Corporation, or Capital \nManagement Services, Inc.\n  Mr. President, the President's recent statements raise serious \nquestions about his intent to interfere with, and possibly undermine, \nthe Independent Counsel's ongoing investigation into these matters.\n  Today, Senator Bond and I are submitting a concurrent resolution that \nwould express the Sense of the Congress that the President should \ndisavow any intent of issuing presidential pardons to James and Susan \nMcDougal and Jim Guy Tucker and reaffirm one of the basic tenets of our \nAmerican system of justice that no one is above the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11558-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11558-S11559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 73--RELATIVE TO PROPERTY CLAIMS\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 73\n\n       Whereas Fascist and Communist dictatorships have caused \n     immeasurable human suffering and loss, degrading not only \n     every conceivable human right, but the human spirit itself;\n       Whereas the villainy of communism was dedicated, in \n     particular, to the organized, and systematic destruction of \n     private property ownership;\n       Whereas the wrongful and illegal confiscation of property \n     perpetrated by Fascist and Communist regimes was often \n     specifically designed to victimize people because of their \n     religion, national or social origin, or expressed opposition \n     to the regimes which repressed them;\n       Whereas Fascists and Communists often obtained possession \n     of properties confiscated from the victims of the systems \n     they actively supported;\n       Whereas Jewish individuals and communities were often twice \n     victimized, first by the Nazis and their collaborators and \n     then by the subsequent Communist regimes;\n       Whereas churches, synagogues, mosques, and other religious \n     properties were also destroyed or confiscated as a means of \n     breaking the spiritual devotion and allegiance of religious \n     adherents;\n       Whereas Fascists, Nazis, and Communists have used foreign \n     financial institutions to launder and hold wrongfully and \n     illegally confiscated property and convert it to their own \n     personal use;\n       Whereas some foreign financial institutions violated their \n     fiduciary duty to their customers by converting to their own \n     use financial assets belonging to Holocaust victims while \n     denying heirs access to these assets;\n       Whereas refugees from communism, in addition to being \n     wrongly stripped of their private property, were often forced \n     to relinquish their citizenship in order to protect \n     themselves and their families from reprisals by the \n     Communists who ruled their countries;\n       Whereas the participating states of the Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe have agreed to give full \n     recognition and protection to all types of property, \n     including private property, as well as the right to prompt, \n     just, and effective compensation in the event private \n     property is taken for public use;\n       Whereas the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, as \n     well as the Caucasus and Central Asia, have entered a post-\n     Communist period of transition and democratic\n\n[[Page S11559]]\n\n     development, and many countries have begun the difficult \n     and wrenching process of trying to right the past wrongs \n     of previous totalitarian regimes;\n       Whereas restrictions which require those whose properties \n     have been wrongly plundered by Nazi or Communist regimes to \n     reside in or have the citizenship of the country from which \n     they now seek restitution or compensation are arbitrary and \n     discriminatory in violation of international law; and\n       Whereas the rule of law and democratic norms require that \n     the activity of governments and their administrative agencies \n     be exercised in accordance with the laws passed by their \n     parliaments or legislatures and such laws themselves must be \n     consistent with international human rights standards: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) welcomes the efforts of many post-Communist countries \n     to address the complex and difficult question of the status \n     of plundered properties;\n       (2) urges countries which have not already done so to \n     return plundered properties to their rightful owners or, as \n     an alternative, pay compensation, in accordance with \n     principles of justice and in a manner that is just, \n     transparent, and fair;\n       (3) calls for the urgent return of property formerly \n     belonging to Jewish communities as a means of redressing the \n     particularly compelling problems of aging and destitute \n     survivors of the Holocaust;\n       (4) calls on the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, \n     Romania, Slovakia and any other country with restrictions \n     which require those whose properties have been wrongly \n     plundered by Nazi or Communist regimes to reside in or have \n     the citizenship of the country from which they now seek \n     restitution or compensation to remove such restrictions from \n     their restitution or compensation laws;\n       (5) calls upon foreign financial institutions, and the \n     states having legal authority over their operation, that \n     possess wrongfully and illegally property confiscated from \n     Holocaust victims, from residents of former Warsaw Pact \n     states who were forbidden by Communist law from obtaining \n     restitution of such property, and from states that were \n     occupied by Nazi, Fascist, or Communist forces, to assist and \n     to cooperate fully with efforts to restore this property to \n     its rightful owners; and\n       (6) urges post-Communist countries to pass and effectively \n     implement laws that provide for restitution of, or \n     compensation for, plundered property.\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I submit a concurrent resolution \nwhich addresses a number of distinct, but closely related, property \nissues. It follows up on work already done by the Helsinki Commission, \nwhich held a hearing on this subject on July 18, 1996. This same \nconcurrent resolution is being submitted today in the House by the \nCommission's distinguished Chairman, my good friend and colleague from \nNew Jersey, Congressman Chris Smith. It is cosponsored by the majority \nof the Commission.\n  The substance of this concurrent resolution has been discussed with \nthe Administration and parallels and supports the work being done by \nUnder Secretary of Commerce for International Trade Stuart E. \nEizenstat, who also serves as the U.S. Department of State Special \nEnvoy for Property Claims in Central and Eastern Europe.\n  I strongly believe that there must be a full, complete and final \naccounting of the assets of Holocaust victims that have been wrongfully \nheld by Swiss--and possibly other banks--for some five decades now. \nThose records must be opened, and the stolen assets returned to their \nrightful heirs. This concurrent resolution addresses that issue.\n  It also addresses the compelling situation of Holocaust survivors in \nCentral and Eastern Europe. Many of these people, unlike their \ncounterparts in Western Europe, were denied the chance to receive any \ncompensation for their suffering or to receive the return of properties \nstolen by the Nazis when the iron curtain closed, leaving them at the \nmercy of new dictatorships. This concurrent resolution recognizes the \nurgent need for Jewish communal properties to be restored to their \nrightful owners, to help give these survivors the means to live out \ntheir final days in dignity.\n  Finally, this concurrent resolution speaks to the difficult and \ncomplex process underway in many post-Communist countries in Central \nand Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Some countries have \nalready taken steps to return property or provide compensation for \nproperty wrongly confiscated by Communist regimes. I commend those \ncountries for their efforts.\n  At the same time, I am deeply troubled that some restitution or \ncompensation laws have discriminated against American citizens, people \nwho lost both their property and their citizenship when they sought \nrefuge in this country, fleeing Communist persecution. To exclude these \npeople from efforts to right past wrongs pours salt on an open wound. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting this concurrent resolution, \nand in sending a message that these injustices must be remedied before \nthe passage of time carries the victims beyond our mortal abilities to \noffer them some recompense for their suffering.\n  While restoration of property ownership or compensation for its \nwrongful confiscation can never right the terrible wrongs done to the \nvictims by their Nazi, fascist, and communist oppressors, it can go \nsome way toward balancing the scales. That is what this concurrent \nresolution is about and why it deserves our support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11558-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                THE FEDERAL POWER ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1996\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      MURKOWSKI AMENDMENT NO. 5412\n\n  Mr. NICKLES (for Mr. Murkowski) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. \n737) to extend the deadlines applicable to certain hydroelectric \nprojects, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       Beginning of page 2 line 1 through page 6 line 6, strike \n     section 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, and renumber subsequent section \n     accordingly.\n       On page 9, following line 17, add the following new section\n\n     ``SEC. 5.

Mr. President, this morning I rise to commend the \nNational Institutes of Health and its leadership for changing the way \nthe Government buys technology.\n  Earlier this year, the Information Technology Management Reform Act, \nwhich I authored, became law. ITMRA fundamentally changes the rules \ngoverning how the Government purchases and uses technology. It \neliminated overly bureaucratic and cumbersome procedures that resulted \nin the Government's failure to get what it needed and frustrated \nvendors who were unable to provide government with the optimum \nsolution. ITMRA sets the stage for Federal agencies to emulate \nsuccessful organizations and break up large computer projects into \nsmaller more manageable segments--a strategy that up to now had been \nhindered by a procurement system that encourages large complex \ncontracts.\n  Despite passage of this major reform, the Government must also \novercome a culture that arose from the antiquated and cumbersome way of \ndoing business. While the full impact of this reform may take a little \ntime to be felt, some agencies have seized the opportunity to become \nleaders in innovation consistent with the spirit and intent of the \nlegislation. While I have witnessed recent innovations within the \nDepartment of Defense, General Services Administration and a number of \nother agencies, one effort stands out as exemplifying the spirit behind \nITMRA and is particularly well developed based on the intent behind \nITMRA.\n  The chief information officers solutions and partners contract at the \nNational Institutes of Health is an excellent example of how \ngovernment, under ITMRA, will be able to meet its technology needs in a \nreasonable time frame and obtain optimum solutions. By comprehending \nthe possibilities presented by recently enacted procurement reform, NIH \nhas provided a contracting vehicle that will allow Federal agencies to \nbuy goods and services in a manner that is competitive, easy to use, \nfair and timely.\n  Although the ultimate success of this program will depend on NIH's \nability to properly administer the task orders it receives, the \ninnovation demonstrated in the early phases of this procurement \ndeserves special mention. In particular, the leadership and hard work \nof two NIH employees, Manny DeVera and Gale Greenwald, deserve special \nattention.\n  Both Mr. DeVera and Ms. Greenwald quickly recognized the potential of \nITMRA and procurement reform, allowing them to award a flexible \ncontract in record time. Both the Government customers and the vendor \ncommunity are quite excited about the prospects for obtaining needed \nservices in a timely and efficient manner. Government clients will be \nable to obtain the technology, services, and solutions they need under \nITMRA via competitive task orders. Agencies will not have to bundle \ntheir requirements into large contracts that take years to award and \noften end in protest and litigation. Under the new law, an agency can \nlook to the growing number of multiple award task order contracts or \nthe GSA schedule to fulfill information technology requirements. Agency \nchief information officers can then focus on the return on investment \nfrom information technology rather than on finding ways to overcome \nobstacles in the Federal procurement system.\n  Mr. President, while this contract must still prove itself, this \neffort represents a milestone in innovation. The two Federal employees \nmost responsible for this innovation, Manny DeVera and Gale Greenwald, \ndeserve our thanks and appreciation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11560-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HIGHWAY FUNDING FAIRNESS ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I proudly join with the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Senator Baucus, to correct a serious accounting error that \nwill cost my home State of Delaware millions of dollars in badly needed \nFederal highway assistance.\n  Federal-aid highway funds are for the creation and maintenance of our \nNation's interstate highways--literally the lifelines of our economy. \nThe east coast's largest, most important interstate, I-95, runs through \nthe northernmost part of Delaware, carrying hundreds of millions of \ntons of goods and products from Maine to Florida and beyond. Tens of \nthousands of Delawareans commute daily on I-95.\n  In fact, the Delaware Department of Transportation is just now \nbeginning a massive, $73 million project to repave and resurface key \nparts of I-95. This undertaking is vitally important not only to the \npeople of Delaware, but to commuters and businesses across America.\n  Yet, next fiscal year, Delaware--partly because of a 1994 \nbureaucratic snafu--is going to receive approximately $8.2 million less \nthan it received in 1996. That is an 11-percent cut.\n  This will occur even though the Federal Government will spend a \nrecord $18 billion on Federal highway assistance--roughly $455 million \nmore than the current year.\n  During consideration of the Transportation Appropriations bill this \npast July, Senator Baucus successfully offered an amendment that I \nsupported to correct this miscalculation and restore the needed \nfunding. Yet despite the strong vote in support, and the best efforts \nof Senator Lautenberg, conferees dropped the Baucus amendment, thus \npreserving the slip-up and cutting funding to 28 States.\n  Because of this fundamental unfairness, and the egregious, short-\nsighted cuts in Amtrak funding, I voted against the Transportation \nAppropriations conference report.\n  The legislation introduced by Senator Baucus that I am cosponsoring \ntoday, the Highway Funding Fairness Act of 1996, corrects the 1994 \nhighway fund credit mistake and gives the 28 affected States their \nrightful allocations.\n  This 1994 accounting error skims the surface of the issue, however. \nThe root cause of the $8 million cut in funding to Delaware is the \nskewed allocation formula put in place by the 1991 Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA], which fails to accurately \nreflect highway needs. This formula, particularly the so-called 90 \npercent of payments guarantee, unfairly rewards selected States at the \nexpense of smaller, less populated States, such as Delaware.\n  I intend to work hard next year during consideration of the ISTEA \nreauthorization bill to correct this fundamental unfairness, and ensure \nthat States, like Delaware, receive their proper share of highway \nfunds.\n  I hope my colleagues representing the other 27 affected States will \nseriously consider cosponsoring the Highway Funding Fairness Act of \n1996, and I commend and thank Senator Baucus for all of his \nwork.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11560-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11560-S11561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            JOE MARK ELKOURI\n\n Mr. INHOFE.

Throughout \nhis life, Joe Mark gave of himself for the benefit of countless others, \nendearing friends and loved ones for life.\n  He is survived by two loving daughters, Brie and Lee Elkouri of \nOklahoma City; two sisters, KoKo Sparks and family of Oklahoma City, \nand Sharon Massad of California; his mother Dorothy Weinstein of \nDallas, TX, and Jim Roth of the home.\n  Joe Mark served his community as a distinguished member of the State \nbar of Oklahoma and served as an Administrative Law Judge for numerous \nState agencies and as a Special Judge for the city of Oklahoma City. \nJoe Mark's professional accomplishments are many, but he will be \nremembered most for his\n\n[[Page S11561]]\n\ntremendous good will, enormous heart, and joyful sense of humor. He \nwill be greatly missed by all who knew him and loved him. May He Rest \nIn Peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11560-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE ACCOUNTABLE PIPELINE SAFETY AND PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to support S. 1505, \nthe Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act of 1996. My \ninterest in the pipeline safety issue dates back to the explosion and \nfire at Edison, NJ in 1994. In reaction to that tragedy, which set fire \nto eight apartment houses and cost one life, I introduced the \nComprehensive One-Call Notification Act, S. 164, cosponsored by \nSenators Spector, Lautenberg and Exon. The purpose of that bill was to \nimprove state-wide notification systems to protect natural gas and \nhazardous liquid pipelines from being damaged during excavations, the \ncause of the Edison accident.\n  In S. 1505, the Commerce Committee has wisely chosen to strengthen \nState one-call programs, and has provided new authorization for grants \nto States to establish one-call notification systems consistent with \nstandards which assure at least a minimally acceptable level of \nprotection from accidents. These grants, which were also a feature of \nS. 164, will assist States in developing the kinds of one-call systems \nneeded to prevent future Edisons from happening.\n  While I would have preferred a stronger and more comprehensive set of \nrequirements, the bill is an important first step toward the goal of \nimplementing strong, comprehensive one-call systems nationwide.\n  S. 1505 also includes new language broadening public education \nprograms carried out by natural gas pipeline owners to include the use \nof one-call systems.\n  Finally, I was pleased to join with Senator Lautenberg in proposing \nadditional provisions which are the subject of a manager's amendment to \nS. 1505. These include a survey and risk assessment by the Department \nof Transportation of the effectiveness of remotely-controlled valves \nwhich shut off the flow of natural gas in the event of a pipeline \nrupture. Once the survey and assessment are completed, the Secretary of \nTransportation shall issue standards for their use if he or she finds \nthem technically and economically feasible.\n  The manager's amendment also includes measures to promote public \nawareness of pipeline location. Pipeline owners or operators must \nprovide municipalities where pipelines are located with facility maps \nto prevent accidents and respond to pipeline emergencies. In addition, \nthe Secretary of Transportation must survey existing public education \nplans to determine which components are most effective at accident \nprevention. After analyzing the results of the survey, the Secretary \nmay promulgate nationwide regulations, if necessary, to ensure the \nsafest feasible pipeline public education system.\n  The bill and these amendments, taken together, represent a \nconsiderable improvement over current practices for accident \nprevention. I hope they can be enacted this year, and prevent another \nEdison accident.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11561-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11561-S11562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            NAVAJO-HOPI LAND DISPUTE SETTLEMENT ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues \nto support this important legislation which will resolve a longstanding \ndispute between the Hopi Tribe, the Navajo Nation and the United \nStates. This legislation marks the culmination of 4 years of mediation \nefforts of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals involving the Hopi Tribe, \nthe Navajo Nation, representatives of the Navajo families residing on \nHopi partitioned lands, and the U.S. Department of Justice. S. 1973 \nprovides for the settlement of four claims of the Hopi Tribe against \nthe United States and provides the necessary authority to the Hopi \nTribe to issue 75-year lease agreements to Navajo families residing on \nthe Hopi partitioned land. This legislation will ratify the settlement \nand accommodation agreements made by the Department of Justice, the \nHopi Tribe, the Navajo Nation, and the Navajo families residing on the \nHopi partitioned lands.\n  The settlement marks an important first step in bringing this \nlongstanding dispute between the Hopi Tribe, the Navajo Nation, and the \nUnited States to an orderly and peaceful conclusion. These agreements \nare the product of many, many hours of negotiation under the auspices \nof the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals mediation process. While I \nunderstand that there are factions in both the Hopi Tribe and the \nNavajo Nation who have voiced their opposition to the settlement, I \nbelieve that these agreements represent the only realistic way to \nsettle the claims of the Hopi Tribe against the United States and to \nprovide an accommodation for the hundreds of Navajos residing on Hopi \npartitioned lands.\n  I believe it is imperative that the Congress take this step before \nthe close of this session in order to bring this longstanding dispute \nto a final resolution. It has been over 22 years since the Navajo-Hopi \nSettlement Act was passed with the intention of settling the disputes \nbetween the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe. Since that time, the \nFederal Government has spent over $350 million to fund the Navajo-Hopi \nRelocation Program. That funding exceeded the original cost estimates \nby more than 900 percent. And yet, there are over 130 appeals still \npending, which raises a great deal of uncertainty regarding who is and \nis not eligible for further relocation benefits under the act. I am \nconvinced that future Federal budgetary pressures will force closure of \nthe Navajo-Hopi Relocation Housing Program. I intend to ensure that \nthis be done in an orderly fashion. I will introduce separate \nlegislation in the near future that will provide for a measured phase \nout of the Navajo-Hopi Relocation Housing Program in 5 years. As an \nimportant first step, it is critical that the Congress pass legislation \nto settle the outstanding claims of the Hopi Tribe against the United \nStates.\n  There are several important clarifications that have been made to the \nlegislation as part of our committee's deliberation on the bill. S. \n1973 has been amended to make clear that the Hopi Tribe has the \nauthority to renew leases entered into under the settlement for \nadditional terms of 75 years. The bill makes clear that the Hopi Tribe \ncannot place land into trust that is located within a 5 mile radius of \nan incorporated town or city in northern Arizona and that prior to \nplacing lands into trust for the Hopi Tribe, the Secretary shall \ncertify that no more than 15 percent of the eligible Navajo households \nremain on the HPL without having an accommodation agreement with the \nHopi Tribe. These clarifications will help ensure that this settlement \nwill achieve a greater degree of finality.\n\n  Mr. President, I am also proposing several amendments which further \nclarify provisions in the settlement and its potential impacts on \ncommunities in northern Arizona. The first amendment clarifies that the \nprovisions prohibiting the Secretary from taking lands into trust \nwithin 5 miles of an incorporated town also apply to cities in northern \nArizona. The second amendment adds a finding to the bill that \nrecognizes that the Navajo Nation and the Navajo families did not \nparticipate in the settlement between the Hopi Tribe and the United \nStates. The third amendment adds a new definition for newly acquired \ntrust lands. The fourth amendment pertains to the potential impacts of \nthe settlement provisions on ongoing water rights negotiations in \nnorthern Arizona. It would make clear that the settlement agreements \nprovisions would not prejudice or adversely impact existing water users \nand more senior water rights holders along the Little Colorado River. \nThis provision also makes clear that any water rights covered in the \nsettlement agreement are a part of, and bound by, the adjudication of \nthe court presiding over the Little Colorado River adjudication. \nFinally, the amendment makes clear that nothing in the Act or the \namendments made by the act shall preclude, limit, or endorse actions by \nthe Navajo Nation to seek, in court, an offset from judgments for \npayments received by the Hopi Tribe.\n  It is my understanding that as part of the negotiations on provisions \nin the bill relating to the Little Colorado River adjudication, the \nHopi Tribe and the city of Flagstaff have commenced discussions to \nresolve the water rights of the city of Flagstaff. I am very\n\n[[Page S11562]]\n\npleased that the city of Flagstaff has communicated its support for \nthis settlement and its desire to work with the Hopi Tribe to resolve \nthe outstanding issues related to their respective claims to scarce \nwater resources. I am also pleased that the Hopi Tribe has pledged to \nwork diligently with the city to resolve these difficult issues. It is \nmy hope that both the Hopi Tribe and the city of Flagstaff will be able \nto resolve these issues amicably in the near future. To that end, let \nme assure the parties that I will provide whatever assistance I can in \nworking with the Hopi Tribe and the city of Flagstaff to resolve these \nimportant issues.\n  Mr. President, this long overdue legislation marks an important first \nstep toward the resolution of the disputes between the Hopi Tribe, the \nNavajo Nation, and the United States which have been the subject of \nover 35 years of litigation and acrimony. For the first time since this \ndispute began, a mechanism will be provided that permits Navajo \nfamilies to legally remain on homesites within the Hopi partitioned \nlands. It is vitally important that Congress pass this legislation in \norder to settle these long-standing claims against the United States \nand to provide an opportunity for many Navajo families to remain on \ntheir homesites.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this legislation is supported by the Navajo \nNation, the Hopi Tribe, the administration, the State of Arizona, and \nrepresentatives of the Navajo families residing on the Hopi partitioned \nlands. Accordingly, I strongly urge the Senate to pass S. 1973.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11561-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO ARMY COL. BARBARA SCHERB\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, as the 104th Congress draws to a \nclose, I stand to pay tribute to a distinguished Army officer who \nserved as a congressional science fellow on my staff during this \nCongress. Col. Barbara Scherb, U.S. Army, was selected for this highly \ncoveted fellowship as a result of her outstanding training, experience, \nand accomplishments. She is the prototype of what nursing leadership \nshould be. Her impeccable credentials and superb performance earned her \nthe respect and admiration of the Senate staff. She distinguished \nherself rapidly as a professional who possessed an infectious demeanor, \ntremendous integrity, decisive leadership style, political savvy, and \nunending energy. The ultimate Army officer, Colonel Scherb is a \nvisionary thinker who has the innate ability to implement these \nvisions. Colonel Scherb is the consummate professional; nursing never \nhad a better ambassador nor patients a more devoted advocate.\n  Colonel Scherb forged strong alliances and affiliations with a myriad \nof congressional offices, committees, and Federal and civilian agencies \nto present a cohesive approach to legislative proposals. She worked \nclosely with staff members on the Senate Armed Services and Labor and \nHuman Resources Committees and Defense and Labor, Health and Human \nServices and Education Appropriations Subcommittees in support of \nmilitary health issues and national nursing and health care agendas.\n  As a champion of tri-service nursing and military health issues, \nColonel Scherb was instrumental in the clarification of the board \ncertification pay statutes to include certain military nurse \nspecialists; establishment of equitable disbursement of incentive \nspecial pay for nurse anesthetists; authorization to establish a \ngraduate school of nursing at the Uniformed Services University of the \nHealth Sciences [USUHS]; and authorization to establish a tri-service \nnursing research program at USUHS.\n  Her dynamic leadership provided the driving force behind legislation \nthat enabled any qualified officer in the military health system to be \nappointed as Surgeon General, and promoted the development of \nleadership opportunities for nurses and other nonphysicians to include \ncommand and general officer promotion. Colonel Scherb wrote legislative \nlanguage enabling the Services to distribute their field grade end-\nstrength equitably ushering in a new era of equality for military \nmedicine. Colonel Scherb actively pursued codification of Army and Air \nForce chief nurse appointments as general officers. She championed \ntelemedicine initiatives including advanced medical technologies, \ndigitized radiography, computerized patient records, teleconsultation, \nand remote distance learning.\n  As a recognized authority on health care, Colonel Scherb's expertise \nwas in constant demand as a speaker and writer. At significant personal \nsacrifice, she eagerly sought each and every opportunity to advance \nnursing, and the health care goals and vision of America.\n  Colonel Scherb is now attending the Army War College. Based on her \nsplendid performance and exceptional leadership while in my office, I \nam confident that she will excel in this new endeavor.\n  Colonel Scherb is an officer of whom the military and our Nation can \nand should be justifiably proud; a unique combination of talent and \ndevotion to duty. I want to personally and publicly acknowledge my \nsincere appreciation to Colonel Scherb for her dedicated months of \nexemplary service and to bid her a fond aloha and heartfelt \nmahalo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11562-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRATULATING REPUBLIC OF CHINA'S CONGRESSIONAL LIAISON\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, many Senators have come to the \nfloor this week to give tribute to our retiring colleagues as the 104th \nCongress moves toward adjournment. The end of the congressional session \nalso means that many of our friends in the diplomatic community are \nmoving on to other assignments.\n  I rise today to say farewell and to congratulate Dr. Lyushun Shen, \nwho has served as head of the Republic of China's Congressional Liaison \nDivision in Washington for many years. In recognition of his good work \nhere, Dr. Shen has been named Director of North American Affairs in the \nthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs and will return to Taipei at the end of \nthis month. This is an extremely important position because he will be \nresponsible for coordinating Taiwan's policies toward the United \nStates, among other things. I am pleased the United States will have a \ngood friend in that position.\n  My staff and I have had many occasions to work with Lyushun during \nhis tenure in Washington. Whether the issue was one where we disagreed, \nsuch as back in the days of fishing disputes between Taiwan and Alaska, \nor where we agreed, such as allowing a private visit by President Lee \nto his alma mater, Lyushun has served his country with diligence, \nprofessionalism, and a fine sense of humor--an important quality in \nthis town. I also had the chance to observe his fishing skills when he \nattended my wife's charity fishing tournament this past summer, but I \nthink he should stick with diplomacy.\n  I am confident that Lyushun will be as successful in his new role as \nhe has been here. And I know our paths will cross again during my \ntravels to Asia. I am certain that my colleagues join me in wishing \nLyushun and his family all the best in the coming years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11562-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11562-S11564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AD HOC HEARING ON TOBACCO\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on September 11, I cochaired \nwith Senator Kennedy an ad hoc hearing on the problem of teen smoking. \nWe were joined by Senators Harkin, Wellstone, Bingaman, and Simon. \nRegrettably, we were forced to hold an ad-hoc hearing on this pressing \npublic health issue because the Republican leadership refused to hold a \nregular hearing, despite our many pleas.\n  Yesterday I entered into the Record the testimony of the witnesses \nfrom the second panel. Today I am entering the testimony of the \nwitnesses from the third panel which included talk-show host Morton \nDowney, Jr.; his doctor, Dr. Martin Gordon; former Marlboro man, Alan \nLanders; and, former cigarette model Janet Sackman.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the testimony and related materials from \nthe third panel of this ad hoc hearing be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n  Testimony at the Ad-Hoc Tobacco Hearing, U.S. Senate, September 11, \n                                  1996\n\n\n                    statement of morton downey, jr.\n\n       Mr. Chairman, distinguished Senators, Dr. Martin Gordon, \n     Fellow members of the American Lung Association, Ladies and \n     Gentleman, I wish I did not belong on this panel of people \n     who have learned first hand the connection between smoking \n     and cancer. Sadly this former smoking fool heads the list.\n\n[[Page S11563]]\n\n       Like 3,000 kids every day, I began smoking at the age of \n     about 13. My parents had sent me to military school. All my \n     buddies smoked, it was cool. By Christmas vacation I was \n     hooked. Banging down about 20 butts a day. I knew they \n     couldn't hurt me, because the full-page advertising Life \n     magazine and the Policeman's Gazette said, ``More Doctors \n     Smoke Camels Than Any Other Cigarette.'' Think of how hooked \n     I was. It was military boarding school, every time I got \n     caught smoking it was ten demerits, which meant ten hours of \n     marching with a rifle on my shoulder after class and on \n     weekends. In my first year, I marched over 300 hours of \n     punishment for smoking. My dad said that showed how stupid I \n     was to smoke. Billy Waldon, my roommate, said it showed how \n     stupid I was to get caught. I agreed, kept smoking and kept \n     being stupid. Bill Waldon, my ex-roommate, died when he was \n     53. He had given up smoking at 40 and started chewing tobacco \n     so as not to get lung cancer. He died ten years of tongue and \n     throat cancer--some trade off.\n       What kind of trade off are we giving our children, Mr. \n     Chairman? An absolute guarantee that if we do not face our \n     responsibility right now, at least 1,000 of those new daily \n     smokers will die an agonizing death from a smoking-related \n     illness.\n       To those who falsely gnash their teeth over First Amendment \n     rights, what about the Preamble, those first thoughts our \n     forefathers had about the right to Life, Liberty and the \n     Pursuit of Happiness? Cancer will steal their life! Liberty \n     should mean the right to be liberated from our own youthful \n     stupidity.\n       Mr. Chairman, can I find happiness for my child when I know \n     the adults who pretend to care for her, the Tobacco \n     Lobbyists, the Government that is sworn to protect her, \n     abandon their responsibility and bow to the cigarette giants, \n     the Tobacco Terrorists?\n       She needs your courage, your leadership, your ability to \n     stand-up in the face of those who would spend 5 billion a \n     year to send our children to an early but agonizing death--\n     but not spend one red cent toward the breaking of the smoking \n     habit, money to purchase medication for the agonizing pain as \n     death approaches, or dollars to develop a cure for their \n     addicting gift to our children.\n       To think I was a role model for cigarette smoking youth, \n     even signing my name on their cigarettes. To that generation, \n     I beg your forgiveness. May the next generation have kinder \n     and wiser role models such as you Senators and President Bill \n     Clinton who will not bow to the Tobacco Terrorists by \n     weakening the regulations that only serves to deny our youth \n     the opportunity to destroy themselves as many of us already \n     have. I ask you to show the legislative courage to save my \n     little girl. She need not suffer as I have, as my colleagues \n     have. Think of some of my fellow smokers, Sammy Davis, Jr., \n     Edward R. Murrow, Yul Brynner----\n       They smoked and they're dead. Wouldn't it be a better world \n     if they were alive today?\n\n\n                  statement of Martin n. Gordon, m.d.\n\n       Good Morning.\n       My name is Dr. Martin N. Gordon. I am a physician \n     specializing in pulmonary medicine at Cedars Sinai Medical \n     Center and I am Morton Downey, Jr.'s pulmonologist. I am \n     honored and pleased to address this committee and offer my \n     views on tobacco smoke, lung cancer and the FDA regulations.\n       It is generally agreed by those in the scientific and \n     medical communities that most lung cancer is attributable to \n     the inhalation, by a susceptible host, of carcinogenic \n     pollutants. Cigarette and other tobacco smoke are the most \n     important of these pollutants. Members of the committee may \n     be interested to know that the initial suspicion that tobacco \n     might cause cancer was first voiced by the English physician, \n     John Hill, in 1761! This was promptly followed by our Surgeon \n     General's report in 1964.\n       Early in this century, physicians and scientists alike \n     strongly suspected a relationship between smoking and lung \n     cancer. Dr. I. Adler was the first to strongly suggest that \n     lung cancer is related to smoking in a monograph published in \n     1912. A similar conclusion was reached in a 1941 article by \n     Dr. Michael DeBakey, who cited a correlation between the \n     increased sale of tobacco and the increasing prevalence of \n     lung cancer. In addition, early investigators seemed to \n     understand the correlation between the age when one first \n     begins to smoke and lung cancer, finding that smokers with \n     lung cancer began smoking earlier and continued to smoke \n     longer than control groups.\n       Lung cancer is only the tip of the iceberg. Smoking has \n     been causally related to an increased incidence of a number \n     of other malignancies, and is a significant risk factor in \n     the development of coronary artery disease. As Dr. Thomas \n     Petty from Colorado states, ``Today, no reasonable person \n     would deny that smoking is the cause of 90% to 95% of lung \n     cancer.''\n       Lung cancer is the most fatal malignancy of both men and \n     women. In the United States we will probably have close to \n     193,000 reported cases of lung cancer this year, 112,000 in \n     men and 81,000 in women, with a 5 year mortality rate of 85%.\n       Building on Dr. Petty's statement, it would be safe to \n     state that, sadly, 90% of lung cancers are preventable. \n     Logically, preventing people from smoking would be the single \n     most positive step towards reducing the incidence of lung \n     cancer. Furthermore, since it is widely known that starting \n     to smoke at an early age is a particularly strong risk factor \n     in the development of lung cancer and almost 90% of daily \n     smokers begin before the age of 18, it would make sense to \n     focus our effort on preventing children from smoking. This is \n     the goal of the FDA regulations--to protect children from \n     tobacco's addictive properties and its deadly effects. As a \n     physician who has seen the ravages of lung cancer, I fully \n     support the timely enactment of the FDA regulations. I \n     believe they will go a long way towards my seeing fewer \n     patients like Morton Downey, Jr. walk through my door.\n       I urge those on the committee and other members of Congress \n     to support the FDA regulations and oppose any legislative \n     efforts to weaken them. Thank you for the opportunity to \n     address this distinguished body. I would be happy to answer \n     any questions.\n\n\n                       statement of alan landers\n\n       My name is Alan Landers. I live in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, \n     and I am 55 years old. I am a professional actor, model, and \n     acting teacher. My career began with the pilot film ``Aloha \n     from Hawaii''. Over the years I appeared in various \n     television shows and motion pictures, including ``Annie \n     Hall'', ``Stacey'', ``The Tree'', ``The Web'', ``Hurricane,'' \n     ``Ellery Queen'', ``The DuPont Show'', ``Deadly Rivals'', \n     ``Cop and \\1/2\\'', ``South Beach'', ``America's Most \n     Wanted,'' ``Superboy'', ``Model of the Year'', \n     ``Petrocelli'', ``Kate McShane''. I also appeared as a model \n     and actor in numerous advertising campaigns, including: \n     Binaca, United Airlines, Lancer Wine, Brylcreme, M.J.B. \n     Coffee, BelAir Cigarettes (South America), Sony, and Vics 44.\n       I owned the Alan Landers Acting Studio in Hollywood, \n     California. Some of the people who attended the Studio and \n     were coached by me include: JoAnne Woodward, Jerry Hall, Ali \n     McGraw, Joe Penny, George Lazinbee, Sara Purcell, Frankie \n     Crocker, Lynn Moody, Lydia Cornell, Susan Blakely, Merite Van \n     Kamp, Vinviano Vincenzoni, Shel Silverstein, and Joe Lewis. I \n     have appeared in numerous television and motion picture \n     productions, including ``Annie Hall''.\n       During the height of my acting and modeling career I was \n     courted by R.J. Reynolds to appear as the ``Winston Man''. I \n     did the majority of the print ads for the RJ Reynolds tobacco \n     company in the late 1960's and early 1970's.\n       I appeared on billboards and in magazine advertising \n     holding a Winston cigarette urging others, young and old, to \n     smoke. I was expected to portray smoking as stylish, \n     pleasurable, and attractive. I was required to smoke on the \n     set, constant smoking was required to achieve the correct \n     appearance of the cigarette, ash, and butt length. During \n     this time frame I also promoted Tiparillo small cigars. In \n     television advertisements, my character, dressed in a \n     trenchcoat utters the rhetorical line, ``should a gentleman \n     offer a Tiparillo to a lady?''\n       Despite the fact that I worked closely with cigarette \n     company personnel during the shooting, at no time was I ever \n     told that cigarettes could be dangerous to my health. I knew \n     that some people believed them to be unhealthful, but the \n     cigarette manufacturers denied, and still deny to this date, \n     that their product is harmful.\n       Later in this statement I explain what I have learned about \n     the hazards of cigarette smoke, and when the cigarette \n     industry realized these hazards. Looking back on my career I \n     am ashamed that I helped promote such a lethal and addictive \n     product to the children and adults of this country. Had I \n     understood then what I now understand--that cigarettes are an \n     addictive poison that kills almost 50% of their users--I \n     would never have participated in their mass marketing.\n       In 1987 the hazard of cigarettes became tragically apparent \n     as I was diagnosed with lung cancer. Although 95% of lung \n     cancer victims do not survive five years from diagnosis, I \n     was determined to beat the odds. In a painful and dangerous \n     surgical procedure, my doctors removed a large section of \n     lung, hopefully to remove the cancer from my body. After \n     the surgery, I lived from examination to examination, \n     hoping the cancer would not recur. In 1992 I received \n     devastating news. Another cancer had formed, this time in \n     my other lung. The only hope was more surgery, which was \n     accomplished with major complications. A nerve leading to \n     my vocal cords was cut, causing it to be almost impossible \n     to speak normally. This is a crushing blow to an actor. I \n     survived the second surgery and am hoping for the best, \n     although there are no guarantees. I am extremely short \n     winded because sections of both lungs have been removed, \n     and I am told that I have in addition emphysema from \n     cigarette smoking. Scars from the surgery wrap around my \n     back permanently disfiguring me, but I feel lucky to be \n     alive.\n       I have learned a great deal since the surgery for lung \n     cancer, about the true dangers of cigarettes and the deceit \n     of the industry that sold them. I never understood how lethal \n     the product really is. Looking back, I recall smoking on the \n     eve of my second surgery. I am a strong willed person who had \n     broken the addiction several years earlier. The addictive \n     power of nicotine addiction is real and that my frustration \n     of being unable to quit is shared with many, if not most, \n     regular smokers.\n       I have also became aware of the industry's deceitful \n     attitude toward its customers. My attorney, Mr. Norwood S. \n     Wilner of Jacksonville, has filed a case on my behalf seeking \n     compensation from R.J. Reynolds and others. I was delighted \n     to see that Mr. Wilner\n\n[[Page S11564]]\n\n     was successful in August of this year in obtaining a verdict \n     on behalf of one of his other clients against the cigarette \n     industry. The landmark case Carter v. Brown and Williamson \n     Tobacco Comapny, tried in Jacksonville, showed that juries \n     will not forgive the cigarette industry for its carelessness \n     and deception in refusing to warn its customers or to develop \n     safer alternative products.\n       I have donated my time to the fight against tobacco and to \n     protect children from becoming involved in this dangerous \n     drug. Lawton Chiles, Florida's courageous Governor, has asked \n     me to address the Florida Legislature. I have appeared \n     numerous times for the American Cancer Society, the Tobacco \n     Free Coalition, Citizens Against Tobacco, the Duval County \n     Public Schools ZIP program, the Monroe County (Key West) \n     School System, the Cancer Survivors for Life. I have at my \n     expense appeared on national and local television and radio \n     shows.\n       I now understand, and wish to place into the record, some \n     of the shocking facts that the Carter jury saw, which reveal \n     how the industry put profits over people, stonewalled its \n     critics, and concealed scientific evidence from the public \n     and its customers. The attached article entitled ``Mass \n     Destruction: A Medical, Legal, and Ethical Indictment of the \n     Cigarette Industry'' authored by my attorney, Norwood S. \n     Wilner, and my physician, Dr. Allan Feingold of South Miami \n     Hospital, outlines my understanding of these terrible facts.\n       I call upon the lawmakers of this country to protect our \n     children from this dangerous substance. Tobacco products \n     should be regulated as the addictive drugs they are. Tobacco \n     advertising should be eliminated or strictly curtailed. I \n     call upon the tobacco industry to compensate its victims, its \n     former customers, who are suffering and dying from its \n     products. Thank you for permitting me to appear before this \n     committee.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 State of Florida,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                 Tallahassee, FL, August 12, 1996.\n     Mr. Alan Landers,\n     Lauderhill, FL.\n       Dear Alan: On behalf of the citizens of Florida, I wish to \n     thank you. As a former model for cigarette manufacturers, \n     your compelling testimony before the Florida Legislature of \n     cigarettes' insidious poison, and the perverse marketing of \n     this product to our youth is a true ``profile in courage''. \n     Your personal message made the difference in our winning 1996 \n     Legislative battle against Big Tobacco.\n       Your critical help, combined with the American Cancer \n     Society, American Lung Society, and the American heart \n     Association, permitted Floridians to beat back over sixty \n     (60) high paid lobbyists and a million dollar media campaign \n     designed to distort the truth. In biblical parlance, ``we \n     smote them with the jaw bone of an ass.''\n       Alan, thank you again. We will need your help in the \n     future, and I am glad that I can count on you.\n           Warmly yours,\n     Lawton C.

At the request of a tobacco executive, \n     Mrs. Sackman learned to smoke at age 17.

Mr. President, this month marks the 20th \nanniversary of Congress' passage of the National Forest Management Act \nof 1976 [NFMA]. As many of you know, at the beginning of this Congress \nwe embarked upon the first sustained oversight of the implementation of \nthe NFMA, and the related statutes and regulations that govern the \nmanagement of Federal forest lands--both those managed by the U.S. \nForest Service, as well as by the Bureau of Land Management.\n  During the course of last year and this, our subcommittee held 15 \nhearings, receiving testimony from over 200 witnesses concerning the \nstatus of Federal forest management. We then participated in, and \nreviewed the results of, the Seventh American Forest Congress before \nfinalizing our conclusions. These conclusions are summarized in a June \n20, 1996 letter that I sent to Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman. \nSince the transmittal of this letter and its subsequent circulation, we \nhave received a number of letters, calls, and comments from various \nindividuals both inside and outside the federal land management \nestablishment. Generally, they have been: First telling us that we are \naccurate in our diagnosis of the problems associated with federal \nforest management; and second urging us to address some of the problems \nand opportunities described in the June 20 letter.\n  At the conclusion of our oversight hearings earlier this year we \ninvited the administration to provide us with ideas about needed \nchanges, basically making good on the commitment that Secretary \nGlickman made when he was confirmed by the Senate in March 1995. In the \nJune 20 letter, we again offered to entertain the administration's \nproposals. On August 1 we received a response indicating that no \nproposals were ready to tender. We are distributing a copy of the \nletter and the Secretary's response to you.\n  Last week, I met with the Secretary to see whether the administration \nwas close to offering a proposal of any sort. Not surprisingly, they \nare not--nor will they be anytime before a certain date in November \nthat seems to figure heavily in all of their planning.\n  I also asked the Secretary whether he imagined that--if we were to \nintroduce a legislative proposal before that magic date--we might have \na thoughtful and substantive discussion detached from partisan \nwrangling and political recriminations? He thought not. What a \nsurprise, but more the pity.\n  Without being overly critical, I think we have to question both the \nseriousness of the administration's approach to these issues, and the \ndepth of the Secretary's commitment to constructively engage Congress \non Federal forest management. But I want to emphasize that my mind and \nmy door are still open. As we move forward, we would still be happy to \nsee a legislative proposal from the administration to put alongside \nwhat we propose.\n\n\n  we must choose a coherent philosophy under which our Federal forest \n                        lands should be managed\n\n  Today, I want to review the basic approach we took to our oversight \ntask. In evaluating the need for change, we started by evaluating how \nwell our current statutes are working. Then, having established that \nchange is imperative, we stepped back and tried to evaluate the overall \nphilosophy under which we want our Federal lands to be managed.\n  We chose to reaffirm the multiple-use mandate that has guided the \nmanagement of Federal forest lands since the early part of this \ncentury. We have refused to accede to the no-use philosophy that is \ncurrently being popularized by elements of the national environmental \ncommunity and, to some extent, agents of this administration.\n  We have chosen the former over the latter because any sentient being \ncan see the results of the no-use philosophy on the land. Fires are \nburning out of control through forests that are inherently unhealthy \nbecause of stand conditions that have been allowed to deteriorate as a \nconsequence of both simple administrative inaction, and a more basic \nand grievous confusion over the role of man in nature. The bill we will \npropose does not deal with the forest health issue alone. Rather, it \nwill also deal with the health of the Forest Service and the other land \nmanaging agencies. It is our conclusion that the clear results of the \nimplementation of no-use philosophies on the agencies have been as \ndramatic as the results of the application of similar philosophies on \nthe land.\n  Consider this--in over 15 hearings with 200 witnesses--no one \nsupported the status quo. Let me repeat, no one from any walk, \nprofession, interest group, or point of view provided any testimony \nthat suggested Congress need not act to fix the current situation. In \nsum, the health of the Forest Service--or, more broadly, our Federal \nGovernment--as an enlightened advocate of professional resource \nmanagement has reached a critical point. In an era of tightening \nGovernment budgets this might be the case even if this administration \nwas not subjecting the agencies to unprecedented political \ninterference. But, in fact, the amount of political interference that \nthe Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management are facing is \nextraordinary.\n  Thus, as we summarize our general philosophy, we flatly reject the \npreservationist philosophy that the best\n\n[[Page S11565]]\n\nthing we can do for our Federal forests is to walk away and leave them \nalone. Rather, we choose to: First, reaffirm and reinvigorate multiple-\nuse management; second, restore the health of our forests and the \nmorale of our professional forest managers; third, fashion forest \npolicy on hope instead of fear; fourth, develop solutions instead of \nconflict; fifth, encourage education instead of litigation; sixth, rely \nupon science instead of stoking emotions; and seventh, employ human \nresources in environmental stewardship, instead of destroying them in \nthe interest of environmental purism.\n\n\n    our approach to this process has necessarily been time consuming\n\n  When we initiated this oversight process two Marches ago, I remarked \nupon the novelty of Congress wading into an area where it has been \nabsent from the field for so many years. I also noted that, if our \noversight uncovered the need for significant changes, these changes \nwould take time. Indeed, legislative changes of this nature always take \nmore than one Congress to achieve. When you write the environmental \nhistory of this Congress I hope you will remember that we expected it \nto take awhile, but we will get the job done.\n  I relish the opportunity to quote Senator Hubert Humphrey's remarks \n20 years ago this week as he brought the conference report accompanying \nthe 1976 National Forest Management Act to the Senate floor. He stated \nthat:\n\n       It is with a tremendous amount of pride and satisfaction \n     that I offer this measure for the consideration of the \n     Senate. It is a product of 3 years of work by four committees \n     of this Congress, as well as more than a dozen public \n     interest groups and business interests.\n\n  These issues could not be viewed as the work of a single Congress or \nthe result of an individual election, even then. They certainly cannot \nnow. For those critical of Congress' efficiency, it is worth noting \nthat the number of congressional committees has decreased, even as the \npanoply of interest groups has expanded exponentially.\n  Generally speaking, significant change comes only through crisis or \nconsensus. I would submit that, today, we have a consensus that the \nstatus quo is unacceptable. But there is not yet a shared sense of \ncrisis, nor any specific agreement on an appropriate solution. \nTherefore, our proposal will represent a starting point to see if we \ncan: First, build upon the only established consensus--that is, the \nstatus quo is unacceptable; and second, move toward some agreement on \nwhat kinds of appropriate solutions should be provided.\n  By necessity, many parties will be involved in the deliberations that \nwe will begin in a few weeks, and carry forward through the next \nCongress and perhaps beyond. But at the same time, many parties have \nalready been involved in providing us useful insights that are \nreflected in the proposal we will circulate in the near future. Let me \nmention a few groups that have been involved and deserve recognition \nfor the contributions made to date.\n  First, I want to recognize the thousands of people involved in the \nSeventh American Forest Congress. Their coming together was a truly \nunique experience. I directed my staff to attend, and they benefitted \ngreatly from the insights provided. We delayed introduction of this \nmeasure to benefit from their deliberations. I hope to continue this \nextraordinary dialog with this other Congress.\n  Representatives of the environmental community have also been \ninstrumental in providing both the backdrop for the discussions that \nhave occurred in this Congress, as well as a number of specific \nsuggestions for changes. While we do not agree with all they advocate, \nthey nevertheless deserve the credit for elevating the public's \ninterest in the state of our Federal forests.\n\n  Third, I want to recognize the forest scientists that have begun to \nlook at land management and ecosystem analysis at broader geographic \nscales. Many of the initiatives that have been pioneered by this group \nof devoted Forest Service and other Federal agency scientists over the \nlast 4 years are going to be recognized and provided with a statutory \nbasis.\n  Fourth, I want to thank State and local officials who have provided \nconsiderable testimony about the current state of federalism, insofar \nas Federal resource management is concerned. They have suggested a \nnumber of improvements based upon their increasingly impressive \ncapabilities to perform a number of the management functions that are \ncurrently entrusted solely to the diminishing number of Federal agency \nemployees spread across the country.\n  Fifth, I want to thank representatives of local, dependent \ncommunities and industries. I want to commend their patience in seeing \nus through these deliberations, while in many cases--and for \njustifiable reasons--they felt their concerns are of a more immediate \nnature.\n  Finally and most importantly, I want to thank the Forest Service and \nother Federal agency employees who contributed so much to our oversight \nprocess both formally and informally. By elevating environmental \nconsiderations within the agency, Forest Service employees have made \nmany of the changes that we will propose both reasonable and possible. \nThere is less need now to use other Federal employees to police the \nwork and commitment of Forest Service scientists, biologists, and land \nmanagement professionals than there may once have been. For this, and \nfor other efficiencies in better land stewardship that we will propose, \nForest Service employees deserve considerable credit. I am also \nappreciative of the amount of time and effort that went into the \ndevelopment of agency testimony and support materials that provided the \ninformation necessary for our oversight and ongoing drafting processes. \nI deeply appreciate, the professionalism and commitment of these \nemployees.\n  I do not expect any of the above mentioned groups to be wholly or \nvery satisfied--or, in a few cases, even remotely satisfied--with the \nproposal that we will unveil shortly. Nevertheless, all of their views \nwere heard and in many ways reflected, even if not exactly the way they \nthought they would be.\n  Now having reviewed the process that we used to develop the \nlegislation, let me explain how we will proceed. Prior to meeting with \nthe Secretary last week, I was prepared to introduce this measure \nimmediately and start the process of discussing these ideas. The \nSecretary's responses to my questions have convinced me that this would \nresult in little more than the most cynical exercise in political \nposturing at the present time.\n  Therefore, I plan to wait and circulate this proposal immediately \nafter the election. If the current administration returns, the \ninvitation to come forward with their own proposal still stands. If \nnot, I expect that their successors may well be more aggressive and \ncommunicative in their desire to proceed and address these issues. \nAfter I finish a little work I have back in Idaho, I will sponsor a \nseries of workshops and/or hearings during the recess to secure \nspecific comments and suggestions for change. I will also direct our \nstaff to meet with interested groups to secure additional comments. I \nhope that we will then have an improved bill to introduce at the \nbeginning of the next Congress in order to begin a more focused \ndialogue on legislation that I will strive to advance in a bi-partisan \nfashion.\n  To this end, I look at the forthcoming proposal as a working draft--\neven though I have been at it for 2 years. I urge people to review it \ncarefully. I hope that, with a minimum amount of rhetorical overkill, \nthey will tell us what they think the good parts and the bad parts are. \nI will not be seeking immediate support, and I will try to avoid \nimmediate condemnation. This proposal is going to change--perhaps \ndramatically--as we listen and rework it to reintroduce in the next \nCongress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11564-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11565-S11566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DR. JOE CARROLL CHAMBERS\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to recognize today a \nman who has given selflessly to his community and profession, Dr. Joe \nCarroll Chambers. He will be retiring on October 11, 1996 and we are \nvery sad to see him go. Dr. Chambers is a graduate of the University of \nTennessee College of Medicine, interned at the Baptist Hospital in \nNashville, and completed a masters in public health at the University \nof North Carolina. He is the recipient of many awards, including the \nJames Hayne Award by the SC Public Health Association for meritorious\n\n[[Page S11566]]\n\nachievements in public health over an extended period time and the \nAmerican Lung Association's John Martin Medal for significant \ncontributions. I wish him and his wife, Bettye Ann, the best as they \ntake on the slower pleasures and pace of retirement. I ask to have \nprinted in the Record a synopsis of Dr. Chambers' accomplishments as \ndirector of the Charleston County Health Department.\n  The synopsis follows:\n\n                     Joe Carroll Chambers, MD, MPH\n\n       Dr. Joe Chambers was named Health Director of the \n     Charleston County Health Department in 1977 after having \n     served in the same capacity for Aiken County. Since that \n     time, Charleston has seen improved public health, grown in \n     services, increased activity in preventing potential \n     environmental hazards and, in general, an increased awareness \n     of the need for preventative health measures.\n       The CCHD Public Health Nursing Division is accredited by \n     the National League for Nursing as is the Home Health \n     Services Program. Home Health visits have continued to grow \n     for the past several years as the public has become \n     increasingly aware of this service for those in need.\n       The Women, Infants and Children Food Program serves \n     pregnant, breast feeding, postpartum women, infants and \n     children under five. The Charleston program serves the \n     largest number of patients, who are at nutritional or medical \n     risk, in the state.\n       One of the County Health Clinics recently received the \n     Distinguished Volunteer Award from the Charleston County \n     School District.\n       Environmental Health programs have prevented the spread of \n     communicable disease through control of the environment. \n     Annually, the food protection program inspects over 1,700 \n     food service establishments.\n       Think about this health department that sponsors rabies \n     clinic throughout the county vaccinating 10,000 animals \n     annually, handling more than 4,000 relative activities \n     through its Solid Waste/Litter Control Program and being \n     nationally recognized for its Lead Poisoning Prevention \n     Program. All these have had skillful leadership of fine \n     teams, headed by Dr. Chambers.\n       Certain health conditions serve as a barometer of the \n     health status of the community. In Charleston, as the \n     immunization of children under two continues to improve, the \n     infant mortality rate improves. Because early and continuous \n     prenatal care services have been promoted by Dr. Chambers, \n     results are positive. Dr. Chambers is recognized as an \n     advocate for prevention initiatives that protect and improve \n     the health of our community.\n       The Charleston County Board of Health recognizes and \n     congratulates Dr. Joe Carroll Chambers for his vision, \n     knowledge and leadership as Director of the Charleston County \n     Health Department. Through his tenure, we have witnessed a \n     safer Charleston, a growth in needed health services and an \n     increased awareness of environmental risks. This Tri-County \n     area, Charleston, Berkeley and Dorchester Counties, has been \n     fortunate to have enjoyed better community health due to Dr. \n     Chambers' diligence, dedication and foresight. He has given \n     attention to every facet of this area's well being that \n     touches on good health and disease prevention. All of this he \n     has done with skill, grace, kindness and \n     understanding.\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, everyone should have one--a Poot, \nthat is. And maybe everyone does have one. The important thing is I do.\n  We all have our causes. It's just that some of us are more assertive \nthan others. In my business we're all assertive. So I engage in combat \nevery day with my adversaries who, although I love each and every one \nof the misguided souls, would sell our country and everything we hold \ndear for one more social program.\n  Mr. President, they look the other way as we strip our Nation of its \nvital defenses, leaving us vulnerable to both conventional and missile \nattacks--and hope desperately the people don't find out the truth. They \nload up our system with unbearable burdens of overregulation and wonder \nwhy we are not globally competitive. They bleed the very lifeblood from \nour veins in the form of taxes until we are too weak and disheartened \nto produce--and then come after that last drop--all to support their \ninsatiable appetite to render their control of our lives absolute. They \ngive dancing lessons to hardened criminals--punishment, heaven forbid--\nand then turn them lose to plunder again.\n  And so I do combat every day with every fiber of my being, leaving no \ndoubt in my mind that the fate and the very essence of Western \ncivilization is absolute in its dependence upon my actions, wisdom and \nperformance.\n  That is, until--until I see Poot. And I realize that while she is \ntolerant of my priorities, hers are not the same. Not even close. She \nwants the same thing I want but she doesn't worry about it because she \nassumes I'll do it. And that lets her keep close to the ones she loves, \nwhich is everybody, and stay in touch with them to the extent that she \nknows every birthday, wedding date, draft status and social security \nnumber. She, along with her diary, is a data bank with the chip \ncapacity of the Congressional Record--that's her priority.\n  And in addition she is the control center for compassion. For her \nfamily, yes, but also anyone else who stumbles along. No matter who is \nin trouble or in need, she is their counselor and companion--that's her \npriority.\n  But all the while her capacity for enjoyment will never be \nchallenged. There's not a Broadway show she hasn't both seen and \nmemorized--that's her priority.\n  So, Mr. President, you should be so lucky to have a Poot like I do. \nJust when you begin to believe that you are so important, you have no \none to put you back in perspective. I do. And when you forget the \nstreet address where you lived when you were 6 years old, you don't \nhave anyone to call. I do. And when you cast a vote that makes everyone \nhate you, you don't have anyone who understands. I do--in fact she even \nagrees with me.\n  So Mr. President, I've got the No. 1 70-year-old Poot in the Nation, \na beautiful and compassionate consolidation of the pioneer woman, \nmother Teresa, and hello Dolly.

Mr. President, I was sorry to read the story in \nthe New York Times by Steve LeVine under the title ``Armed Troops in \nArmenia Arrest Dozens of protesters.''\n  Armenia is generally moving in the right direction.\n  While there may have been abuses in the election, the fact that the \nelection results showed the incumbent president getting 51 percent and \nhis major rival 42 percent suggests to me that it was basically a free \nelection.\n  I have come to have great respect for President Ter-Petrossian who \napparently has been reelected.\n  I believe that restraint is essential for freedom to survive in \nArmenia.\n  We do not want Armenia to go in the direction of chaos.\n  An overreaction to protests does not help the future and the \nstability of Armenia.\n  I was particularly concerned about the suggestions in the story that \nopposition leaders have been jailed or chased underground and that \ngovernment troops went into an opposition party office and arrested \neight people.\n  I will continue to do what I can for Armenia in or out of the United \nStates Senate, but I hope self-restraint is used by the government. \nSelf-restraint is essential for stability and for freedom.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the New York Times story be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 27, 1996]\n\n          Armed Troops In Armenia Arrest Dozens of Protesters\n\n                           (By Steve LeVine)\n\n       YEREVAN, Armenia, Sept. 26--Government troops arrested and \n     beat dozens of demonstrators and bystanders today in an \n     effort to end three days of protests against Armenia's \n     presidential election, which was tainted by charges of fraud.\n       Armored vehicles blocked the streets, parks and squares \n     where tens of thousands of opposition supporters had \n     protested the announced victory by President Levon Ter-\n     Petrossian in the election on Sunday.\n       Bands of soldiers in full combat gear patrolled the \n     streets, breaking up gatherings of civilians as the \n     Government imposed what in effect was a state of emergency in \n     parts of the capital.\n       The main opposition leader, Vazgen Manukian, a former Prime \n     Minister who trailed in the vote to Mr. Ter-Petrossian \n     according to official results, disappeared from public view \n     and his whereabouts were unknown. An Interior Ministry \n     spokesman said Mr. Manukian, 50, was ``being pursued.''\n       Some tension remained this evening, but the Government \n     moves seemed to bring at least a pause the three days of \n     protests outside Parliament in which crowds of opposition \n     supporters called for Mr. Ter-Petrossian to resign.\n       With the crackdown, Mr. Ter-Petrossian has now jailed, \n     chased underground or forced into exile most of his key \n     political opponents.\n       The Government action came a day after demonstrators tore \n     down a gate and part of a fence surrounding Parliament, \n     charged onto the grounds and beat up the Speaker.\n\n[[Page S11567]]\n\n       The protesters asserted that fraud nudged Mr. Ter-\n     Petrossian over the 50 percent mark in the election, allowing \n     him to avoid a runoff in Armenia's first presidential \n     election since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n       Government troops dispersed the crowd by firing in the air \n     and beating protesters on Wednesday, and a state newspaper \n     reported today that a policeman and a civilian were killed.\n       In a television address this morning that opened with \n     pictures of the protest, Mr. Ter-Petrossian condemned his \n     rivals and banned unauthorized public gatherings. Citing the \n     strife in neighboring Georgia and Azerbaijan since the Soviet \n     collapse, Mr. Ter-Petrossian suggested that he was the only \n     barrier between calm and chaos in Armenia.\n       ``Can it possibly be that the mistakes of our immediate \n     neighbors have taught us nothing, or did we have to feel this \n     on our own skin''? Mr. Ter-Petroassian asked. ``I warned you \n     about this danger, the danger of fascism from one group of \n     mentally ill people who wanted to rule over you.''\n       Within an hour, troops stormed into an opposition party \n     office, beat up and arrested eight people, according to a \n     Reuters reporter who witnessed the incident.\n       At the same time, soldiers fired live ammunition into the \n     air near the Opera House, an opposition gathering place. Men \n     booed and women screamed as soldiers and armed men in \n     plainclothes pursued, beat and arrested several bystanders.\n       Pro-Government Members of Parliament beat up six opposition \n     members when they entered a morning emergency session. The \n     opposition politicians were then arrested by Interior \n     Ministry troops.\n       Government officials said the deputies and some other \n     opposition figures would be tried in what they are calling an \n     attempted coup.\n       Near the concentrations of Government troops, residents \n     were openly bitter, angry and frightened. Uniformed soldiers \n     and men in black leather or denim jackets roamed these areas, \n     slapping, kicking or beating seemingly any Armenian who \n     inquired in less than polite tones about the action.\n       ``This is a nightmare,'' said Vartan Petrossian, a musician \n     who was strolling with his wife to buy some fish. ``This has \n     happened to our neighbors, but how can this happen in \n     Armenia''? I don't want a government that splits in my \n     face.''\n       Another man, who did not want to give his name, asserted: \n     ``They are worse than the Communists. What kind of government \n     do we have that keeps power this way?''\n       In the sprawling flea market near the Razdan Soccer \n     Stadium, a dozen merchants expressed sympathy with the \n     opposition. But they voiced dismay that the opposition would \n     risk disorder in a republic that until now has been spared \n     it.\n       The ferocity of the crackdown has perplexed diplomats who \n     generally admire Mr. Ter-Petrossian, who rose to power in a \n     wave of nationalism that began here in 1988 and once had been \n     jailed with Mr. Manukian, then a close ally.\n       It has been hard for some diplomats to reconcile the harsh \n     local ruler with a President who is moderate on other matters \n     like seeking better relations with Turkey.\n       ``What has surprised me is that the Government is doing \n     nothing to sound conciliatory,'' a Western diplomat said \n     today of the crackdown. ``They just sent out the attack \n     dogs.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11566-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BILL MONROE\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to salute a legend in \nBluegrass music. Bill Monroe, the father of Bluegrass music and a \nmember of Nashville Tennessee's Grand Ole Opry, passed away this month. \nHe was a national treasure whose talents spanned several generations \nand influenced many musical talents.\n  Bill Monroe had a simple upbringing. While his formal education ended \nwith the third or fourth grade, he had of such great musical talent \nthat he was credited with founding an American music form. Bluegrass \nmusic was born when Bill Monroe took the ingredients of what had come \nbefore him and mixed them with his emotions, acoustic talent, and \nmandolin playing skills.\n  Monroe and his brothers, Charlie and Birch Monroe, performed together \nfor several years and made their radio debut in 1927. Later, Bill \nstruck out on his own, forming his own Bluegrass band and joining the \nGrand Ole Opry in 1939. Monroe's success with the mandolin in Bluegrass \nmusic influenced other musicians to include that instrument. In time it \nbecame an essential instrument to Bluegrass music.\n  Mr. President, over the years Monroe's band went through many \nchanges. Band members moved on and new talents were brought in. At its \npeak in the 1940's, Monroe's band remained a stronghold in the music \nindustry. Though rock 'n' roll quickly took center stage and pushed \naside the sound of Bluegrass, Monroe's genius left its mark on the \nmusic industry.\n  The influence of Bill Monroe and his mandolin tunes can be seen in \nrock 'n' roll, as well as country music. The ``King of Rock 'N' Roll,'' \nElvis Presley, was heavily influenced by the music of Bill Monroe, and \neven recorded Monroe's ``Blue Moon of Kentucky'' on his first album. \nBuddy Holly was one of Bill Monroe's greatest fans and Bluegrass \ncontributed to many of his songs. Country music has also been \ninfluenced by Bill Monroe. Ricky Skaggs grew up listening to Bluegrass \nmusic and was a young fan of Monroe. The music of Hank Williams is also \ninfluenced by the Bluegrass great. Bill Monroe's music and spirit has \nbecome a part of our culture.\n  Mr. President, it is important that we remember Bill Monroe as an \nartist and a contributor to our Nation's culture. He influenced the \nlives of so many young artists and his music and talent live on today. \nHe will be missed, but never forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11567-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      A TRIBUTE TO GAIL WALKER, RN\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an \noutstanding American health care hero. Ms. Gail Walker is a registered \nnurse and the executive director of the Hamakua Health Center in \nHonokaa, HI. She was recently honored by the Robert Wood Johnson \nCommunity Health Leadership Program for her outstanding commitment to \nproviding residents of the Hamakua area with continuing access to \nhealth care. She was 1 of 10 health care heroes selected from a \nnational pool of 720 candidates and the recipient of a $100,000 award \nfor her community cause. This is truly an outstanding life-time \nachievement.\n  Ms. Walker was born in Honokaa, HI and raised on a cattle ranch in \nKukaiau, a community just east of Honokaa, where her father worked as a \ncowboy and mechanic. Her mother is a retired nurse. Leaving her native \nhome for a formal nursing education and several years of work \nexperience, she returned to excel in the health care industry on Oahu. \nIn 1989 she returned to her home to take the position of director of \nnursing at the Hamakua Medical Center. In 1991, she became the \nexecutive director of that health center, the only medical clinic in \nthe district.\n  Ms. Walker quickly reorganized this clinic, instituting an \nappointment process, thus expediting medical care to the beneficiaries. \nIn 1992, disaster struck the area when the Hamakua Sugar Co. filed for \nbankruptcy. Her friends and neighbors were without jobs and their \nfamilies without support. Without the innovation, dedication, energy, \nand personal sacrifice of Ms. Walker these people would have lost not \nonly their security, but their health care as well.\n  Ms. Walker organized a task force of local residents, politicians, \nand department of health representatives. Financing the clinic's \noperation through her own funds, she had to manage the health care of a \ncommunity with one tenth of her normal budget. Over the next 2 years, \nMs. Walker engineered support initiatives with the insurance companies, \nlocal banks, local private donors, and the State Legislature. This \nresulted in the restoration of the health care system, a life line for \nthe 7,500 residents of this 900-square-mile poverty-stricken area.\n  In 1995 the State of Hawaii built a 7,000-square foot rural health \nclinic with a staff of 32 dedicated physicians, nurses, and support \npersonnel in Honokaa. This new facility provides an expanded array of \nmedical and social services never seen before in this rural, plantation \ncommunity. These services include primary care, mental health, disease \nprevention, an indigent medication program, a nurse certification \ntraining program, and a School-to-Work Nurse's Aide Training Program \nfor high school juniors. Ms. Walker will use funds from this award to \nestablish a new urgent care program thus expanding the health care \nservices in the community even further.\n  It is hard to overstate the benefits these services provide the \ncommunity of Honokaa, HI. Ms. Walker's ability to overcome enormous \nobstacles to provide modern health care in her native community attests \nto her strength of character, her compassion, and vision. I want to \npersonally and publicly acknowledge my sincere appreciation to Ms. \nWalker for her dedicated years of exemplary leadership and service to \nher community and to bid her a heartfelt mahalo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11567-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S11568]]\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO BRIAN THOMPSON, BOB GAGNON, ``CHIPPER'' ROWE, SANDY \nROBINSON, MURRAY SMITH, AND ALBERT DAUPHINAIS, SIX NEW HAMPSHIRE HEROES\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to six \nheroic residents of North Sutton, NH, who saved the life of my good \nfriend and neighbor, Rosa Weinstein. Brian Thompson, Bob Gagnon, \n``Chipper'' Rowe, Sandy Robinson, Murray Smith and Albert Dauphinais \nall acted without hesitation to rescue Rosa from her burning car in \norder to get her to the hospital. I am very proud of these six \nindividuals from North Sutton who did not waste 1 second in coming to \nRosa's rescue. I would like to extend a personal word of thanks to each \none of them for saving my friend's life.\n  On September 1, Rosa Weinstein was driving through North Sutton, NH, \nwhen her car went out of control, flipped over on its side and caught \non fire. By what many have described as a miracle, the accident \noccurred within a few yards of the North Sutton Volunteer Fire Station \nand in front of the home of Brian Thompson. Immediately after Brian saw \nthe car from his kitchen window, he used a fire extinguisher to contain \nthe flames coming from the car. As Brian was doing this, two firemen, \nBob Gagnon and ``Chipper'' Rowe, ran to the nearby firehouse for the \nequipment to put out the flames. Three additional heroes, Murray Smith, \nAlbert Dauphinais, and Sandy Robinson, a emergency management \ntechnician, helped put out the flames, rescued Rosa from inside the car \nand kept her alive long enough to be taken to the hospital.\n  Rosa suffered considerably from the accident, but she is very \ngrateful for the actions of the North Sutton residents who so quickly \ncame to her aid. There is no doubt whatsoever in anyone's mind that \nRosa owes her life to these six heroes.\n  It is my hope that Rosa will regain her strength soon and will make a \nspeedy recovery over the next few weeks. Both Rosa and her husband, \nHarris, are wonderful, thoughtful friends. Indeed, I was very sad to \nhear about the accident, but am also very proud of the way the six \nNorth Sutton residents reacted.\n  Harris expressed the deep gratitude of Rosa's family by saying, ``The \nuncommon heroism demonstrated by Brian Thompson, Bob Gagnon, \n``Chipper'' Rowe, Sandy Robinson, Murray Smith, and Albert Dauphinais \nis an extraordinary example of America at its best. We will forever be \nthankful for their selfless, quick-thinking action.''\n  Mr. President, the actions of these six individuals on that day in \nearly September are truly remarkable. Their efforts are appreciated not \nonly by Rosa's family but by myself and many other New Hampshire \nresidents. And, for Rosa, I wish the very best for her as she recovers \nfrom her injuries. Our thoughts and prayers are with her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11568-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO DANA PODELL OF COLORADO, GIRL SCOUT GOLD AWARD WINNER\n\n Mr. BROWN.

The \nMountain Prairie Girl Scout Council honored Molly with the Girl Scout \nGold Award on May 4, 1996.

Mr. President, yesterday, the ``Mental Health \nParity Act of l996'' was signed into law by President Clinton. Mr. \nPresident, the act provides parity of coverage for treatment of mental \nillness. The debate over the bill was both stimulating and educational, \nin that it encouraged many of us to learn more about issues affecting \nthe management of mental health disorders. I believe that, as a group, \nwe now have a greater awareness and sensitivity to this area. I would \nlike to take this opportunity to present some of the issues which I \nfeel must be addressed.\n  Mental health may be affected by numerous factors ranging from \noutside stressors, presenting in ways that may be difficult to manage, \nto physical disease or genetic defects that impair brain function. The \nerosion of our traditional social support systems, including \nfragmentation of extended and nuclear family structures, have \ncontributed to the morbidity of mental disorders. Increased complexity \nand stress in society are also responsible for the higher incidence of \nsymptoms.\n  Consequently, alcohol, drug abuse, and mental health disorders affect \n18-30 percent of adults annually. Suicide claims 30,000 lives each \nyear. We are also faced with skyrocketing costs and utilization of \nmental health and substance abuse services which now represent 4 \npercent of the GDP. However, these costs represent only one-fourth of \nthe total price. Employees with behavioral health problems experience \nhigher accident rates, use more health benefits, and have lower overall \nwork performance ratings than other workers. The costs of crimes which \nare committed as a result of behavioral disorders must also be \nincluded.\n  As a physician and surgeon, I understand the impact of mental illness \non the lives of my patients and their families. I also understand the \nimportance of good psychiatric care. Advances in medication and \npsychological therapeutic techniques have improved our ability to treat \nthese disorders effectively. In addition, the destigmatization of \nmental illness and chemical dependency have led to a greater \nwillingness on the part of the general public to seek help for these \nproblems.\n  However, traditional techniques have not been effective in \ncontrolling either the costs or quality of care provided in this arena. \nReorganization of public sector, local authority, and managed care \ncontracting has begun and a niche industry of specialized managed \nmental health/substance abuse organizations or carve-outs has \ndeveloped.\n  Unfortunately, we cannot necessarily rely on competition and the \nmarket to solve these problems. These forces may fail because of \nexternalities and information problems. Even our health care providers \nhave not always received the education about mental illness necessary \nto perform their tasks. At this point, no one is sure that the new \nprograms are any more effective than the old ones.\n  As a transplant surgeon, I understand the value of teamwork. I \nbelieve that we must use that approach if we are to solve these \nproblems. Government, payers, providers, and consumers must each \ncontribute solutions. Together, we can accomplish the following \nobjectives:\n  First, parity of coverage between mental and physical disorders must \nbe encouraged.\n  Second, payers must develop incentives for providers to provide \nappropriate care as well as information for patients.\n  Third, we must educate providers about the most cost-effective ways \nto deliver high quality care. Medical school curricula should be \nrevised to provide more in-depth training on mental health and \nsubstance abuse disorders. Reimbursement mechanisms for graduate \nmedical education must be changed so that residents are less tied to \nacute-in-patient facilities. When they are placed in facilities across \nthe continuum of care they will receive more exposure to issues of \nchronic behavioral disease management.\n  Fourth, we must learn how to measure the real value of care we \nprovide in\n\n[[Page S11569]]\n\nterms of health improvements per dollar spent on care. We must also \nconsider the social consequences of that care.\n  Fifth, we must learn how to better estimate the effects of cost \ncontainment measures on treatment cost effectiveness.\n  Sixth, we must encourage the development of consistent standards for \nuse of evidence in policy debates.\n  Mr. President, this Congress has worked in a bipartisan fashion to \naddress mental health parity. As policy makers, we can continue to \naddress the needs of the mental health community by working with \neducators, health plans, employers, and researchers to encourage them \nto meet these other important objectives. I believe our health care \nsystem can meet these goals. However, it requires cooperation from the \nentire health care community. I urge my colleagues in the U.S. Senate \nto consider the issues of mental health in this broader context; as \nwell as, to continue to educate ourselves on the mental health issues \nthat impact our health system and society as a whole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11568-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MENTAL HEALTH PARITY\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Yesterday, President Clinton signed the VA/HUD \nappropriation bill and the Mental Health Parity amendment which was \nincluded in the appropriated bill into law. For all of us who worked so \nhard to achieve passage of the parity amendment, the enactment of the \nprovision represented more than the insurance policy changes that the \nprovision will actually require. Passage of the legislation is a symbol \nof fairness, progress and hope for millions of Americans and their \nfamilies who, for far too long, have been victims of discrimination--\nfamilies who for far too long have been thrust into bankruptcy, or \ndenied access to cost-effective treatments because their illness was a \nmental illness and not a physical illness like cancer or heart disease. \nMental illness has, in one way or another, touched the lives of many of \nus who work here on Capitol Hill and I am pleased that the 104th \nCongress was able to take this first and very necessary step toward \nparity.\n  I want to take this opportunity to say that while the passage of this \namendment was a historic step forward for people with mental illnesses, \nthe amendment was a fist step and a first step only. It does not \nrequire parity for copayments or deductibles or inpatient days or \noutpatient visit limits. It also does not include substance abuse \nservices. My State of Minnesota has passed legislation which goes much \nfurther than what we were able to accomplish in this Congress. \nMinnesota requires that health plans provide full parity coverage for \nmental health and substance abuse services. The cost impact of this \nlegislation in Minnesota has been minimal according to a recent study \nbased on preliminary data.\n  Without full parity coverage for mental health and substance abuse, \nhealth plans will continue to discriminate against individuals and \nfamilies in need of services. The responsibility for and cost of care \nwill continue to be shifted from the private to the public sector. For \nchildren and adolescents, the burden and cost of care will continue to \nbe shifted to the child welfare, education, and juvenile justice \nsystems. These overburdened systems are often not able to provide \nneeded services, and many are forced to go without treatment. This will \ncontinue to be the case.\n  I have seen first hand in my State at facilities like Hazelden and \nothers, the benefits that drug and alcohol treatment can bring to the \nlives of millions of Americans. Alcohol and other drug addictions \neffect 10% of American adults and 3 percent of our youth. Untreated \naddition last year alone cost this Nation nearly $167 billion. \nUltimately we all bear the cost of delays or gaps in mental health and \nsubstance abuse services. Sadly, that fact has not been changed by the \npassage of Senator Domenici's and my amendment.\n  We have much more work to do and I look forward to consideration of \nlegislation which would provide full parity coverage for mental health \nand substance abuse services. I am grateful for the advocacy, hard \nwork, and compassion of the mental health and substance abuse \ncommunity. Without them, we could not have achieved such success this \nyear. This victory was made possible because families and friends of \npeople struggling with mental illnesses were willing to speak out in \npublic. This issue has a human face now and that made it possible to \nwin votes and enact legislation.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with Senators Domenici, Kennedy \nand Conrad to expand coverage for mental health and substance abuse \nservices and I also want to take this moment to thank Senators Simpson \nand Kassebaum who will not be here next year but were critical in \nenabling us to take the first critical step toward parity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11569-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JEREMY MARKS-PELTZ\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, every day Americans are exposed to \nmuch of what is wrong with America and not enough about what is good \nand right across our Nation and in our communities.\n  It is in that light that I rise today to speak about a young man in \nFlorida whose compassion and humanity should serve as a reminder to all \nof us that there is much about America that is good and right--12 year \nold Jeremy Marks-Peltz of Kendall, FL.\n  Last year Jeremy was on a boat tour in south Florida and saw the \nunfortunate plight of homeless people living in cardboard boxes. He \ndecided he wanted to help them, and began organizing a food, clothes \nand furniture drive for some of south Florida's homeless charities.\n  Jeremy went to Bloomingdale's in Miami seeking assistance for his \ncharity drive; they decided to help. Bloomingdale's recently wrote me \nabout Jeremy's efforts and why they got involved.\n\n       We receive hundreds of requests from charities for \n     donations through letters, but this was the first time I was \n     face to face with a twelve year old boy wanting to help the \n     needy. It was touching and in a society that some times only \n     remembers the needy during the holidays, it was refreshing.\n\n  With Bloomingdale's assistance. Jeremy's desire to make a difference \nin his community has resulted in a full-scale campaign called, Making a \nWorld of Difference, which will run through the year. The campaign, \nwhich began in February, consists of an appeal to all of Bloomingdale's \ncustomers for donations for the needy, including food, clothing and \nfurniture.\n  Over the years I have said many times that individuals must play a \ngreater role in the fight to make our communities safer, more \nprosperous, and simply better places for all of us to live. Jeremy's \nwork to make south Florida a better place for all its residents to live \nexemplifies that ideal.\n  John Randolph once wrote, ``Life is not so important as the duties of \nlife.'' Only 12 years old, Jeremy Marks-Peltz has already learned this \nlesson well. His compassion, commitment, and understanding of what is \ngenuinely important in this world are truly shining examples for all of \nus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11569-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11569-S11570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO FIRST TENNESSEE BANK\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to salute First \nTennessee National Corporation, an innovative company that maintains \ncompany success by focusing on a family-friendly environment. First \nTennessee Bank's success can be attributed in part to the amount of \ntime and effort they put into maintaining a positive employee-company \nrelationship.\n  Three years ago, First Tennessee developed its Family Matters program \nto address concerns that involved the work-family relationship. They \nrealized early on that employee job performance did not rely solely on \nthe working conditions at the office. Personal time influenced \nemployees' overall attitude, and in turn, their attitude toward work. \nFirst Tennessee adopted a non-traditional work schedule that gives \nemployees more freedom to adjust their schedules around personal needs \nor family obligations. Family Matters trained managers and supervisors \nto work with employees who wanted flexible work hours to give them the \ntime they needed without sacrificing job productivity. Variations of \nthe flexible hours differ, but one good example can be seen at First \nTennessee's downtown Chattanooga branch office. Richard Grant, Vice \nPresident of\n\n[[Page S11570]]\n\nBusiness Development and Manager of the word processing center, was \napproached by two of his employees in the word processing center who \nwanted to stagger their work hours and give themselves a day off every \nother Friday. He agreed, and the women were not only happier, their \nproductivity in their high stress jobs has increased. Now they work \nlonger 4-day weeks one week, followed by a regular 5-day work week the \nnext.\n  Mr. President, First Tennessee's efforts have paid off. They were \nrecently named the number one family-friendly company by Business Week \nmagazine. This is a fine example of how change and risk-taking are \nbeneficial to the growth of companies. First Tennessee has seen the \nbenefits of its Family Matters program and other family friendly \nprograms in elevated company morale, improved productivity and \nincreased employee tenure.\n  First Tennessee's interest in improving itself from the inside out is \nan example to us all that every organization can make improvements. \nTaking a proactive approach and involving employees in the learning \nprocess is a greatly admired advance toward company improvement. First \nTennessee has been innovative and is sure to continue to see added \nimprovements and benefits due to its responsibility to its employees as \nwell as its customers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11569-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR. BILL WILEY\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I have been privileged in my \ncareer in the U.S. Senate, through my work on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee and on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy \nand Water Development, to work with many of the great scientific minds \nof this country. I rise today to pay tribute to one of those scientists \nwith whom I worked especially closely and who was a longtime close \npersonal friend before his death last summer.\n  Dr. Bill Wiley of the Battelle Memorial Institute built a monumental \ncareer and left a huge legacy first and foremost because of his special \ngifts and training as a fine scientist. His achievements over his 31-\nyear career with Battelle, beginning as a staff research scientist and \nending with his position as vice president for Science and Technology, \ncontributed significantly to this country's scientific understanding.\n  But I believe that the work for which Bill Wiley should and will be \nbest remembered is the concrete result of his vision which is now \nnearing completion on the banks of the Columbia River in Richland, WA, \nthe Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory [EMSL], which will be \nthe jewel of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and which may \nvery well hold the key to this country's Herculean effort to the \ncleanup of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation and other, similar sites \naround the country.\n  Armed only with this vision and his irresponsible charm and \nenthusiasm, Bill Wiley came to see me several years ago to lay out his \nplans for EMSL, undaunted by skeptics who had told him at every turn \nthat it might be a good idea, but the Congress was unlikely to embrace \nsuch a costly project. I must say that had it been anyone other than \nBill Wiley pushing the dream, the skeptics probably would have been \nright. But Bill not only convinced me that it was worth doing, he \npersuaded all the other relevant players that not only was it something \nwe could do, but that it was something a great nation should not fail \nto do. I visited the EMSL facility in its late stages of construction \nshortly before Bill's death last summer. Anyone who ever harbored \ndoubts about the wisdom of this research facility should go have a look \nwhen it opens its doors next month. It will be home to America's finest \nscientists employing the latest tools doing the best research in the \nworld today. And it is a point of special pride to those of us who were \nhis friends that they will be doing so in the building named in memory \nof William R. Wiley.\n  This African-American son of an Oxford, MS, cobbler served his Nation \nwell professionally and as a humanitarian who was never too busy in his \ncareer to help the less fortunate who were trying to work their way up \nthe ladder or merely to get to the first rung of the ladder. I know \nmany colleagues join me in expressing our condolences to Bill's loving \nwife Gus and to his daughter Johari Wiley-Johnson and in expressing our \ndeep gratitude for the paths that Bill Wiley charted and the mark he \nleft behind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11570-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE WILDFIRE SUPPRESSION AIRCRAFT TRANSFER ACT\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, late last night the Senate \nacted to adopt S. 2078, the Wildfire Suppression Aircraft Transfer Act. \nSenator Bingaman of New Mexico and I introduced this bill, along with \nSenator Craig with the support of the administration 2 weeks ago. \nSenator Kyl has joined us as a cosponsor, and the bill has been cleared \nby the Armed Services Committee.\n  This summer, more acres have burned than in any other fires season in \nthe past 50 years, and unfortunately, this fire season is not over yet. \nForest scientists warn us that severe fire seasons are becoming more \nand more frequent, which is a real cause of concern when rural \npopulations growth is increasing the number of private homes that come \ninto direct contact with fires on Federal lands.\n  The Forest Service has determined that the existing fleet of aircraft \nis inadequate to meet Federal obligations to control fire to protect \nlives, property and resources. The fleet available to them consists \ncurrently of 39 planes, two thirds of which are World War II and Korean \nwar era aircraft. An average of one plane a year is lost to old age or \naccidents. In meetings with the Armed Service Committee, to which the \nbill was referred, the Forest Service estimated that they will need \naccess to 20 additional planes over the next 3 to 5 years to maintain \nservice and meet increasing demands.\n  The most obvious source of these planes is surplus military \nequipment. But the Forest Service and the Department of Defense have \nfound that the planes are not making it through the system to be \navailable for purchase by private contractors. In response, this bill \nwould give the Secretary of Defense the option of making fire fighting \nneeds a priority for the sale of aircraft excess to the needs of the \nDepartment. The Secretary of Defense would do so only in response to a \nrequest from the Secretary of Agriculture. The legislation ensures that \naircraft could only be available for purchase by companies certified to \nhave Forest Service contracts to fight fires, and requires the \nSecretary of Defense to develop regulations to enforce restrictions \nthat the aircraft sold would only be used for fire fighting purposes.\n  We do not have time to waste. It will take an estimated 1 to 2 years \nto retrofit a plane to be used to fight forest and range fires. By \nForest Service estimates, we are already two planes short of an \nadequate fire fighting fleet. The 1996 fire season has already burned \nnearly 6 million acres across the country. That is three times the 10 \nyear average, but it is not much more than we saw burn in 1994. These \nfires are burning more intensely, with devastating effects on the \nenvironment, and creating dangerous situations for our citizens. In my \nown State, local and Federal officials are working around the clock to \nensure that the scorched hillsides above Boise to try to minimize the \ndevastating mudslides that are only a few inches of rain away. In the \nway of those mudslides are schools, homes, the downtown district, and \nour State capitol building.\n  I am pleased my colleagues recognized the urgency, and agreed to \nadopt this legislation to make it possible for the Forest Service to \nhave access to the equipment they need to keep our citizens, their \nproperty and our natural resources safe from catastrophic \nfires.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11570-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11570-S11571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO CHARLES M. PIGOTT\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, at the end of this year Mr. Charles \nM. Pigott will step down as chairman and chief executive officer of \nPACCAR, Inc. Today I would like to recognize Mr. Pigott for his superb \nachievements and to pay tribute to a thoughtful and considerate friend.\n  Guided for nearly three decades by Mr. Pigott's steady hand, PACCAR \nis now America's largest domestically owned truck manufacturer. His \npursuit of quality and innovation has left a lasting imprint on the \ncompany and American industry as well.\n\n[[Page S11571]]\n\n  Mr. Pigott began at PACCAR with a summer job in 1945. He went on to \nreceive an engineering degree from Stanford University, then served as \na Navy aviator in Korea. When his tour of duty ended, he rejoined \nPACCAR. In 1967 he became chief executive officer. He oversaw a period \nof great change in the industry, a period in which trucks became safer, \nmore efficient and longer-lasting.\n  The technical center Mr. Pigott built has brought forth many new \nproducts and innovations. They include the aerodynamic Kenworth T600, \nwhich was so widely acclaimed and imitated it changed the look of \nheavy-duty trucks; the Kenworth T2000, PACCAR's newest edition; and the \nmore than 330 patents PACCAR has garnered under Mr. Pigott.\n  The market, of course, rewards quality. Nearly one out of four class \n8 trucks sold in America today is a Peterbilt or Kenworth. And company \nsales have, on Mr. Pigott's watch, grown from $320 million to $4.5 \nbillion annually. Net income increased almost sixteen-fold, and \nshareholders' equity from $88 million to well over $1.2 billion. It is \nremarkable that every year in which Mr. Piggot was CEO, PACCAR, \nrecorded a profit.\n  Mr. Pigott has made his mark in the community as well. For nearly \nfive decades he has worked with the Boy Scouts of America, serving as \npresident of both the Chief Seattle Council and the National Council. \nHe has been general campaign chairman and trustee for United Way of \nKing County, chairman of the Washington Roundtable and in leadership \npositions for many other cultural and civic organizations. He also \nheads the PACCAR Foundation, which distributes approximately $3 million \nyearly to civic, cultural, educational and health and welfare causes in \ncommunities where PACCAR does business.\n  Mr. Pigott has been blessed with a wonderful family. He and his wife \nYvonne have raised seven fine children.\n  When Mr. Pigott steps down on December 31, 1996, he will continue \nfamily tradition and hand leadership over to his son. I congratulate \nhim on a splendid career, thank him for his contributions to American \nindustry, and wish him all the best in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11570-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DAVID EHRENFRIED\n\n Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, recently, Dave Ehrenfried retired \nafter 40 years as an editor and cornerstone of Lewiston, ME's Sun-\nJournal.\n  He began at the paper in 1956, where he quickly showed his talent for \nnewspaper reporting. Dave held many positions throughout his tenure at \nthe Sun-Journal. Most notably, his work was recognized by the New \nEngland News Executives Association with a first place award for \neditorial writing in 1982. In 1988, Dave was named the assistant \nexecutive editor at the Sun-Journal and in 1991 he became a \nrepresentative, advocating for readers of the daily and Sunday papers. \nHe was once again recognized by his peers for his dedication to \njournalism by being asked to serve as president of the New England \nSociety of Newspaper Editors in 1993.\n  Dave has always been a hard worker, a requirement when you work for \none of Maine's leading newspapers. His coworkers hold him in the \nhighest esteem, including one member of the Sun-Journal staff who \nreferred to him as a quiet leader with sound judgment. Dave gave \nhimself and his time to all who asked and the people who turned to him \nwho knew that they were heard. Dave is a remarkable person who has \ndedicated his life to journalism and integrity.\n  I commend his commitment to his family, his coworkers, and to Maine \njournalism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11571-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, child abuse is a critical issue facing our \nNation. Each year, close to one million children are abused or \nneglected and as a result, in need of assistance and out of home care.\n  While these numbers are staggering, we should also be concerned by \nthe nearly 2 million false or unsubstantiated reports of child abuse \nand neglect that are filed wrongfully and in some cases maliciously. \nWhat this means is that case workers, who are already over worked, are \nconducting 2 million investigations at some level, possibly resulting \nin inappropriate interventions--including removal of the children from \ntheir homes.\n  Members of the Labor Committee may recall the testimony of Jim Wade \nwho spoke of his 3-year ordeal, in which his daughter was wrongfully \nremoved from his home. I have received many such reports and \ncomplaints, and while we should be mindful not to legislate by \nanecdote, these stories involve real people and are chilling.\n  I am also reminded of the tragic case of Elisa Izquierdo of Brooklyn, \nthe 6-year-old girl brutally murdered by her mother on the day before \nThanksgiving this past year. Elisa was well known to the overburdened \ncase workers who were assigned to monitor her, however it appears that \nthey simply did not have enough time to keep a close watch on Elisa, \nnor maybe enough training to realize the tremendous seriousness of her \nsituation.\n  Each of us unfortunately, can share similar stories from our States \nand communities. Each of us can point to a child whose life ended far \ntoo early, and then tragically--at the hands of a loved one.\n  The legislation that the Senate will shortly vote on, S. 919, will \nnot solve the epidemic of child abuse and neglect. That solution rests \nwith families and communities. But it will better enable caseworkers to \ndo their jobs and protect children who are in serious jeopardy. By \nfocusing on better training and the use of risk assessment procedures \nS. 919 will help to improve the safety of children and will in \nsignificant and positive ways, improve the way we respond to an \ninvestigate reports of child abuse and neglect.\n  First, in order to protect individuals from false reports S. 919 \neliminates current law's blanket immunity from prosecution for persons \nmaking knowingly false allegations of child abuse or neglect. On good \nfaith reports will be protected by immunity.\n  Second, in order to ensure citizen participation and public \naccountability of State and local child protection agencies, we have \nrequired each State receiving funds under this act to establish citizen \nreview panels to evaluate the extent to which child protection agencies \nare effectively discharging their child protection responsibilities and \nto review the facts surrounding local child fatalities or near \nfatalities resulting from abuse or neglect.\n\n  Third, S. 919 protects children at risk of abuse by eliminating the \nrequirement that States seek to preserve families and reunify children \nwith parents who abuse or neglect them. States would no longer have to \npursue reunification with surviving children where a parent was \nconvicted of murder, voluntary manslaughter or felony homicide of \nanother child.\n  Additionally, States would be required to include murder, voluntary \nmanslaughter, and felony assault as a statutory ground for termination \nof parental rights. The decision to pursue termination or to seek \nreunification in these cases would be determined by the State on a \ncase-by-case basis.\n  Finally, S. 919 includes a new provision requiring States to have \nprocedures for expedited termination of parental rights in cases \ninvolving abandoned infants.\n  These changes in the law have been sorely needed and will result in a \nmore cohesive child protection system, with an enhanced ability to \nrespond to the very serious problems of abuse and neglect.\n  One of the other important sections of CAPTA is its research \ncomponent. S. 919 streamlines and better targets limited research \ndollars into areas with the most promise, in terms of responding to \nchild abuse. Additionally, we have revised CAPTA's research \ndemonstration program to focus on innovative and effective new \napproaches in the area of child protection. Kinship care is such an \napproach. S. 919 authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services \nto conduct a 10-State demonstration of kinship care programs and to \nreport back with recommendations concerning its possible expansion. \nKinship care has been shown in several States to be a very effective \nand compassionate alternative to foster care.\n\n  Similar programs in other States have been less successful. The \nkinship care demonstration will enable us to ascertain where this \nprogram works and why and what we need to do to avoid any possible \nnegative consequences.\n  Finally, we have clarified the definition of child abuse or neglect \nto include at a minimum, acts which result in death or serious physical \nor emotional harm or which present an imminent risk of serious harm. \nThis definition provides additional guidance to States and should \nassist them as they endeavor to protect children from abuse and \nneglect.\n  S. 919 also reauthorizes several other important programs: The \ncommunity and family resource grants which significantly consolidates \nthe community based prevention grant, respite care program, and family \nresource programs into one cohesive network; reauthorizes The Family \nViolence Prevention and Services Act which provides assistance to \nStates to help victims of domestic violence; reauthorizes The Adoption \nOpportunities Act which supports aggressive efforts to strengthen the \ncapacity of States to find permanent homes for children with special \nneeds; The Abandoned Infants Assistance Act which provides for the \nneeds of children who are abandoned, especially those with aids; The \nChildren's Justice Act; The Missing Children's Assistance Act and \nsection 214 of the Victims of Child Abuse Act.\n  Mr. President, as we are moving toward passage of this legislation I \nwanted to take the time to thank several colleagues for their tireless \nefforts: Senator Kassebaum, Senator Dodd, and Senator Kennedy. We have \nworked together over the last year and a half in a truly bi-partisan \nfashion and I think we have produced a very good product. I would also \nlike to acknowledge the significant contributions of \n\n[[Page S11582]]\n\ntheir staffs, Kimberly Barnes-O'Connor and Rebecca Jones with Senator \nKassebaum, Michael Iskowitz and Jeffrey Teitz with Senator Kennedy, \nJane Lowenson and Brook Byers-Goldman with Senator Dodd, and Stephanie \nMonroe and Townsend Lange of my staff. Thank you all for the hard work \nyou have done on this legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, at this time I would like to ask unanimous consent \nthat a colloquy between myself and Senator Dodd on the issue of medical \nneglect be inserted into the Record as if read.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Child Abuse \nPrevention and Treatment Act of 1996. I am very pleased that this has \nbeen a bipartisan effort. This bill comes at a very critical time. Just \nlast week the results of the National Incidence Study conducted by the \nNational Center on Child Abuse and Neglect showed an alarming increase \nin the incidence of child abuse and neglect. Since 1986 the number of \nabused and neglected children has almost doubled. Physical abuse has \nnearly doubled and sexual abuse has more than doubled. Additionally the \nstudy indicates that children from families with incomes below $15,000 \nare 22 times more likely to be victims of child abuse and neglect than \nare those children from families with incomes above $30,000.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned that the welfare reform bill signed \ninto law last month may lead to an increase in cases of child abuse and \nneglect. That legislation left no safety net for children whose parents \nhad reached their 5-year limit on public assistance. I intend to watch \nthis issue very closely.\n  The good news is that today we are asking the Senate to consider, by \nunanimous consent, the reauthorization of the Child Abuse Prevention \nand Treatment Act, S. 919. First enacted in 1974, this legislation \nprovides, among other things, Federal financial assistance for \nidentifying, preventing, and treating child abuse and neglect. This \nbill affirms a clear Federal role in addressing prevention and \ntreatment of child abuse. Further, it recognizes the importance of \nFederal leadership in funding research, training, technical assistance, \nand data collection to help aid the States to do their jobs better. It \nalso continues support to States to improve child protective service \nsystems.\n  Finally, I am pleased that the bill reauthorizes and enhances the \nFamily Resource and Support Center Program that I authored in 1990 and \nexpanded in the Human Services Act in 1994. The Family Resource \nServices are essential to prevention and allow families to meet their \nneeds to avoid problems that propel them into crisis down the road.\n  I thank Senator Coats for all his hard work and cooperation on the \nreauthorization of this bill. I am very pleased that this has been a \nbipartisan effort.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that under CAPTA, States have \nbeen allowed to exempt parents from prosecution on grounds of medical \nneglect if the parent was employing alternative means of healing as \npart of the parent's religious practice. CAPTA also has required States \nto have procedures in place to report, investigate and intervene in \nsituations where children are being denied medical care needed to \nprevent harm.\n  Mr. COATS. That is correct. The two provisions you have described \nhave caused problems for some States. The Department of Health and \nHuman Services has moved to disqualify certain States from CAPTA \nfunding based on the State's accommodation of the religious treatment \nin lieu of medical treatment.\n  Mr. DODD. And it is my further understanding that we have clarified \nthat issue in the Rule of Construction in the bill before us.\n  Mr. COATS. Yes, we have. After a very lengthy negotiation we have \nreached a compromise which will both protect children in need of \nmedical intervention while ensuring that the first amendment rights of \nparents to practice their religion are not infringed upon. Under this \nbill, no parent or legal guardian is required to provide a child with \nmedical service or treatment against their religious beliefs, nor is \nany State required to find, or prohibited from finding, abuse or \nneglect cases where the parent or guardian relied solely or partially \nupon spiritual means rather than medical treatment in accordance with \ntheir religious beliefs.\n  Mr. DODD. Does the bill address the State's authority to pursue any \nlegal remedies necessary to provide medical care or treatment when such \ncare or treatment is necessary to prevent or remedy serious harm to the \nchild, or to prevent the withholding of medically indicated treatment \nfrom children with life-threatening conditions?\n  Mr. COATS. Yes it does. In addition, the bill gives States sole \ndiscretion over case-by-case determinations relating to the exercise of \nauthority in this area. No State is foreclosed from considering parents \nuse of treatment by spiritual means. No State is required to prosecute \nparents in this area. But every State must have in place the authority \nto intervene to protect children in need. Let me also state that \nnothing in this bill should be interpreted as discouraging the \nreporting of suspected incidences of medical neglect to child \nprotection services, where warranted.\n  Mr. DODD. I also see that a new section has been added that requires \nthe States to include in their State laws, as statutory grounds for the \ntermination of parental rights, convictions of parents for certain \nspecified crimes against children. It also eliminates a Federal mandate \nthat States must seek reunification of the convicted parent with \nsurviving children. Given the crimes that have been specified--murder, \nvoluntary manslaughter, and felony assault--it appears that what we are \naddressing is a parent who deliberately takes the life or seriously \ninjures his child.\n  Mr. COATS. That is correct. This section is intended to give the \nStates flexibility in this area by not requiring them to seek to \nreunify a parent convicted of a serious and violent crime against his \nchild, with that surviving child or other children. States may still \nseek to reunify the family but will no longer be required to do so by \nFederal law. Second, the bill provides that these very serious crimes \nshould be grounds in State law for the termination of parental rights. \nAny decision, however, to terminate parental rights, even in these \ncases, is entirely a State issue and remains so under this bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Would States be allowed to consider a parent's motive when \ndeciding to terminate parental rights or to seek reunification of that \nfamily? And could this include sincerely held religious beliefs of the \nparent?\n  Mr. COATS. Yes. Since this is entirely a matter of State law, States \nare free to consider whatever mitigating circumstances they would like.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is my understanding that concerns have \nbeen raised regarding outreach services that grantees must make to \nvarious communities. It is my understanding that when grantees engage \nin outreach activities, they must ensure that they maximize the \nparticipation of racial and ethnic minorities and members of \nunderserved or underrepresented groups. I just want to ascertain that \nthis list envisions inclusion of immigrant communities.\n  Mr. COATS. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate concur to the \namendment of the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/27/senate-section/article/S11573-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11582-S11583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       WATER DESALINIZATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is taking \nfinal action to enact the False Statements Accountability Act of 1996, \nlegislation to overturn the Supreme Court's 1995 decision in Hubbard \nversus United States and restore the prohibition on making false \nstatements to Congress.\n  The bill before us is in substance identical to the bill that passed \nthe Senate on July 25, 1996, except in one respect. I do not want to \nreiterate all that I said at that time, so I will address at this time \nonly the one substantive difference between the bill passed by the \nSenate and the current compromise we will vote on today.\n  As passed, the Senate bill provided blanket application to prohibit \nany false statement made to Congress or any component of Congress, \nincluding individual members and their offices. The coverage provided \nby the House bill was much narrower in scope. The trick was to \nreconcile the two approaches. Through detailed negotiations and the \ngood faith of all concerned, we have been able to produce this \ncompromise legislation, which restores the applicability of section \n1001 of title 18 of the United States Code to the areas in which \nCongress most needs it.\n  First, the compromise covers false statements made in all \nadministrative matters. This includes claims for payment, vouchers, and \ncontracting proposals. The provision also covers all employment related \nmatters, such as submitting a phony resume or making false claims \nbefore the Office of Compliance or Office of Fair Employment Practices. \nAlso covered are all documents required by law, rule, or regulation to \nbe submitted to Congress. This crucial provision will cover all filings \nunder the Ethics in Government Act and the Lobbying Disclosure Act and \nprovides a real deterrent to false filings under these two laws, among \nothers. For this reason alone, this bill is one of the most important \ncongressional reforms we will have taken during this Congress.\n\n  The compromise also applies the prohibition on false statements to an \ninvestigation or review conducted by any committee, subcommittee, \ncommission, or office of the Congress. This provision will prohibit \nknowing and willful material false statements to entities like the \nGeneral Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office. False \nstatements to the Capitol Police will also be covered.\n  The greatest difficulty was in formulating the scope of the \napplicability of the false statement prohibition to committees and \nsubcommittees of each House of Congress. Only committee or subcommittee \ninvestigations or reviews conducted pursuant to the authority of the \nparticular committee or subcommittee, meaning within its jurisdiction, \nwill receive the protection of section 1001, and then only so long as \nthe investigation or review is conducted in a manner consistent with \nthe rules of the House or Senate, as relevant. This provision will \nallow each House to determine for itself whether to limit the \ncircumstances in which committee or subcommittee investigations or \nreviews will be covered by section 1001. We do not intend, however, for \nthe Senate to need to change its rules before false statements made to \na committee or subcommittee conducting a review of a policy within its \njurisdiction be punishable under this act.\n\n  In having the bill cover any investigation, we intend to cover formal \ninvestigations conducted pursuant to the rules of particular committees \nof the Senate, many of which have specific rules covering \ninvestigations. Thus, an investigation will be a more formal inquiry \ninto a particular matter within\n\n[[Page S11606]]\n\nthe jurisdiction of a committee or subcommittee. Included in the \ndefinition of investigation are ancillary proceedings, such as \ndepositions, and formal steps employed by certain committees that are a \nnecessary prelude to an investigation, such as a preliminary inquiry \nand initial review employed by the Select Committee on Ethics.\n  The application of the bill to any review by a committee or \nsubcommittee is broader. Under Rule XXVI (8) of the Standing Rules of \nthe Senate, each committee ``shall review * * * on a continuing basis \nthe application, administration, and execution of those laws, or parts \nof laws, the subject matter of which is within the legislative \njurisdiction of that committee.'' By using review in this law, we \nintend to cover all such review conducted by committees and \nsubcommittees of the Senate. Often, we refer to such reviews as \noversight. The sponsors of the bill, who include the chairman and \nformer chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, and the \nchairman and former chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, among others, intend that the term ``review'' be read \nbroadly to cover all committee oversight and inquiries into the current \noperation of federal law and policy, compliance with Federal law, or \nproposals to improve Federal law, policy, or administration. In \naddition, we intend to capture within the meaning of review matters \nwithin committee jurisdiction that are not directly legislative, such \nas confirmation proceedings.\n\n  We chose to limit the act to committees and subcommittees, and their \nstaff, because these are the entities through which Congress conducts \nits inquiries and oversight; these are the entities that hold hearings; \nthese are the entities that can issue and enforce legal process; these \nare the entities charged with developing legislation for consideration \nby each House of Congress. Thus, section 1001 will not apply to \nstatements made to individual members not acting as part of a committee \nor subcommittee investigation or review. This restriction should \nalleviate any concern that constituents exercising their right to \npetition Congress would fear prosecution for inadvertent or minor \nmisstatements. No first amendment rights will be chilled by this bill. \nNor will the bill apply to the statement of opinion or argument, as \nonly knowing and willful false statements of fact are meant to be \ncovered.\n  This is an important bill. I am pleased that enough Members of both \nHouses saw the need to act quickly on this legislation, which I believe \nto be absolutely necessary to protect the constitutional interests of \nthe Congress. I want to thank my colleagues and cosponsors, in \nparticular Senator Levin, the lead cosponsor, for their efforts. I also \nwant to thank Representative Bill Martini, sponsor of the House \ncompanion, for pushing so hard to get this done, and Chairman Bill \nMcCollum of the House Subcommittee on Crime, and his staff, Paul \nMcNulty and Dan Bryant, for working so hard to reach agreement on this \nbill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as a sponsor of S. 1734, the Senate-passed \nversion of this legislation, I am pleased to join Senator Specter in \nurging passage of this bill. The House passed this bill, which restores \ncriminal penalties for knowing, willful, material false statements made \nto a Federal court or Congress, by rollcall vote without a single vote \nin opposition. I hope we can pass it here by unanimous consent.\n  For 40 years, title 18 United States Code, section 1001 has been a \nmainstay of our legal system, by criminalizing intentional false \nstatements to the Federal Government. In 1955, the Supreme Court \ninterpreted title 18 United States Code, section 1001 to prohibit \nknowing, willful, material false statements not only to the executive \nbranch, but also to the judicial and legislative branches. Last year \nthe Supreme Court, in Hubbard versus United States, reversed this \nprecedent and held that Section 1001 prohibits false statements only to \nthe executive branch, and not to the judiciary or legislative branches.\n  The Supreme Court based its decision on the wording of the statute \nwhich doesn't explicitly reference either the courts or Congress. The \nCourt noted in Hubbard that it had failed to find in the statute's \nlegislative history ``any indication that Congress even considered \nwhether, section 1001, might apply outside the Executive Branch.''\n  The obvious result of the Hubbard decision has been to reduce parity \namong the three branches. And the new interbranch distinctions are \ndifficult to justify, since there is no logical reason why the criminal \nstatus of a willful, material false statement should depend upon which \nbranch of the Federal Government received it.\n  Senator Specter and I each introduced bills last year to supply that \nmissing statutory reference. This year, we joined forces, along with a \nnumber of our colleagues, and introduced S. 1734. It was passed by the \nSenate on July 26 of this year with the support of the administration. \nWe then worked out our differences with the House, and that's how we \nare able to bring this final product before the Senate. I want to \nassociate myself with the remarks of Senator Specter in describing the \ndifferences between H.R. 3166 and S. 1734.\n  Provisions to bar false statements and compel testimony have been on \nthe Federal statute books for 40 years or more. Recent court decisions \nand events have eroded the usefulness of some of these provisions as \nthey apply to the courts and Congress. The bill before you is a \nbipartisan effort to redress some of the imbalances that have arisen \namong the branches in these areas. It rests on the premise that the \ncourts and Congress ought to be treated as coequal to the executive \nbranch when it comes to prohibitions on false statements.\n  I want to thank Senator Specter and his staff, Richard Hertling, for \ntheir dedication to this legislation. We have been able to solve \nproblems that arose because of the truly bipartisan approach we had to \nthis bill. I also want to thank Senator Hatch, chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, for recognizing the significance of this \nlegislation and acting promptly on it in committee to get it to the \nSenate floor, and I want to thank the Members in the House, Congressmen \nMartini, McCollum and Hyde, without whose assistance this bill wouldn't \nbe at this point. I also want to thank Morgan Frankel and Mike \nDavidson. Morgan is currently Deputy Senate Legal Counsel and Mike \nrecently left as Senate Legal Counsel. Their experience with the work \nof the Senate was valuable in working through a number of technical \nissues. I particularly want to thank Elise Bean of my staff who is as \ncapable as they come and simply an excellent lawyer.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join Senator Specter, myself, \nand our cosponsors in sending this bill to the President for his \nsignature.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to indicate my full support for \nthis bill, which returns to the Federal false statements statute, 18 \nU.S.C. Sec. 1001, the simple but vital proposition that lying to \nCongress is as unacceptable as lying to any other part of the \nGovernment.\n  This legislation has enormous practical importance for the oversight \nand investigative work performed by the Senate. As the past chairman of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee and the current chairman of the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I have chaired many oversight \nhearings and conducted numerous investigations that have probed the \nefficacy of Federal Government programs and initiatives. Oftentimes, \nthe Committee and Subcommittee's work has uncovered serious problems, \nsometimes of a criminal dimension. In the best of circumstances, \ngathering facts that may not reflect well on an agency, or a program, \nor an individual is difficult. Willful deceit out of the mouths of \nwitnesses or in the documents they provide to Congress can make that \njob nearly impossible.\n  Until Hubbard was decided last year, the threat of criminal sanctions \nunder Sec. 1001 was a powerful deterrent to such deceit, and it was the \nsource of appropriate punishment for those who lie to Congress. We need \nto return Sec. 1001 to Congress' investigative and oversight arsenal, \nand this legislation will do just that. That being the primary effect \nof the legislation, it also works well-crafted and necessary changes to \nother aspects of Congress's ability to investigate, and I support those \nas well.\n  Many years ago, Woodrow Wilson wrote, ``Unless Congress have and use\n\n[[Page S11607]]\n\nevery means of acquainting itself with the acts and the disposition of \nthe administrative agents of the government, the country must be \nhelpless to learn how it is being served; and unless Congress both \nscrutinize these things and sift them by every form of discussion the \ncountry must remain in embarrassing, crippling ignorance of the very \naffairs which it is most important that it should understand and \ndirect.'' It is for this fundamental reason--that Congress must be able \nto scrutinize accurately the matters before it--that I am proud to co-\nsponsor this legislation and urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, today the Senate has agreed to pass a very \nimportant bill, the False Statements Penalty Restoration Act (H.R. \n3166).\n  When Congress originally enacted the False Statements Act, the \nFederal perjury statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001, to impose felony criminal \npenalties on an individual who knowingly and willfully makes a false or \nfraudulent statement, it thought it had created a criminal law that \napplied to all three branches of Government, including Congress. And \nsince 1955, when the U.S. Supreme Court specifically held that the \nstatute applied to all three branches, this was the law of the land.\n  However, in 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the statute did \nnot apply to the judiciary branch, thus creating uncertainty about \nwhether false statements made to Congress and by Members of Congress \nwere now covered by the law.\n  To our constituents, it once again appeared that Members of Congress \nwere a special class to which a particular law did not apply--and that \nmay have been the case.\n  Since the 1995 Supreme Court decision, indictments charging \nindividuals with making knowing and willful false statements on \nfinancial disclosure forms and other reports have been dismissed. This \nsituation must not be allowed to continue for one day more.\n  Today's legislation makes clear that Congress is indeed subject to \nthis important law, as it should be. It returns us to where the law was \nfor the last 40 years.\n  As a former chair and vice chair of the Ethics Committee, I know this \nlegislation has particular significance. Without this legislation, \nthere are currently no sanctions for deliberately filing false \ninformation in connection with these Federal reporting documents. To \nensure the integrity of these reporting requirements, this bill must be \nenacted so it is very clear there are penalties for knowing and willful \nviolations.\n  This legislation also addresses needed clarification in the \nobstruction of justice statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1505. This law makes it \na Federal offense to impede or obstruct an investigation of a \ncongressional committee. In 1991, the D.C. District Circuit Court of \nAppeals held, however, that the statute did not clearly prohibit an \nindividual from personally lying to or obstructing Congress in its \ninvestigations.\n  Again, I know first hand from my Senate Ethics Committee experience \nhow this court interpretation risks impairing the ability of the Ethics \nCommittee, and other congressional investigations to maintain any \nintegrity in its proceedings. If a person can lie, or induce another to \nlie for him without worry of being prosecuted for such action, of what \nconsequence would be any congressional investigation.\n  This legislation corrects the 1991 Supreme Court decision. Any \nindividual who tries to impede a congressional or other governmental \ninvestigation, regardless of whether the individual acts on his own, or \nthrough the actions of another individual is going to be penalized--\nperiod.\n  I am pleased to support this legislation to remedy these ambiguities \nin our statutes, and ensure the integrity of Congress' investigations, \nand the Federal reporting requirements. For the American public, this \nbill also ensures that no member of Congress is above the law.\n  The following is a more detailed explanation of the changes this \nlegislation will make, and its particular impact on the work of the \nSenate Ethics Committee, and other congressional investigations.\n  The Federal perjury statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1621, punishes knowing \nfalse and material testimony, only if given under oath, such as in \nformal committee hearings and depositions. The Ethics Committee \nnecessarily uses a variety of other, less formal fact-gathering \ntechniques in the conduct of its initial examinations of complaints and \npreliminary inquiries, in order to determine whether there are \nsufficient grounds to warrant receipt of formal testimony through \ndepositions and hearings.\n  It is critical to the Ethics Committee's ability to fulfill its \nresponsibility to the Senate to investigate allegations of misconduct, \nand to the subjects of allegations to investigate fairly, that the \ncommittee's preliminary judgments about potential wrongdoing be based \non the most accurate information possible. The availability of a \ncriminal sanction under section 1001 for knowing false and material \nstatements to the committee is an important safeguard to preserve the \nquality of the committee's investigative functions.\n  The absence of section 1001 liability may push the Ethics Committee \nto initiate formal proceedings more often, and earlier, than it would \notherwise, just to ensure it receives truthful information. This \npremature heightening of ethics inquiries risks imposing unwarranted \nand unfair injury to subjects' reputations and unnecessary expense to \nthe Senate.\n  This bill would restore the applicability of section 1001 to false \nmaterial statements to congressional committees during inquiries.\n  Individuals who have knowingly filed false financial disclosure \nstatements have in the past been convicted of violating the false \nstatements statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001. Following the U.S. Supreme \nCourt's reinterpretation of section 1001 last year, executive branch \nofficials are still subject to punishment for false statements under \nsection 1001, but congressional filers cannot be punished under section \n1001 for identical misconduct. While congressional filers may \npotentially remain subject to sanction under other criminal code \nprovisions, the applicability of these other provisions is untested and \nuncertain. Members of Congress and their staffs should not receive any \npossibility of special treatment, but should face the same criminal \nsanction for their false financial disclosures as other government \nofficials.\n  In addition, the Senate Code of Official Conduct and Federal law \nrequire the filing of a number of other reports and disclosure forms \nunder various circumstances. These include reports of the acceptance of \ngifts from foreign governments, disclosure of employees' reimbursed \ntravel expenses and authorization for such reimbursement, reports of \ndesignations of charitable contributions by registered lobbyists or \nforeign agents in lieu of honoraria, and reports of contributions to \nand expenditures from legal expense funds, among other matters for \nwhich reports or disclosure is required.\n  Without section 1001, there are currently no sanctions for \ndeliberately filing false information in connection with any of these \nreporting requirements. For these disclosure and reporting requirements \nto fulfill the purpose for which they were established, there need to \nbe clear penalties for willful violations of the rules by the filing of \nfalse reports.\n  The obstruction of justice statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1505, makes it a \nFederal offense corruptly to impede or obstruct an investigation of a \ncongressional committee. Historically, this provision has served to \nsafeguard the integrity of congressional inquiries by providing a \npenalty for individuals who seek to obstruct a proper inquiry. In 1991, \nthe D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision in the Poindexter case \nseriously eroded the protection of section 1505 by holding that, as \napplied to conduct undertaken by an individual witness him/herself, \nrather than through another individual, the law was unconstitutionally \nvague to be applied.\n\n  For a committee like the Senate Ethics Committee, which has the task \nof finding facts in sensitive and complicated cases involving potential \nmisconduct of Senators, this narrowed interpretation raises serious \nrisks of impairing the integrity of the committee's proceedings. In the \ncase involving former Senator Bob Packwood, the Ethics Committee noted \nin its report that ``the committee is specifically empowered to obtain \nevidence from Members and others who are the subject of\n\n[[Page S11608]]\n\ncommittee inquiry, and it is entitled to rely on the integrity of such \nevidence. Indeed, the entire process is compromised and rendered wholly \nwithout value if persons subject to the committee's inquiry, or \nwitnesses in an inquiry, are allowed to jeopardize the integrity of \nevidence coming before the committee.'' [Report at pages 142-43].\n  For many years, it has been understood that an individual who acts \nwith improper or corrupt purpose to obstruct a committee or other \nGovernment investigation, whether by false or misleading testimony, the \ndeliberate destruction or alteration of documents, or other nefarious \nmeans, commits wrongdoing subject to punishment under 18 U.S.C. section \n1505. Now, after the Poindexter decision, a serious question exists \nwhether an individual who engages in conduct to obstruct an \ninvestigation personally, rather than by persuading someone else to do \nso, may be called to account for such unacceptable conduct under \nsection 1505.\n  It is my firm conviction that Congress has already acted \nlegislatively through the present language of section 1505 to \ncriminalize this conduct. However, since at least one court was \napparently unclear on what Congress had in mind, it is important that \nwe provide explicit guidance in the law so clear that no confusion will \narise in the future.\n  This bill would correct the court's nonsensical interpretation of \nsection 1505 by making clear that the statute prohibits witnesses from \nengaging with improper purpose in any of the variety of means by which \nindividuals may seek to impede a congressional or other governmental \ninvestigation, whether doing so personally or through another \nindividual, and whether by making false or misleading statements or \nwithholding, concealing, altering, or destroying documents sought by \ncongressional committees and other investigative bodies.\n  The Senate subpoena enforcement statute, 28 U.S.C. section 1365, \nprovides the mechanism for Senate committees to go to court to seek \nassistance from the court in enforcing compliance with a subpoena of \nthe committee. This system, which was enacted in 1978, permits a \ncommittee seeking necessary testimony or documents to apply to court, \nwith the Senate's authorization, so that the witness may present his/\nher privilege or other basis not to comply with the Senate subpoena. If \nthe court sustains the committee's position, it may order the witness \nto comply with the subpoena and thereby enable the committee to obtain \nthe information it needs in a timely and fair manner.\n\n  Over the past 20 years, the availability of this system has proven \nextremely beneficial to Senate committees, including the Ethics \nCommittee. The Ethics Committee utilized this process to obtain a \njudicial ruling on Senator Packwood's objections to providing portions \nof his diaries to the committee. In that case, the courts upheld the \ncommittee's position and Senator Packwood was ordered to turn over his \ndiary materials, subject to the masking of privileged and personal \ninformation, which the committee respected. The process worked well and \nenabled the committee to obtain the evidence it needed to complete its \nresponsibilities to the Senate and the public.\n  An ambiguity in the current statute, however, periodically threatens \nthe ability of this salutary system to work to resolve controversies \nbetween Senate committees and witnesses. When the enforcement law was \nenacted, an exception was carved out for privilege assertions by the \nexecutive branch, so that the courts would not be called on to resolve \ndisputes between the two political branches of Government. The drafting \nof that exception left some unfortunate doubt, however, as to its \napplicability when a witness who happened to be employed by the Federal \nGovernment was asserting a personal privilege or objection to a Senate \nsubpoena, not a governmental privilege. The law was never intended to \nexclude such cases from judicial resolution and there is no good reason \nfor so doing.\n  The ambiguity has created questions in some cases as to whether or \nnot the Senate could utilize the civil enforcement mechanism to obtain \njudicial assistance with one of its committees' subpoenas. Even in the \nexample, I described involving Senator Packwood, a question could have \narisen whether, because he was a Senator, and, therefore, a Government \nofficer, the exception precluded judicial enforcement of the Ethics \nCommittee subpoena. Senator Packwood did not make such an argument, and \nthe court did accept jurisdiction over the case.\n  However, the mere possibility of such a jurisdictional issue's \narising creates an impediment to the swift and sure resolution of \ndisputes over the entitlement of Senate committees to information they \nneed. In the context of an important and sensitive ethics \ninvestigation, the risk of such a situation arising in the midst of an \ninvestigation is unacceptable. This bill would clarify section 1365 to \nmake clear that the Senate may authorize committees to go to court to \nresolve subpoena disputes, whether with private individuals or \nGovernment employees, as long as the witness is raising a personal \nprivilege or objection, rather than governmental privilege.\n  The final clarification in the bill involves the congressional \nimmunity statute, 18 U.S.C. section 6005. Senate committees have power \nto confer use immunity, by vote of two-thirds of their membership, to \ncompel witnesses to testify notwithstanding an assertion of Fifth \nAmendment privilege. Committees properly immunize witnesses very \nsparingly, only when they determine that receiving the testimony is \nnecessary to the committee's task and that the possible adverse effect \non future criminal prosecution is tolerable. Following the D.C. \nCircuit's decision in the North case, in particular, committees are on \nnotice that conferral of use immunity to receive testimony in public \nhearings subject to television broadcast may have a dramatic impact on \nthe ability of a prosecution to obtain a conviction for criminal \nwrongdoing. Since the North decision, Senate committees have proceeded \nexceedingly cautiously before agreeing to grant use immunity to a \nwitness.\n\n  There are occasions, nonetheless, when immunity is appropriate and \nnecessary to receive testimony from an essential witness. In such \ncircumstances, committees have properly conferred use immunity. This \nhas happened in the Senate on a total of 10 occasions since the North \ndecision. All but 1 of these instances--that is, 9 times out of the \n10--were in the context of Ethics Committee investigations, when \nimmunity was necessary to obtain information about allegations of \nwrongdoing by a Senator.\n  One of the tools that the Ethics Committee has used in these \ninstances in order to help make sure that there are not adverse \nrepercussions on criminal prosecutions is its authority to receive the \nimmunized testimony in private session, as in staff depositions. \nIndeed, eight of the nine witnesses who were immunized for testimony at \nstaff depositions, not at public hearings. This procedure enables the \nCommittee to receive information that it needs, but to do so in a forum \nthat does not run the risk of spreading a witness' immunized testimony \nacross the nation's television screens.\n  Unfortunately, the technical drafting of the immunity statute has \napparently left a question in some people's minds as to whether the \nSenate's immunity poser extends to authorized staff depositions, or \nonly to committee hearings. This was raised as a serious problem in the \nIran-Contra investigation and any committee that ever seeks to receive \ntestimony under immunity in a deposition runs the risk of the issue \nbeing raised there to block the testimony. The Ethics Committee is the \ncommittee that bears the greatest chance of facing this impediment in \nthe future.\n  Accordingly, this bill contains a very simple, but important, \namendment to make clear that the congressional immunity statute covers \nancillary proceedings, like staff depositions, as well as committee \nhearings. Immunity still would be conferred only on a two-thirds vote \nof the full committee, and would be done so sparingly. However, with \nthis change, there will be no questions that committees would be able \nto compel immunized testimony at staff depositions, rather than being \nforced to receive the testimony in a committee hearing, where it could \npossibly later taint a criminal prosecution.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent the Senate concur in the House \namendment to the Senate amendments.\n\n[[Page S11609]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
