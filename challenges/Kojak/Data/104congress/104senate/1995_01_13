We give You thanks for all the ways \nin which our Nation, and this Chamber reflect Your character. Thank you \nfor all the trials endured, time spent, and effort expended for our \nbenefit in this place. We thank you because we know that none of us can \ndo anything apart from Your sustaining power.\n  Our request this morning is that You would save this Nation from \nlawlessness. We read that righteousness exalts a nation, but that sin \nis a reproach to any people. We confess that we as a people seem to be \nmore concerned about riches than righteousness, more worried about \npoverty than sin, more willing to deny You than to deny self.\n  O Lord, change us for Your glory. In Your mercy entrust this country \nwith material prosperity; but also in Your mercy, we pray that You \nwould not allow us to go on in such prosperity and sin. Give us true \nprosperity of heart and soul.\n  In Your grace make this place an exception to the corrupting pull of \npower. Make this Chamber a shining light, a city set on a hill, filled \nwith men and women who individually, in their dealings with one \nanother, and together in their execution of the public business are \nexamples to us all. Help them so that we may live peaceful and quiet \nlives in all godliness and holiness.\n  We dare to ask for special blessings, and for special help to use \nthose blessings You have already given to us. Bless Your people with \npower entrusted to those who know their own weakness, with rulers who \nare servants, with freedom under God, in the name of Jesus Christ, the \nservant-king, we ask it.

Mr. President, it is my pleasure, as I rise this morning, \nto join my colleagues in support of S. 1, the unfunded mandates bill \nthat Senator Kempthorne and many others have done such great work on. \nIn the recent election, of course, this country and the voters of this \ncountry voted for change, a change in the way that Washington operates, \na change in the way that the Government operates. This bill provides us \nwith one of the first opportunities to deliver that change.\n  It seems to me that, although we will take up a great many specific \nissues throughout this session of Congress, and we should, that \nprobably most important are some of the structural changes that we are \ntalking about--this being included as one of them. Some of the changes \nin procedure will result in the individual issues being changed and \nbeing about the change that voters asked for.\n  Sometimes, I suppose, people at home get a little impatient with the \nidea that we work for procedural changes. But let me suggest that in \norder to bring about continuing change, fundamental change, these \nprocedural changes are the most important thing that we can do--\nprocedural changes like the balanced-budget amendment, which will \nchange our outlook on fiscal responsibility; changes like unfunded \nmandates, which will change the relationship between the Federal \nGovernment and the States; changes like accountability, which we passed \nyesterday, of course, which properly makes the Congress live under \n[[Page S920]] the same rules that it applies to everyone else. Term \nlimits, I believe, are also a procedural change that needs to take \nplace.\n  Unfunded mandates affect State and local communities. They are hidden \ntaxes that local communities, businesses, and citizens have to pay. \nThese mandates force the States and localities to increase their taxes \nor shift their priorities of spending and shift their services in order \nto make those ends meet. National programs should not be financed by \nlocal property taxes, but that is exactly what happens when the \nCongress passes an unfunded mandate. Unfunded mandates infringe upon \nStates' rights. Federal mandates take away State and local community \nopportunities to set their own priorities and make it difficult for \nState and local governments to plan for the future.\n  I served in the Wyoming Legislature, and a good deal of our budget \nwas committed, before we ever arrived in Cheyenne, to unfunded \nmandates.\n  This bill will help restore States' rights and the Founding Fathers' \nconcept of federalism and the relationship that should exist between \nthe Federal Government and the States. We will give some recognition to \nthe 10th amendment, that those things that are not expressly given to \nthe Federal Government should rest with the people and with the States \nand communities. In the words of Thomas Jefferson, ``Were we directed \nby Washington when to sow and when to reap, we should soon want for \nbread.''\n  A simple rule should apply to Congress: If legislation is good enough \nto pass, it ought to be good enough to pay for. The cost of unfunded \nFederal mandates is well documented. Over the past two decades the \nFederal Government has enacted over 200 new laws containing thousands \nof regulations and assigned the costs to State and local government. \nFor example, unfunded mandates eat up about 12 percent of locally \nraised revenue and will cost localities about $54 billion over the next \n5 years.\n  Unfunded mandates, of course, exist everywhere. There are examples in \nWyoming. Wyoming's towns are generally small towns. Greybull, WY, for \nexample, was mandated $1.3 million by EPA for a water treatment plant. \nThat is nearly $3,000 per resident who lives there.\n  Pinedale, WY, draws their water from the cleanest source anyone can \nimagine and the test results of that water are perfectly acceptable in \nquality. Nevertheless, they had to build a water treatment plant, not \nfor the results but because of the unfunded mandates.\n  The city of Cheyenne, $3 million in the last year alone, in the last \nfiscal year.\n  I guess the thing I remember the most was going to the community \ncollege in Torrington, WY, where they had made arrangements to make \ntheir auditorium accessible to disabled people under the Americans With \nDisabilities Act--as they should. However, they had a way to make it \naccessible at very much less cost than what they finally had to do \nbecause of the regulations that were imposed under the mandate. To \nachieve the same goal they had to pay a great deal more.\n  The Clinton administration has a poor record on unfunded mandates. \nPresident Clinton's health proposal, the Brady law, and last year's \ncrime bill are just some examples of this administration's unfunded \nmandate agenda. We need this bill enacted quickly to put the brakes on \nthat regulatory machine.\n  The balanced-budget amendment, of course, will be before us soon. I \nsupport the balanced-budget amendment. I think it is morally and \nfiscally right to not be able to spend more than we take in. That \nshould apply to the Federal Government as well. Local officials, of \ncourse, are concerned about a balanced-budget amendment unless they \nhave the protection against unfunded mandates so that the result of a \nbalanced-budget amendment will not simply be the shifting of costs to \nlocal governments.\n  By requiring activities without paying for them, official Washington \ncan go on a spending spree on somebody else's credit card. It is easy \nand dishonest, but it is a way around the Federal deficit.\n Congress takes the credit for legislation but sidesteps the costs. The \ncombination of these two proposals, unfunded mandates and a balanced \nbudget amendment, will be the answer.\n\n  We need to pass unfunded mandates legislation before we tackle the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Last year, unfunded \nmandates legislation made it out of committee both in the House and in \nthe Senate. I was a member of the Governmental Operations Committee in \nthe House, and in the last days of the session we passed it. \nUnfortunately, it did not receive consideration on the floor.\n  In this new Congress, we have a tremendous opportunity to change the \nway government operates. While this bill is not as strong as some would \nlike it, it is a solid first step in restoring some accountability in \nWashington.\n  The bottom line is that Washington must stop passing the buck and \nstart taking the responsibility for the legislation it passes. It is \nvital that we take advantage of this opportunity to change the way \nGovernment functions.\n  Mr. President, thank you for the time. I yield the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, not seeing any Senator seeking recognition \nat this time, I would like to take a few minutes to comment on the bill \nwe will be taking up again today, the unfunded mandates bill.\n  I want to emphasize again that there will be votes today. I think \nthat the distinguished majority leader intends that we go forward on \nthis important legislation and that there will be votes on amendments \nor otherwise. It is not clear at this time exactly how long that will \ngo. But I just wanted to make sure the Members understood, to be fair, \nthat we will have some votes later on this morning, or perhaps in at \nleast early afternoon.\n  I want to commend our distinguished majority leader and the minority \nleader for the patience they have already exhibited this year. We, I \nthink, have made good progress. We have already passed S. 2, a major \npiece of legislation on congressional accountability. We are already \nnow working on the next piece of major legislation, unfunded mandates. \nMembers have been offering amendments freely, and that is the way it \nshould be in the Senate. I am sure there will be a number of amendments \non this unfunded mandates legislation. Perhaps there will be some good \namendments that will be offered and actively debated, and perhaps even \nsome amendments adopted as we go forward. That is what the legislative \nprocess is all about.\n  I think the majority leader intends to make sure Members have that \nopportunity to offer amendments and have a good debate, and move this \ngood legislation and improve it, if it is possible.\n  There have been objections that reports were not available earlier. \nBut the reports are available now. Any Senator can avail himself or \nherself of those reports. I hope they will read them and that we can go \nforward with the debate on the substance of this legislation. This is a \ngood bill, well prepared over a long period of time. Yeomen's work has \nbeen done by the Senator from Idaho, Senator Kempthorne, and Senator \nGlenn has worked on this legislation, probably for years, and certainly \nat least for months. Senator Roth has done good work.\n  So there has been a tremendous amount of thought given this \nlegislation. It has been changed and improved, and perhaps in some \nrespects weakened because some points go beyond what I would like there \nto be in order to get something with which we can move forward.\n  This is a major step forward. This is setting up a process. This is \nnot ending things that have been happening. This is giving us an \nopportunity to find out what is in a bill, to find out what it is going \nto cost and who is going to pay for it. What does it really do? That \nfact is I think most Americans would be incredulous to realize that we \ndo not do that anyway.\n  So there is no need to delay this. Yes, we should have amendments. We \nshould think about it. But we all know this legislation is going to \npass overwhelmingly. I am sure probably almost every Republican and a \nmajority of the \n[[Page S921]] Democrats will vote for this legislation. So I hope we \nwill keep that in mind. Let us not delay just for the sake of delay. \nLet us look at the substance, let us work on it in a responsible way, \nand then let us move forward because we know it needs to be done and \nbecause we know in the end it is going to pass.\n  Let me just make a couple of points. This legislation will increase \naccountability. It places added responsibilities where it needs to be, \non those who want to either create a new mandate or increase costs of \nan existing one. In order to do that, they are going to have to get an \nestimate of the cost of the new requirement to both State and local \ngovernments and the private sector. I want to emphasize this also \nincludes a way, hopefully, to help control the unfunded mandates on the \nprivate sector.\n  There has been some suggestion that maybe small business might not be \nbenefit by this or might not be all for it. The National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses put out a letter on January 3 on behalf of \n600,000 members of the NFIB, which really represents the small \nbusinessmen and women in my State, and said they support this \nlegislation unreservedly, and it is going to be one of their top-rated \nvotes. So the private-sector small businesses want this. I think they \nwant it not only as businessmen and women, but just as individuals and \nAmericans. They know this needs to be done.\n  So there will be the cost estimates, and then there will be an \nopportunity to waive the requirements by a simple majority. We can \ndebate that point, and I feel we probably will, on whether or not these \nrequirements can go into effect or not.\n  I believe this will lead to more informed decisions. Some allegation \nhas been made--intended, I think, as criticism--that this might once \nagain slow down moving some legislation. I have never seen the Senate \nworry about slowing things down. We are the saucer under the hot cup to \ncool it down. A little more information, a little more deliberation \nbefore we put another mandate on the American people, public or \nprivate, seems to me something we should be doing.\n  The American people want it, and every State in every region, \nregardless of philosophy, even. A lot of the biggest supporters of this \nlegislation are Democrats, liberal Democrats. Elected mayors and county \ncommissioners have to wrestle with this. They have to find a way to pay \nfor it. So, therefore, this is something that is long overdue. I hope \nthe Senate, in its great deliberative fashion, will make sure that all \nof the details are analyzed, but in good time will move it forward. I \nbelieve it will provide relief for State and local taxpayers.\n  More and more and more, the Federal Government has dumped \nrequirements on States that Governors, like the distinguished Senator \nin the chair, the former Governor of Missouri, has had to deal with. He \nknows the extra costs that were put on the taxpayers of Missouri, not \nby the Missouri Legislature, but by the Federal Government, telling \nthat State: You have to do this and, by the way, good luck finding the \nway to pay for it as best you can--not a few thousand dollars, but \nmillions of dollars on every State, big and small, rich and poor.\n  My poor State of Mississippi struggles to deal with these federally \nunfunded mandates. The Governor of our State, Gov. Kirk Fordice, has \npleaded for relief and for flexibility to allow innovation to occur at \nthe State level. They can do it better. They can save money, and they \ncan give relief to the taxpayers. Also, that is true at the local \nlevel. I have had to wrestle in the past as a Congressman and Senator \nwith these Federal mandates that have been dumped on poor, small \ncities, requirements that say: You must do this; you must clean up \nthat; you must provide this service. And in communities sometimes where \nyou have 70 to 80 percent minorities, they just cannot pay for it. So \nthey have said: We want to do it for safety purposes or environmental \npurposes, but we do not have the money. Help us.\n  So I think, at the Federal level, a cost analysis will allow us to \nsee what the cost is going to be and require us, if it is in the \nnational interest, if it is in the interest of safety or environmental \nconsiderations nationwide, to step up to the lick log and pay for it. \nGive them safe drinking water, but help them pay for it. Or, if we are \nnot going to pay for it, do not dump it on them. We make criminals out \nof the elected officials, literally criminals. Good men and women are \nsaying: I cannot do this. We worry about how we attract good people in \noffice. It is things like unfunded mandates that drive them out. You \nget a local insurance agent or local homebuilder. Do you think he or \nshe will want to continue to deal with these Federal mandates and the \ntax increases that are required by them?\n  If we really want to give taxpayers some tax relief in a painless \nway, this is the way to do it, by giving them the opportunity to make \nmore decisions on their own without Federal mandates and without \nincreased local and State taxes.\n  So, Mr. President, I am very pleased that S. 1, the first bill of the \nyear that was introduced, is the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995.\n  I commend all that have been involved with it. I think we are going \nto have good legislation. The risks are small, and the benefits could \nbe great. I hope that early next week, we will move to conclusion.\n  Mr. President, seeing the distinguished Senator from California on \nthe floor, I yield at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

So if the majority whip would like to continue, I am perfectly \npleased.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I have not spoken yet on the floor \nregarding the disaster that has hit my State of California. Senator \nFeinstein was on this floor and brought the Senate up-to-date a couple \nof days ago. I would like to do the same, and then I would like to \nspeak about another very urgent issue regarding safety at reproductive \nhealth care clinics. I see that Senator Feingold has joined me, and he \nwill be participating in that particular discussion.\n  Mr. President, 34 counties have been declared State disaster areas \nand 24 counties have been declared Federal disaster areas, and we \nexpect others to be added shortly. I do not think I have to tell my \ncolleagues that the people in California have, once again, been struck \nby Mother Nature in a very difficult way.\n  We live in a very magnificent State. We treasure it and we prize its \nbeauty--its rivers, ocean, mountains, streams, creeks, forests, and \ndeserts. And because we are such a magnificent State, we just have to \nput up with our share of natural disasters. I want to say, once again, \nto my colleagues how appreciative Californians are for the swift relief \nwe got from the Clinton administration, backed in a very bipartisan way \nby this Congress, and we are rebuilding. Now we have people thrown out \nof their homes because of ravaging floods. The power of that water--\nsomeone described it as a 500-year occasion in some parts of the \nState--is just overwhelming.\n  What we know is that we have a little break in the weather right now. \nI am very anxious to get on a plane and go back and see for myself \nexactly what damage will last after this flood and what we need to do. \nBut today I merely want to bring you up-to-date. Santa Barbara has \nreported $20 million in damage, and Sacramento reports at least $50 \nmillion in damage. The FEMA \n[[Page S922]] emergency phone number is 1-800-462-9029. I say that in \ncase we have any Californians who need to hear that number. The reason \nthat number is important is, if you have damage, you call there and you \nare eligible for short-term emergency assistance, such as \ntransportation and housing, and longer term registration if you need a \nloan up to $200,000, if your home has been lost and its value is that \nhigh.\n  The loans are made to people who cannot qualify at banks, and the \ninterest rate will be about 4 percent. If you can qualify at a bank, \nthe interest rate will be about 8 percent. I want to thank the Clinton \nadministration for acting so swiftly. James Lee Witt, the Director of \nFEMA, unfortunately, has become a familiar figure in our State. He is \nan extraordinary man. He happened to be there during this disaster and \nhas remained there. We are getting ready for what is to come. I urge my \ncolleagues to please help us as we would help you in a similar \nsituation, indeed as we have helped you in a similar situation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/13/senate-section/article/S921-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           UNFUNDED MANDATES\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are debating the unfunded mandates \nbill. I voted it out of the Budget Committee. I am very much in \nagreement with the thrust of the bill. I served in local government and \nwe had some mandates I never could understand.\n  So I am very hopeful that the bill, in its final form, will be good \nfor my State of California. And I want to make it clear, if I think it \nis good for the people of my State, I will be very proud to vote for \nthe bill. But if I see that the bill takes some twists and turns and \nignores, for example, the biggest unfunded mandate we face, which is \nservices to illegal immigrants, then I am going to have a lot of \ntrouble voting for the bill. Therefore, I look forward to the debate.\n  We know that this bill on the issue of unfunded mandates will make a \nbig difference in the way we fund State and local government. But no \nmatter how fast or slowly we move this bill--and there is a push to \nmove this bill fast because it is in the Contract With America and \ntherefore there is a push to move it fast--there is something that is \nhappening right now that we have to address.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/13/senate-section/article/S922-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S922-S924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE CLINIC VIOLENCE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. The unfunded mandates bill will have an impact way down \nthe road, maybe a year or more out. But I want to talk about a problem \nthat is happening now. We have reproductive health care clinics all \nacross this great land and right now we have some very brave people \nworking in those reproductive health care clinics.\n  Why do I say ``brave?'' I do not think any of us could know the \nfeeling that some of these folks have when they leave their house: Will \nthere be a stalker standing outside their house as they go to work to \ndo a legal, legitimate job that helps many people? Do they have to wear \na bulletproof vest-- many doctors do--and will that vest be enough to \nsave their lives?\n  Mr. President, this is a very, very, serious issue. And it has \nnothing to do with how one views the issue of reproductive rights. I \nhappen to be someone who believes in the right to choose, a \nconstitutionally guaranteed right, and until it is outlawed or changed \nit will remain so.\n  I introduced a resolution. My two prime sponsors are here, Senator \nFeingold and Senator Murray; and another very important sponsor, \nOlympia Snowe, Senator Snowe, is from the other side of the aisle. We \nhave been pushing to get a vote on this resolution because, while we \ndebate unfunded mandates that will take effect years into the future, \nright now, this minute, people feel like sitting ducks in clinics in \nrural and urban communities across this country. That is wrong.\n  We passed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. That bill \nsays that it is a crime to injure or to harm anyone because they happen \nto work or volunteer at a clinic. There are approximately 900 clinics \nin the United States providing reproductive health services. But the \nviolence continues every day. We have seen the brutal shootings of \ninnocent people in Massachusetts and the shooting at a health care \nclinic in Virginia. Organizations monitoring this violence have \nrecorded over 130 incidents of violence or harassment last year.\n  I have a bill. We are trying to get that bill brought up as a \nfreestanding bill. It is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution and it calls \non the Attorney General to fully enforce the law and take any further \nnecessary measures to protect persons seeking to provide or obtain, or \nassist in providing or obtaining, reproductive health services from \nviolent attack. There should be no argument about this.\n  I hope that the majority will clear this bill. We have been working \nto get it cleared on a bipartisan basis for the last 3 days. One day, \n``Oh, yes, it is going to be cleared''; the next day, ``Oh, it is going \nto be cleared.''\n  Everyone on our side has no objection. We need to send a signal to \nthe people who work in these clinics that we care. President Clinton \nsent a directive to the Attorney General. She is working on this \nproblem. We need to add our voice. This is not a criticism of the \nAttorney General. It is a push to make sure that President Clinton's \ndirective is carried out.\n  I hope, by the end of this day, we will have this bill before the \nU.S. Senate for a vote and we will add our voice.\n  I yield at this time to my colleague and friend, Senator Feingold.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise very briefly to praise and thank \nthe Senator from California for her leadership on this issue. I am \nvery, very pleased to be a cosponsor of the resolution and the \namendment which is very straightforward.\n  I appreciate the language. It expresses the sense of the Senate that \nthe Attorney General should take strong action to protect reproductive \nhealth care clinics.\n  There is really nothing else to be said, other than that the Senate \nshould pass the resolution authored by the Senator from California. \nThis must be done immediately, and if this Federal Government does not \nexpress that view, it is a sign of a Government that no longer can \nreally protect the people of this country.\n  I think that this demands swift action in this body. There are many \nissues that can be disputed; some obviously should be ones we ought to \ntake a lot of time on. I think we have a couple of them right now. The \nunfunded mandates bill is very complicated; the balanced budget \namendment, amending the Constitution. These require the deliberative \nskills of the U.S. Senate, but this does not.\n  I cannot believe there is any Member of this body on either side of \nthe aisles who believes the Federal Government should do anything but \nbe very aggressive in stopping this violence. Just this past August, \nduring debate over the VA-HUD appropriations bill, Senator Lautenberg \noffered, and I cosponsored, a similar amendment in the wake of the \nshooting of a clinic doctor and his escort in Pensacola, FL. However, \nat that time as now, I believe that the resolve of the Senate in the \nmatter of clinic violence is clear. Ninety-eight Members of the Senate \nvoted to condemn the shootings in Pensacola last August, and indeed, to \ncondemn the use of deadly force as a means of protest. That is why I \nask all of my colleagues to show their strong and united support today \nand lift any objections to the unanimous consent that this item come up \nat this time.\n  There are two reasons that I would like to add. The first is that the \ntype of violence that is involved in these incidents is not truly \nrandom violence. It is random, perhaps, as to where it occurs and at \nwhat time, but it is not just one troubled individual for whatever \npersonal reason who decides they want to kill somebody. This is the \ntype of violence that is driven by an organized effort to deprive \npeople of their reproductive rights and to intimidate them from \nexercising those rights. That is very different. The tactics of some \nindividuals who oppose abortion access have escalated. As Ellen \nGoodman, a syndicated columnist who lives in Boston said in her column, \nthe literal ``line of fire\" is coming closer to home. She writes, \n``First doctors, then escorts, now receptionists. First Wichita, then \nPensacola, now Brookline.''\n   [[Page S923]] That is a direct threat to the rights of every person \nin this country and in particular every women in this country. And it \nis a situation where the Federal Government, not just local \ngovernments, has to take the lead.\n  The other reason I wanted to add very briefly is that I have heard a \ngreat deal of very appropriate talk in this body in the last 2 years \nabout the victims of crime. They are people that have been forgotten in \nthis society. But when it comes to clinic violence, there is quite a \nrange of victims.\n  First of all, of course, the tragic deaths and injuries that have \noccurred directly to the people who have been shot or injured, but \nalso, I think, the health care professionals that are involved and the \npeople involved in the clinics, the receptionists, the nurses and the \ndoctors, some of whom, in my home State of Wisconsin, have taken to \nwearing bulletproof vests to go to their clinics and do their work. \nThree very poignant examples of threats to health care professionals \nwere reported by the Milwaukee Journal and the Wisconsin State Journal. \nBullets were fired into one clinic on four separate occasions. One \nWisconsin doctor is continually stalked. She reported that her car is \nalways covered with anti- choice and threatening propaganda when she \nparks it--even at the supermarket. The remarks are frighteningly direct \nand personal. On her last trip she received a note on her windshield \nupon her return asking ``How was your trip to Washington?'' Another \nWisconsin doctor received a letter saying that the anonymous writer \nwould ``hunt you down like any other wild beast and kill you.''\n  They did not sign up for that kind of detail when they went to \nmedical school or trained to be nurses. They wanted to help people make \na difficult decision and they wanted to be medical professionals who \nwere caring and compassionate. This is a terrible thing to do to these \npeople.\n  But, most of all, the victims are all the young women in this country \nwho already, in situations like this, are confronted with a very, very \ndifficult personal decision. They want counseling and, if they make a \nparticular decision, they want good medical attention. I want to remind \nall in this body, Mr. President, that when Mr. Salvi walked into the \nfirst clinic on Beacon Street on Friday, December 30 and started \nshooting, he was standing in a facility that not only performs \nabortions but also conducts Pap smears and routine gynecological \nexaminations. Each time an abortion clinic is threatened with violence \nnot only are those who seek abortion services in peril, but those who \nuse a wide range of reproductive health service are as well.\n  These people are the true victims, the ultimate victims, who are \nintimidated from exercising their rights as Americans to make those \ndecisions for themselves.\n  And so, Mr. President, I rarely ask this body to move immediately. It \nis not a body that is set up for that purpose. But there are exceptions \nand I think Senator Boxer has identified such an exception. The Senate \nshould pass this resolution without delay. Condemning clinic violence \nshould not be a partisan issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield as much time as is required to the Senator from \nWashington, Senator Murray.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the President. I thank my colleague from \nCalifornia for yielding and for bringing this extremely important issue \nout to the floor of the Senate this morning.\n  The Senator has been diligent in pursuing this and in asking our \ncolleagues to bring this issue forward so that we can get a vote and \nmove quickly forward to let the people of this Nation know that the \nhighest elected officials in this country do not condone violence. We \nwill do everything we can to protect all of our citizens in this \ncountry.\n  Before us we have the unfunded mandate issue. It is an extremely \nimportant and extremely complex issue that we deal with today. However, \nit does raise a number of questions. It will take Members some time to \nmove through that issue. Certainly we have to ask what is the outcome \nof this issue and make sure that, as we pass unfunded mandates, we do \nit in a way that will not bring about consequences that we have not \nasked for.\n  The Senator from California is bringing forward an issue that the \nconsequences are clear. The consequences are the safety of individuals \nin this country, one of the highest priorities that we have. The issue \nof unfunded mandates is critical. But the issue of violence is just as \nimportant, if not more important. The issue of violence is one that \nevery child in this country, unfortunately, understands and talks \nabout. The issue of violence is one that we have to deal with at all \nlevels.\n  I think it is extremely important that this body go on record in this \nNation, now, to say to our kids that we will not condone violence in \nany way, shape, or form. No matter how we feel about the issue of \nchoice, whether we are pro-choice or pro-life, we have to let people \nknow in this country that we will not accept violence as a means of \nshowing how we feel about an issue. We have to protect our citizens.\n  I commend the Senator from California for bringing this issue before \nthe Senate. I sincerely ask all of our colleagues to list their \nobjections so that we can move quickly to send a strong message to this \ncountry that we will back the rights of every citizen and we will not \ncondone violence in this country.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California. I yield back to \nher at this time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may have up \nto 10 additional minutes as long as there is no one on the floor. If a \nSenator appears on the floor, I will end my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to thank my two \ncolleagues who were right there, immediately, when I called them and \nsaid we need action on this bill.\n  I also want to say that the majority leader, Senator Dole, in public \ncomments on this matter, has been very clear that it is a function of \nthis Federal Government to protect the clinics. Now, I ask him to move \nthis bill to the floor. We do not want to wait for another incident.\n  As I said, passage of this bill by the U.S. Senate, a sense of the \nSenate resolution, is essential to make it very clear as to where we \nstand on this issue. By the way, not only do medical professionals work \nat these clinics--and I know my friend from Wisconsin volunteered at \nthese clinics--as we know, we have had volunteer escorts hurt. We had \none case of a retired military person who was shot dead--shot dead. The \nman fought for his country, and he was shot dead in his own country \nescorting a doctor into a clinic.\n  It is a tragedy and a travesty of justice if this continues. So we \nneed to send a message to the people who are exercising their \nconstitutional rights, innocent neighbors of ours. Nurses are our \nneighbors. Receptionists are our neighbors. Doctors are our neighbors. \nEscorts are our neighbors, hard-working men and women who, on the \nweekends when they have time or after work, volunteer their time.\n  We are not only sending a message to them when we pass this \nresolution that we stand for law and order in this society, but we also \nsend a message to those who would even think of picking up a gun or a \ngrenade or the chemicals that they spray underneath clinic doors that \nwe are not going to stand by--that this Attorney General, by the way, \nis not standing by. She has at her disposal some 2,000 members of the \nU.S. Marshals Service and 10,000 FBI agents. She has contacted the U.S. \nattorneys. I know the U.S. attorney for northern California, in San \nFrancisco, was contacted. I spoke with him at length. U.S. attorney \nMichael Yamaguchi is, in fact, formulating a plan using all resources \nat his disposal.\n  Let me tell the Senate an additional reason why this is so important. \nNot only do we need to send a message to the decent people who work or \nvolunteer at these clinics and to the women across this land that we \nprotect them, but we also need to send a message to those who would \nconsider violence or the groups who may not think they are inciting \nviolence. But, when they call \n[[Page S924]] doctors murderers, they ought to rethink it. They ought \nto rethink their language. Anyone can oppose a law. Anyone can work for \nSenators who support their view to outlaw a woman's right to choose. I \nwould absolutely applaud a person for taking their feelings and working \nto change the system. That is what America is about.\n  But we do not take a gun out, or a knife out, and slash each other up \nwhen we disagree. Not in this country, or at least we never did. And we \nare not talking about one incident; 130 incidents of violence \nnationwide in 1994 alone; 50 reports of death threats to doctors and \nother clinic workers; 40 incidents of vandalism; 16 incidents of \nstalking; 4 acts of arson; and 3 attempted bombings.\n  We better say something here in the U.S. Senate. We better say it \nclearly because the message has to get out. If the Attorney General \nfeels that she needs more help, I hope she will let Members know. \nSenator Feingold is on the Judiciary Committee and he stands ready to \nhear. But it is my belief, after talking to the U.S. attorney for \nnorthern California, that they are beginning to put together the type \nof operation they need to make these clinics safe.\n  We have to go on record--Republicans and Democrats alike--that we \nwill not stand by and allow innocent people to be harmed. That is the \nleast that we can do in this circumstance. I look forward to hearing, \nonce more, from the majority leader, whom I have discussed this with \nand from the new chairman of the Judiciary Committee whom I have also \ndiscussed this with, and I want to compliment Senator Olympia Snowe for \nworking with me in the most bipartisan fashion. As a matter of fact, we \nspoke very late last night. We spoke at about 11 last night, and she \nintends to do her part on her side of the aisle to get this bill \ncleared.\n  I hope we will do that today. Frankly, Mr. President, I think it will \nmake us proud to pass this bipartisan bill. I yield the floor. Mr. \nPresident, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/13/senate-section/article/S922-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     A TRIBUTE TO UCONN BASKETBALL\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, in my home State of Connecticut we face many \nchallenges this winter: An economy that is beginning to recover, hopes \nare rising, and still a lot of work to do. But there is one element of \nlife in the State that really has brought us all closer together, and \nthat is the University of Connecticut Huskies basketball teams.\n  Over the last few years, the success of the UConn men's and women's \nbasketball teams have inspired a feverish following that has actually \nearned its own name, which is ``Huskymania.'' Each season, these teams \nbring the State a little closer and make those cold Connecticut winters \nall the more bearable.\n  I know the occupant of the chair has some relatives from Connecticut, \nand he can testify at least to the coldness of the winters.\n  These days, we all feel with great pride that our Connecticut Huskies \nare top dogs. The latest basketball polls nationally show that both the \nmen's and women's teams are ranked second in the country, which is the \nhighest combined ranking of any school in the Nation. I think even the \nmost passionate partisan of some other college team would recognize \nwhat a tremendous accomplishment this is for a school from a State the \nsize of Connecticut.\n  I think it is really a remarkable tribute to the young men and women \nwho have worked so hard in pursuit of excellence and a dream--the \nschool's first national championship in basketball--and to the great \ncoaches who lead them, Jim Calhoun and Geno Auriemma.\n  These Huskies, if I may continue this metaphor, clearly have a bite \nto match their bark. The 11-0 men's team is the only team among the \nNation's 302 Division I schools that has yet to be beaten, and we are \nvery proud of that.\n  It is also worth noting that the Huskies are achieving this \nextraordinary start this year even after losing their All-American big \nman, Donyell Marshall, to the NBA. If I can extend my pride regionally, \nit would be important to note that the UConn men this week are second \nto the University of Massachusetts, which marks the first time that two \nteams from New England have ever been ranked 1 and 2.\n  The UConn women's team, which is also 11-0, has been equally \nimpressive. These Huskies have been ranked second for much of the \nseason, actually beating their opponents by an average of more than 40 \npoints per game. This is a very dominant team. They are led by All-\nAmerican center Rebecca Lobo, who is an exceptional student athlete--\nremarkable athlete--but an extraordinary student as well.\n  So I want to take this opportunity on this particular Friday to \nsalute both teams who, in my opinion, are a classic example of what can \nhappen when you aim high and work hard. I want to congratulate them on \ntheir success. I know that they have a tough road ahead of them from \nnow on, but what they have achieved up until now should not go \nuncomplimented and they should know how much we appreciate them.\n  This Monday, the UConn women will face the No. 1 Tennessee \nVolunteers, and on that same day, the UConn men will get a big test \nwhen they play the 10th-ranked Georgetown team.\n  Regardless of what happens, to say the obvious, the State of \nConnecticut feels that these Huskies are winners. We wish them the best \nof luck as they try to not only fulfill their dreams but ours.\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, since 1983, the United States Congress \nand the German Parliament, the Bundestag, have conducted an annual \nexchange program for staff members from both countries. The program \ngives professional staff the opportunity to observe and learn about the \nworkings of each other's political institutions and convey Members' \nviews on issues of mutual concern.\n  This year marks the fifth exchange with a reunified Germany and a \nparliament consisting of members from all 16 German states. A \ndelegation of staff members from the United States Congress will be \nchosen to visit Germany from May 7 to May 20. During the 2-week \nexchange, most of it will be spent at meetings conducted by Bundestag \nMembers, Bundestag party staff members, and representatives of \npolitical, business, academic, and the media. Cultural activities and a \nweekend visit in a Bundestag Member's district round out the exchange.\n  A comparable delegation of German staff members will visit the United \nStates in July for a 3-week period. They will attend similar meetings \nhere \n[[Page S925]] in Washington and visit the districts of congressional \nMembers over the Fourth of July recess.\n  The Congress-Bundestag Exchange is highly regarded in Germany, and is \none of several exchange programs sponsored by public and private \ninstitutions in the United States and Germany to foster better \nunderstanding of the politics and policies of both countries.\n  The U.S. delegation should consist of experienced and accomplished \nHill staff members who can contribute to the success of the exchange on \nboth sides of the Atlantic. The Bundestag sends senior staff \nprofessionals to the United States. The United States endeavors to \nreciprocate.\n  Applicants should have a demonstrable interest in events in Europe. \nApplicants need not be working in the field of foreign affairs, \nalthough such a background can be helpful. The composite United States \ndelegation should exhibit a range of expertise in issues of mutual \nconcern in Germany and the United States such as, but not limited to, \ntrade, security, the environment, immigrations, economic development, \nhealth care, and other social policy issues.\n  In addition, U.S. participants are expected to help plan and \nimplement the program for the Bundestag staff members when they visit \nthe United States. Participants are expected to assist in planning \ntopical meetings in Washington, and are encouraged to host one or two \nstaff people in their Member's district over the Fourth of July, or to \narrange for such a visit to another Member's district.\n  Participants will be selected by a committee composed of U.S. \nInformation Agency personnel and past participants of the exchange.\n  Senators and Representatives who would like a member of their staff \nto apply for participation in this year's program should direct them to \nsubmit a resume and cover letter in which they state why they believe \nthey are qualified, and some assurances of their ability to participate \nduring the time stated. Applications may be sent to Kathie Scarrah, in \nmy office at 316 Hart Senate Building, by Wednesday, February 15.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/13/senate-section/article/S924-4", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

I am pained to see that the administration \nhas arrived at the stance that the Karadzic Serbs cannot be stopped and \nhave thus conceded to nearly all of their demands. Owing to the fact \nthat yesterday was the 44th anniversary of the Genocide Convention, it \nis an outrage that the administration has allowed the slaughter in \nBosnia to continue to go on.\n  This one-sided approach to the issue is embarrassing and an affront \nto a people who wish only to be free of Serbian attack. The Bosnian \nGovernment asks only one thing of us, a lifting of the arms embargo. \nWhile the Senate has repeatedly tried to do so, the administration \ncontinues to refuse to do this, only worsening the situation. This is \noutrageous.\n  Mr. President, following the Holocaust, the slogan ``Never Again,'' \nbecame a watchword. It was supposed to mean that we would remain \nvigilant to ensure that never again, would an entire population be \nsubjected to extermination. Today, however, this is not the case. \nToday, the watchword seems to be, ``Yes, Again.'' This is very \ndisheartening and it cannot continue.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/13/senate-section/article/S925-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 ON THE RETIREMENT OF WILLIAM J. McCORD\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the service of \nWilliam J. McCord, the Nation's longest-serving director of a State \nalcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment agency. Mr. Jerry \nMcCord is resigning on February 16 after fulfilling a thirty-five year \nmission to build a system in South Carolina that helps citizens avoid \nand defeat the curse of addiction. When he became the first full-time \nemployee of the fledgling State Alcoholism Education Program instituted \nat the start of my Governorship in 1959, none of us knew he would \neventually guide an agency that treats more than 30,000 South \nCarolinians yearly and leads the Nation in its focus on preventing \nalcohol abuse among teens.\n  Jerry McCord has pursued his vision of an addiction-free population, \nnot just within the community of treatment professionals, but on every \nfront. He has taught at both of South Carolina's medical colleges, \nhelped found a nonprofit foundation for drug abuse prevention, and \nreceived the Distinguished Service award from the South Carolina \nCorrectional Association for his work with law enforcement. He has \nfostered a system of county commissions that lets each commission meet \nthe needs of its community, while continually championing a longterm, \nsystem-wide goal of prevention, particularly among the young. In short, \nJerry has dedicated his long and vigorous career to building a \nflexible, longterm system to benefit future generations.\n  In addition to his wide-ranging service in South Carolina, Jerry has \nalways made time to help the Nation find better prevention and \ntreatment policies. His myriad national contributions include \ntestifying before Congress in 1969 to advocate the formation of a \nFederal agency to fight alcohol abuse, serving three terms as president \nof the Alcohol and Drug Problems Association of North America; chairing \nthe Alcohol Policies Project Advisory Board for the Center for Science \nin the Public Interest; serving as president, chairman, and member of \nthe board of directors of the Council of State and Territorial \nAlcoholism Authorities; serving on the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation \nHead Start Partnership to Promote Substance Free Communities; and \ncurrently chairing the Expert Panel of the National Center for the \nAdvancement of Prevention.\n  This service has brought Jerry McCord repeated recognition at the \nnational level, including a Lifetime Career Achievement Award from the \nNational Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors, the \nOutstanding Leadership and Dedication to the Alcohol Field award from \nthe same organization, the First Annual Leadership in Prevention Award \nfrom the National Association of Prevention Professionals and \nAdvocates, and the Outstanding Individual Offering National Leadership \nin the Alcohol and Drug Problems Field Award from the Alcohol and Drug \nProblems Association of North America. And, of course, Jerry has been \nmy tutor on the best direction for Federal policy.\n  Thus, it is with personal pride, but also speaking for those who know \nof his influence in South Carolina and across the country, that I \ncommend Mr. William J. McCord for his generous career and wish him the \nbest in what I am sure will be an active retirement.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/13/senate-section/article/S925-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S925-S927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               S. 2, THE CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto explain to the Senate and my constituents my reason for missing two \nvotes on Friday, January 9. These votes were on two separate amendments \noffered to S. 2, the Congressional Accountability Act.\n  The first amendment, offered by Senator Exon, would have created a \npoint of order against any budget resolution brought before the \nCongress that fails to set forth a glide path to a balanced budget by \nthe year 2002. The amendment would also make out of order any budget \nresolution or amendment to the Budget Act that sets forth a level of \noutlays for fiscal year 2002 that exceeds the level of revenues for \nthat fiscal year. This amendment is printed on page S540 of the \nCongressional Record of January 6, 1995.\n  The second amendment in question was offered by Senator Simon. This \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution called on the Bridgestone/Firestone \nCorp. to reconsider its decision to hire permanent replacement workers \nand return to the bargaining table and bargain in \n[[Page S926]] good faith with the United Rubber Workers of America, the \nrepresentative of their employees. This amendment is printed on page \nS557 of the Congressional Record of January 6, 1995.\n  Mr. President, I was unavoidably absent from the Senate when rollcall \nvotes were held on these two measures on the afternoon of the 9th. \nEarlier that day I felt compelled to leave Washington, DC in order to \ntend to an important family matter. I regret my necessary absence, and \nI would like to explain how I would have voted on these amendments and \nmy thoughts on the substance of the amendments.\n  Before any amendments were offered to S. 2, I decided to vote against \nthe addition of all nongermane amendments that my colleagues might \noffer. As a sponsor of S. 2, I saw the need to move the bill though the \nSenate without the addition of nongermane amendments which would have \nslowed passage of the bill and possibly forced a lengthy and \ncontentious conference between the Senate and the House. I felt it was \nin the interest of the entire Congress that we take quick and decisive \naction on S. 2. I am convinced that the best way for Democrats and \nRepublicans to begin the 104th Congress is by promptly enacting this \nlegislation, which helps restore the American public's confidence in \nour system of governance. I believe that quick enactment of the \nCongressional Accountability Act, which will require Congress to live \nby the same laws it imposes on the rest of the country, will go a long \nway toward achieving that goal. I was concerned that amendment to S. 2 \nwould force a lengthy conference and delay the bill.\n  Had I not felt the need to vote against all amendments to S. 2 in \norder to expedite swift passage, I would have voted in favor of the \nExon amendment to require a roadmap to a balanced budget by the year \n2002. While I wholeheartedly endorse the goal of a balanced budget, I \nhave long been troubled by the fact that we have not come up with a \ncoherent plan that will get us to that goal. As we all know, the devil \nis in the details, and the Exon amendment sought to get at those \ndetails. For this reason, I support the thrust of the Exon amendment, \nand I anticipate Senator Exon will offer it again when the Senate \nconsiders the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to note my support for the thrust of \nthe Simon sense-of-the-Senate resolution. This resolution simply sought \nto express the collective view of the Senate that Bridgestone/Firestone \nshould not replace thousands of its striking workers with permanent \nreplacements. The resolution would have had no binding legal effect on \nthe parties in dispute, but its intent was entirely consistent with the \nNational Labor Relations Act, which requires parties in a collective \nbargaining dispute to negotiate in good faith. The Simon resolution \nasks Bridgestone/Firestone to resume good faith negotiations with its \nstriking employees, and that is a goal I support.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to note that I voted against the \nadoption of many amendments during consideration of S. 2 which I would \nordinarily support. Among these are many of the amendments regarding \ncampaign finance reform and the Levin-Wellstone-Feingold-Lautenberg \namendment regarding a prohibition on gifts to members of Congress and \ntheir staff and full disclosure of lobbyists and their contacts. These \nwere worthy measures which I have supported in the past, and I note \nthat the majority leader has indicated he would bring to the Senate \nfloor legislation prohibiting gifts and requiring full disclosure of \nlobbying, as well as comprehensive campaign finance reform in the early \nmonths of this 104th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my \ncolleagues who were instrumental in passage of the Congressional \nAccountability Act. Senator Grassley deserves enormous credit for his \ntireless efforts to build support for this legislation and his skilled \nstewardship of this bill on the Senate floor over the past week. Since \nthe later years of the last decade my friend from Iowa has reminded \nthis body on a continual basis that it cannot continue to maintain a \ndouble standard which is offensive to the public and injurious to our \nsystem of governance. Our success is due in large part to his \nlongstanding commitment to this legislation. It was a privilege to work \non this bill with him, both last year on our bill S. 2071, and on this \nyear's version, S. 2.\n  I would also like to thank Senator John Glenn, who moved this bill \nthrough the Governmental Affairs Committee in the 103d Congress and \ncontinued his work on this bill in the 104th Congress as the Democratic \nfloor manager of S. 2. Like Senator Grassley, Senator Glenn's \nsuccessful effort in the past week to move this bill through the Senate \nwas the culmination of many years of work. Beginning in 1978 my friend \nfrom Ohio introduced legislation seeking to bring Congress under the \nsame employment laws it imposes on the private sector, and so I see \npassage of this bill as the happy culmination of many years of work on \nthe part of Senator Glenn. I would also like to note that immediately \nfollowing Senate passage of S. 2, Senator Glenn proceeded to serve as \nthe floor manager for the unfunded mandates bill. Acting as floor \nmanager for one bill is difficult enough. Acting as floor manager for \ntwo complex pieces of legislation in immediate succession is a \nchallenge that most Senators never face, and so I would like to commend \nSenator Glenn for his stamina, good humor, and willingness to tackle \ntwo intricate pieces of legislation at once.\n  Mr. President, I should also mention my colleagues, in the House who \noriginated this legislation. Congressman Christopher Shays, my friend \nand colleague from Connecticut, was the original author of the \nCongressional Accountability Act. He has been tireless in his advocacy \nof this legislation, and I would like to praise him for moving his bill \nthrough the House of Representatives not only last year, but also again \non the first day of the 104th Congress. I offer him my congratulations \non his great success.\n  Last among my colleagues I would like to thank the majority leader, \nSenator Dole, for giving this bill privileged consideration as the \nfirst bill brought to the Senate floor in the 104th Congress. I believe \nthe majority leader wisely saw that quick passage of this bill could \nhelp restore the public's faith in Congress and the ability of our two \npolitical parties to work together again, and I offer him my sincere \nthanks for choosing to designate the Congressional Accountability Act \nas S. 2.\n  Finally, I would like to thank all the staff who worked tirelessly on \nthis legislation. I would like to thank Melissa Patack, formerly of \nSenator Grassley's staff, who worked with my staff to formulate the \nfirst bill, S. 2071, which Senator Grassley and I authored in the 103d \nCongress. I would also like to thank Frederick S. Ansell of Senator \nGrassley's staff, who worked many long hours over the holidays to \nfinish preparation of the bill for floor action in early January. This \nwas an extremely demanding task, and I thank Fred for his sacrifice, \npatience, and good humor.\n  I would also like to thank Lawrence B. Novey of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. Larry worked many weekends and late nights in the \n103d Congress to coordinate the committee's\n hearings on this legislation, organize a markup, draft the committee \nreport, and ready the bill for floor consideration in October. The bill \nthe Senate passed on Wednesday is based largely on the committee-passed \nbill, so it is fitting that we recognize Larry's enormous contributions \nto the bill. Larry also spent many long hours over the holidays \npreparing the bill for floor action, and we are clearly the benefactors \nof his commitment, wide knowledge, and legal skill.\n\n  My thanks also go to Michael Fox and Peter Carson of Congressman \nShays' staff, who first began work on the Congressional Accountability \nAct and produced H.R. 349, the very first version of the bill. By \naggressively seeking a wide, bipartisan group of cosponsors and the \nconsent of the House leadership in the 103d Congress, Peter and Michael \nassisted Congressman Shays in laying the political foundation of this \nbill, and made it that much easier for my staff to do the same in the \nSenate.\n  Before concluding, I would like to offer many thanks to our Senate \nLegal Counsel, Michael Davidson, and his assistant counsel, Claire M. \nSylvia. Mike and Claire provided invaluable counsel \n[[Page S927]] on a variety of matters, ranging from technical drafting \npoints to constitutional issues surrounding this legislation. As \nalways, their counsel was sound, impartial, and imbued with the wisdom \nand insight of a first-rate legal team. In addition to the gratitude \nthat Senator Grassley and I owe Michael and Claire, I believe the \nSenate and indeed, the entire Congress, is indebted to them, because \ntheir counsel has improved the substance of this legislation so \ngreatly. Michael Davidson and his staff are a great credit to the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Fred Richardson and John Nakahata of \nmy staff for their dedication to enactment of this bill. I know that \nthe Senate's approval of this legislation on January 11 was \nparticularly meaningful to both of them, but for very different \nreasons. For Fred I know it was a very happy coincidence that final \npassage of the Congressional Accountability Act came on his birthday, \nafter nearly 2 years of work and countless drafts of the legislation. \nFor John, it is with a mixture of deep personal regret and real \nhappiness for John that I note that the day of final passage for S. 2 \nwas also John's last day of service in the Senate.\n  While I am very happy to see John advance his career and new \nchallenges at the Federal Communications Commission, it is with deep \nsadness that I see John leave my staff. John's energy, intellect, and \nreputation for unfailing professionalism is well known in the Senate, \nand his departure is a great loss to me and my staff. He will be deeply \nmissed. But I am very pleased that John's final day happened to \ncoincide with passage of this legislation to which he devoted so much \ntime and energy. John's imprint can be found throughout the text of the \nbill and in the history of its movement through the Senate, and so I \nhope he leaves the Senate with S. 2 as a memento to his talents, \nenergy, and understanding of the institution, and also with a sense of \nclosure and success on a very complex and important piece of \nlegislation. Thank you, John, for your years of service and your \ninvaluable work on the Congressional Accountability Act.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/13/senate-section/article/S925-4", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S927-S928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 1, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1) to curb the practice of imposing unfunded \n     Federal mandates on States and local governments; to \n     strengthen the partnership between the Federal Government and \n     State, local and tribal governments; to end the imposition, \n     in the absence of full consideration by Congress, of Federal \n     mandates on State, local, and tribal governments without \n     adequate funding, in a manner that may displace other \n     essential governmental priorities; and to ensure that the \n     Federal Government pays the costs incurred by those \n     governments in complying with certain requirements under \n     Federal statutes and regulations, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Committee amendment on page 15, line 6.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the committee \namendment on page 15, line 6.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, we have begun a good discussion on S. 1, a bill that \nis designed to realign federalism so that our State and local partners \nrealize that they are indeed partners and not special interest groups \nthat are out there. It also pays attention to the private sector so \nthat we will know as a decisionmaking body the cost and the impact of \nthese mandates before we vote to impose them. Of course, it provides \nfor a waiver so that if we choose to take some altered course we may do \nso.\n  It enhances our decisionmaking ability. As a result of many hours of \ndiscussion yesterday where we talked about this, a number of Senators \nwere able to address some of their points and the support that they \nhave for this bill. Some raised concerns of specific aspects of that \nbill. But as a result of that, we realize that reporters all across \nAmerica are beginning to truly focus on this issue by calling the city \nhalls and county courthouses and the school districts in their regions. \nAnd they are asking the mayors and the county commissioners, ``What \nabout these unfunded mandates? Is this truly a problem and can you give \nus some examples?'' So the stories are starting to come forward of what \nthese unfunded Federal mandates are, which are hidden Federal taxes.\n  In today's USA Today, for example, is a good story talking about \nColumbus, OH, and the unfunded Federal mandates. Really Columbus, OH, \nis one of those cities--Mayor Gregory Lashutka is not only an effective \nmayor but a good friend of mine--one of the first cities to document \nthese unfunded Federal mandates. It has become a good source of \ninformation for many of us.\n  I received in the mail, also, Mr. President, a letter. Because we \ntalked about the cities, the counties, and the States, we referenced \nthe schools. But I think this helps make the point about the impact on \nthe schools.\n  This is a letter from James B. Appleberry, president of the American \nAssociation of State Colleges and Universities, and C. Peter Magrath, \npresident, National Association of State \n[[Page S929]] Universities and Land-Grant Colleges. I would like to \njust read a couple of statements that they make in their letter dated \nJanuary 6.\n\n       We write on behalf of the institutions----\n\n  --Which I just referenced.\n\n     in support of S. 1, the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995. \n     Together AASCU and NASULGC represent virtually all of the \n     nation's public four year colleges and universities, \n     enrolling more than 5.5 million students.\n\n  They go on to cite that:\n\n       Our associations have a long-standing public policy \n     position of discouraging congressional efforts to pass \n     legislation that imposes unfunded Federal mandates on the \n     states. We know that Federal mandates are generally for \n     worthy purposes, but our concern rests on the fact that \n     Federal mandates diminish a State's ability to address its \n     own priorities.\n\n  They go on to point out the reduction that they have experienced in \nfunding at the State level. They say:\n\n       In recent years, states have been forced to divert scarce \n     discretionary dollars from vital state programs in order to \n     comply with new Federal directives. Public higher education, \n     funded primarily from state discretionary funds, is one of \n     those areas where State appropriations have been severely \n     diminished as a result of newly mandated federal initiatives. \n     Since 1982, financial support of higher education from State \n     and local funds has dwindled from 7.6 percent of all revenues \n     to 6.2 percent in 1993. When inflation and decreased State \n     funding are taken into account, higher education's purchasing \n     power has dropped by $7.7 billion since 1990.\n       This reduction in funding is not happening because the \n     states have stopped valuing higher education, but rather \n     because unfunded Federal mandates have dried up all sources \n     of a State's discretionary revenue. The main response to \n     depleting state of discretionary funds available to public \n     colleges and universities has been to cut services and raise \n     tuition. The subsequent tuition increases force students is \n     to either borrow greater amounts or to forgo a postsecondary \n     education.\n\n  This is at the heart of the education of this Nation, but because of \nthese unfunded Federal mandates, the end result may be that students \nare forgoing postsecondary education, students who would like to \ncontinue in their educational opportunities.\n  What about the children at the elementary and secondary grade level? \nThis is the letter dated January 11, 1995, from Boyd Boehlje, who is \nthe president of the National School Boards Association. They state \nthat:\n\n       The National School Boards Association, on behalf of the \n     more than 95,000 locally elected school board members \n     nationwide, strongly supports S. 1, ``The Unfunded Mandate \n     Reform Act of 1995\" and urges you to reject all weakening \n     amendments.\n\n  They go on to say that:\n\n       S. 1 will bring an open, accountable, and informed \n     decisionmaking process to future proposals and regulations \n     that impact school districts and other local and State \n     governments. School districts in your state need the \n     protection.\n\n  He says:\n\n       The bill is reasonable, workable, and long overdue. It has \n     our strongest support, and needs to move through the process \n     without weakening amendments.\n       Today, school children throughout the country are facing \n     the prospect of reduced classroom construction because the \n     Federal Government requires, but does not fund, services or \n     programs that local school boards are directed to implement. \n     School boards are not opposed to the goals of many of these \n     mandates, but we believe that Congress should be responsible \n     for funding the programs it imposes on school districts. Our \n     Nation's public school children must not be made to pay the \n     price for unfunded federal mandates.\n\n  Strong statements, Mr. President, from leaders of elementary, \nsecondary, as well as the universities of this Nation pointing out the \nimpact of unfunded Federal mandates on our children and on our students \nof this country.\n  Mr. President, we have received the committee reports, one from the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, the other from the Budget Committee. \nThey have now been presented to Members of the Senate. They have been \npublished. I know this was a concern of the Senator from West Virginia. \nSo again, that has been taken care of so that all Senators have the \nopportunity to examine them.\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, because the reports are now in \nSenators' hands, I ask unanimous consent that the Republican planing \ncommittee amendments be considered, en bloc, agreed en bloc, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table with the following \nexceptions: the amendment on page 25, the amendment on page 27, and the \namendment on page 33; I further ask unanimous consent that all adopted \ncommittee amendments be considered as original text for the purpose of \nfurther amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if I might, \nI want to compliment our distinguished friend from Idaho for his long-\ntime commitment to the goals and to the premises that this piece of \nlegislation represents. But I think, Mr. President, it needs to be said \nthat this is a far-reaching, a very, very far-reaching piece of \nlegislation.\n  It is the most far-reaching piece of legislation that this body, the \n104th Congress of the U.S. Senate, has yet considered.\n  Mr. President, I sat through, the other morning, a very extensive \ndebate in the Committee on Governmental Affairs relative to this \nparticular piece of legislation. And in that committee, there were two \nissues that very much concerned me, two issues that I am afraid, at \nleast for the moment, at that time were disposed of. One of those \nissues was a vote taken by the committee relative to a committee \nreport. That committee report, by the way, as the Senator from Idaho \nhas now demonstrated, has been filed. We have that particular report \nfrom the Committee on Governmental Affairs. However, the committee at \nfirst voted not to accompany this bill with a committee report.\n  I want to compliment my friend from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, who \nhas in the last 2 days--in my opinion, justifiably so--requested, \nbefore this measure be considered, a committee report from the other \ncommittee of jurisdiction, which is the Committee on the Budget. In my \nopinion, even though I am a member of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, the Budget Committee report is more meaningful to this \nparticular bill than the Governmental Affairs Committee report.\n  The Budget Committee has now made its report. It has been given to \nthe Senate, but only in the past few hours. This morning, we received \nthis particular report on the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. We \nnow have the report. I must say, and tell my colleagues that it is no \nnews that since 10 o'clock, we have been in a meeting with Mr. \nGreenspan, Alan Greenspan, relative to the financial and economic \ncrisis in Mexico. That has consumed most of our morning. We have been \nin recess most of this Friday morning, I might add. I do not know how \nmany people have had the opportunity, I respectfully submit, to look at \nthis particular committee report.\n  Finally, I think the issue of a sunset of 3 years, which was left \nunresolved by the Committee on Governmental Affairs, is an issue that I \nthink needs to be addressed as we proceed with this bill. A measure of \nthis far-reaching impact and consequence is a measure which, in my \nopinion, at this time needs a careful consideration of a sunset \nprovision, where all of this measure would sunset at the end of 3 \nyears, in order to afford the Congress --the House and Senate--the \nmayors, Governors, and all of us who are involved in this vast \nrestructuring process, the opportunity to see if we have made the right \nor the wrong decision, and to see if we need to make changes in this \nparticular concept that we have brought to this great country of ours.\n  So with that being said, Mr. President, I have reserved the right to \nobject, and I have not entered an objection. I see the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia; and I see the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan, who has been very much involved in the formation of this \nparticular legislation.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I must begin by saying that Senator \nKempthorne came to my office earlier and showed me this request. I am \nmuch impressed with this Senator. He is a decent, fine Senator who \nwants to move on with this bill. He is certainly extending every \ncourtesy and every cooperation that one could expect. I applaud him for \nthat.\n   [[Page S930]] As to the request itself, I was supplied this morning \nwith a copy of the report by the Committee on the Budget. I had said \nyesterday a number of things; perhaps I should repeat some of them. I \nsaid, first of all, that I am not taking on the role of traffic cop. \nThat is somebody else's job. It is not my job to be a traffic cop. Then \nthey say: Why, Senator Byrd, are you up here? Why are you here being a \ntraffic cop yesterday and today?\n  If that is the role I am being perceived as playing, I should say \nthat this is a massive bill. I am not for it; I am not against it. I do \nnot know where I am on this bill. I have not had an opportunity to \nstudy a committee report, although the committee report that was \naccompanying the bill which came from the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs was available yesterday.\n  I was on the floor all day and into the evening. I personally have \nnot had any opportunity to read that. I never had any opportunity to \nread the bill. That is nobody's fault that I had no opportunity to read \nthe bill. But I was not aware that the bill the Senate was going to act \non would be the bill reported out of the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs. I had read about a Budget Committee bill, and I also had read \nthat the minority--meaning the Democrats on that committee--had not \nbeen permitted to have a committee report in which they had hoped to \nexpress individual views or minority views, or whatever.\n  I have always stood for the rights of the minority. When I was in the \nmajority, I stood for the rights of the minority. I stood for the \nrights of the minority just recently, when there was the effort to \nmodify the filibuster rule. I have been in the minority; I have been in \nthe majority. So I have had some experience in both situations.\n  I have also been a Member of the House, a long time ago, and there \nwas a reason for the constitutional Framers' decision to have two \nHouses, each with a particular role to play in its sphere of action. I \nhave never been very convivial with respect to making the U.S. Senate a \nsecond House of Representatives. I want the Senate to remain what it \nis; namely, the premier upper body in the world today. Two reasons \nbeing--among others--that we have the right to offer amendments here, \nas long as we want to offer amendments and feel the need to offer \namendments; also, that we have unlimited debate, which can only be \nproscribed by cloture motion agreed to or by unanimous-consent \nagreements.\n  So I felt that the minority--in this case, on the Budget Committee--\nhad a right to ask for a report, as I stated yesterday, so that the \nwhole record would be clear. As I stated earlier, every bill or \nresolution that comes to the floor does not necessarily have to have a \ncommittee report. There are a lot of minor bills that come to the floor \nand there are often no committee reports accompanying those bills. \nNobody raises any fuss about that. But this is not a minor bill. I do \nnot know what is in the bill, but I know enough about this bill to know \nit is no minor bill.\n  I have read that it is part of the Contract With America. I do not \nknow what the Contract With America states. I have read that there is \none, but I have not read it. Well, some would say: Why have you not \nread it? Well, I have never read the Democratic platform. I have been \nin politics now going on 49 years, and I have never yet read a \nDemocratic platform. Why? Because I did not have any part in writing \nthat platform. I am going to be guided by my own conscience and by the \nfacts in a given situation, not by some party platform.\n  I do not read party platforms; do not expect ever to read a party \nplatform. Why waste my time on a party platform? I have my own platform \nto deal with my conscience and try to do what is right and best as I \nsee it for the Nation, for my State, for the U.S. Senate, this \ninstitution, and for my fellow man.\n  There are a couple of things that even supersede those. My dedication \nto my family and my Maker--and I am not of the religious right or the \nreligious left. I do not claim to be a religious man, but I have some \nvery definite ideas concerning religion and concerning the fact that I \nam going to have to meet my Maker one day and live in eternity. I \nbelieve that.\n  Eternity is a long time. Would Senators like to know how long \neternity is?\n  I take this handkerchief in my hand. Let us suppose that a bird flew \nover Mount Everest carrying this handkerchief--once a minute--drawing \nthis handkerchief across Mount Everest, just as I am drawing it across \nthis microphone--and that that bird could live forever. When Mount \nEverest had been worn down to a level with the sands of the sea, by a \nbird dragging that handkerchief across the top of Mount Everest, \neternity would have just begun.\n  I have some pretty strong opinions, but I am no religious rightist \nand I am no religious leftist. And I resented it when Joycelyn Elders--\nwhose nomination I opposed--was reported to have made some snide \ncomments about Christians.\n  No man is good. We all sin.\n  But I have some strong beliefs. I will not have anything other than \nthe King James version of the Bible in my House. Why? Because that is \nthe book that my foster mother and father read. I grew up with the King \nJames version and I will stay with that version until I am laid beneath \nthe sod.\n  I say all of that to say this. I have not signed any Contract With \nAmerica, and I have not read it. But there is a great rush around here, \nthere is a great stampede to enact the contract within the first 100 \ndays.\n  I did not sign any Contract With America. I may like some parts of \nit. I may not. I am not a signatory.\n  I know that our distinguished leader, Mr. Dole, with whom I have \nworked many years here in various capacities, is under pressure. I am \nnot saying that he does not believe in the so-called Contract With \nAmerica. I have not discussed it with him. But he is under great \npressure. He is under pressure from the other body. That steamroller \nover there across the Capitol is coming our way.\n  And that Speaker, in my judgment, has more power than any Speaker \nsince Sam Rayburn, under whom I served when I was in the House. I was \nalso in the House when Joe Martin was Speaker.\n  But I am sure that Senator Dole is also under pressure from people \nwithin his own ranks. So I try to understand--because I have been down \nthat road--I try to understand his problems. And I can understand why \nhe wants to move on to get this work done. I congratulate him for \nbringing in the Senate here during days when ordinarily we might have \nexpected to be out following the swearing in of Senators. I applaud \nthat.\n  I am glad he has kept us in. We ought to be here. We ought to be here \ndebating this bill. We ought to know what is in this bill.\n  I am an old-time Senator, and I am also a brand-new model.\n  I say that I want to know how badly my State is going to be hurt by \nthis so-called contract, if it is passed.\n  We have all this push to get these bills through, ram them through \nthe Senate and House. What happened in the Budget Committee, I would \nassume, was an effort to get the bill to the floor in a hurry. The \nmajority leader had asked to get those bills out of committee as soon \nas possible, which is a reasonable request. I understand that the \nchairman said, ``Well, we are going to get this out and we are not \ngoing to have a committee report.''\n  Well, it came out without a committee report. And then we were told, \n``Well, the statement is in the Record. The committee report is no \ndifferent from the statement, so read the statement. Why wait on the \ncommittee report? All you are going to get in that committee report is \nthat statement, plus this page,'' which says, ``Unfunded Mandate Reform \nAct of 1995, Report of the Committee on the Budget.''\n  Well, that is not quite the case. The statement is not exactly like \nthe committee report. I understand that Mr. Exon's views had not been \nincluded in the statement, at least that is what I understood Mr. Dole \nto say last night.\n  But, be that as it may, there are many other reasons why we need a \ncommittee report. And I can explain a few of those reasons later.\n  But, for now, I said I want to be a reasonable man. And I feel that I \nam on legitimate, solid ground when I ask for a committee report.\n   [[Page S931]] Why should I be up here asking for a committee report? \nI have a responsibility as a Senator. I want to protect my State.\n  I voted against the so-called Coverage Act, the only Senator to vote \nagainst it. I had good reasons. If Senators are still around here long \nenough, they will all understand some of those reasons. If Senators \nstay around here long enough, they will understand the kind of \nstraitjacket the legislation will put the Senate into. I alone, voted \nagainst that bill and have no apologies.\n  But I am saying to my friends on both sides of the aisle, just \nbecause the House has rules that will allow it to ram bills through, \ndoes not mean that the Senate has to roll over and play dead. Let \nMembers slow down a little bit here. This is only the 13th day of \nJanuary, Friday the 13th. This is early in the session. We are not up \nagainst the fiscal year deadline. We are not up against a deadline to \nraise the debt limit. We are not up against any emergencies this \nmorning. We will have, possibly, an emergency supplemental come along \none day, but this bill is not an emergency bill. We have some time. Let \nMembers slow down and look at what is in this bill. That is, as I see \nit, my duty as a Senator.\n  It sparked my notice when I heard that the minority on the Senate \ncommittee had been denied the right to file minority views in a \ncommittee report. It kind of got the adrenalin flowing; stimulated my \nblood pressure just a bit. So I came to the floor yesterday and \nsuggested we have a committee report and an opportunity to study it a \nlittle bit so we could better understand what we are being asked to \nvote on. I have not yet had an opportunity to study that committee \nreport. I know that the distinguished majority leader, when he comes to \nthe floor, has the first right of recognition, which he should have. \nHis party also has the chair, which I insist on.\n  The new Senators who are presiding are doing an excellent job. They \nare paying attention. They are not up there reading or signing mail. \nThere used to be a telephone behind the Presiding Officer's chair. \nSenators would be in the chair and they would talk on the telephone. \nWhen I became majority leader, I took that telephone out.\n  Mr. President, is there something the Chair wishes to say?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Iowa?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. President, am I recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  The minority does not have a right to that chair. If Republicans are \nin the majority, they should have that chair, and vice versa. So, when \nfriends have asked, ``Do you not think it would be a good thing to \nshare the chair,'' I said, ``No.''\n  The majority leader, when he comes to the floor, will have that arrow \nin his quiver--the arrow--of first recognition. I may not have another \nchance today to say a few words on this.\n  Mr. President, the first item of legislation passed by this Congress \nwas S. 2, the Congressional Accountability Act. The Senate now has \nunder its consideration S. 1, the so-called unfunded mandates bill. \nWhen I think about the paradoxical effects of those two bills, I \nsincerely hope I am not the only one to marvel at the utter \ninconsistency of what we see going on.\n  On the one hand, when the Senate passed S. 2, it agreed to apply to \nthe Congress and its employees many of the same worker protection and \nenvironmental safety laws currently enjoyed by the rest of the Nation. \nYet here we are today debating the unfunded mandates bill, which, if \nenacted, could turn right around and endanger many of those same \nprotections.\n  In principle, I am not opposed to the idea of requiring congressional \nfunding for programs that we enact. I agree that in some cases we have \npassed along to the States the cost of increased benefits that we knew \nwe could not fund. But dealing with the problem on a case-by-case \nbasis, which I believe is a prudent course, is a completely different \napproach from that which we have in this bill. The plain truth is, Mr. \nPresident, the approach taken by S. 1 seems to me, at this point and \nuntil I have a better understanding of it, a little bit like using an \nelephant gun on a squirrel hunt.\n  As currently drafted, if I listen to my colleagues and some of the \nstaff around here, and as I understand it--and I want to verify this--I \nfear that the bill may be too broad a solution to the problem. The \nanswer to unfunded mandates is not going to be found through enactment \nof legislation that may irreparably quash important health, \nenvironmental, and quality-of-life measures already on the statute \nbooks.\n  I know that a good many Senators have problems with the Clean Air \nAct. When I was majority leader I would not bring it up. I had a lot of \nSenators on my side of the aisle, including the former majority leader, \nMr. Mitchell, very much a supporter of that act. When I was majority \nleader I would not bring it up. As majority leader, I did not feel that \nI necessarily had to bring up every bill that some colleague on this \nside of the aisle wanted. I did not bring it up.\n  I ended up voting against the Clean Air Act. It had some good things \nin it and some things I did not like. Of course, the Senate took the \nhill country boy from West Virginia and ran over him.\n  I had an amendment which was called the ``coal miner's amendment.'' I \nhad the then majority leader, Mr. Mitchell, against me, and I had the \nthen minority leader, Mr. Dole, against me, and I had the President \nagainst me. I had to go up against that vast array of formidable \npersons who were opposed to my poor little old coal miner's amendment.\n  But I worked hard, and I managed almost to win the fight. My problem \nwas that three Senators who had committed to vote with me did not vote \nwith me but voted against me. So I lost my amendment by 1 vote.\n  You might call that Clean Air Act an unfunded mandate. I voted \nagainst it. Many Senators here today who want this unfunded mandates \nlegislation voted for that bill. They voted for that bill, and they \nhave voted for most of the legislation--most of the legislation--that \nthey now refer to as unfunded mandates legislation. Various Senators \nwho are now pushing hard for this bill, voted for what is now attacked \nas unfunded mandates laws.\n  So I say, again, the answer to unfunded mandates is probably not \ngoing to be found through enactment of legislation that may irreparably \nquash important health, environmental, and quality-of-life measures \nalready on the statute books.\n  Incidentally, I should alert my colleagues that there will be votes \ntoday. I hope that they do not leave under any impression or false hope \nthat, now that I have the floor, I will be talking the rest of the day \nand the night. I do not intend to do that. I am not filibustering this \nbill. I am sure the majority leader will have a vote or two at some \ntime.\n  I want my colleagues to be fully aware of that. This is not one of \nthese Fridays we have become accustomed to around here in which we show \nup for an hour, and go out early. The custom that has grown up around \nhere is, we get an agreement to finish up everything next Tuesday and \nwe will not be in session on Friday. We need more debate around here, \nnot less. But this is not one of those Fridays in which we will vote by \n10:30 and then hie away to the four winds.\n  To my colleagues, I say we better learn how to be a minority again. \nThe Senators over here on this other side of the aisle know how to act \nas a minority. I am going to tell you another bit of news: They also \nknow how to operate as a majority. You watch that leader over there. He \nwill not hesitate to use the rules. He will not hesitate to rock the \nboat.\n  I have to kind of get used to being in the minority again.\n  We do not need to put the Family and Medical Leave Act or the \nNational Voter Registration Act or the OSHA Reform Act or the Clean \nWater Act, among others, on the chopping block in an effort to solve \nthe problem of unfunded mandates.\n  In saying that, may I say that I have some sympathy with efforts to \ndeal with these unfunded mandates. But this legislation would do that \nprecisely, put them on the chopping block in an effort to solve the \nproblem of unfunded mandates.\n   [[Page S932]] Any time one of those programs or any one of almost \n200 other such mandates currently tracked by the National Conference of \nState Legislatures is reauthorized or amended, they could be put in \njeopardy.\n  Mr. President, I am well aware that there are those in the Senate who \nwould like to accomplish that goal, the goal of rolling back what has \npreviously been accomplished. Some of what has previously been \naccomplished, I would like to roll back, but I am not sure that this \nbill, until I understand it better, is the way to do it.\n  For some--not all, of course, but some--this bill appears to me, from \nlistening to others and some of those who have even ``whispered in my \near,'' I get the impression that the bill is simply a back-door way of \ngutting progressive legislation enacted over the past several years. I \nam not saying all the legislation that has been passed in the last \nseveral years has been progressive. I voted against some. Some may say \nthe bill we passed earlier this week is progressive legislation, S. 2. \nI did not think so. I voted against it.\n  If that is what they want to do, then come forward and say so. Bring \na bill to the floor that would repeal the minimum wage law. Bring a \nbill to the floor that would repeal the regulations relating to toxic \nwaste disposal. If that is the agenda, bring a bill to the floor that \nrepeals it. Lay it out on the desk in open view. Let us debate the \nmerits of one of those bills if that is the intention of some. But we \nshould not continue on this headlong rush to pass legislation whose \nimpact is not completely known.\n  I am also concerned, as I listen to members of my staff, that S. 1 is \nsimply impractical in its method of addressing the problem. The \nrequirements placed on congressional committees and the Congressional \nBudget Office are totally unworkable. Now that is what I understand in \ntalking to Jim English, who is the former director of the \nAppropriations Committee staff in the Senate, and others. I consider \nthem the experts. I understand from them that the requirements placed \non congressional committees and the Congressional Budget Office are \ntotally unworkable. As an example, they point to the need of every \npiece of legislation reported out of an authorizing committee to \ninclude a report on the aggregate cost of that legislation to State, \nlocal, and tribal governments. Well, at least if we ever pass this \nlegislation as it is we will get committee reports. We will not have \nthat problem again. We will get committee reports that have minority \nviews in it.\n  Mr. President, there are more than 80,000 governmental units in this \ncountry--80,000. How in the world is CBO going to survey each and every \none of those organizations in their effort to determine a program's \ncost?\n  The fact is that it cannot be done. Dr. Reischauer, the Director of \nthe Congressional Budget Office, even stated as much in a letter last \nmonth to our colleague who is in the Chamber, Senator Levin. Dr. \nReischauer said it would be ``very difficult, if not impossible, to \ndetermine with precision'' the required cost estimates.\n  Mr. President, I have an impulse to suggest the absence of a quorum \nand make it a live quorum. I am not doing that yet, but why should I \nnot do it? Here we are, debating this very important bill. We have only \nfive Senators in the Chamber, including the Senator in the chair.\n  Why are Senators not here talking about this bill, explaining it? I \nwill sit down and listen to anyone who wants to explain the bill or the \namendments. I will be happy to have anyone explain the amendments. I \ndesire that somebody come and explain this bill and answer questions \nabout it.\n  I know I am not the only Senator, other than the four who are in the \nChamber besides me, who does not understand this bill.\n  Estimating the costs of various proposals on a State-by-State basis \nrequires very detailed and comprehensive information on the issue under \nstudy. Such data are needed for each State, local, or tribal \ngovernment. But the necessary data bases are not always available, and \nso developing a single methodology that can be used in the estimating \nprocess is not a viable option. Consequently, Mr. President, the staff \nof the CBO, I am told, would have to address each bill and each \namendment that contained a mandate separately in order to identify and \nfind the needed data. And obviously that is an extremely time consuming \nand costly endeavor.\n  Now, Senators and staff advise me that S. 1 mandates that the \nestimates be made for a full 5-year period. How ironic that is, Mr. \nPresident, since we have some in this body who have complained that \nthey cannot provide the American people details of how they would \ncomply with a balanced budget constitutional amendment because the data \ncannot be reliably projected that far into the future.\n  Now, that opens up an interesting subject. We have some in this body \nwho have complained that they cannot provide the American people \ndetails of how they would comply with a balanced budget constitutional \namendment because the data cannot be reliably projected that far into \nthe future. What is going on here? This bill mandates that the \nestimates be made for a full 5-year period. There are some in this body \nwho are proposing that we, that those who support the balanced budget \namendment, provide the details, provide the roadmap that will point the \nway and tell us what the costs are, what the sacrifices are, what the \nburdens are, what is going to be cut. And the American people have the \nright to know. Other Senators have the right to know.\n  The American people do not know. I do not have the newspaper in front \nof me, but I saw something in a newspaper recently to the extent that \n80 percent of the American people favor a balanced budget amendment--80 \npercent favor it. But in reading the fine print as to what does this \nmean; what does this entail; does it mean cutting Social Security or \ndoes it mean cutting veterans pensions or veterans compensation or law \nenforcement, health care, Medicare; what does it mean--suppose that is \nthe question: How do you feel about it?--well, no longer did 80 percent \nfavor a balanced budget amendment. When they saw, ``Oh, it means that \nthey might cut my veterans pension; they might cut my Medicare; I am \nnot in favor of it,'' I began to see that the 80 percent came down to \n59 percent in one case or some such, 53 percent, and 34 percent or 33.\n  Now, that was not 33 percent of the 100. That was 33 percent of the \n80 percent. In other words, as I read it, all those who favor a \nbalanced budget amendment--well, if 80 percent favored it, obviously 20 \npercent did not. That is what I assume. But of the 80 percent who \nfavored it, who favored this if such was cut, and then when it said \nthat 59 percent, only 59 percent favored it if a certain item was cut, \nthey did not mean that 59 percent of the total pie, 59 percent of the \n100 percent of those who were opposed to it. It meant 59 percent of the \n80 percent who said they were for it.\n  So when people come to understand what the punishment is, affecting \ntheir particular circumstances, their particular lifestyle, or whatever \nit may be, then the 80 percent falls away.\n  That is why I voted for Mr. Exon's amendment the other day. He \nsuggested that we know what the details are in connection with the \nbalanced budget amendment. And our leader, Mr. Daschle, and the House \nMinority Leader, Mr. Gephardt, and others are seeking to know what is \nin this poke along with this pig that we are being asked to buy. I \nthink that is a legitimate objective.\n  There are those who say, ``Well, we can't provide the American people \ndetails on how they could comply with a balanced budget constitutional \namendment because the data cannot be reliably projected that far in the \nfuture.'' Others say, ``Oh, if we do that, we won't be able to pass it, \nwe won't be able to ram a constitutional amendment on the balanced \nbudget through the Congress. No, we can't begin to pass it if we do \nthat. Why, then the American people wouldn't be for it.''\n  Somebody has said, in essence: ``We can't afford to let the American \npeople know what's good for them; or what's bad for them. If we do, \nthey won't buy it.''\n  So here, with S. 1, those who say that they cannot provide the \nAmerican people with the details of how they would comply with such an \namendment because the data cannot be reliably projected that far in the \nfuture, here they turn right around and say that CBO \n[[Page S933]] will be required to do just that--provide 5-year \nestimates which, as I noted, the Director has said will be nearly \nimpossible to determine.\n  Illogical, too, is that the cost estimates are required before the \nlegislation is enacted, even though the regulations to implement the \nlaw are proposed by executive branch agencies, and then only after \nenactment of the law. How on Earth can we expect CBO--or anyone else, \nfor that matter--to come up with reasonable cost estimates before the \nprecise regulations for implementing the law are available? The answer \nis, we cannot. The answer is that we cannot.\n  As I said, the only way that CBO can determine the cost of \nlegislation is to rely on information from the various State, local and \ntribal governments. But those officials may not be familiar with all \nthe details of a particular piece of legislation. The full \nramifications may not be obvious to a county commissioner or a county \nmanager or township clerk, notwithstanding the fact that they may \notherwise be quite competent. Likewise, I question the wisdom of \nrelying on those entities for input. If officials--particularly at the \nState level--know that the cost will be fully funded by the Federal \nGovernment, they clearly have an interest in inflating the potential \ncost. They have an interest in it, as I say, a basic self-interest. \nThat is what I am talking about, basic self-interest. And basic self-\ninterest will undoubtedly skew many of these estimates.\n  I also fear that one of the unintended consequences of this bill will \nbe to set up a disparate system between the Government and the private \nsector--a disparate system between the Government and the private \nsector. For example, my staff tells me that a point of order can lie \nagainst any mandate directed at a governmental unit if we do not fully \nfund that mandate. I have heard some discussion of that here on the \nfloor, I believe, on yesterday. But the same point of order would not \nbe appropriate if the mandate is aimed solely at the private sector. \nThat difference is especially troubling in those areas where the \nprivate sector competes with the Government.\n  What happens? What happens if, for instance, a publicly owned utility \nis exempt from additional clean-air regulations because the cost of \nthose regulations have not been fully funded and a point of order could \nnot be overcome, while a similar utility, wholly owned by a public \ncompany, must comply? Such a scenario could easily crop up, it seems to \nme. What happens then, Mr. President? In effect, we will have imposed \nan additional and costly burden on a private business.\n  My point is simply to suggest that while the intent behind S.1 may be \nlaudable, the fact remains that this is a substantially different bill \nthan what we considered last year. I heard that last night. My friend, \nthe distinguished Senator from Michigan, I believe--I either heard him \nsay that on the floor or he said it somewhere within the reach of my \nhearing. I still have pretty good hearing. I do not have a hearing aid \nyet. I am doing very well without one. But I thought I heard him say \nthat this is a substantially different bill than what we considered \nlast year. I thought I heard that Senator say that. I see he is nodding \nhis head in the affirmative. He is on the record with me that he did, \nhe did say so.\n  It is a substantially different bill. And, as such, I do not believe \nwe know enough about all its possible ramifications. Therefore, and \nuntil we have a fuller discussion, we cannot turn a bind eye to any \npotential problems in the apparent rush to pass as much legislation as \nsoon as possible. There is no reason to expedite this bill to the \nextent the effort is being made to expedite it through the Senate. We \nare not in a race, here. I understand that no committees are meeting \ntoday, so some parts of the Senate, apparently, feel that we are not in \na big rush on things. We certainly have no obligation to bow to the \nwhims of those who have set false timetables.\n  I do not blame them for setting timetables. That is all right. Those \nwho subscribe to the Contract With America, they have laid out a 100-\nday timetable. I am not part of that timetable. I did not subscribe to \nthat. We have plenty of time. Let us see what is in these bills. Let us \ntake a moment and dissect them. And the members of the committees, if \nthey have an opportunity to fully debate these bills and explain them \nand offer amendments, then the rest of us will understand what is in \nthem.\n  I do not have any obligation to say: Oh, yes, I will just roll over \nand play dead. I hear that a steamroller is coming, a steamroller is \ncoming down the track. I want to know what is in that steamroller. We \ndo not have the rules of the House. As long as this Senator is here we \nare not likely to have the rules of the House, if I can have anything \nto do with stopping any impulse to stampede in that direction.\n  If unfunded mandates are a genuine and unreasonable burden on State \nand local governments or private organizations--and I believe in some \ncases they may be; I don't have any doubt that they are--then we should \ndeal with them directly. There is absolutely no need, it seems to me, \nto establish some elaborate new procedural scheme within the Congress \nin order to do that.\n  But if it comes to that, if we do establish such a scheme, let us \nknow what it is about. I only represent one vote here and I have always \nsaid that, with respect to the filibuster, the filibuster will not \neternally kill something, kill legislation that the American people \nreally want. It may slow it down for a while. It may stop it for a \nwhile. But in the process of education of the American people through \nunlimited debate, the American people often become more aware of what \nthey are being asked to buy.\n  That is the case with the balanced budget amendment. As I have read \nin the newspapers, there are some groups, now, that are raising some \nquestions about that balanced budget amendment. I even see that some \nGovernors are beginning to have second thoughts, who are beginning to \nwonder if this thing is all it is cracked up to be. So that is the way \nthese things happen. But I have maintained that if the American people \nreally understand a question, if they really understand it and they \nreally want it, they will get it regardless of the filibuster.\n  Sadly, though, erecting these ``process'' fixes is symptomatic of an \nextremely bad habit into which the Congress has fallen over the past \nseveral years. When confronted with a difficult problem for which there \nis no easy or painless solution, the tendency is to resort to some sort \nof procedural fix rather than dealing with the problem head-on.\n  So here we have a procedural fix. The balanced budget constitutional \namendment is a procedural fix. The balanced budget constitutional \namendment is the greatest unfunded mandate that was ever imposed since \nAdam and Eve were driven from the Garden of Eden, the greatest unfunded \nmandate ever imposed.\n  So here we are going in two different directions meeting ourselves \nhead on. Here we have this bill dealing with unfunded mandates. But \nbehind it is the so-called ``balanced budget constitutional \namendment.'' You talk about an unfunded mandate. Wait until that thing \nsettles its claws into legislative bodies throughout the land. Wait \nuntil that thing settles its roost on the Government's doorstep. It \nwill peck on the windows; and unfunded mandates. If they think that \nthis bill is going to relieve their concerns about the balanced budget \namendment, they had better think twice, three times and more, as we \nwill have an opportunity to discuss in due time. Just mark that down. \nThe balanced budget constitutional amendment, contrary to what it is \nbeing purported to do, is not only the biggest hoax that is perhaps \nabout to be perpetrated on the American people but it is the largest \nunfunded mandate. I will not take the time of the Senate today to \nexplain what I mean by that.\n  I want to repeat this word ``caution'' for those who think that S. 1 \nis some kind of cure for mandates. They need to think about it. S. 1 \ndoes nothing to protect any State or local government as I understand \nit--I may understand it better later--but as I understand, it will do \nnothing to protect any State or local government from the costs of \nFederal budget cutting of any program that is not presently mandated. \nHow about that? They just say it applies prospectively. It does not \nprotect any program that is not presently mandated. Therein lies the \ntale. For example, S. 1 would not apply to Federal \n[[Page S934]] programs whereby the Congress provides grants for use in \nhousing programs, programs that provide social services for the \nhomeless, child immunization, Federal aid to States and localities for \neducation, or even transportation grants.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be permitted, \nalthough I have the floor, to ask a question of the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan [Mr. Levin].\n  Is Federal aid to education a Federal mandate or is that simply a \ngrant to the States? Is that a mandate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  To the best of my knowledge, that is not a mandate. That is just a \ngrant to the States.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well. Then, if in this budget-cutting fever that is so \ninfectious, Federal aid to education is cut--and I might be one who \nwould support such a cut. Here we are pouring billions of dollars into \nFederal aid to education for our poorer students on the whole, more \nthan the other industrialized countries. So I have some second thoughts \nabout the way we handle Federal aid to education.\n  But that is, according to Mr. Levin, not a mandate. So the cost of \nreplacing Federal dollars which may be cut by the Congress in the \nfuture will be dumped directly on the States by cuts in grants to the \nStates. This bill does not cure that. If any of the dollars that go to \nthe States to help those areas are reduced, the States will still be \nstuck with the problem and, most importantly, the expense of the \nhomelessness or poor transportation system. This legislation does \nnothing to protect the States from increased costs which are caused by \nfuture actions of the Federal Government; in other words, cuts in \ngrants and other Federal programs.\n  Think about that possible scenario, Mr. President. I hope that the \nproponents of the bill will stop the mad rush to pass this legislation \nnow and go back to the drawing board and come up with a workable and \npracticable piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Chair will momentarily indulge me as I have \nthe right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as I stated earlier, it is not my desire to hold the \nfloor inordinately today. I have accomplished most of what I had hoped \nto do; namely, have a report by the Committee on the Budget and an \nopportunity to understand what is in the report. The report is \navailable. I have not had an opportunity to study it, but it is not my \ndesire to hold the floor. Senators know if I wanted to filibuster the \nbill--and the Senator from Arizona knows full well--I could talk for \nthe rest of the day. That is not my intention. So I intend to yield the \nfloor shortly.\n  Let me say, again, that the distinguished Senator from Idaho has \nextended every act of cooperation and courtesy to me, and I appreciate \nhis decency and his spirit of good will. I did not want to give up the \nfloor until he returned.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments that the \nSenator from West Virginia has made and, of course, I have great \nrespect for him and for his understanding of legislation. I know that \nhe will be an integral part of the overall discussion of this Senate \nbill No. 1. I know, also, Mr. President, that it will be my intention \nthat on final passage--I have full intentions of having the Senator \nfrom West Virginia vote for this bill because--I think he used the \nterms he was ``not sure how it could hurt his State.'' I think he will \nlearn that it will not hurt the States. This is what States are asking \nus to do in reestablishing and reaffirming the federalism that is \nintended.\n  Also, Mr. President, this issue is tied with the Contract With \nAmerica that the Senator from West Virginia pointed out. I would like \nto just comment about that. When I took the oath of office here 2 years \nago, the day that I took the oath of office as a Senator was the day \nthat I resigned as mayor in Boise, ID. One of the items that I was very \nintent on doing was to somehow deal with these unfunded Federal \nmandates. So the first bill that I ever introduced in my Senate career \nwas a bill dealing with these unfunded Federal mandates. Ultimately, \nthat bill, Senate bill No. 993, which gained bipartisan support and \nwhich went through the Governmental Affairs Committee last session on a \nvote of 16 to 0--much of what is in today's bill, S. 1, was derived \nfrom Senate bill No. 993. The definitions are the same and, again, much \nof it is the same, but there are changes to it. I say that so that you \nsee a bit of a history here.\n  The Contract With America, which happened a few months ago, took \nplace after we had been moving this legislation. And so while the issue \nof unfunded mandates--dealing with that is part of the Contract With \nAmerica in the House of Representatives, and while I am delighted and \nproud that they have included that issue to be part of the things \ndiscussed and dealt with in the Contract With America, really this \nissue in the Senate, this legislation, precedes that.\n  Also, the Speaker of the House agreed to take that element of the \nContract With America dealing with unfunded mandates and to pull it out \nof the Contract With America so that it could be freestanding and so \nthat we could deal with this issue and have this sort of discussion.\n  So I assure the Senator from West Virginia that this is not part of \njust some large package that we have to hurriedly get through. It is a \ncritically important issue, the impact of which has been taking years, \nand our cities and States and the private sector has heard about it.\n  The Senator also referenced the Congressional Budget Office. I wish \nto assure the Senator from West Virginia that through the Budget \nCommittee we have stayed in close contact with the Congressional Budget \nOffice, so that as modifications from S. 993 were made to S. 1 they \nwere able to tell us every step of the way what their needs would be in \norder to accomplish the responsibilities that this legislation would \nassign to them, including the funds to carry that out. So we have dealt \nwith that issue.\n  I believe that, at some point later, we are going to be coming up \nwith possible amendments dealing in this area, and so I will withhold \nfurther comment on that. By the fact that there has been objection to \nthat unanimous-consent request, it would be my understanding that we \nhave before us the next committee amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the ninth reported \ncommittee amendment.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). Is there objection?\n  Mr. FORD. There is an objection. I apologize to the Senator, but I \nhave been asked to protect the rollcall and, if the Senator will allow \nme, I will see if I can give him the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I might amplify.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will continue the call of the roll.\n  The bill clerk continued to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed as in morning \nbusiness for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/13/senate-section/article/S928-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S934-S935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VIOLENCE AT HEALTH CLINICS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the absence of any other pending \nbusiness in the Senate, I have sought recognition to comment briefly \nabout violence at clinics, with respect to two principle issues.\n   [[Page S935]] One is a contention which is advanced by some, and has \nbeen used as a possible legal defense, that violence and murder is \njustifiable homicide. There is absolutely, positively no basis \nwhatsoever in criminal law for such an assertion that anybody who \nmurders or assaults or maims at a clinic where the clinic may be \nperforming abortions has any conceivable legal justification under the \ndoctrine of justifiable homicide.\n  That is a legal principle that I worked with to a considerable extent \nduring my 12 years in the Philadelphia district attorney's office, and \nthe doctrine of justifiable homicide has been worked out in a very \ncareful way; for example, when a police officer may seek to defend an \ninnocent victim, citizen, during the course of a robbery and may shoot \na robber in order to stop the murder of an innocent citizen in the \ncourse of a felony. And for someone to seize upon the term of \n``justifiable homicide,'' picking it out of the thin air to say that \nthat is any reason for committing violence at a clinic where abortions \nmay be performed is just absolutely preposterous.\n  One of the problems which has arisen, Mr. President, has been really \ninsufficient condemnation of violence at these clinics.\n  I was very pleased to see the statement made by Cardinal Law of \nBoston asking for a cessation of any picketing, where the situation may \nbe permitted to cool. But it seems to me that we need to speak out on \nlevels to condemn that kind of conduct and to state as unequivocally as \npossible that there is no conceivable justification as ``justifiable \nhomicide.''\n  The other point that I want to comment on briefly, Mr. President, is \nthat at these clinics where women secure medical care, abortion is a \nrelatively small percentage of what is done; that most of the women who \ngo there--I heard the percentage is as high as 90 percent--are there \nfor medical purposes. They are there for mammograms to guard against \nbreast cancer. They are there for Pap smears to guard against cervical \ncancer. They are there for a whole range of medical procedures.\n  When there has been an epidemic of violence at these clinics, the \nwomen stay away in droves because there is terror that in being there, \nthey may be in the midst of violence.\n  So I wanted to take a few moments in the interlude of the \nproceedings, Mr. President, to make those two points and to speak out \nas forcefully as I can, and with the background I have had as a \ndistrict attorney dealing with the concept of justifiable homicide, to \nmake it as unequivocal and forceful as I can that there is no \nconceivable justification for that violence and to say, at the same \ntime, that it is driving many women urgently in need of medical care \naway from those facilities.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from Kentucky for \nsecuring the time. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator withhold?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Pennsylvania withhold \nthe quorum call?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nNebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/13/senate-section/article/S934-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S935-S941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNFUNDED MANDATE REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1, which the Budget \nCommittee unanimously ordered reported on Monday, and since that time, \nwe have come forth with a report that has been suggested and I believe \nthat is being reviewed at the present time.\n  I am an original cosponsor of S. 1. I want to take this opportunity \nto commend my distinguished colleagues and friends, Senator Glenn, \nSenator Domenici, and Senator Kempthorne, for the yeomans' work that \nthey have put into this bill. We would not be where we are today if it \nwere not for their dedication.\n  Mr. President, unfunded mandates are not merely a thorn in the side \nof the Nation's Governors and State and local officials. They have \nburrowed deep into the Nation's landscape and present a problem of the \nutmost gravity.\n  Washington passes mandates and regulations and then drops them like \nan orphan on the doorstep of the States, forcing officials to dig deep \ninto their own pockets to pay for compliance, to pay for mandates, at a \ntime when they are confronting their own fiscal shortfalls and the \npublic's demand for greater services.\n  Speak to any State or local official from Nebraska to Nevada, from a \nmayor to a town manager or a Governor, and they will tell you that this \ncost shifting from the Federal level to the State level is wreaking \nhavoc with their budgets. As my good friend and colleague, Senator \nGlenn, rightly observed, we are passing the buck without the bucks.\n  In spite of the cry of ``enough'' from the States, Washington keeps \nheaping unfunded mandates upon unfunded mandates and regulations upon \nregulations, and there is no end point to the mandates effect. Like an \nentitlement, they go on and on and on, to an endless life of their own. \nUnfunded mandates are relentless in their demands upon State and local \ntreasuries and, unfortunately, the sky seems to be the limit.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, compliance with Federal \nlegislative and regulatory mandates rose from $225 million in 1986 to \n$2.8 billion in 1991. CBO readily admits that its estimates are highly \nconservative.\n  We really do not know the full extent and magnitude of the situation. \nMr. President, it is time we brought these unfunded mandates back to \nEarth and back to the realm of reason and responsible budgeting. It is \nhigh time that we not only rethink the relationship between the Federal \nand State Governments, it is time that we did something about it. And \nthat is what this bill does.\n  The legislation before us today would create a point of order against \nunfunded mandates. Under the bill, the Federal Government must provide \ndirect spending for these mandates. If it cannot, the mandate \nrequirements must be scaled back to the amount of money appropriated.\n  That is fair, and that is reasonable. And above everything else, Mr. \nPresident, that is right.\n  Mr. President, this is a bill that takes in the very broad picture. \nIt already enjoys great bipartisan support. My last count indicates \nthat it has 57 cosponsors and probably a few more today that I do not \nknow about. I predict that it will pass overwhelmingly and in a very \nreasonable period of time. But I wish to be clear that there are no \nhalf measures in the legislation. It meets the problem head on.\n  Of course, there are those who advocate a radical approach to the \nissue, what they call a no money, no mandates backstop.\n  While I commend my colleagues' enthusiasm and dogged persistence in \nrighting the unfunded mandates inequities, this is a classic case of \ncorrectly diagnosing the problem but applying the wrong treatment, a \ntreatment which I suggest could have disastrous side effects.\n  The alternative backstop strategy that some are referencing would \ntake us down a road which could not only swell the size of an already \nbloated Federal bureaucracy, but it could further fan the flames of the \nlitigation inferno that is raging throughout the Nation.\n  This draconian approach would require that the CBO reestimate each \nyear--and I stress ``each year''--the cost of mandates. I do not \nbelieve that we can fathom how much we would have to expand the CBO \nstaff to meet this formidable and I think unnecessarily forbidding \ntask.\n  Mr. President, over the past 2 years, we have made excellent headway \nin meeting the American people's rightful demands to reduce the size of \nGovernment. We have much further to go. We will have the smallest \ngovernment, though, I would point out, since President Kennedy sat in \nthe Oval Office. This is not the time to undue the good and the hard \nwork that has been done in many areas. We must be cautious but we must \nbe effective.\n  Second, we would be doing, I suggest, a terrible disservice to our \nfellow citizens if we inadvertently fueled further litigation. That is \nexactly what would \n[[Page S936]] happen if we chose the simplistic measure. The lawyers \nwould be lining up a hundred deep in the court, challenging at every \nturn the CBO reestimates. And I hope that this concern will be \nunderstood by all Members of the body.\n  The columnist David Broder wrote a very effective piece touching on \nthis subject that appeared in the newspaper a few days ago. Mr. Broder \nendorsed the bill before us today as ``a worthy effort.'' Mr. Broder \nfurther notes that the no-money, no-mandate alternative would ``split \nthe bipartisan coalition.'' We must not split the bipartisan coalition \nthat is moving aggressively forward and if followed will pass S. 1 in a \nvery short period of time. If we proceed through any other course, we \nendanger the longstanding civil rights and environmental policy and \nperhaps draw a Presidential veto.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this \nperceptive column be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. EXON. In a similar vein, Mr. President, the proposal of some to \nraise the requirement for waiving the new point of order from a \nmajority vote to 60 votes would also split the bipartisan coalition. \nAnother 60-vote point of order in this context would tie the Senate in \nknots. If we have seen gridlock over the last decade, this kind of a \n60-vote point of order would lead to a glacial gridlock.\n  Mr. President, I was involved in the negotiations that led to the \nunfunded mandates bill currently before the Senate. There were a few \nitems of the bill that merit further clarification.\n                             retroactivity\n\n  There has been a great deal of confusion surrounding the question of \nretroactivity in S. 1. Namely, to what mandates does S. 1 apply? And, \nwill mandates already enacted into law be affected by S. 1?\n  The drafters of S. 1 intended that reauthorization of existing laws \nnot be subject to the requirements of S. 1 where the net costs of the \nlegislation do not exceed existing costs of the mandate plus the \nthresholds established in the legislation.\n  The no-retroactivity clause would apply to laws for which \nauthorizations of appropriations may have expired, such as the 1987 \nWater Quality Act.\n  I would add that this same principle would apply equally to \nregulations that are issued pursuant to existing laws, but which have \nnot yet been proposed or finalized. However, let me stress that the \nexisting law must be in effect at the time S. 1 became effective \nregardless of whether an authorization of appropriations has expired.\n\n\n                               exclusions\n\n  The bill contains a broad exclusion for legislation that establishes \nor enforces any statutory rights that prohibit discrimination.\n  The drafters of S. 1 believe this language to mean provisions in \nbills and joint resolutions that prohibit or are designed to prevent \ndiscrimination from occurring through civil or criminal sanctions or \nprohibitions.\n\n\n                            points of order\n\n  The legislation ensures that a simple majority in the House or Senate \nwill be required to waive a point of order, if raised, for an unfunded \nintergovernmental mandate, or where a CBO statement does not accompany \na bill or joint resolution.\n\n\n                               procedures\n\n  The situation may arise where a mandate--already in effect for a \nyear--is declared ineffective and enforcement or judicial action has \nalready commenced. In such a case, the drafters of S. 1 intend that \nwhere enforcement actions have begun, the mandate in question would \ncontinue to consider applicable law preceding the declaration of \nineffectiveness.\n  For example, in a case where a mandate is fully funded in the first 2 \nyears, but not in the third, the mandate is effective for the first 2 \nyears, but not in the third.\n\n\n                administrative processes and procedures\n\n  When an intergovernmental mandate is either declared ineffective or \nscaled back because of lack of funding, these changes in the mandate \nwill be effectuated consistent with the requirements of the \nAdministrative Procedures Act.\n  This will ensure that all affected parties including, the private \nsector, State, local and tribal governments and the intended \nbeneficiaries of the mandate will have adequate opportunity to address \ntheir concerns.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to say that after much though \nand analysis we have found in the legislation before us today the \nsolution to the problem of unfunded mandates. It might not be a perfect \none. Certainly we all can say that we have passed few perfect pieces of \nlegislation. It does not mean that we may not have to revisit this from \ntime to time. But I think it is time we move aggressively ahead to \nsolve the problem of unfunded mandates.\n  On January 5, the Budget Committee, of which I am the ranking \nminority member, and the Governmental Affairs Committee held a joint \nhearing on S. 1. Both of our respective committees favorably reported \nout the measure earlier this week. We have heard loud and clear the \ncall from the States. It is now time that we acted and passed this \ncritical legislation.\n                               [Exibit 1]\n\n                           Money and Mandates\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       Before George Voinovich became governor of Ohio four years \n     ago, he was a member of the Ohio legislature, a Cuyahoga \n     County commissioner and the mayor of Cleveland. That may \n     condemn him as a career politician in some people's eyes, but \n     it also placed him in a unique position to help move what may \n     become the first law passed by this new Congress--the \n     unfunded mandates bill.\n       Voinovich, a Republican, last year used his friendships in \n     both parties to construct an unusually broad and solid \n     coalition of state and local government groups to press for \n     enactment of a long-overdue measure that will require \n     Congress to look twice before saddling states, counties and \n     cities with the costs of carrying out policies the federal \n     government finds desirable.\n       The measure was stymied in the last Congress by Rep. Henry \n     Waxman (D-Cailf.) and some of the other veteran mandate-\n     writers, but this year it has high priority in the Senate and \n     House, with their new Republican majorities. For reasons I \n     will explain in a moment, this measure may not provide all \n     the relief the states and localities expect. But it is an \n     effort to address a real problem: the increasing tendency of \n     a federal government which has spent itself into $4 trillion \n     of debt to make its partners in state and local government \n     pay for Washington's good deeds.\n       The governors, legislators, mayors, and county officials \n     have griped about this for a long time. But it was not until \n     they put aside their internal differences and came together \n     last year as the State and Local Coalition that Congress \n     began to take notice. As Voinovich commented over coffee last \n     week in Washington, ``It is rare that an idea that was on no \n     one's screen in Washington one year becomes the top priority \n     in Congress the next year.'' Members of Congress ``can ignore \n     any one of our groups, but they can't ignore all of us.''\n       Voinovich's political acumen also was important in keeping \n     the legislation within bounds of reason. Some conservatives \n     want to enact a ``no money, no mandate'' law that would stop \n     the federal government from requiring any cost-sharing by \n     state and local governments on programs of national \n     importance.\n       Voinovich recognizes that would split his bipartisan \n     coalition, which includes many liberal Democrats, endanger \n     long-standing national civil rights and environmental \n     policies, and perhaps draw a presidential veto. So he has \n     worked diligently to persuade conservatives, including \n     Speaker Newt Gingrich, to back bills by Sen. Dirk Kempthorne \n     (R-Idaho) and Reps. William Clinger (Pa.) and Rob Portman (R-\n     Ohio) that take a more measured approach.\n       The bills do not repeal existing mandates, leaving an \n     examination of their financing to a bipartisan commission. \n     They exempt measures necessary to enforce constitutional or \n     statutory rights prohibiting discrimination of any kind--\n     including disability.\n       They allow future Congresses to pass unfunded mandates--but \n     only if, on a separate roll-call vote, before final passage, \n     a majority of the House and Senate say, deliberately and \n     explicitly, that the purpose is so compelling they believe \n     they should waive the rule against unfunded mandates. In \n     other words, senators and representatives would have to tell \n     their constituents, in effect, ``We're voting to raise your \n     state or local taxes.''\n       The difficulty I mentioned earlier arises from the \n     enforcement mechanism. Somebody has to decide how much an \n     unfunded mandate would cost and whether it exceeds the \n     threshold set in the proposed law--$50 million in costs for \n     state and local governments, $200 million for private \n     business. That agency is the Congressional Budget Office \n     (CBO), a nonpartisan arm of Congress.\n       That is a huge power to give to a group of unelected \n     bureaucrats, even if they are required by law to consult with \n     local and state officials and are supervised by the House and \n     Senate Budget committees. Robert D. Reischauer, the director \n     of CBO, has written \n     [[Page S937]] members of Congress a letter warning that ``in \n     some of the situations that will matter most . . . [it] will \n     be very difficult if not impossible to determine'' the costs \n     the proposed mandate will impose.\n       Local officials, as Reischauer delicately put it, ``are \n     likely to have a strong interest in having the costs of a \n     proposed mandate appear as high as possible''; congressional \n     sponsors, the opposite motivation. In truth, the added costs \n     will vary enormously, depending on the severity of the \n     problems in the locality and the degree of effort already \n     being made.\n       Voinovich is right in arguing that the bill will force \n     Congress to consider future mandates with care. It will \n     provide a forum where the states and cites can argue their \n     case. But this law is altogether too likely to have \n     unintended consequences. I can see the same local officials \n     who are enraged now by Congress's caprice in passing unfunded \n     mandates being equally enraged--and frustrated--by future CBO \n     cost estimates.\n       The unfunded mandate bill is a worthy effort. But in the \n     end, the real solution lies in sorting out more clearly what \n     responsibilities should be financed and run by each level of \n     government. Voinovich and other governors are ready for that \n     kind of dialogue to begin. President Clinton should take the \n     lead in seeing that it happens.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nremaining committee amendments be temporarily laid aside in order to \nconsider the Dorgan amendment; that no second-degree amendments be in \norder, and that at 2:30 a vote will occur on the amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. Will the \nSenator kindly restate the request?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Yes. The unanimous-consent request is that the \nremaining committee amendments be temporarily laid aside in order to \nconsider the Dorgan amendment; that no second-degree amendments be in \norder, and that at 2:30 a vote will occur on the Dorgan amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator who reserved the right to object \nwill yield for a question to the manager.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Dorgan amendment that the Senator is referring to, as \nI understand it, is an amendment which would substitute the ACIR, in \nlieu of the new commission which the bill would create, the ACIR being \nan existing commission on intergovernmental relations. As I understand \nSenator Dorgan's amendment, it would utilize the ACIR in lieu of \ncreating a new commission, as the bill currently provides; is that just \nthe nature of the amendment, so the folks know what it is the unanimous \nconsent refers to?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. In response to the Senator from Michigan, that is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, this seems to \nme to be a positive amendment, one that has considerable merit, as I \nunderstand it. I do not plan to object to setting the amendments aside \nto take up this amendment. But before I complete my reservation, I \nstarted out saying I wanted a committee report, so that our minority \npeople on both committees--not just the Budget Committee, but on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee--who had been denied the committee \nreport with individual views or minority views, knowing full well \nnothing about the content of the bill, but knowing that there is a \nsteamroller coming down the road, to put all these wonderful things. I \nhave seen the number 10 used, 10 plans in the Contract With America--\nmaybe 12. All these wonderful things are in the Contract With America. \nAnd realizing that this bill, being No. 1, must be a very important \nbill, not just a simple sense-of-the-Senate resolution, but a very \nimportant bill. No. 2, S. 2 was passed earlier, and I voted against S. \n2. But in this case, I said I want, on behalf of the Senate, on behalf \nof the minority, and on behalf of myself, and on behalf of all other \nSenators who do not know any more about this bill than I do, I want to \nsee a committee report. I want to see the minority view. I want to see \nthe votes that were taken inside the committee. I want all those things \nin the committee report that we are instructed to have in the committee \nreports by the Senate rules. Senators and listeners who do not know \nwhat I am talking about, read the Senate rules and find out. I wanted \nthose, and I wanted an opportunity not just to have it given to me in \nmy hand but an opportunity to study it. I have the reports now, but I \nwant this weekend to study this bill.\n  In the meantime, I do not want to appear to be filibustering, \nalthough I do not mind being a filibusterer when the right time comes. \nSenators will know when I am filibustering. I have been called worse \nnames than a filibusterer. But I have no interest in killing the bill. \nI may be for it. I probably will be, but I am not sure. I probably will \nbe for the bill. But I resist the temptation to roll over and play \ndead. I resist that temptation. I am not going to be cowed like a \nwhipped dog because of threats or charges that I may be obstructing or \nfilibustering. I am not doing that. I want to know what is in these \nbills. We have plenty of time. We do not have to ram them through. Let \nus take the time. This is an important bill. I hear a lot of whispering \nand murmuring about problems with this bill from my colleagues. I want \nto know what is in it. So I want to study that bill this weekend, after \nI do the mopping of the kitchen. I always mop the kitchen. Every \nSaturday that is my job and I mop the washroom where she does the \nwashing, where the washer and dryer are. I mop, yes. I clean all the \ncommodes. I clean all the bathroom structures. I clean out the \nbathtubs.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Not yet. I will shortly. I do all the vacuuming. I do the \ndusting. I dust the furniture in the family room and dust the furniture \nin the living room, and so on. My wife does the buying and the cooking \nand the washing and the ironing and the pressing of suits and taking \ncare of my little dog, Billy. But over this weekend, whenever I get \nthrough with doing my chores, which I have sworn on to for a number of \nyears, then I want to study this bill. That is a legitimate reason not \nto rush pell-mell at this point.\n  I want to be a reasonable man. Here is an opportunity to vote on \nsomething that is positive. I will listen to the Senator's explanation \nof the amendment. It is my understanding, in talking with the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan, that this is a good amendment. So I am not going to \ninterpose an objection to setting these committee amendments aside. I \nhave no objection to setting those amendments aside and letting the \nSenate go forward and dispose of the amendment by Mr. Dorgan. There may \nbe another amendment that would fit into that. All I am asking is that \nI want this weekend, after I get through with mopping the kitchen and \nmopping the washroom, and all those things, I want the opportunity to \nstudy this bill. That is a reasonable request. I am saving my strength \nfor a filibuster on another day, on another bill. I am not \nfilibustering this bill. Give me a break here.\n  So I have no objection to that if the leader wants to do that.\n  Mr. DOLE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am merely reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. DOLE. Last night we talked about your dog, Billy, and my dog, \nLeader. So I have had Leader inscribe a picture for Billy, and here is \nthe picture.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will wonders never cease? Sweet smoke of rhetoric, my, what \na handsome dog that is. I wish someone would call my office downstairs \nand have a picture of Billy brought up here. That is a pedigree. That \nis a blue ribbon dog.\n  I will read the inscription: ``To Billy:''\n  There is only one Billy, and that is Billy Byrd.\n  ``To Billy, with best wishes.'' The signature, ``Leader.'' Leader; \nthat is a beautiful dog. It really is.\n  I thank the distinguished leader.\n  But I do want to bring a picture of Billy up.\n  So I have no objection to setting the amendments aside for that \npurpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n   [[Page S938]] Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am offering this amendment along with \nthe Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham]; the Senator from Michigan [Mr. \nLevin]; and the Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne].\n  Mr. President, it says on page 39 of S. 1, which the Senate is now \nconsidering, at the top of the page, under:\n\n             Title III--Review of Unfunded Federal Mandates\n\n     SEC. 301. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       There is established a commission which shall be known as \n     the ``Commission on Unfunded Federal Mandates'' (in this \n     title referred to as the ``Commission'').\n\n  And then it goes on in subsequent pages to describe the duties and \nresponsibilities of this commission.\n  My amendment would substitute the Advisory Commission on \nIntergovernmental Relations for this new commission.\n  I offer this amendment because, prior to a week or so ago, all of the \ndrafts of this legislation, going back to last year, written by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee under the chairmanship of Senator Glenn, \nand more recently negotiated in biparitisan discussions, all of those \ndrafts included in this section a commission to study unfunded mandates \nand that commission was going to be the Advisory Commission on \nIntergovernmental Relations. It is called ACIR. ACIR is an organization \nthat has been in existence a long, long time, one with which I have a \ngreat deal of familiarity from the time when I was a statewide elected \nofficial.\n  ACIR has done a substantial amount of research in many, many areas \ndealing with intergovernmental relations. Its membership includes \nmembers from virtually all levels of government, members appointed by \nthe President, members appointed by the Presiding Officer of the \nSenate, the House; we have mayors and Governors and we have private \ncitizens.\n  The fact is, it is an outstanding commission that has done \noutstanding work for a long, long while. And it has especially done an \nenormous amount of work on the subject of unfunded mandates. It has for \nover 10 years done credible and thoughtful studies on this subject of \nunfunded mandates.\n  If this organization, the ACIR, one with such a distinguished \nreputation, one which I have worked with personally for over 20 years \non many intergovernmental issues, if this organization has been the one \nthat has done over a decade's worth of research and work on unfunded \nmandates, the question for me was: Why would we pass legislation that \ncreates a new commission to give us some studies and some answers on \nunfunded mandates? That does not make any sense. In fact, it did not \nmake any sense over recent months to all of those Republicans and \nDemocrats who were constructing this. Only in the last week or so was a \nnew commission put in here in substitute for ACIR.\n  My amendment says, let us replace it with the Advisory Commission on \nIntergovernmental Relations. It makes little sense to create a new \ncommission. We are in Government these days talking about reinventing, \nabout downsizing, about trying to be more efficient, trying to avoid \nduplication and overlapping of duties.\n  And this amendment simply moves us in that direction, to say a \ncommission already exists, a commission that has expertise in this very \nmatter, and that is the commission that ought to appear on page 39.\n  So my amendment is relatively simple. It simply substitutes the ACIR \nfor the new commission that otherwise would be created.\n  The advantages to this are obvious. First of all, the Advisory \nCommission on Intergovernmental Relations is ready to do this work. No \nnew commission has to be created. No new members have to be appointed. \nNo new staff has to be hired. No new space to house a staff need be \ncreated. No new rules. No new relationships. It already exists. It can, \nbecause of that, realistically, in my judgment, meet all of the \ntimetables. So it is a perfect fit.\n  I indicated that the ACIR has done studies going back 10 years on \nthis very issue. In fact, they have done five major studies and have \nbeen the major resource used by most of us in the Congress who have \nbeen concerned about unfunded mandates. The mission of the Advisory \nCommission on Intergovernmental Relations is to strengthen the Federal \nsystem, strengthen the cooperation between levels of government. And \nso, again, it is uniquely situated, in my judgment, to perform this \ntask.\n  I have watched with interest the discussion on the floor of the \nSenate recently about unfunded mandates. As I conclude and prepare to \nallow my distinguished friend from Florida and others, hopefully, to \nsupport this amendment, I just want to say that it is not without \nmerit, in my judgment, for us to proceed with deliberation and proceed \nin a manner that allows all Members of this body to have some comfort \nthat they understand exactly what is \n[[Page S939]] in this legislation. This will be a better bill if we \nproceed in a manner that allows everyone to understand it, ask all of \nthe questions, improve it, modify it, change it, accept it and then \nfinally vote on it and move this along so that it becomes law.\n  I expect, in the end, to cast a ``yes'' vote on a piece of \nlegislation that I think has great merit. But there are questions that \nwill be asked. I have two additional amendments I will offer next week. \nBut I believe that this bill moves us in the right direction of being \nmore responsible on a subject where we have acted in the past without, \nin my judgment, full information.\n  And so I appreciate very much the discussion that has gone on among \nthe principal sponsors of the legislation and Senator Byrd and many \nothers on this floor in recent hours and recent days. I thank him for \nhis willingness to allow this amendment to be offered and allow the \nother amendments to be set aside. It demonstrates, I think, that we \nwant to make some progress on this legislation. And this amendment \nitself is one with merit and one that I think will demonstrate \nprogress.\n  I know Senator Graham and Senator Kempthorne and others wish to speak \nin support of it. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the Senator allow me to compliment him, and also I \nwould ask that he add my name as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  As I understand, the pending bill authorizes more Federal staff at \nCBO and more Federal spending, $4.5 million per year, to hire \nadditional CBO personnel to carry out their new, largely unachievable, \nresponsibilities under the bill. In addition, the bill would set up yet \nanother Federal commission.\n  And we have in the bill that was passed earlier this week--which I \nwas against, the so-called coverage bill--we have in that bill a new \nbureaucracy under the auspices of a so-called bicameral commission that \nwill spend almost unlimited funds. That was one of the reasons why I \nvoted against the bill. Is this what the Senators mean by Government \nreform, continuing to establish commissions?\n  A bill which passed earlier this week, as I say, S. 2, created a \nwhole new board and authorized that board to employ such staff and \nconsultants as were considered appropriate. I voted against that bill \nfor a number of reasons, one of which, I opposed the creation of that \nnew board.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from North Dakota on his \namendment, and I hope he will allow me to be a cosponsor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator very much for his \ngenerous remarks. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from West \nVirginia [Mr. Byrd] be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, thank you.\n  First of all, let me congratulate Senator Dorgan on this amendment. I \nthink he has experience in intergovernmental relationships. I believe \nhe has actually served on that commission, although I may be mistaken. \nI know I have served on that commission.\n  There is no reason for Members to be creating another commission. It \nis the last thing we ought to be doing when we are reinventing \nGovernment.\n  This bill, I believe, was deficient in that regard by creating \nanother commission. Unlike last year's bill 993, which used the \nAdvisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, an existing \ncommission, this bill before Members created a new commission. It was \nunneeded. It will lead to delay and expense.\n  I congratulate Senator Dorgan on going back to what was in last \nyear's Senate bill 993, which was utilizing the ACIR for this purpose. \nI am pleased to cosponsor his amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to first express my support for the objectives of S. 1, and I \nlook forward to voting for it on final passage. I believe that there \nhas been a tendency, particularly during a time of restrained Federal \nresources, to look to the imposition of obligations on State and local \ngovernment as a means of accomplishing national objectives which we at \nthe National Government are either unable or unwilling to pay for. This \nwill not preclude such behavior in the future, but it will require the \nCongress to understand what it is doing and make a discreet judgment \nthat that is the course of action that it is willing to undertake.\n  Having said that, I think there is going to be a surprise and \ndisappointment, however, upon the final passage of the bill if it is in \nbasically the form that is currently before Members. That is that many \nfeel it is going to undo existing mandates.\n  I have seen news accounts of Governors and other executives at the \nlocal level who have talked about the amount of savings that will be \nderived as a result of passage of this bill. As I read the bill and \nunderstand its processes, it is all prospective in operation. That is, \nit will make it more difficult to impose new unfunded mandates, but it \nin no way deals directly with those mandates that are already in place. \nThat is what makes this amendment so important.\n  What title III does is it sets up a parallel process that gives us a \ngreater capacity to look at current unfunded mandates and, on a case-\nby-case basis, particularly through the reauthorization process, to \nbegin to deal with those unfunded mandates.\n  I recognize that the bill provides that in a reauthorization, \nwhatever the current status of unfunded mandates is does not trigger \nthe mechanisms of this bill. It is only if we elevate further an \nadditional $50 million of imposition on State and local governments, \nwill the mechanisms of this specific bill relate to existing, enhanced, \nenlarged, engorged, unfunded mandates.\n  But what title III--which is what we are amending--provides is there \nwill be a systematic look back at all of the unfunded mandates. That \nwill provide Members the opportunity to receive a thoughtful, \nquantitative analysis of the unfunded mandates which are in the current \nlaw, present those to the appropriate authorization committees so that \nwhen bills are being considered at the committee level in hearings and \nthen later considered on the floor to final adoption, we will be in a \nposition to offer amendments that relate to those current levels of \nunfunded mandates. And if successful, if we believe it is appropriate \nand wise, to eliminate, reduce, or redirect the nature of the current \nunfunded mandates.\n  The reason it is so important we pass this amendment and place that \nresponsibility for doing that analysis of existing unfunded mandates in \nthe Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations is because it is \ncompetent to do that job; it has a high level of confidence by persons \nat the local, State, and Federal level. It has been in business since \n1959.\n  It is not an entity which is going to be new to this issue, as \nSenator Dorgan said. In fact, the ACIR has conducted some five major \nstudies of unfunded mandates within the last 10 years. So it will bring \na tremendous amount of expertise to this issue, and the ability to \napply that expertise on an expedited basis.\n  There are some very important reauthorizations which contain some of \nthe most egregious examples of unfunded mandates that are going to be \ncoming before this 104th Congress. It is very much in our interest that \nwe have an entity which can quickly move to do that analysis and make \nthat information available to Members so that during the course of the \nnext 2 years, we will be in a position to make some thoughtful \njudgments in existing legislation as to whether we wish to continue \nexisting unfunded mandates.\n  Mr. President, for those reasons, I want to commend Senator Dorgan \nfor having offered this amendment and I am very pleased to join with \nSenator Dorgan and his colleagues in its support.\n  I urge to my colleagues its adoption.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I, too, appreciate what the Senator \nfrom North Dakota has carried out. It just makes a great deal of sense \nto use an existing commission where we already have different \nrepresentatives from the impacted organizations serving as opposed to \ncreating a new commission. I think that makes very good sense.\n   [[Page S940]] Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. What is the regular \norder?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield for inquiry?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. What is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order will be to vote on the \nDorgan amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. A further parliamentary inquiry. And I appreciate my \nfriend from North Dakota yielding for this purpose. Further \nparliamentary inquiry. Does that mean absent unanimous consent we would \nhave the vote that originally had been scheduled at 2:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Unmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Further reserving the right to object--I probably will \nnot, but further reserving the right to object, if it would be in order \nfor me to ask the distinguished majority leader, might he tell me, if \nthis modification occurred, how many more votes we would have and when \nwe would finish voting?\n  Mr. DOLE. I would like to accommodate the Senator from Vermont and \nothers by having back-to-back votes and have the Senator out of here by \n5 after 3 or 6 or 7 after 3. I do not know whether that accommodates \nthe Senator or not. So if we work it out, if we have back-to-back \nvotes, that will be it for today.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will not object. I would only note, not that it affects \nit, if we had had the vote at 2:30, I would have been able to make my 3 \no'clock flight to Vermont to be with my family today. This way I will \nnot.\n  On things that we know we can work out, I would hope, for those of us \nwho do have families and do have homes in our home States and do prefer \nto be there on weekends, that we might be able to have some more \nexactness when some of these votes will occur. I know the leaders on \nboth sides were working hard on it, but it is unfortunate something is \nhappening now that could easily have happened 1\\1/2\\ hours ago.\n  I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has the floor.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 18, as modified\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to modify my amendment. I have \nsent the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, the \namendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 39, strike out lines 4 through 11 and insert in \n     lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SEC. 301. BASELINE STUDY OF COSTS AND BENEFITS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Advisory Commission on \n     Intergovernmental Relations (hereafter in this title referred \n     to as the ``Advisory Commission''), in consultation with the \n     Director, shall begin a study to examine the measurement and \n     definition issues involved in calculating the total costs and \n     benefits to State, local, and tribal governments of \n     compliance with Federal law.\n       (b) Considerations.--The study required by this section \n     shall consider--\n       (1) the feasibility of measuring indirect costs and \n     benefits as well as direct costs and benefits of the Federal, \n     State, local, and tribal relationship; and\n       (2) how to measure both the direct and indirect benefits of \n     Federal financial assistance and tax benefits to State, \n     local, and tribal governments.\n\n     SEC. 302. REPORT ON UNFUNDED FEDERAL MANDATES BY ADVISORY \n                   COMMISSION ON INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Advisory Commission on \n     Intergovernmental Relations shall in accordance with this \n     section--\n       On page 43, beginning with line 1, strike out all through \n     line 17 on page 49 and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SEC. 303. SPECIAL AUTHORITIES OF ADVISORY COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Experts and Consultants.--For purposes of carrying out \n     this title, the Advisory Commission may procure temporary and \n     intermittent services of experts or consultants under section \n     3109(b) of title 5, United States Code.\n       (b) Detail of Staff of Federal Agencies.--Upon request of \n     the Executive Director of the Advisory Commission, the head \n     of any Federal department or agency may detail, on a \n     reimbursable basis, any of the personnel of that department \n     or agency to the Advisory Commission to assist it in carrying \n     out this title.\n       (c) Contract Authority.--The Advisory Commission may, \n     subject to appropriations, contract with and compensate \n     government and private persons (including agencies) for \n     property and services used to carry out its duties under this \n     title.\n\n     SEC. 304. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Advisory \n     Commission--\n       (1) to carry out section 301, and section 302 $1,250,000 \n     for each of fiscal years 1995 and 1996.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might just in brief seconds explain \nthe modification. The modification is one that we have discussed with \nthe sponsors of the amendment, and it would make a change with respect \nto the number of years and the number of dollars and the duties of this \ncommission. It would eliminate something called section 303, and it \nwould provide funding for the exercise of duties under section 301 and \n302 for $1.25 million each of the years 1995 and 1996. This new version \nstill comports with this bill's original thinking of what the \ncommission would do. It accomplishes the result of the amendment. And I \nappreciate the indulgence of my colleagues to explain the modification.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Does the Senator request the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, also we have another amendment. I am \ngoing to ask unanimous consent that it follow immediately after the \nvote that is going to occur on the amendment of Senator Dorgan. This \nsimply deals with that issue, to further clarify that S. 1 will be able \nto, in a report, define if there is any area of competitive \ndisadvantage to the private sector.\n  So I ask unanimous consent a rollcall vote on the Kempthorne-Cochran-\nLevin amendment regarding committee reports on competitive balance \nimmediately follow the vote on the Dorgan amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we cannot \norder rollcall votes by unanimous consent.\n  I have no objection to setting the amendment aside for this \namendment. I think it improves the bill and that is what I have been \nadvised by Senator Levin and others. But we cannot get that consent.\n  Mr. DOLE. Set it aside, offer it, and then have a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have no objection, if the Senator makes the request to \nset the amendment aside and that a vote occur immediately on the \nsecond. I have no problem with that but we have to order the yeas and \nnays by a show of hands.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Then my unanimous consent would embody what the \nSenator from West Virginia has so stated, and following that, so we \nwould have a recorded vote, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection that it be in order to \norder the yeas and nays at this time? Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Idaho please send the \nsecond amendment to the desk.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 19\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I now send the second amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S941]]\n\n  The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne], for himself, Mr. Cochran and \nMr. Levin, proposes an amendment numbered 19.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 15, line 12, after ``nesses'' insert the following: \n     ``including a description of the actions, if any, taken by \n     the Committee to avoid any adverse impact on the private \n     sector or the competitive balance between the public sector \n     and the private sector.''\n\n\n                        vote on amendment no. 18\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question now \noccurs on amendment No. 18, offered by the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I rise at the end of our day to speak to \nthe subject with which the House and Senate began the day, which is the \ncrisis of currency and foreign exchange in Mexico and the prospect \nthat, unless there is a quite extraordinary and urgent action in the \nUnited States, the Government of Mexico might default on its foreign \nobligations, a matter which would have repercussions not just \nthroughout the Western Hemisphere, not just in our own economy and that \nof Canada and the rest of Latin America as already has been the case in \nArgentina and Brazil, but, indeed, repercussions throughout the world. \nA world of previously rigidly controlled, usually government-controlled \neconomies that have been moving toward free markets in the general \nshift of attitudes that have come with the end of the cold war, and \nwith the appearance of wholly new and quite revolutionary currency \nmarket systems.\n  Mr. President, we have to act. We have to act now, immediately. And \nevery day that goes by is a day in which the difficulty of acting \neffectively becomes more problematic.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, it would be our intent that next \nTuesday, at 9:30 a.m. we would again take up S. 1. At that time I would \nbe asking for a unanimous-consent agreement that we would lay aside the \nnext two committee amendments and that we would then have before the \nSenate the pending business of the amendment found on page 25.\n  I would not make that unanimous consent request until Tuesday \nmorning. And on behalf of the leader I announce that it is possible \nthat there could be votes prior to the 12:30 recess on Tuesday.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I was saying that we are in the midst of a regional \ncrisis which could become a global crisis in very short order. Such are \nthe speeds with which currency markets move at this time, such is the \nenormous amount of capital not controlled by governments. Such is the \ncapacity already in evidence in our region to reconsider the whole \ndegree of risk involved in these new economies. This week's ``The \nEconomist'' speaks of this matter in no fewer than three separate \npieces.\n  I speak, sir, in support of the general outlines as they are \nunderstood presently of the agreements reached on a bipartisan basis \nbetween the Members of the Senate, the leadership in the House, the \nadministration, and, of course, the Federal Reserve Board in the person \nof our distinguished chairman, Alan Greenspan.\n   [[Page S942]] This morning, we met with Mr. Rubin, our Secretary of \nthe Treasury, Mr. Greenspan, and Dr. Summers, who is the Treasury \nUndersecretary and is deeply involved in these matters.\n  A number of persons mentioned the degree to which there was already a \nreaction in this country--on radio call-in shows and such like--\nspeaking in various degrees of censure and animosity about those in \nthis Chamber and the other body who had supported the North American \nFree-Trade Agreement and now find themselves having to associate with \nthis emergency action in a crisis atmosphere.\n  I would like to speak as one who did not support that agreement, who \nwas opposed from the first, and yet who very much supports the measures \nwe are working on even as I speak, and to make the point that this was \nalways a close question in the Senate.\n  On May 24, 1991, on the issue of giving the administration--then the \nadministration of President Bush--fast-track authority to negotiate a \nNorth American Free-Trade Agreement, 36 of us in this body--a large \nnumber--voted not to do so. A position which I believe, in retrospect, \nmight have given a little more sense of treading carefully to our \nnegotiators. But there you are.\n  The agreement was negotiated beginning after that vote, and \neventually it came to the Committee on Finance, as such trade \nagreements do. By then I was chairman of the committee and was one of \nfour members of the committee who voted not to report the bill \nfavorably, although fully intent that the bill be reported, as clearly \n16 members of the committee wished to be done, and as the President, \nPresident Clinton, had assumed the same position of his predecessor in \nthis regard, as was also the case of the Uruguay round.\n  The bill came to the floor in November 1993 and, again, the approval \nwas not overwhelming. It was 61 to 38. Of course, there was a great \ndeal of opposition from a very wide range, wide spectrum of opponents, \nand they might at this point be tempted to assert they had been right \nall along.\n  I would like to take a different view. I would like to make the case \nthat the arguments, such as they were, against this agreement had to do \nwith the nature of the Mexican polity. I was one who absolutely \nsupported a free-trade agreement with Canada, a country that has a \nregime of law similar to our own, a tradition of an impartial and \nindependent judiciary, of free elections, of basically a market system \nin their economy in which differences, when they arise, are settled \naccording to procedures that are well understood and agreed to by both \nparties.\n  It is simply the case, Mr. President, that these conditions still do \nnot exist in Mexico. They are not wholly absent and in no sense can we \nsuggest--can we or ought we suggest--that they will not evolve. But \nthey have not yet done so. The Mexican Government remains fundamentally \na one-party state. Other parties are tolerated, and there have been \noccasions recently in which the PRI, the Party of the Institutionalized \nRevolution, has, in fact, accepted defeat in a local election.\n  But, in the main, since the 1920's, there has been one party, and it \nhas dominated all aspects of the national life.\n  At the time, and particularly under President Cardenas in the 1930's, \nit was a great achievement. We tend, because of our own tradition, I \nsuppose, to pay a great deal of attention to the onset of revolution \nand instability, if you will. That, in fact, Mr. President, is a very \nordinary event. It happens with the frequency of hurricanes in the \nCaribbean. A much more rare event in world history is the onset of \nstability.\n  Mexico had been a hugely unstable society, largely because--if I can \noffer a thought, and I see my friend from New Mexico is on the floor \nand he would have a better, closer sense than I--but the Mexican polity \nhad never developed a device for yielding office.\n  It has frequently been remarked by American Presidents that the \nAmerican democracy really began--oh, Philadelphia was fine, the \ninauguration of George Washington was fine--but democracy really began \nwhen John Adams learned he had lost the election to Thomas Jefferson, \nturned over a mostly empty Treasury, the Great Seal, what there was of \nthe Army, and left for Massachusetts, thinking that he had been a \nfailure when, in fact, he had proven in a democracy that free election \ncan bring a transfer of party and power.\n  That has never happened in Mexico. What has happened is that the \ninvention was that a President would leave office but he would choose \nhis successor and would find himself frequently in an advantaged and \nattractive position in the aftermath of a single term.\n  But it also meant that there were no free elections; and in addition, \nthat there were frequent, dramatic violations of human rights. Freedom \nHouse and Americas Watch have recorded this with great care and \nconcern--not hostility, but concern. Americas Watch reported not 2 \nyears ago that torture was endemic in Mexico. Not that it happened here \nand there, but it was endemic; it was a device of social control, \ntorture--not long prison sentences or the like, but torture as a wholly \nillegal, extralegal, but normal practice.\n  The judiciary had no independence. And the outcome of the election \nwas a given, excepting on occasion, very rarely, very infrequently, \nwhen another party was allowed to prevail.\n  In that circumstance, Mr. President, I believed that we would be \nassociating ourselves--we would, as we have done--in intricate \neconomic-social relations with a polity very different from our own and \nvery problematic as regards those aspects of our civilization, our \npolity, if you like, and of Canada's, surely, which we find of central \nimportance.\n  And the agreement we reached itself was problematic in certain \nrespects. For example, the Mexican investors had instant access to \nAmerican markets--open, free, unfettered with that always indispensable \nfeature that you could buy anything you could pay for.\n  For example, a Mexican firm recently purchased a seat on the New York \nStock Exchange. Fine. But the reciprocity you would expect has not \ntaken place. For example, American financial institutions and many \nother American investors have had very restricted access to the Mexican \nmarket. The agreement provided for only limited access, over a very \nlong transition period. Now, at this moment of a financial crisis, the \nMexican Government could very much wish it had done otherwise and \nprovided as much access as anybody wished. And, indeed, they now have \nbegun to do just that, even as the agreement provides otherwise. They \nwould be in a stronger position today if they had done so earlier.\n  They would be in a stronger position today if they had done so in the \nagreement. But the fact they did not was very characteristic of a \nregime not to want any other influences that would challenge its own \npower. This was not an accident. It was a normal response of such a \nregime, not to let any other influences take hold that they could not \ncontrol.\n  Well, sir, they have not been able to do so, and once again we see a \ncrisis of large consequence with international implications. The peso \nhas dropped 40 percent in three weeks or thereabouts. Inflation may \nreach 40 to 50 percent this year. There is a renewed concern, as a \nresult, along that border that reaches from the Caribbean to the \nPacific, with all the consequences for illegal immigration, a matter of \nvery deep concern to States on the border, especially to California.\n  What are we to do? It seems to me we have no alternative and that we \ndo have a real opportunity. If we act, if we provide $40 billion in \nloan guarantees, the plan would be for the Mexican Government to pay a \nfee to compensate us for assuming that risk. That promises technically \nthe guarantor will make money out of such an event in normal \ncircumstances. I do not say this will happen. It could. We issued a \nvery large loan guarantee to the Israelis a few years ago in a matter \nof providing housing for the sudden, huge immigration that was coming \nfrom the Soviet Union, and they were to pay a fee for any bonds backed \nby our dollar guarantee. They have not used that. They have not \nexercised that option at all. But were they to do so, we would be in a \nposition of a lender receiving compensation for a guarantee.\n  But if we do not do this, we face the prospect of not only \ninstability in the currencies of the Western Hemisphere or the \ndeveloping nations around the \n[[Page S943]] world, we face the prospect of mass instability in Mexico \nitself. We have seen this in the Chiapas insurgency which is not yet \nresolved by any means. We have seen it in instances of political \nkillings. I do not want to get in any way abrasive, but I commented on \nthis floor at one point that Mexico is a country where you can murder \narchbishops and say they inadvertently wandered into the line of fire \nin a police action involving drug dealers, which was the equivalent of \nbeing shot while in church.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Paul Gigot, in this morning's Wall Street Journal, \nwrites that if we fail to stem the crisis, we ``can expect more Mexican \nsons and daughters to arrive in San Diego soon''. Unwilling to stay in \nMexico, seeking a promise of better opportunities, overwhelming the \nopportunities of our own people in our own country.\n  We cannot do that. We cannot risk undermining a reviving Argentina \neconomy, a promising Brazilian economy. We cannot put at risk the \nefforts around the world of countries that moved away from centrally \ncontrolled, to use a French term, ``dirigiste'' regimes in which \nAmerican investment is kept out, American goods kept out, autarky I \nthink as the economists would call it, and with the result of economic \nstagnation.\n  The courage--and it takes courage--to open up, to be part of the \nworld economy is more and more in evidence everywhere. That courage \ncould turn into fear and retreat in a very short order if we do not \nact.\n  I would like to congratulate the majority leader of the Senate, \nRobert Dole, and the minority leader, Tom Daschle, for their \nwillingness to meet with the President, in the company of their \ncounterparts from the House, to bring forth a bipartisan American \ninitiative which is very much directed to the protection of American \ninterests, and I hope it succeeds. I hope it finds support on the \nSenate floor with Senators generally as it has done with the \nleadership.\n  I thank my friends for their patience. Mr. President, I thank the \nChair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COHEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I had the opportunity last evening to join \nSenator Dole in meeting with British Gen. Rupert Smith, who will take \ncommand of the United Nations force, known as UNPROFOR, in Bosnia later \nthis month. A few other Senators also had a chance to meet with General \nSmith yesterday.\n  Senator Dole and I expressed admiration for General Smith's \nwillingness to take on this unenviable task. But we also expressed \nskepticism that UNPROFOR can improve its credibility in order to more \neffectively carry out its limited mission of facilitating humanitarian \nrelief and lessening the violence in Bosnia. But the change in command \nin UNPROFOR does at least offer the opportunity to try to adopt \nmeasures to make UNPROFOR more effective.\n  I recall that a year ago, when UNPROFOR's leadership was rotating, \nAmerican military officials responsible for the humanitarian airlift \nand airdrops in Bosnia proposed to take advantage of the situation to \nreestablish UNPROFOR's credibility and its ability to fulfill its \nmandate in Bosnia.\n  They proposed that UNPROFOR end its ```mother may I?' construct of \noperations,'' and they outlined a plan by which UNPROFOR, even with its \nrestrictive rules of engagement and limited troops and equipment, could \nuse force to more effectively carry out its humanitarian mission and \ncurb Serb and other harassment of UNPROFOR. These American military \nofficers warned that if such action were not taken, an already bad \nsituation would quickly get much worse.\n  When he first took command of UNPROFOR in January, Lt. Gen. Michael \nRose took actions that suggested he might follow this advice. But this \ninitial promise faded as General Rose became even more pliable to Serb \ndemands than previous UNPROFOR commanders had been. The results have \nbeen disastrous:\n  UNPROFOR has all along had difficulty supplying food, fuel, and \nmedical supplies to Bosnian civilians suffering the privations of war. \nNow, UNPROFOR cannot be sure it can supply its own emaciated troops.\n  The United Nations declared a weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo \nbut refused to enforce it despite routine Serb violations. Now, it has \neffectively become a Serb-declared exclusion zone from which \nhumanitarian air flights are blocked at the whim of Serb forces.\n  In the past, UNPROFOR had been humiliated by being compelled to \nassist Serbs in the deportation of detained Muslims. Now, UNPROFOR has \nbeen rendered impotent by having its own forces detained and used as \nhuman shields against NATO air attacks. Some UNPROFOR troops seem to \nhave become willing hostages who engage their Serb captors in sports \nand feasts.\n  In short, continued UNPROFOR's submission to Serb demands and threats \nmay make it impossible for it to fulfill its mandate. While things \nappear to have improved in recent weeks, with relief flights resumed \nand U.N. forces not held hostage, this has only been at the discretion \nof the Serbs, who can reverse course at any time. All sides in the \nconflict have sought to manipulate UNPROFOR to their own ends, but Serb \nforces have largely succeeded in making UNPROFOR a tool of Serb \nstrategy, and the recent improvement should be seen in that light.\n  This situation will only get worse over time unless UNPROFOR can gain \ncredibility it has never enjoyed.\n  Either prompt, dramatic action should be taken to establish \nUNPROFOR's credibility and its ability to do its humanitarian job or \nUNPROFOR should be withdrawn from Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n  The plan proposed last winter by American military officers may have \nworked if implemented then, but it is probably too late toady. Certain \nelements of that plan, however, are still relevant and even more \ncritical in light of Croatia's recent announcement not to extend \nUNPROFOR's mandate in that country beyond March 31:\n  Discredited UNPROFOR leaders cannot change the situation. Any effort \nto revitalize UNPROFOR must be accompanied by new leaders. General \nRose, the UNPROFOR commander in Bosnia, will be replaced on January 24 \nby General Smith. Yasushi Akashi, the U.N. Secretary General's \nrepresentative for the former Yugoslavia, must be replaced, as well.\n  The U.N.-declared no-fly zones and weapons-exclusion zones in Bosnia, \nnow widely flouted, primarily by the Serbs, should be enforced. This \nincludes the withdrawal of SAM's from the zone and deactivation of \nSAM's in the surrounding area that threaten NATO aircraft policing the \nzones.\n  UNPROFOR should no longer tolerate checkpoints operated by \nbelligerents nor should it pay tolls, extortion by belligerents of fuel \nand other humanitarian supplies. If belligerents question whether a \nconvoy is going to its declared civilian destination, they should be \npermitted to ride the convoy.\n  UNPROFOR should organize is convoys along military lines and reject \nSerb demands that include armored vehicles and similar demands.\n  Any use of force or threat of force against UNPROFOR should be met \nwith force. While such retaliation must be measured according to its \nobjective, it need not be limited to retaliation against the specific \noffending forces, given the targeting difficulties often involved and \nthe need for UNPROFOR to acquire the upper hand.\n  As for the concern that adopting such an approach would endanger \nUNPROFOR troops now detained by Serbs, the reality is that unless such \nan approach is adopted immediately, all UNPROFOR troops will be \nendangered--whether formally detained or not. Action can either be \ntaken to reverse the current situation, or it will only get worse.\n  If UNPROFOR refuses to adopt such an approach, it should be withdrawn \nin \n[[Page S944]] as swift and orderly a manner as possible. The United \nStates should, of course, provide the necessary assistance to help our \nallies and friends in UNPROFOR withdraw. This may include the temporary \ndeployment of ground forces in Bosnia. End the impotence or end the \nmission.\n  Any action by any of the belligerents to interfere with the \nwithdrawal of UNPROFOR should be met by overwhelming force. Such force \nshould not be limited to targeting those belligerent forces directly \ninvolved in interfering with the withdrawal. Instead, given the \ndifficulties often involved in targeting the offending forces and the \nneed to dominate the battlefield during a withdrawal, targets could \ninclude anything of military, political or economic value to the \nbelligerents. Nor should we exclude targets outside Bosnia-Herzegovina, \ngiven that much of the impetus and sustenance for the conflict has come \nfrom outside its border.\n  Once UNPROFOR has withdrawn, NATO should continue to enforce the \nexclusion zone around Sarajevo to the extent possible without \nexcessively endangering allied forces.\n\n\n                       the broader balken context\n\n  Given the Clinton administration's support for keeping UNPROFOR in \nBosnia, and presumably trying to make it more effective there, the \nadministration should work with our allies to reverse Croatia's \ndecision to end UNPROFOR's mandate in that country. This might be \npossible if, parallel to adopting the measures I have proposed for \nUNPROFOR in Bosnia, a serious effort were made to revitalize UNPROFOR \nin Croatia, where it has been as much a tool of Serb strategy as in \nBosnia.\n  The Clinton administration has nominally recognized the former \nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], but in response to pressure \nfrom domestic groups has refused to fulfill this decision by sending an \nambassador. This is an important foreign policy issue, not a election \nspoil. A professional diplomat should be dispatched forthwith as \nambassador with a mandate to assist in the reconciliation among ethnic \ngroups in that country and between Skopje and Athens.\n  Both Presidents Bush and Clinton threatened to use military force \nagainst Serbia if it should employ blatant force in Kosovo, Serbia's \nAlbania-populated province along its southern border with Albania and \nMacedonia. While Serbia has been slowly tightening its grip over the \nonce autonomous Kosovo, this American threat remains useful to \ndiscourage overt and widespread violence. Congress should explicitly \nendorse this threat to make it more credible.\n  Mr. President, during our meeting yesterday, General Rose emphasized \nthat he was going to have to play the hand he has been dealt, and do so \nwith the players who are already at the table, including the Bosnian \nSerb leadership.\n  It is true that we have to shape our policy based on the situation as \nit exists today. No one can go back and undue what has happened over \nthe last 3 years. But we can learn from the mistakes of the last 3 \nyears.\n  The measures I have proposed would seek to do so. But from what I \nheard from General Smith, I am afraid that UNPROFOR will continue down \nthe path it is on. If so, the quagmire that is now up to its waist will \nsoon be up to its neck. And at that point, the task of pulling it out \nand bringing it home will be much more difficult and costly.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dole pertaining to the introduction of S. 230 are \nlocated in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/13/senate-section/article/S943-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-82.

A bill to designate additional land as within the Chaco \nCulture Archaeological Protection Sites, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  the chacoan outliers protection act\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nChacoan Outliers Protection Act of 1995. This legislation will expand \nthe Chaco culture archaeological protection sites to include an \nadditional 5,516 acres containing structures and artifacts associated \nwith the Chacoan Anasazi Indian culture of the San Juan Basin of New \nMexico.\n  Chaco Canyon lies within the San Juan Basin in northwestern New \nMexico, an area of major significance to the cultural history of North \nAmerica. It is estimated that the first human occupation of the area \ndates as far back as 10,000 years ago, when Paleo-Indian hunters \nentered the area.\n  The culture of these hunter-gatherers evolved quickly. Within the \nperiod spanning from 500 to 900 A.D., the culture of the people of the \nSan Juan Basin, part of a larger culture known as the Anasazi, a Navajo \nterm meaning ``the ancient ones,'' had developed more quickly than \nnearby Anasazi communities and cultures.\n  While modern-day Chaco Canyon is a remote and barren site, ancient \nChaco Canyon was the center of the Anasazi civilization. The Anasazi \nflourished, building more pueblos and structures around Chaco Canyon \nand establishing a large network of outlying communities, which are \nwhat we now refer to as the Chacoan outliers. These outliers were \nspread over an area of more than 30,000 square miles and linked by an \nextensive system of roads.\n  As suddenly as the Anasazi evolved and thrived in the San Juan area, \nby 1300 A.D. the culture just as quickly disappeared, lasting only a \nbrief 400 years. The sudden evolution and disappearance of the Anasazi, \nas well as the purpose of Chaco Canyon and its outliers, are two of \narchaeology's more intriguing mysteries.\n  It is traditionally believed that Chaco was a trade center for as \nmany as 75 outlying communities in the area. Other maintain that Chaco \nwas a religious and ceremonial site. While no one is certain exactly \nwhat function Chaco served in its time, all agree that its remaining \nsites must be preserved and protected.\n  Chaco Canyon has long been recognized as a nationally and \ninternationally significant site. In March 1907, a Presidential \nproclamation established Chaco Canyon as a national monument. The \nmonument was further enlarged in 1928 by another Presidential \nproclamation.\n  I have long been a supporter of preserving these precious areas. In \n1980, I introduced and the Congress passed the Chaco Culture National \nHistorical Park Establishment Act, which became Public Law 96-550. This \nact enlarged the park and reestablished it as the Chaco Culture \nNational Historical Park, consisting of the main body of the park and \nthree noncontiguous units. The act also mandated procedures for the \nprotection, preservation, and administration of archaeological remnants \nof the Chacoan culture.\n  When Chaco Canyon was first afforded Federal protection in 1907, \nnumerous aracheological sites were known to exist outside the \nboundaries of the national monument. Their relationship to Chaco \nCanyon, however, was unclear. Archaeologists subsequently determined \nthat many of these sites--some as far as 100 miles from Chaco Canyon--\nwere part of the Chacoan culture.\n  To the untrained eye, the physical remains of the Chacoan outliers \nare difficult to discern. At some of the sites, walls still stand. At \nmost sites, however, the magnificent structures of the Anasazi people \nhave collapsed into a mound of rubble, which over the years have been \nburied by the desert sands and eroded by sand and wind. Unfortunately, \nmany of these sites were further vandalized by unscrupulous pot hunters \nor degraded by development activities.\n  In order to protect these outliers, the Chaco Culture National \nHistorical Park Establishment Act designated 33 sites as Chaco culture \narchaeological protection sites. The Secretary of the Interior is \ncharged with managing these sites in order to preserve them and provide \nfor their interpretation and study. Activities that would endanger the \ncultural values of the sites are prohibited.\n  Ownership of the lands containing the archaeological protection sites \nis a checkerboard of private, State, Federal, and Indian interests. The \nIndian interests include trust, allotted, and fee parcels. In addition, \nsome surface and subsurface ownerships are divided between two or more \nentities. Therefore, the act mandated that these lands be protected by \ncooperative agreements, rather than Federal acquisition, where \npossible.\n  The Chacoan outliers are not included in the National Park System. \nRather, they are managed primarily by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the \nNavajo Nation, and the Bureau of Land Management. These entities are \nresponsible for resource protection and preservation at the sites.\n  This legislation will expand the existing Chaco culture \narchaeological protection sites system to add a total of eight new \nsites, and deleting two others. Of the two sites deleted, one has been \nincorporated into El Malpais National Monument, and the other is owned \nand protected by the Ute mountain tribe which prefers to manage this \nsite. The additions are all publicly owned. This legislation also \nmodifies the boundaries of certain already designated protection sites.\n  Included in these new archaeological protection sites is the first \nForest Service site, Chimney Rock in southern Colorado. The Manuelito \nsites have been designated as ``Priority 1 National Historic \nLandmarks'' because severe erosion has damaged the sites. The Morris 41 \nsite was added to the list as a result of hearings in the Senate \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources last year.\n  The net results of the changes to be made by the Chacoan Outliers \nProtection Act would be to increase the number of Chaco culture \narchaeological protection sites from 33 to 39 and to increase the \nacreage of the system by 5,516 acres to 14,372 acres.\n  This legislation also authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to use \na combination of land acquisition authority and cooperative agreements \nto provide archaeological resources protection at those sites remaining \nin private ownership. Testimony received during hearings in the House \nof Representatives last year indicated that the Department of the \nInterior did not have authority to purchase sites without clear \nevidence of damage or destruction of the Chacoan resources located in \nsuch areas. The bill was modified by the House to authorize the \nacquisition of such sites before they are destroyed.\n  Twenty-five of the thirty-nine sites designated under this bill are \nunder Navajo jurisdiction. The Navajo people have preserved these \nresources in the past, but no single agency has previously taken the \nlead role in assisting the Navajo Nation in these efforts to ensure \nthat the Navajo Nation will have a meaningful and equitable role in \nmanaging the Chaco sites. Therefore, this bill directs the Secretary to \nassist the Navjo Nation in the protection and management of the sites \nlocated on lands under the Navajo Nation's jurisdiction.\n  These changes are the result of dedicated years of research, \nrecommendations, and assistance from Federal, \n[[Page S946]] State, and Indian officials and organizations, \narchaeologists, the Interagency Management Group and the Chaco Culture \nArchaeological Protection Sites, the National Park Service, the Bureau \nof Indian Affairs, the Bureau of Land Management, the Forest Service, \nthe Navajo Nation, and the State of New Mexico. These changes are also \nin accordance with the 1983 Joint Management Plan for the Chaco culture \narchaeological protection sites.\n  This bill is similar to the modified version of S. 310 from the 103d \nCongress. This bill was approved in the Senate, modified slightly by \nthe House, and was one of many public lands bills cleared for floor \naction by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, but \nnever brought to the floor for final passage. I am hopeful we will be \nable to overcome the final hurdle and will pass legislation during the \n104th Congress. These sites are part of the cultural heritage of all \nAmericans and we must act quickly to preserve them. Cultural resources, \nonce lost, can never be restored or regained.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 226\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

A bill to require the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to conduct risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses \nin promulgating regulations relating to human health and the \nenvironment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n\n     the epa risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis act of 1995\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that \nwould improve the Environmental Protection Agency's implementation of \nthe Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and other environmental laws by \nrequiring that, before issuing certain major regulations, the EPA \nAdministrator must conduct a risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis.\n  The bill is identical to the Johnston-Baucus-Moynihan amendment, \nwhich was approved by a vote of 90 to 8 and incorporated into section \n18 of the Safe Drinking Water Act that the Senate passed last year. \nThat amendment is described, in detail, on pages S5875-5881 of the May \n18, 1994, Record.\n  By way of brief background, we in Congress sometimes react to the \nproblems of the day. We passed the Superfund law in 1980 as a reaction \nto the disaster at Love Canal. The Oil Pollution Control Act was passed \nafter several tankers went aground fouling our coastal waters. And so \non.\n  For the most part these are sound laws that protect our health and \nour environment. But, Mr. President, it is the rare case when Congress \nhas all the information when these laws are enacted. Most often we are \nreacting to the most recent examples of the problem, which \nunfortunately are just the tip of the iceberg.\n  But it is regulatory agencies like EPA who have the responsibility to \naddress the rest of the problem. And, when they do, they are almost \nalways faced with difficult task of deciding how much protection is \nsufficient.\n  We may never have enough information to legislate the right level of \nprotection in every case. But what we can do is make sure that these \njudgments are fair, unbiased, and based on the best information and \nanalyses available.\n  That is the purpose of this bill. It requires EPA to conduct a \nthorough assessment of the risks before it issues a major regulation. \nIt also requires the Administrator to certify that the benefits \noutweigh the costs, that the best available information was used, and \nthat there are no other alternatives that are more cost-effective.\n  This will ensure that the public and everyone affected by the \nregulation will have full disclosure. They will know what is behind the \nregulation and why it is needed. They will also know how the risk \naddressed by the regulation compare with other risks encouraged in \neveryday life.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe in the principles of risk assessment. \nBut it must be applied fairly, and must not be used to masquerade \nefforts to undermine environmental protection.\n  Unlike some other risk assessment proposals, this bill will not roll \nback the environmental gains we have already made, or tie the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency in knots. It is limited to key rules \nthat have a major \n[[Page S947]] economic impact. It requires a careful assessment or \nregulatory benefits, including environmental benefits that may be \ndifficult to calculate. It will not trigger a flurry of lawsuits that \nclog the courts. Instead, it applies risk assessment judiciously, so \nthat we can improve our efforts to protect human health and the \nenvironment.\n  In closing, I wish to complement Senator Johnston, who has worked \nhard on this issue for several years and negotiated a solid compromise \nduring the last Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 229\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. RISK ASSESSMENT AND COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS.\n\n       (a) Requirement.--Except as provided in subsection (b), in \n     promulgating any proposed or final major regulation relating \n     to human health or the environment, the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency shall publish in the Federal \n     Register along with the regulation a clear and concise \n     statement that--\n       (1) describes and, to the extent practicable, quantifies \n     the risks to human health or the environment to be addressed \n     by the regulation (including, where applicable and \n     practicable, the human health risks to significant \n     subpopulations who are disproportionately exposed or \n     particularly sensitive);\n       (2) compares the human health or environmental risks to be \n     addressed by the regulation to other risks chosen by the \n     Administrator, including--\n       (A) at least three other risks regulated by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency or another Federal agency; \n     and\n       (B) at least three other risks that are not directly \n     regulated by the Federal Government;\n       (3) estimates--\n       (A) the costs to the United States Government, State and \n     local governments, and the private sector of implementing and \n     complying with the regulation; and\n       (B) the benefits of the regulation;\n\n     including both quantifiable measures of costs and benefits, \n     to the fullest extent that they can be estimated, and \n     qualitative measures that are difficult to quantify; and\n       (4) contains a certification by the Administrator that--\n       (A) the analyses performed under paragraphs (1) through (3) \n     are based on the best reasonably obtainable scientific \n     information;\n       (B) the regulation is likely to significantly reduce the \n     human health or environmental risks to be addressed;\n       (C) there is no regulatory alternative that is allowed by \n     the statute under which the regulation is promulgated and \n     that would achieve an equivalent reduction in risk in a more \n     cost-effective manner, along with a brief explanation of why \n     other such regulatory alternatives that were considered by \n     the Administrator were found to be less cost-effective; and\n       (D) the regulation is likely to produce benefits to human \n     health or the environment that will justify the costs to the \n     United States Government, State and local governments, and \n     the private sector of implementing and complying with the \n     regulation.\n       (b) Substantially Similar Final Regulations.--If the \n     Administrator determines that a final major regulation is \n     substantially similar to the proposed version of the \n     regulation with respect to each of the matters referred to in \n     subsection (a), the Administrator may publish in the Federal \n     Register a reference to the statement published under \n     subsection (a) for the proposed regulation in lieu of \n     publishing a new statement for the final regulation.\n       (c) Reporting.--If the Administrator cannot certify with \n     respect to one or more of the matters addressed in subsection \n     (a)(4), the Administrator shall identify those matters for \n     which certification cannot be made, and shall include a \n     statement of the reasons therefor in the Federal Register \n     along with the regulation. Not later than March 1 of each \n     year, the Administrator shall submit a report to Congress \n     identifying those major regulations promulgated during the \n     previous calendar year for which complete certification was \n     not made, and summarizing the reasons therefor.\n       (d) Other Requirements.--Nothing in this section affects \n     any other provision of Federal law, or changes the factors \n     that the Administrator is authorized to consider in \n     promulgating a regulation pursuant to any statute, or shall \n     delay any action required to meet a deadline imposed by \n     statute or a court.\n       (e) Judicial Review.--Nothing in this section creates any \n     right to judicial or administrative review, nor creates any \n     right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at \n     law or equity by a party against the United States, its \n     agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or \n     any other person. If a major regulation is subject to \n     judicial or administrative review under any other provision \n     of law, the adequacy of the certification prepared pursuant \n     to this section, and any alleged failure to comply with this \n     section, may not be used as grounds for affecting or \n     invalidating such major regulation, although the statements \n     and information prepared pursuant to this section, including \n     statements contained in the certification, may be considered \n     as part of the record for judicial or administrative review \n     conducted under such other provision of law.\n       (f) Definition of Major Regulation.--For purposes of this \n     section, ``major regulation'' means a regulation that the \n     Administrator determines may have an effect on the economy of \n     $100,000,000 or more in any one year.\n       (g) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect 180 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 227. A bill to amend title 17, United States Code, to provide an \nexclusive right to perform sound recordings publicly by means of \ndigital transmissions and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n         THE PERFORMANCE RIGHTS IN SOUND RECORDINGS ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. HATCH.\n  Mr. President, today, together with my distinguished colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, I am introducing the Performance Rights \nin Sound Recordings Act of 1995.\n  Despite that complicated title this legislation is in fact a simple \nbill that amends the Copyright Act by giving those who create sound \nrecordings the basic copyright protections that current law gives to \nall other creators. Specifically, the bill provides that the copyright \nowners of sound recordings have the right to benefit from the digital \ntransmissions that may be made of their music.\n  Thus, like other copyright owners, such as film and video producers, \nthose who create sound recordings will, on passage of this bill, be \nable to license many of the digital transmissions made of their works.\n  One common illustration of how this disparity in treatment operates \nin practice will demonstrate the irrationality of our current law: Many \nnew recordings are released in video formats as well as in traditional \naudio only form. When the video is broadcast on television or cable, \nthe composer of the music, the publisher of the music, the producer of \nthe video, and the performer of the work are all entitled to a \nperformance right royalty. However, when only the audio recording is \nplayed on the radio or delivered by means of a satellite or other \nsubscription service, only the composer and publisher have performance \nrights that must be respected--even though the audio recording may be \nidentical to the video soundtrack. The producer's and performer's \ninterests are ignored.\n  It should be initially noted, Mr. President, that this bill does not \nimpose new financial burdens on broadcasters or on any other broad \nclass of users who traditionally perform sound recordings. Those users \nwill instead continue to be subject only to those financial burdens \nthat they voluntarily undertake. The aim of this bill is simply to \nlevel the playing field by according to sound recordings most of the \nsame performance rights that all other works capable of performance \nhave long enjoyed.\n  As I noted last Congress, sound recordings are not the only source of \nmusic available to broadcasters, nor is music programming the only \nformat. Should those who may be granted new performance rights in the \ndigital transmission of sound recordings be so unwise as to unfairly \nand unrealistically charge for licensing their works or to actually \nwithhold their works from the public, then the detriment will fall \nprincipally on the very copyright owners that the law is designed to \nprotect. But, in any event, the bill ensures that most digital \ntransmissions of sound recordings will have the right to a license, on \nterms to be negotiated, or if necessary, arbitrated.\n  The basic issue raised by the Performance Rights Act is not new, Mr. \nPresident. The importance of the performance right issue was recognized \nwhen the Copyright Act of 1976 was debated by us, though it was not \nultimately addressed by that act. Congress did, however, request a \nstudy of the issue to be made by the Copyright Office, and that study, \nreleased in 1978, did conclude that a performance right in sound \nrecordings was warranted. This was at a time, it should be noted, when \nfew could have anticipated the \n[[Page S948]] widespread availability of digital technology and the \npossibility for flawless copying that is now a reality.\n  A subsequent study of this issue was provided to the Subcommittee on \nPatents, Copyrights and Trademarks in October 1991, in response to a \njoint request by Chairman DeConcini and Representative Hughes, chairman \nof the House Subcommittee on Intellectual Property. Their request was \nfor an assessment of the effect of digital audio technology on \ncopyright holders and their works. Again, the Copyright Office \nconcluded that sound recordings should, for copyright purposes, be \nequated with other works protected by copyright. From this premise \nflows the inevitable conclusion that the producers and performers of \nsound recordings are entitled to a public performance right, just as \nare all other authors of works capable of performance. Thus, it should \nnot be surprising that the Copyright Office recommended in 1991 that \nCongress enact legislation recognizing the performance right. Senator \nFeinstein and I responded to that recommendation when, in the 103d \nCongress, we filed S. 1421, the Performance Rights in Sound Recordings \nAct of 1993.\n  In the months following introduction of S. 1421, a number of highly \nproductive roundtable discussions were held, along with full hearings \nby the House Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and the \nAdministration of Justice. In these forums, and in private discussions \nand negotiations, a remarkable variety of viewpoints were aired. As a \nresult of this exchange numerous additions to the original text of S. \n1421 have been incorporated in this year's bill, in response to the \nlegitimate concerns of interested parties, including, but not limited \nto, music publishers, composers and songwriters, musicians, \nbroadcasters, cable operators, background music suppliers, and \nperforming rights societies.\n  Principal among these changes is the decision to give the bill a more \nlimited scope. Unlike S. 1421, today's bill does not affect the \ninterests of broadcasters, as that industry has traditionally been \nunderstood. While strong arguments can be made in favor of attaching a \nperformance right to every performance of a sound recording, including \nanalog and digital broadcasts, it is also true that long-established \nbusiness practices within the music and broadcasting industries \nrepresent a highly complex system of interlocking relationships which \nfunction effectively for the most part and should not be lightly upset.\n  Of equal importance is the fact that traditional broadcasting does \nnot present a threat to displace sales of sound recordings to the same \nextent that pay-per-listen, direct satellite, and subscription services \ndo.\n  Currently, sales of recordings in record stores and other retail \noutlets represent virtually the only avenue for the recovery of the \nvery substantial investment required to bring to life a sound \nrecording. There are no royalties payable to the creators of the sound \nrecording for the broadcast or other public performance of the work.\n  If the technological status quo could be maintained, it might well be \nthat the current laws could be tolerated. But, we know that \ntechnological developments such as satellite and digital transmission \nof recordings make sound recordings vulnerable to exposure to a vast \naudience through the initial sale of only a potential handful of \nrecords. Since digital technology permits the making of virtually \nflawless copies of the\n original work transmitted, a potential depression of sales is clearly \nthreatened, particularly when the copyright owner cannot control public \nperformance of the work. And new technologies such as audio on demand \nand pay-per-listen will permit instant access to music, thus negating \neven the need to make a copy.\n\n  But, Mr. President, even if this economic argument were not \npersuasive, fairness and responsible copyright policy nonetheless \ndictate the recognition of the rights embodied in today's bill. As the \nCopyright Office has noted:\n\n       Even if the widespread dissemination by satellite and \n     digital means does not depress sales of records, the authors \n     and copyright owners of sound recordings are unfairly \n     deprived by existing law of their fair share of the market \n     for performance of their works.\n\n(Report on Copyright Implications of Digital Audio Transmission \nServices, Oct. 1991, pp. 156-157).\n  Mr. President, the bill that Senator Feinstein and I are introducing \ntoday is about fairness, plain and simple. Unless Congress is prepared \nto create a hierarchy of artists based on a theory of rewarding some \nforms of creativity but not others, it must adopt a policy of \nnondiscrimination among artists. This should be true whether we are \ntempted to discriminate among artists based on the content of their \ncreations, based on the nature of the works created, or based on the \nmedium in which the works are made available to the public.\n  For too long, American law has tolerated an irrational discrimination \nagainst the creators of sound recordings. Every other copyrighted work \nthat is capable of performance--including plays, operas, ballets, \nfilms, and pantomimes--is entitled to the performance right. It is \ndenied only for sound recordings.\n  It is frankly difficult, Mr. President, to understand the historical \nfailure to accord to the creators of sound recordings the rights seen \nas fundamental to other creators. I acknowledge that in other nations \nsome have advanced the theory that copyright protection should not \nextend to sound recordings. This theory is based on the view that the \nact of embodying a musical work on a disc or tape is more an act of \ntechnical recordation than a creative enterprise. But, this has not \nbeen the American view, nor the view of most nations with advanced \ncopyright systems. Since 1971, Congress has clearly recognized sound \nrecordings as works entitled to copyright on an equal basis with all \nother works.\n  Thus, the joint authors of sound recordings--those who produce them \nand those who perform on them--must be seen as creators fully entitled \nto those rights of reproduction, distribution, adaptation, and public \nperformance that all other authors enjoy. It is, I believe, no longer \npossible to deny the true creative work of the producers of sound \nrecordings. While few are so well known as their stage and film \ncounterparts, there are significant exceptions. In the field of \noperatic recording alone, one could cite legendary figures such as \nWalter Legge, Richard Mohr, or John Culshaw. As the ``New Grove \nDictionary of Opera'' states with reference to the latter's landmark \nWagner recordings of the 1950's, ``Mr. Culshaw's great achievement was \nto develop the concept of opera recording as an art form distinct from \nlive performance.'' (Vol. I, p. 1026; Macmillan Press, 1992). The \nevents referred to occurred over 30 years ago, yet American law still \nfails fully to recognize the sound recording as an art form entitled to \nthe full range of copyright protections enjoyed by live performances.\n  Similarly, the unique creative input of the performing artist as a \njoint author cannot be casually discounted as a proper subject of \ncopyright protection. It has been said that the recording industry was \nalmost single-handedly launched by the public demand for one \nperformer's renditions of works largely in the public domain. Indeed, \nEnrico Caruso's recordings from the early years of this century are \nalmost all still in print today. To take a more contemporary example, \nit could be noted that Willie Nelson authored a country music standard \nwhen he composed ``Crazy,'' a song he has also recorded. But, Patsy \nCline made the song a classic, by her inimitable performance of it.\n  It should be carefully noted, Mr. President, that today's bill is, \nfrankly, compromise legislation. It does not seek to create a full \nperformance right in sound recordings, a right that would extend to the \nmore common analog mode of recording. Also, the digital right that the \nbill does create is limited to subscription transmissions. Other public \nperformances of digital recordings are still exempted from the public \nperformance right that the bill would create.\n  I believe that these major limitations on the rights that we seek to \ncreate today will limit as much as possible the dislocations and \nalterations of prevailing contractual arrangements in the music and \nbroadcasting industries. I am sure I speak for Senator Feinstein as \nwell when I say that we are open to the consideration of additional \nmeans of ensuring that this bill does not have unintended consequences \nfor other copyright owners, be they songwriters, music publishers, \nbroadcasters, or others.\n  [[Page S949]] Mr. President, while today's bill is landmark \nlegislation, it should also be noted that the bill only proposes to \ngive the creators of sound recordings something approaching the minimum \nrights that more than 60 countries already give their creators. In so \ndoing, the legislation should also have extremely beneficial \nconsequences in the international sphere by strengthening America's \nbargaining position as it continues to campaign for strong levels of \nprotection for all forms of intellectual property and by allowing \nAmerican copyright owners to access foreign royalty pools that \ncurrently deny distributions of performance royalties to American \ncreators due to the lack of a reciprocal right in the United States.\n  The absence of a performance right undoubtedly, hindered the efforts \nof United States trade negotiators in addressing matters such as the \nUruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] and \nwill continue to hinder the current efforts of the World Intellectual \nProperty Organization to develop a new instrument to settle the rights \nof producers and performers of sound recordings. In each instance, U.S. \nnegotiators have been faced with the argument from our trading partners \nthat the United States cannot expect other countries to provide \nincreased protection when U.S. law is itself inadequate.\n  Furthermore, in many countries that do provide performance rights for \nsound recordings, there is often a refusal to share any collected \nroyalties with American artists and record companies for the public \nperformance of their recordings in those foreign countries. This is \nbased on the argument that these rights should be recognized only on a \nreciprocal basis. For as long as foreign artists receive no royalties \nfor the public performance of their works in the United States, \nAmerican artists will continue to receive no royalties for the \nperformance of American works in those foreign countries that insist on \nreciprocity.\n  The royalty pools we are talking about here, Mr. President, are, in \nfact, considerable. The Recording Industry Association of America has \nestimated that in 1992 American recording artists and musicians were \nexcluded from royalty pools that distributed performance royalties in \nexcess of $120 million. It is likely that this figure has increased in \nrecent years and will continue to grow.\n  The insistance of certain foreign nations on reciprocity of rights as \na condition to the receipt of performance royalties is inconsistent \nwith the fundamental obligation of those nations to provide national \ntreatment under the Berne Convention on the Protection of Literacy and \nArtistic Property or under the Rome Convention for the Protection of \nPerformers, Producers of Phonograms, and Broadcasting Organizations. It \nis nonetheless an economic fact of life that seriously disadvantages \nAmerican producers and performers and therefore must be dealt with. If \npassed, the Performance Rights in Sound Recordings Act should make it \nmore likely that Americans who are entitled to royalties from foreign \nperformances will be able to recover those funds. Thus, the direct \neconomic benefits to be derived from the legislation are considerable.\n  Before concluding, Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague \nfrom California, Senator Feinstein, for joining me again this year in \nintroducing this important legislation and for drawing our attention to \nthe significant economic consequences involved.\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am joining my distinguished \ncolleague, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator \nHatch of Utah, to introduce once again the Digital Performance Rights \nin Sound Recordings Act. Just as the version on which we collaborated \nlast year did, this bill will--for the first time--provide recording \ncompanies and musical artists with the same protection under copyright \nlaw already enjoyed by songwriters and composers with respect to the \nperformance of digital sound recordings.\n  Senator Hatch and I introduced similar language in the last Congress \nfor the express purpose of beginning in earnest the debate over how to \nredress the current imbalance in copyright law. I'm very pleased that, \nalthough time did not permit final congressional action on the bill \nlast year, virtually all of the affected industries accepted our \ninvitation--and that extended by former Congressman Hughes--to fully \nexplore the complicated legal and commercial issues presented by \ntechnology's inevitable advance.\n  Mr. Hughes, then chair of the House's Subcommittee on Intellectual \nProperty and Judicial Administration, organized two highly effective \nroundtables that brought cable, broadcast, satellite, restaurant, and \nmusic industry leaders together with other copyright holder and labor \norganizations. I also met at great length with many of those principals \nlast February, as did Chairman Hatch and his staff on many, many \noccasions. These efforts, I am pleased to say, produced a sweeping \nagreement on most major aspects of this issue last May.\n  That agreement provided the framework for the bill we have introduced \ntoday. This legislation creates a digital public performance right in \nsound recordings that is applicable to transmissions for which \nsubscribers are charged a fee. Most of these transmissions are subject \nto statutory licensing, at rates to be negotiated, or if necessary, \narbitrated. However, interactive services remain subject to an \nexclusive right, in keeping with the bill as originally introduced last \nCongress. The bill contains protections for licensing of copyrighted \nworks in vertically integrated companies and contains language to make \nclear that the new performance right does not impair any of the other \ncopyright rights under existing law.\n  Ditigal technology, and the industries built around its use to \ndistribute sound recordings, have evolved and advanced dramatically in \nthe 17 months since this legislation was first introduced, Mr. \nPresident. The need to keep America's copyright law current, therefore, \nhas only become more acute.\n  Accordingly, I believe that this Congress has not merely an \nopportunity, but a responsibility, to build on the tremendous \nbipartisan strides made last year by expeditiously considering, \namending if need be, and passing the bill that Senator Hatch and I have \nintroduced today.\n  For those who have not reviewed this issue since the last Congress or \nare new to it, let me briefly review the principal reasons to adopt \nthis legislation:\n  First, it is the fair thing to do. Owners of almost every type of \ncopyrighted work--movies, books, plays, magazines, advertising, and \nartwork, for example--have the exclusive right to authorize the public \nperformance of their copyrighted work. Sound recordings, and the \nartists and companies that make them, however, have no such performance \nright.\n  Accordingly, when a song is played over the radio, or, as is \nincreasingly the case, over a new digital audio cable service, the \nartist who sings the song, the musicians and backup singers, and the \nrecord company whose investment made the recording possible have no \nlegal right to control or to receive compensation for this public \nperformance of their work.\n  The artists who made the music, and the companies that underwrote its \nproduction and promotion, don't see a dime of the revenue realized by \nthe ditigal transmitter. And, without a right of public performance for \nsound recordings by means of digital transmissions, they will not. That \nis just not fair, and this inequity will not be corrected unless and \nuntil this legislation is passed.\n  Second, the advent of digital technology and the emergence of a whole \nnew industry to distribute them directly to the home make prompt \nprotection of artists and record companies critical.\n  Let me explain why. Ordinary, or analog, radio signals are waves and, \nas such, they vary in strength and break down over distance. That \nbreakdown greatly diminishes sound quality.\n  In the past, therefore, the sale of comparatively high-quality \nrecordings on cassette tapes and record albums was not jeopardized by \nthe casual home recording of music played over the radio. The quality \nof home recording over-the-air simply did not compare with what a \nrecord or tape sounded like over a home stereo system.\n  Today, however, the same technology that has given us compact discs \nnow allows perfect reproductions of music to be digitized--turned into \ncomputer ones and zeros--that can be sent by \n[[Page S950]] satellite or over cable TV wires around the globe, and \nreassembled into concert hall quality music in our homes. Predictably, \nand quite legally, this quantum leap in sound technology has had a \nrevolutionary impact on the way that music is marketed.\n  New subscription digital audio services have sprung up in cities, \ntowns, and rural communities across the country. For a modest monthly \nfee, they deliver multiple channels of CD-quality music to customers in \ntheir homes--primarily through subscribers' cable TV wiring.\n  Other companies are experimenting with similar services to be \nprovided through home computers, or more sophisticated systems that \nwill permit the customer at home to custom-order whatever music he or \nshe would like to hear and record. Although it is extremely time-\nconsuming to download a CD today, soon compression technology and high-\nspeed transmission will permit virtual instantaneous access. All one \nwill need is a modem.\n  As the market is now configured, however, these companies need merely \ngo to a local record store, buy a single copy of a compact disc which \nthey can then transmit for a fee to tens of thousands, potentially \nmillions, of subscribers. Because our copyright law is behind the \ntechnological times, record companies and recording artists do not see \na penny of compensation from even one of those thousands of \nperformances.\n  It is thus no exaggeration to say, that, without the change in \ncopyright law proposed today, these wonderful new services have the \npotential to put the current recording industry out of business. Why \ntravel to a store to buy a record, tape, or compact disc when you can \nget the same, or custom-tailored musical packages, in your living room \nat the touch of a button?\n  Frankly, that would be a tolerable evolution of the marketplace if \nartists and record companies were compensated for the use of their \nsound recordings by the new digital transmission services and on-line \nand interactive services. Right now, however, because of skewed \ncopyright law, that is not the way the market works.\n  Neither Senator Hatch nor I suggest that digital audio services \nshould not be able to operate just as they do now to bring top-quality \ndigital signals to American homes. Our bill does insist, however, that \nsuch services not be able to take advantage of a redressable gap in our \ncopyright laws to avoid compensating record companies and artists \nfairly.\n  Third, copyright experts have consistently urged Congress to create a \nright of public performance in sound recordings.\n  The U.S. Copyright Office has recommended since 1978 that a \nperformance right in sound recordings be granted in all public \nperformances, not just digital transmissions, and recently reiterated \nthe urgency of the need for such reform created by the advent of \ndigital audio technology. Indeed, the Copyright Office testified before \nthe House Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial \nAdministration in the last Congress, urgently calling for enactment of \nsuch legislation.\n  In addition, the administration's working group on intellectual \nproperty rights of the information infrastructure task force, in its \npreliminary draft report, recently wrote:\n\n       * * * the lack of a public performance right in sound \n     recordings under U.S. law is an historical anomaly that does \n     not have a strong policy justification--and certainly not a \n     legal one.\n\n  The report also reiterated the administration's support for the bill \nthat Senator Hatch and I introduced in the 103d Congress and for H.R. \n2575, its House counterpart introduced by Representatives William \nHughes and Howard Berman.\n  It is time to heed these expert calls.\n  Fourth, taking the experts' advice also will help U.S. trade \nnegotiators obtain greater protection for American copyright holders \noverseas than they are now able to demand.\n  More than 60 countries around the world extend similar rights to \nproducers and their artists, and have for many years. American \nnegotiators' efforts to obtain protection for our own companies and \nartists have been hampered, as they have said repeatedly,by our \ninability to reciprocate. It is long past time to provide our trade \nrepresentatives with this valuable bargaining chip.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to reiterate that the legislation we \nare introducing today is no different in intent than S. 1421, although \nthe content is somewhat different. We have attempted to continue the \nwork of the last Congress. Furthermore, we are introducing this \nlegislation in the same spirit with which last year's bill was \nsubmitted. Chairman Hatch and I want to continue to work closely with \nall the affected industries to make this as strong and properly \ntailored a piece of legislation as possible.\n  We are standing at the cusp of an exciting digital age. Technological \nadvances, however, must not come at the expense of American creators of \nintellectual property. This country's artists, musicians, and \nbusinesses that bring them to us are truly among our greatest cultural \nassets. This bill recognizes the important contribution that they make \nand provides protection for their creative works, both at home and \nabroad.\n  I am once again very pleased to be working with Senator Hatch to \ncorrect an increasingly dangerous and inappropriate imbalance in our \nNation's copyright laws.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DOLE (for himself, Mr. Simon, Mr. Helms, Mr. Robb, Mr. \n        McCain, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Gramm, and Mr. Hatfield):\n  S. 230. A bill to prohibit United States assistance to countries that \nprohibit or restrict the transport or delivery of United States \nhumanitarian assistance; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                     Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly today to reintroduce \nthe Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act. I am joined again by the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois, Senator Simon, in addition to the \nfollowing cosponsors: Senator McCain, Senator D'Amato, Senator Kennedy, \nand Senator Gramm. In my view, our legislation will further an \nimportant American foreign policy objective: to facilitate the prompt \ndelivery of humanitarian aid. This would be achieved by establishing \nthe principle that if a government obstructs humanitarian aid to other \ncountries, it should not receive U.S. assistance. It seems to me that \nthis is a principle that could be readily accepted by everyone. Very \nsimply, our legislation would prohibit U.S. foreign assistance to \ncountries which prohibit or impede the delivery or transport of U.S. \nhumanitarian assistance to other countries. It makes a lot of sense to \nme.\n  The intended effect of this legislation is to ensure the efficient \nand timely delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance to people in need. \nIt will help deter interference with humanitarian relief, as well as \nprovide for the appropriate response in the event of interference or \nobstructionism.\n  Mr. President, our legislation would be universally applicable--the \nHumanitarian Aid Corridor Act does not single out any one country. It \nwould apply to all relief situations. Currently, however, there is one \ncountry that would clearly be affected. Turkey continues to receive \nlarge amounts of assistance in the form of grants and concessional \nloans financed by the American taxpayer while at the same time, it is \nenforcing an immoral blockade of Armenia. As a result, outside relief \nsupplies must travel circuitous routes, thereby greatly increasing the \ncost of delivery. Moreover, many supplies never make it at all. This \nsame blockade prevents\n care packages from the American Red Cross from entering Armenia, as an \nexample.\n\n  In sum, United States aid to Armenia is far less effective and much \nmore expensive because of Turkey's blockade. More importantly, \nArmenians freeze and go Hungry as a result of actions taken by the \nTurkish Government. The delivery of humanitarian assistance to aid \nthose in need, like the Armenians--is consistent with the fundamental \nvalues of our Nation. This legislation will strengthen our ability to \ndeliver such assistance which is an important component of our foreign \npolicy.\n  Let me repeat, this bill does not name names. The legislation could \napply to many other relief operations. \n[[Page S951]] Indeed the United States conducts relief operations \naround the world, operations that depend on the cooperation of other \ncountries. I recognize that Turkey has been a valuable ally in Nato and \nrecently in Operation Desert Storm.\n  Mr. President, this legislation recognizes that there may be a \ncompelling U.S. National Security interest which would override the \nprinciple of noninterference with Humanitarian aid. For this reason, \nU.S. foreign aid to nations in violation of this act may be continued \nif the president determines that such assistance is in the National \nSecurity Interest of the United States.\n  Mr. President, it does not make sense to me to offer U.S. taxpayer \ndollars unconditionally to countries that hinder our humantiarian \nrelief efforts. In light of budgetary constraints, it is imperative \nthat U.S. relief efforts be timely and efficient. The bottom line is \nthat countries that prevent the delivery of such assistance, or \nintentionally increase the cost of delivering such assistance, do not \ndeserve unrestricted American assistance.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will be referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations where I hope it will get rapid and positive \nconsideration and a good rapid hearing. Similar legislation will be \nintroduced in the House. I hope that Congress will quickly enact this \nlegislation and send it to the White House for approval.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  We are just simply saying if a country blocks humanitarian aid, they \ndo not get any assistance. It seems to me that it is pretty hard to \ndispute that argument or come to any other conclusion, notwithstanding, \nas I said, the fact that Turkey has been an ally.\n  I would hope that Turkish officials would take another look and make \nit easier for people in Armenia to receive humanitarian assistance from \nthe United States.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 230\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Humanitarian Aid Corridor \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States Federal budget deficit and spending \n     constraints require the maximum efficiency in the usage of \n     United States foreign assistance.\n       (2) The delivery of humanitarian assistance to people in \n     need is consistent with the fundamental values of our Nation \n     and is an important component of United States foreign \n     policy.\n       (3) As a matter of principle and in furtherance of fiscal \n     prudence, the United States should seek to promote the \n     delivery of humanitarian assistance to people in need in a \n     manner that is both timely and cost effective.\n       (4) Recipients of United States assistance should not \n     hinder or delay the transport or delivery of United States \n     humanitarian assistance to other countries.\n\n     SEC. 3.

DEFINITION.\n\n       As used in this Act, the term ``United States assistance'' \n     has the same meaning given that term in section 481(e)(4) of \n     the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KEMPTHORNE (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Dole, Mr. Craig, \n        Mr. McCain, Mr. Mack, Mr. Smith, Mr. Lott, Mr. Nickles, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Heflin, \n        Mr. Simpson, Mr. Coats, Mr. Kyl, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Cochran, \n        and Mr. Robb):\n  S.J. Res. 17. A joint resolution naming the CVN-76 aircraft carrier \nas the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n               U.S.S. ``RONALD REAGAN'' AIRCRAFT CARRIER\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I introduce a joint resolution and ask \nthat it be referred to the appropriate committee.\n  The joint resolution I am introducing today was developed with the \nhelp and guidance of the senior Senator from Virginia, Senator John W. \nWarner. Senator Warner and I separately came up with this idea and we \njoined forces to put this resolution together. In addition, Senators \nDole, Thurmond, Craig, Smith, McCain, Mack, Lott, Nickles, Hutchison, \nInhofe, Santorum, Feinstein, Cochran, Kyl, Simpson, Coats, and Heflin \nhave jointed Senator Warner and I as cosponsors of this joint \nresolution.\n  The joint resolution Senator Warner and I are introducing today will \ndirect that the aircraft carrier approved and funded by the last \nCongress, known heretofore as CVN-76, shall be named the U.S.S. Ronald \nReagan. I can think of no better tribute to our Nation's 40th \nPresident.\n  In 1980, Ronald Wilson Reagan was elected the 40th President of the \nUnited States of America. After campaigning on a platform dedicated to \npeace through strength, President Reagan initiated policies to rebuild \nand strengthen America's military power. As a result of the so-called \nReagan build up, President Reagan was able to negotiate the first true \nnuclear arms reduction agreements, the INF Treaty and the START I \naccord, with the Soviet Union.\n  President Reagan also enacted policies to promote democracy and \nchallenge Soviet-style communism around the world. In fact, the policy \nof challenging communism with democracy was given a name, it was called \nthe Reagan doctrine. As a result of the Reagan doctrine, freedom \nfighters in nations such as Afghanistan and Nicaragua were able to \nescape the grip of Communist tyranny.\n  As Commander in Chief, President Reagan never forgot the men and \nwomen who volunteer to wear the uniform of the United States of \nAmerica. Indeed, President Reagan's policies and actions restored the \nrespect given to American military personnel around the world.\n  President Reagan served his Nation for 2 terms with unmatched style \nand grace. After his first term in office, an appreciative nation \nreelected President Reagan with a 49-State landslide. Throughout his 8 \nyears as President, no one served as a more dignified, nor proud, \nrepresentative of the United States than Ronald Reagan.\n  I think it entirely appropriate that CVN-76 be named the U.S.S. \nRonald Reagan because of our 40th President's steadfast commitment to a \nrobust Navy, strong Armed Forces and a global U.S. military presence. I \nbelieve that the sight of the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan patroling the high \nseas to defend America's interest will serve as a fitting tribute to \nthe man who reminded his fellow countrymen, and the world, that \nAmerica's best days are yet to come.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will take the time to look at the \nproposed joint resolution and I look forward to bringing this joint \nresolution to the Senate floor. I would like to ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator Warner's letter to President Clinton, and \n[[Page S952]] my letter to the Secretary of the Navy, the Honorable \nJohn Dalton, regarding this proposal be entered into the Record. I also \nwant to once again thank Senator John Warner for his much appreciated \ncooperation and assistance in this joint effort.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 16, 1993.\n     Hon. John Dalton,\n     Secretary of the Navy, Department of the Navy, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Secretary Dalton: As you know, the Fiscal Year 1994 \n     Defense Appropriation Act provided $1.2 billion to begin \n     construction of the next aircraft carrier (CVN-76). Once this \n     ship is authorized, I assume construction of this vessel will \n     begin.\n       I am writing to urge you to name CVN-76 in honor of former \n     President Ronald Reagan. I believe the ``USS Ronald Reagan'' \n     would be a fitting tribute to the man who played a key role \n     in winning the Cold War. Whatever one's political views, \n     President Reagan's commitment to ``peace through strength'' \n     and his dedication to the men and women in our armed forces \n     cannot be denied. I am confident that the American people and \n     the Congress would strongly support this tribute to our 40th \n     president.\n       I hope we can discuss the name of CVN-76 sometime in the \n     future. I look forward to hearing from you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n                                                 December 9, 1994.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Yesterday the Department of the Navy \n     finalized the principle contract for constructing America's \n     newest nuclear aircraft carrier, CVN76.\n       Several ships of this class proudly bear the names of our \n     Nation's former Presidents.\n       As you will soon be selecting a name for the ship, I \n     respectfully urge you to consider designating it ``USS Ronald \n     Reagan.''\n       The first mission of these carriers is to deter aggression \n     against our Nation's security interest and that of our \n     allies.\n       President Reagan was the principle architect of America's \n     defense and foreign policy during the period which not only \n     deterred aggression from communist adversaries, but also laid \n     the foundation for the decline and ultimate demise of \n     European communist Nations.\n       The ``USS Ronald Reagan,'' as she sails the seven seas to \n     deter future aggression, will serve as a symbol of America's \n     role, together with other nations of the free world in \n     successfully defeating communism.\n       With kind regards, I am\n           Respectfully,\n                                                      John Warner.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor, I rise today to \nexpress my full support for the joint resolution introduced by Senator \nKempthorne which would name the Navy's newest aircraft carrier, CVN-76, \nthe U.S.S. Ronald Reagan.\n  Throughout the 1980's and into the early 1990's, the United States \nboasted the strongest military in the world--unmatched in the quality \nof its people, weapons, munitions, and equipment. The nucleus of that \nforce remains today and, with some focused hard work, we will continue \nto be the world's foremost military power.\n  Our preeminent military force did not simply evolve, however. It was \nmethodically built utilizing foresight, dedication and a lot of hard \nwork by a lot of devoted people. One individual, however, stands above \nall others as the principal architect and master builder of our strong \nmilitary, and that individual is Ronald Reagan.\n  President Reagan often quoted George Washington's maxim that ``To be \nprepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving the \npeace.'' Throughout his time in office he followed that maxim, provided \nus with a clear vision of what a powerful American military should be \nand then tirelessly worked to assure that the force was built. His \nefforts guaranteed peace through strength.\n  President Reagan inherited a military that was not at the level of \nreadiness required of a superpower. Recall that when he was elected, 52 \nAmericans were being held hostage in Iran. The previous April, a \nmilitary effort to rescue those hostages had ended in tragedy and \nfailure at a place called Desert 1. The Iranian hostage situation and \nthe debacle at Desert 1 reflected a country whose respect within the \nworld community had eroded and a military whose members were \nundertrained, less than adequately equipped when compared to their \npotential adversaries, and generally dispirited.\n  Ronald Reagan pulled America out of that dilemma. On August 20, 1981, \nthe old ex-horse cavalryman, as he often referred to himself, set the \ntone for his 8 years in office when he made the following statement to \nthe crew of the aircraft carrier, the U.S.S. Constellation:\n\n       I know there've been times when the military has been taken \n     for granted. It won't happen under this administration * * *. \n     Providing security for the United States is the greatest \n     challenge and a greater challenge than ever, but we'll meet \n     that challenge * * *. Let friend and foe alike know that \n     America has the muscle to back up its words * * *.\n\n  During Ronald Reagan's tenure in office, he held true to that \nstatement. His vision led to the creation of the most technologically \nsuperior military in the world. Moreover, increased pay and benefits \nfor our people in uniform, something that President Reagan so strongly \nadvocated and relentlessly pushed for, resulted in the recruitment and \nretention of the highest quality people who have ever served in the \nmilitary. Perhaps even more significantly, President Reagan's strong \nleadership as the Commander in Chief instilled in the American people, \nand in the world community, a renewed high level of respect for our \nArmed Forces while at the same time restoring the confidence of our \nmilitary people, making them believe that they are members of an \nhonorable profession, performing a vital service to their Nation.\n  CVN-76 will be our ninth Nimitz class nuclear powered aircraft \ncarrier. One is named the U.S.S. United States. The other seven \ncurrently in service or being built are named after people who made \ngreat contributions to the American military--either leading forces in \nbattle, serving as President during war or working during times of \npeace to assure the continued strength of the American military and the \nsecurity of the United States. The Theodore Roosevelt, in particular, \nhonors a President who built the Great White Fleet and sailed it around \nthe world to proclaim America as a naval power and an emerging \ninternational economic power.\n  Ronald Reagan's service to our Nation merits his taking a rightful \nplace alongside those other great Americans who have been honored by \nhaving Nimitz class aircraft carriers named after them. Like Theodore \nRoosevelt, President Reagan built a military that announced to the \nworld that the United States is, once again, a great power. And like \nRoosevelt, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Dwight Eisenhower, \nRonald Reagan is a great leader whose vision and guidance have taken \nus, as a nation, to new heights of strength and respect among the other \nnations of the world.\n  The primary mission of CVN-76 will be to deter aggression against our \nNation's security interests and those of our allies. As such, it should \nbear a name which reflects audacity and decisiveness as well as the \nrespect which we trust our allies and potential adversaries alike will \nhold for it and the Nation it represents. I can think of no name for \nthis vessel which would be more appropriate than that of the individual \nwho designed, built, and led the world's most potent military force in \nthe 1980's: Ronald Reagan.\n  Mr. President, I believe my colleagues will agree that naming CVN-76, \na ship that will assure peace through strength, the U.S.S. Ronald \nReagan will be both an enhancement of Navy traditions and a fitting \ntribute to a most deserving former Commander in Chief. I strongly urge \nadoption of this joint resolution.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today to endorse this proposal to \nname the next aircraft carrier, CVN-76, the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan. I \nbelieve this would be a fitting tribute to a great man and a great \nPresident.\n  Ronald Reagan was elected the 40th President of the United States on \nNovember 4, 1980. Central to President Reagan's agenda was the defeat \nof communism and the rebirth of America as a ``beacon of hope for those \nwho do not have freedom.'' He therefore made the buildup of the \nNation's Armed Forces, which began under President Carter, his No. 1 \nbudget priority.\n  Two defensive weapon systems, in particular, have become synonymous \nwith the Reagan administration. First \n[[Page S953]] and foremost is the strategic defense initiative, which \nthe President announced in his historic 1983 address to the Nation. It \nwas the work of scientists and engineers in Huntsville and California \nthat convinced President Reagan to endorse research on missile \ndefenses, and I am proud of the leadership role that Huntsville has \ncontinued to play in this regard.\n  The second weapon system associated with the Reagan administration \nwas the MX missile. The intercontinental ballistic missile was the \ncornerstone of our ICBM modernization program and it, together with \nSDI, can be credited with convincing the Soviets to begin serious arms \ncontrol talks. In fact, by the end of the Reagan's second term the \nSTART talks has begun and we had signed the Intermediate Nuclear Force \n[INF] Treaty which eliminated an entire class of nuclear missiles. It \nshould be noted that the INF Treaty led to the first actual reduction \nof nuclear missiles in history.\n  In retrospect, many credit the Reagan arms buildup with the eventual \nbankruptcy and collapse of the Soviet Union. While I believe the main \ncauses of the collapse were the inherent flaws of communism, the arms \nrace certainly played a major role and the President does deserve \npraise for his steadfast commitment.\n  In his own words, Ronald Reagan's hope was to ``go down in history as \nthe President who made Americans believe in themselves again.'' He was \nsuccessful. He reminded us of our glorious past, that we were in a \nnation founded on the principles of freedom and democracy. He took \nworld leadership on the issues of the day and reassured us we were \nstill the greatest nation on earth. Finally, through his philosophy of \npeace through strength, he held the forces of communism at bay and set \nthe ground work for their eventual defeat, giving us new hope in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, aircraft carriers are the pride of the U.S. Navy and \nare floating symbols of our national strength and conviction. Five \ntimes before we have named an aircraft carrier after a President, with \nthe last being the U.S.S. John F. Kennedy. Ronald Reagan also deserves \nthis honor. I, therefore, encourage my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this tribute to President Reagan.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/13/senate-section/article/S945-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                  S. 4\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from California \n[Mrs. Feinstein] was added as a cosponsor of S. 4, a bill to grant the \npower to the President to reduce budget authority.\n\n\n                                 S. 16\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the names of the Senator from New York \n[Mr. Moynihan], and the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 16, a bill to establish a commission to review the \ndispute settlement reports of the World Trade Organization, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 43\n\n  At the request of Mr. Feingold, the name of the Senator from Vermont \n[Mr. Leahy] was added as a cosponsor of S. 43, a bill to phase out \nFederal funding of the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n\n\n                                 S. 45\n\n  At the request of Mr. Feingold, the name of the Senator from Vermont \n[Mr. Leahy] was added as a cosponsor of S. 45, a bill to amend the \nHelium Act to require the Secretary of the Interior to sell Federal \nreal and personal property held in connection with activities carried \nout under the Helium Act, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 91\n\n  At the request of Mr. Coverdell, the names of the Senator from Kansas \n[Mrs. Kassebaum], the Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham], and the \nSenator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] were added as cosponsors of S. 91, \na bill to delay enforcement of the National Voter Registration Act of \n1993 until such time as Congress appropriates funds to implement such \nact.\n\n\n                                 S. 137\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bradley, the name of the Senator from Delaware \n[Mr. Biden] was added as a cosponsor of S. 137, a bill to create a \nlegislative item veto by requiring separate enrollment of items in \nappropriations bills and tax expenditure provisions in revenue bills.\n\n\n                                 S. 164\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bradley, the name of the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Lott] was added as a cosponsor of S. 164, a bill to \nrequire States to consider adopting mandatory, comprehensive, statewide \none-call notification systems to protect natural gas and hazardous \nliquid pipelines and all other underground facilities from being \ndamaged by excavations, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                          Senate Resolution 31\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Boxer, the name of the Senator from California \n[Mrs. Feinstein] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Resolution 31, a \nresolution to express the sense of the Senate that the Attorney General \nshould act immediately to protect reproductive health care clinics.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/13/senate-section/article/S953-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 53--ORIGINAL RESOLUTION REPORTED AUTHORIZING \n EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY\n\n  Mr. LUGAR, from the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry, reported the following original resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                               S.

FLEMING\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \nsorrow at the death of James T. Fleming, one of the most talented and \nprofessional individuals to ever work in the Congress, and one of the \nfinest gentlemen I have ever had the pleasure of knowing.\n  For the past 20 years, Jim Fleming served as administrative assistant \nfor the senior Senator from Kentucky, the Honorable Wendell H. Ford. He \nalso served as counsel to Senator Ford on the vast array of legislative \nmatters under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources. It was in this capacity that the committee members and staff \ncame to know Jim and to appreciate his wry sense of humor, his great \npersonality, his warmth, and his enormous expertise.\n  Jim's contributions were invariably grounded in good common sense, a \nkeen understanding of good government, and a realistic point of view. \nHe was absolutely dedicated to working for the people of Kentucky and \nSenator Ford's agenda.\n  Much of the legislation written by the Energy Committee reflects Jim \nFleming's influence, including natural gas policy, the Nation's coal \nprogram, the uranium enrichment program, and natural resource \nprotection and utilization.\n  Mr. President, the future meetings of the committee will not quite be \nthe same without Jim Fleming there to offer his unique expertise. I \nfondly recall that as past committee deliberations would proceed with \nsenatorial formality, Jim Fleming could be counted on to listen with a \npoker face, weigh all options, and then with a profound wit and twinkle \nin his eye, offer a perspective that would be both illuminating and \nconstructive.\n  Jim Fleming will be sorely missed. In the words of the former Speaker \nof the House, the Honorable Thomas ``Tip'' O'Neill,--``So long, old \npal. So long.''\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/13/senate-section/article/S954-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JANUARY 17, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I just say for the information of my \ncolleagues that it could be that votes could occur before the 12:30 \nluncheons on Tuesday. Members should be alert that we will start on S. \n1 at 9:30. We will have amendments, hopefully, at 9:30. We have had \nenough delay on this bill. We, in effect, wasted yesterday and wasted \ntoday. We do have an interest in getting this legislation passed. It is \nvery important.\n  I agree with the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator \nByrd, there are a lot of questions about the bill. Hopefully, we can \nstart the debate on the bill, start off with the amendments so that \nmany of the questions that my colleague from West Virginia and other \nSenators may have will be answered.\n  There are a number of very important amendments on each side of the \naisle that are germane that should be \n[[Page S955]] discussed, should be debated. We have to start the \nprocess.\n  I would suggest that probably, at least on Wednesday and Thursday, if \nwe do not complete the bill by Thursday evening, we will probably be in \nlate, say, on Wednesday and maybe Thursday of next week and probably \nhave a pretty good day on Friday unless we can complete action on the \nlegislation.\n  I just ask my colleagues for their cooperation. As leader, I do not \nwant useless votes. Somebody misses a vote, we do not want those kind \nof votes. We want meaningful votes on substantive issues and \nsubstantive amendments and we will try to proceed on that basis. As \nlong as we have the cooperation of our colleagues we will continue that \nprocess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/13/senate-section/article/S954-5", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECESS UNTIL TUESDAY, JANUARY 17, AT 9:15 A.M.\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
