I thank the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. President, the time for the two leaders has been reserved, and \nthere will be a period for morning business until 12:30 p.m., with \nSenators permitted to speak for up to 5 minutes each. I do not \nanticipate any rollcall votes today.\n  I am going to make a request, but I know it is going to be objected \nto. I hope we can revisit it later this afternoon because most of us \nwould like to see everybody back to work. A week ago today, we passed \nin the Senate by unanimous consent a proposal to deem all Government \nemployees essential so they can go back to work and not be in violation \nof anything, and also provided for pay for those Federal employees.\n  So it is my hope that we do not have to wait until next week to \nresolve this. It is my understanding that we may be in session \nthroughout the afternoon subject to the call of the Chair in the event \nthe House should take some action on the measure we passed last week.\n  Yesterday, in an effort to at least get some people back to work, the \nSpeaker and I wrote a letter to the President of the United States. It \nwas not intended to be critical. There is nothing critical in it, \nbecause we are in the midst of budget negotiations, and we agreed not \nto discuss the budget negotiations. But it was our thought perhaps if \nwe passed Interior, and State, Justice, Commerce, and HUD-VA, that \nwould put a lot of people back to work. There are some things the \nPresident does not like in those bills. We can resolve those \ndifferences in the budget agreement. He can sign the bill and we would \nnot need a CR to cover most of the employees not working now.\n\n  Then we have the Labor-HHS bill we have been unable to bring up \nbecause of objection on the other side of the aisle. We have had two \ncloture votes and lost on party-line votes.\n  That leaves the D.C. appropriations bill. There is a continuing \nresolution for the District government until January 3. And then that \nleaves the foreign ops bill, which we still hope to resolve. I know the \nSenator from Vermont has been directly involved in \n\n[[Page S19302]]\nthat, along with the Senator from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, and \nothers. It is still our hope maybe we can resolve that today if \npossible.\n  I guess the point I want to make is, there is a 3:15 p.m. meeting at \nthe White House with budget negotiators. I will certainly update the \nSenate as to the progress following that meeting. What we have agreed \nto do after each meeting is issue a joint statement so it will not \nupset anybody and somehow get it off track.\n  It is my view that the American people want us to reach an agreement \non a balanced budget regardless of party, and I am talking about people \noutside the Capitol, people out in the real world, like some would say. \nI have had an opportunity to meet with some of those people in North \nCarolina and Iowa in the past week. I think they want us to do this for \nthe right reason, not that it is a game, or not that it is Republicans \nversus Democrats, but that it would, if we could get a balanced budget \nagreement, if the President was on board and it did pass the Congress, \nthen we believe, based on experts, that interest rates would drop 2 \npercent, for example. That is 2 percent on a college loan, 2 percent on \na car loan, 2 percent on a farm loan or home loan, and that would be in \nthe interest of all Americans, certainly regardless of party or \nregardless of philosophy.\n  So that is why I think there is a good-faith effort on the part of \nthe President and on the part of the leadership, Republican and \nDemocratic leadership in the House and Senate, and we will proceed this \nafternoon at 3:15. We are prepared to stay through the weekend, if \nnecessary. Sooner or later we have to reach out and make some of the \ntough decisions on Medicare and taxes, but, in my view, if we are \nserious about this, we can do it, or if we cannot reach an agreement, \nwe ought to disagree and Congress can do what Congress feels must be \ndone and the President can do what the President thinks must be done.\n  Having said that, I will also advise my colleagues hopefully in the \nnext couple of hours what I anticipate the program to be for next week. \nWe do start a new session of Congress on Wednesday of next week. I \nguess we have been in like this before a couple of times.\n  I am advised we would come in at 11:55 next Wednesday, adjourn sine \ndie, and then at noon, 5 minutes later, start the new session. But I \nwill give all the other details. I am not certain how many of my \ncolleagues will be present at that time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/29/senate-section/article/S19301-5", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 1643\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, based on what I said earlier, I now ask \nunanimous consent that the Finance Committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of H.R. 1643 regarding MFN status for Bulgaria, and that \nthe Senate now proceed to its immediate consideration; that all after \nthe enacting clause be stricken and the text of H.R. 2099, HUD-VA, H.R. \n1977, Interior, and H.R. 2076, State, Justice, Commerce, as vetoed by \nthe President, be inserted, the bill be advanced to third reading and \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, all \nwithout any further action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask that \nthe unanimous-consent request be modified to provide for a substitute \namendment which would reopen the Government and keep it open until \nJanuary 30. Absent such a modification, I object.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object. I will just \nstate to my friend from Vermont that we both share the same feeling \nabout returning employees to work. But if we can, as I indicated \nearlier, get these bills down to the President, agree with the \nPresident any problems he has with these bills will be resolved in the \nbudget agreement, then these employees will be back to work until the \nend of the fiscal year. So it would be permanent, it would not be a 30-\nday continuing resolution. That would leave, as I said, the District of \nColumbia, which is now under a continuing resolution, and Labor-HHS, if \nI can convince my colleagues to let us bring that up, and then foreign \nops where there is only one difference holding up that very important \npiece of legislation. I would be constrained to object on that basis.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the majority \nleader's original unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object further. I will note that I \nshare the distinguished majority leader's--one of the finest majority \nleaders this Senate has had--desire to go back, but I cannot agree to a \nunanimous-consent to, in effect, override vetoes of the President by \nunanimous consent. So I do object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I had not thought of that, but I think that \nprobably would be something to think about. These are separate bills, \nnot the ones vetoed by the President. It would be new bills. They would \nbe identical to the ones he vetoed. But the one additional ingredient \nhere is that we are on these budget negotiations, and we are serious \nabout it--the President is, I am, the Speaker is, Senator Daschle and \nCongressman Gephardt are.\n  I know on the Interior bill, for example, there are only about three \nreasons the President said he vetoed that bill. Those are all the parts \nand all the things we are hearing about on the nightly news. We ought \nto be able to resolve that. Maybe we can come back later and try, \ninstead of these three at once, maybe sending down one we might be able \nto work out. We would do this only with the agreement of the President. \nSo we are not trying to do anything here that the President would not \nsign off on, and I intend to raise that at our 3:15 meeting and tell \nhim in good faith that if he would let us send down these one or two \nbills, we are prepared to resolve differences as part of the budget \nagreement.\n  I thank my colleague from Vermont. Maybe we can revisit this in a \ndifferent form later today.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the distinguished majority leader would yield, Mr. \nPresident, I share his concern and desire to put the Government back to \nwork. This is not a thing that is helping anybody. They should be back. \nI wish him well in his meetings with the President. I have felt, if I \nmight state frankly, that if the issue to be resolved in this budget \nimpasse was left to this Chamber, Republicans and Democrats could come \ntogether with the President. It would mean that we would not have a \nClinton budget, a Dole budget, a Leahy budget, but we might have the \nbest of all of them and we would have a balanced budget.\n  I have been in negotiations and conference committees with the \ndistinguished majority leader on everything from agriculture to foreign \npolicy to finance and tax matters. I know that while he is a strong and \ntough bargainer, I know he also wants the Government to operate. I \nbelieve there is the possibility to do this and I hope we might.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/29/senate-section/article/S19302-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ORDER FOR RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I wonder if I might make a comment. I \nunderstand the purpose of both objections. The majority leader, I know, \nrecognizes that the passage of a clean CR would mean that everyone \nwould go back to work immediately. It is true that it would be only as \nlong as the CR lasted, but it would end the shutdown.\n  I understand the circumstances which required the Senator from Kansas \nto object to that at this point. I wish them well in the discussions \nwith the President this afternoon. In the event this were to go on for \nseveral more days, can the majority leader foresee circumstances under \nwhich a clean CR might be accomplished so that all Federal workers \nmight go back to work immediately?\n  Mr. DOLE. Well, I am not certain there will be a CR, but something \nhas \n\n[[Page S19303]]\nto be done. That is my view. I cannot speak for all of my colleagues in \nthe House and Senate. But I think there is some recognition--there are \na couple of concerns that people have. First of all, as I have said \nbefore, the employees are sort of the pawns in this game. This is a \nstruggle for whatever we hope will happen over the next 7 years. It is \nvery important. But to somebody out there who is not working and only \nlives from paycheck to paycheck, it is not a very happy choice, and \nthey should be paid, even though some are saying, ``Well, you are \npaying people for not working.'' My view is that if it was voluntary on \ntheir part, you should not, but it is involuntary. They cannot go to \nwork. Some tried, in Baltimore, to show up for work and they were told \nto go home. That is a long answer, I guess, to saying there has to be \nsome way around this. That is why I thought, yesterday, that maybe the \nappropriations bills--if the President would consent to that--then we \ncan probably figure out a way to get Labor-HHS out of here. We have one \nlittle provision--and the Senator from Vermont knows more about it than \nI do--on the foreign ops bill. I will work with the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the majority leader is still on the \nfloor, I hope that he realizes--I am sure he does--that there are many \nof us--I would say the majority of both Democrats and Republicans--who \ndo want to come together on this issue and get it here in the Senate \nand get this finished. He mentioned the foreign ops bill, which is one \nwhere the distinguished Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] and I had \nthe bill on the floor. We had, I believe, 193 items in disagreement \nwith the other body. We settled 192 of the 193, and I think it is \nunfortunate that it is held up.\n  It is beginning to create a problem in the Middle East peace process \nwith the Camp David countries. I think that is of some significance. I \nknow all of us on the floor support the help we give those countries, \nespecially at this critical time. I hope we might work that out. I \nthink we can go through dozens of other issues, where it seems that the \nsolution is so close and so within our grasp. Frankly, Mr. President, I \nwish the majority leader, the Speaker, and the President all the best \nin their negotiations, and the distinguished Democratic leaders in both \nthe House and the Senate, who will join with them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/29/senate-section/article/S19302-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to make a comment to the majority \nleader. He mentioned during his comments that he would encourage the \nPresident to sign the three bills he has vetoed and would be willing to \nwork with him to work out some of the problems that he had. I have a \ncopy of the President's veto message on the Interior bill. I have \nreviewed all of these. In most cases, the differences are very small. I \ncannot help but think that the majority leader and the President could \nwork out the differences. There are a couple items dealing with \ndollars, but a very insignificant amount as far as the total. This is a \n$12 billion bill. The differences in dollars is very small.\n  A few issues maybe need to be clarified as far the administration and \nso on. There is no reason why this bill should not be signed. I know \nthere was a front page article in the Washington Post today. I know \nthere is a lot of concern about visitors not being able to visit parks \nand museums. There is no reason whatsoever that this bill should not be \nsigned.\n  So I encourage the majority leader in his meeting with the President \nto see if we cannot make a couple small changes in the Interior bill, \nas well as the Commerce, State, Justice, and the VA-HUD bill, which \nwould relieve a lot of the problems and anxiety for a lot of people all \nacross the country, not just the employees, but also constituents that \nwould like to have access to the parks and to the museums.\n  So I compliment the majority leader for taking that effort to the \nPresident. Hopefully, he will concur, and maybe we can at least resolve \nthe conflict on three of these major items.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The acting Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/29/senate-section/article/S19303-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HELPING VICTIMS OF CRIME\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there are some things, however, that are \ngetting through. The Senate, in one of its final votes before \nadjourning for Christmas, passed legislation aimed at more than \ndoubling the assistance that my State and others will have in hand to \nhelp victims of domestic crime and terrorism.\n  I mention this, Mr. President, because I think of the years I spent \nas a prosecutor and I remember so many times we spent hundreds of \nthousands of dollars to prosecute a perpetrator, especially of a \nviolent crime, both in the prosecution and in the incarceration, but \nthe victim was usually the forgotten person. The victim got no \nassistance, the victim got no help, the victim was left to fend for \nhimself or herself.\n  What we have done now is raise to half a million dollars in a special \nvictims fund for Vermont, under the Victims of Crime Act and under an \namendment that I propose, that will help these people. I think this \nmakes a great deal of sense because the money comes not from the \ntaxpayers, the money comes from the criminals. The assessments and the \nfines to the criminal will go into this fund.\n  Again, as a former prosecutor, I believe we should bring strong and \neffective prosecution as quickly as possible in these serious crimes. \nWe have seen what happened in places like Oklahoma City. Let us not \nforget the victims. When we are setting out the punishment for the \nperpetrator of the crime, when we add fines and assessments, the money \nwhich can go to help victims all the better. In my experience, the \nvictim is usually the person forgotten. All attention is on the \ncriminal. This way, we will keep the attention on those convicted of \nviolent crimes, but we will make them pay into a fund to help the \nvictims.\n  I think it is much better. I think victims must be treated with \ndignity and assisted and compensated for their suffering. Who better to \npay for the restitution than the perpetrators of those crimes \nthemselves? I thank the Members of the Senate who have joined with \nthat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/29/senate-section/article/S19303-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19303-S19304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have talked about the budget. I have \nlistened to the distinguished majority leader. I am absolutely \nconvinced that if the distinguished Republican leader and the \ndistinguished Democrat leader in this body could sit down with the \nPresident that we could reach those areas of compromise.\n  We have to understand that no matter what the issue is here, when \nthere are many, many differing views, that nobody wins totally. We do \nnot pass a Gingrich budget or a Dole budget or a Daschle budget, a \nClinton budget or a Leahy budget, but we can pass a budget for this \ncountry and one that will bring us to a balanced budget but will also \nallow at least bipartisan cooperation on issues like education, \nenvironment, medical care for the elderly, and so forth.\n  I was concerned in the other body when I hear some say, ``Well, let's \nlock everybody in a room and throw the key away until this is \nsettled.'' I say to those same people, why did you not stay here last \nweekend and do it? Why did you not stay and turn the key on your own \ndoors and stay here?\n  They are claiming over there in the other body that this is for a \nmore efficient Government. This is the least efficient way to run a \ngovernment, let alone a business--send everybody home so no work is \nbeing done, but then people are being told they will be paid for their \nlost time. They should be paid because it was not through their fault, \nbut the American taxpayer is not being paid for lost services.\n  These Federal workers want to go back to work, they want to help run \n\n[[Page S19304]]\n  this country, they want to process the passport claims and the veterans \nclaims and everything else. They cannot understand why we will not make \nit possible.\n\n  Frankly, I think some Members of Congress ought to be asked--those \nwho feel we should lock up the leadership and the President--ought to \nbe asked, why did you leave last weekend? Did you go home for a \nChristmas vacation? Did the taxpayers pay for your airplane fares home? \nOf course they did. Did the taxpayers pay for your salary while you \nwere home making political speeches? Of course they did.\n  Then they also ought to be asked: Do you not think it would have been \nbetter to stay and get the country back to work, get the Government \nback to work, and stop these shenanigans?\n  As I said before, I have been in negotiations, some very tough \nnegotiations, with the distinguished majority leader and the \ndistinguished Democratic leader. I know them both to be Senators of \ngreat honor and great ability. I am willing to rely on them to \nnegotiate with the President of the United States and get us out of \nthis. I hope it can be done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/29/senate-section/article/S19303-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DR. GEORGE McINTYRE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was born in Montpelier, VT. A great \nfriend I had in Montpelier, VT was Dr. George A. McIntyre. Dr. McIntyre \nleft this world this month at the age of 85. I can truly say Dr. \nMcIntyre knew me all of my life because he was the man who delivered me \nas a child. He was a good friend, as is his wife, Theresa. He was also \nthe model of the smalltown country doctor. He was someone who knew \neverybody in the town, respected by everybody in the town, loved by \neverybody in the town, and was there to help.\n  My own memories, I recall as a child of about 12, becoming very ill \nwith pneumonia, and Dr. McIntyre coming to our house, a doctor who \nalways made house calls, bundling me up and bringing me to the \nhospital. Without his care, there is no question I would not have \nsurvived that bout of pneumonia.\n  So I have been privileged, as have members of my family, to know him \nfor all these years. I send my condolences to his wife, his children, \nand the other members of his family. He was a truly remarkable person.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Dr. McIntyre's obituary which appeared \nin the Burlington Free Press be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the obituary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Dec. 16, 1995]\n\n                        George A. McIntyre, M.D.\n\n       Montpelier.--George A. McIntyre, M.D., 85, of Loomis \n     Street, and a longtime area practitioner, died Dec. 14, 1995, \n     in Berlin Health and Rehabilitation Center of complications \n     due to Parkinson's disease.\n       Born on May 3, 1910, in Burlington, he was the son of James \n     C. McIntyre and Emma J. (Wakefield) McIntyre.\n       He received a bachelor of science degree from the \n     University of Vermont and an M.D. from UVM in 1935. Following \n     internship he opened a family practice in Montpelier.\n       On July 10, 1941, he married Theresa Wilkinson in \n     Montpelier and to that marriage four children were born.\n       From Sept. 2, 1942, until Feb. 3, 1946, he actively served \n     as a U.S. Army physician, principally in New Guinea and in \n     the southern Philippines. His military specialty was that of \n     chief of gastroenterology. His final rank promotion was that \n     of major. Postgraduate education was obtained at New York \n     Postgraduate Hospital, University of Chicago, Billings \n     General Hospital, and St. Luke's Hospital, also in Chicago.\n       Dr. McIntyre was an attending physician at Heaton Hospital \n     and its successor, Central Vermont Hospital, for a total of \n     46 years and a member of Washington County Medical Society, \n     Vermont State Medical Society, and American Medical \n     Association.\n       In addition to his regular practice, Dr. McIntyre was \n     medical consultant to Kinstead on upper Main Street in \n     Montpelier, a state-run institution; to New England Telephone \n     and Telegraph Co., IBM, Agway, and the Selective Service. For \n     several years, he was health officer for the City of \n     Montpelier and was attending physician at Vermont College for \n     31 years, serving under the administration of four presidents \n     and medical director of the former Heaton House.\n       On May 15, 1981, Dr. McIntyre was awarded a citation from \n     the Vermont Medical Alumni Association, ``in recognition of \n     his many years of exemplary medical practice and outstanding \n     community service which reflects credit upon the medical \n     profession and epitomizes the ideal physician.'' He retired \n     in November of that year.\n       Following retirement, he was director of the library at \n     Central Vermont Hospital for almost five years, president of \n     Washington County Cancer Society, newsletter editor of the \n     Lake Mansfield Trout Club, and a member of the club, a \n     Montpelier-based literary club. He also authored the history \n     of Christ Church (Episcopal) in Montpelier.\n       Norwich University of Vermont conveyed recognition on Dr. \n     McIntyre by conferring on him an honorary doctor of \n     humanities degree during commencement exercises at Vermont \n     College on May 22, 1988.\n       In a reading presented for inclusion in the Congressional \n     Record by Sen. Patrick Leahy in March 1989, Leahy stated, \n     ``Dr. McIntyre has been my family's doctor for as long as I \n     can remember. All the Leahys have come to depend on him for \n     his patience, caring, and advice. I have literally known him \n     all my life, as he is the physician who delivered me on March \n     31, 1940.''\n       Survivors include his wife of 54 years, Theresa \n     (Wilkinson), whom he married June 10, 1941, in Montpelier; \n     three sons, James C. McIntyre of Montpelier, William A. \n     McIntyre of Nashua, N.H., and John S. McIntyre of Barre; one \n     daughter, Anne M. McIntyre of Melrose, Mass.; and two \n     grandchildren, Matthew and Julia Anne McIntyre.\n       Services will be held Sunday at 2 p.m. in Christ Church \n     (Episcopal). Spring burial service will take place in Lake \n     View Cemetery in Burlington. Calling hours are scheduled \n     today from 2 to 4 and 7 to 9 p.m. in Guare and Sons Funeral \n     Home, 80 School St., Montpelier. The family requests that \n     flowers be omitted. Memorial contributions may be made to \n     Central Vermont Hospital, P.O.

Mr. President, I listened with interest at the discussion \nmoments ago on the floor about the issue of the shutdown and the budget \nnegotiations. I have been involved with Senator Exon on the Democratic \nside in those negotiations for a number of weeks. We have regrettably \nnot solved the problem. We have not resolved a budget that represents a \ncompromise on both sides. It is probably safe for everyone to say that \nwe have, at the end of this year, a real mess here in Washington, DC, \nand in the Congress.\n  It is tempting to just blame, and it seems to me there are plenty of \ntargets, but it seems to me what is causing this deadlock and this \nimpasse is a circumstance where a large number of Members of Congress \nhave come to town to say, ``The way we negotiate is to say to you, `It \nis our way or no way. You agree with us or we create deadlock. We won't \naccept compromise.' ''\n  The Senator from Vermont talked about the press conference yesterday \nby some on the other side of the Capitol who said, ``Let's lock the \nroom. Let's have the President and the majority leader of the Senate \nand the Speaker of the House put in a room and lock the room and not \nhave them come out until there is an agreement on a balanced budget.''\n  The Senator from Vermont appropriately asked the question: Why would \nthey not have asked themselves to remain here last week?\n  I stood on the floor of this Senate late last week when we were told \nthat the other side had decided they were leaving at 2:30 in the \nafternoon, and late that afternoon I asked on the floor of the Senate, \nwhat about this shutdown? What about the 270,000 people who are \nprevented from going to work? What about the taxpayers who are told \nthey are going to pay people who are prevented from doing their work?\n  What about the other half-million people who are working and not \ngetting paid, working a full pay period and getting half a paycheck? \nThat has not been discussed on the floor. I ask, what leverage does it \ngive anyone to poke the eye of the taxpayer by saying to the taxpayers \nof this country, ``You are going to pay 270,000 people who are \nprevented from coming to work and dangling Federal workers out as pawns \nin this budget debate\"? What possible leverage could anyone receive \nfrom this chaos and this mess? This is not leverage, this is \nfoolishness, and it ought to end.\n  They say this is about principle. It is about balancing the budget in \nprinciple. I ask this question: What principle is involved in a \nproposal to balance the budget that says, ``By the way, let us change \nthe alternative minimum tax so that 2,000 corporations, the biggest \ncorporations in America, each get a $7 million tax cut from this little \nadjustment in something called the AMT? Two thousand companies, $7 \nmillion each in a new tax break, to balance the budget?\n\n[[Page S19305]]\n\n  What principle is involved in changing something that no one \nunderstands called section 956(a) of the Tax Code, that says, ``Let us \nmake it easier, and let us provide a better incentive for people to \nclose their manufacturing plants in America and move the jobs \noverseas''? What possible principle is involved in making that \nadjustment for those few recipients, the largest corporations in the \ncountry, to be rewarded in something that is called a balanced budget?\n  I also note the story today in the newspaper that says, ``Furloughs \nFail To Ground Overseas Trips by Congress.'' I think those who are \nresponsible for shutting down the Government and who now plan to leave \non a congressional foreign trip should think better of it. Some of \ntheir constituents might see their actions of shutting down the \nGovernment and then leaving the country as leaving the scene of an \naccident. We ought not be talking about foreign trips. We ought to be \ntalking about getting this Government up and running and reaching a \nbudget agreement.\n  The Republicans are right. I have said it before and I will say it \nthis afternoon, the Republicans are right for pushing for a balanced \nbudget. I compliment them for it. They have energy and strength to say \nwe ought to balance the budget. They are right about that. We ought to \ndo it in 7 years. They are right about that. The Democrats are right in \nsaying let us do it the right way, by protecting the priorities in this \ncountry. Let us not pull the rug out from under Medicare. Let us make \nsure we invest in education. The Republicans are right and the \nDemocrats are right. Let us take the best of what both have to offer, \nrather than get the worst of what each party has to offer this country.\n\n  My hope is that, by the end of today or tomorrow, working together, \nall of us, we will find a way to end this Government shutdown, put \npeople back to work, develop a plan to balance the Federal budget, do \nit in 7 years, and do it with the right priorities that still will make \nthis a better country in the future and especially do it in a way that \nis sensitive to the needs of some of the most vulnerable people in our \ncountry.\n  The American people, it seems to me, at the end of 1995, deserve a \ngovernment that offers some measure of confidence, not chaos. We find \nourselves in this circumstance, at the end of this year, for a lot of \nreasons. This Congress did not pass its appropriations bills on time. \nIt did not pass its reconciliation bill on time. It did not pass any \nappropriations bills on time. The fact is, we end the year in chaos.\n  We can, it seems to me, even by the end of this week--tomorrow, \nSaturday, Sunday, Monday--still make some measure of progress in doing \nthe right thing. And the right thing would be to restore to those \nFederal workers the opportunity to come back to their jobs, to restore, \nfor the taxpayers, some sense of confidence that we are doing the right \nthing, and to provide for this country a budget that is balanced--yes, \nin 7 years; and, yes, in the right way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/29/senate-section/article/S19304-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AGREE ON A BUDGET\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, continuing with the remarks I made \nearlier to Senator Dole, urging him to follow up on what he was talking \nabout doing, going to the President and urging the President to sign at \nleast three of these bills--I hope that happens. I have before me the \nInterior bill and the President's veto message, and there is no reason \nthe President should veto this bill. He has vetoed it. It has caused a \nlot of dislocation. It has put a lot of people out of work, not only \nhurt the Federal employees, but it has also hurt a lot of constituents. \nThey have not had the opportunity to visit parks and museums. I think \nthat is really unfortunate, when I looked at the reason why he vetoed \nthe bill.\n  So I urge the President to agree with Senator Dole and Speaker \nGingrich and sign this bill--maybe making a couple of changes. We can \nmake those changes. We can agree, if the two leaders, in meeting with \nthe President, agree on a couple of changes, modifications. I know he \nwants a little more money for a couple of items in the bill. But by and \nlarge, I think it was vetoed for the wrong reason. This could be \nsigned, thousands of people could go back to work, and our constituents \nwould have access to parks and museums all across the country. So I \nhope that happens.\n  The other couple of bills that the President could sign and hopefully \nwill sign soon, Commerce, State, Justice, and VA/HUD--again, let us \nagree to make whatever compromises are necessary, compromises in a \ncouple of areas. The differences are not that great. But the bill \nshould be signed. Those employees should go back to work and \nconstituents, veterans and others, could receive the services they \nexpect and are entitled to.\n  But the most important thing that needs to really happen is that we \nneed to come to a resolution and agree on a budget. My friend and \ncolleague from North Dakota said it has been months and we have been \nbehind on reconciliation, it has taken too long --though Congress has \ntried to do a lot of things. It tried to reform welfare. Unfortunately, \nthe President vetoed that package. It tried to balance the budget. We \nhave never done that before. I have been here 15 years, we have never \npassed a balanced budget. We have never curtailed the growth of \nentitlement programs. We are trying to do that now.\n  Unfortunately, we have not had any real support or help from the \nWhite House, from the administration. Yes, it is a congressional \ninitiative, and it is easier said than done, but most of the time, \nCongress and politicians make rhetoric, saying we want to balance the \nbudget, but they do not follow through. Congress, now, is very intent, \nvery sincere, very earnest in saying we want to balance the budget and \nwe want to do it with real numbers.\n\n  We thought, 6 weeks ago, President Clinton had agreed and made that \ncommitment that he would do so as well. In the last 6 weeks since the \nNovember 15 agreement to have the CBO budget in 7 years, the President \nhas yet to submit one. I compliment my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle who have signed on to a budget that is balanced using real, \nhonest numbers. At least a dozen Democrats have signed on. So we, at \nleast, have a package. You can work and negotiate because you are both \ndealing with the same numbers. They go to a goal of a balanced budget.\n  Unfortunately, President Clinton has not. Maybe today he will. But \nthe press reports are that he still refuses to submit a balanced \nbudget, so we will have a budget that we can compare. Maybe he is just \ngoing to throw rocks at the budget we have. Maybe he is going to throw \nrocks at the budget the Democrats have. I do not know. But I am \nhopeful. I want to be optimistic. I think it is awfully important for \nthe future of this country, for the future generations, that we do \nstart, begin to live within our means.\n  So I urge the President to work with Majority Leader Dole and Speaker \nGingrich today, work to find an agreeable compromise to where no one \nindividual or party is a winner but the American people will be \nwinners; so the White House can claim victory, the Congress can claim \nvictory, but the real victors, the real winners in this entire process \nwill be the American people and future generations. That would be \nsomething worth fighting for. It would be something worth working for. \nThat would be a victory, I think, that all people could claim some \ncredit for.\n  I hope that will happen. I do think it is possible. It is possible if \nthe President wants to make it happen. Hopefully he will.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/29/senate-section/article/S19305-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19305-S19306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

A bill to impose sanctions on Burma; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n              The Burma Freedom and Democracy Act of 1995\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Moynihan, \nD'Amato, and Leahy to introduce the Burma Freedom And Democracy Act of \n1995.\n  Early in December, prospects for democracy in Burma took a turn for \nthe \n\n[[Page S19307]]\nworse. In a remarkable act of courage, Aung San Suu Kyi and her \ncolleagues in the National League for Democracy decided not to \nparticipate in the National Convention orchestrated by the State Law \nand Order Restoration Council. In announcing her decision she said, ``A \ncountry which is drawing up a constitution that will decide the future \nof the state should have the confidence of the people.'' This is a \nstandard that SLORC cannot meet.\n  Burma is not one step closer to democracy today than it was in the \nimmediate aftermath of the crackdown in 1988. Indeed, in Aung San Suu \nKyi's own words, ``I have been released, that is all.''\n  In fact, the situation continues to deteriorate. A recent report \nfiled by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Burma, Dr. Yokota, is a fresh, \nsharp reminder of the level of despair and the brutality suffered by \nthe people of Burma at the hands of SLORC.\n  In lengthy remarks on December 8, I reviewed for my colleagues in \ndetail the Yokota report. Let me take a moment to briefly review its \nmost recent conclusions.\n  Virtually no improvements have occurred since the spring report of \nthe Special Rapporteur. Dr. Yokota reported that the National \nConvention ``is not heading towards restoration of democracy'' and \ncriticized SLORC for not affording him the opportunity to meet with \nconvention participants free from SLORC supervision.\n  But, those criticisms were mild compared to his determinations with \nregard to human rights and the quality of life for the average Burmese \ncitizen.\n  A complex array of security laws are used to harass, intimidate, and \nafford SLORC soldiers sweeping powers of arrest and detention. He \ncharged the military with carrying out arbitrary killings, rape, \ntorture, forced porterage, forced labor, forced relocations, and \nconfiscation of private property. He substantiated many refugee claims \nthat this pattern of abuse continues most frequently ``in border areas \nwhere the Army is engaged military operations or where regional \ndevelopment projects are taking place.'' He added, ``many of the \nvictims of such atrocious acts belong to ethnic national populations, \nespecially women, peasants, daily wage earners and other peaceful \ncivilians who do not have enough money to avoid mistreatment by \nbribing.''\n  If anyone had any doubts about the ruthless nature of the SLORC \nregime, I encourage them to take a few minutes to read this report.\n  SLORC has now turned its attention to the rising influence of Suu Kyi \nand her supporters. SLORC has cynically used the fact of her release to \nattempt to demonstrate they are relaxing their grip on power. \nUnfortunately, it is a sadistic charade.\n  Although Suu Kyi has repeatedly called for a dialog to reconcile the \nnation, SLORC has rejected every attempt to include her or the NLD in a \ncredible political process. Last week Suu Kyi was personally attacked \nin the official newspapers as a ``traitor'' who should be \n``annihilated.'' When the NLD announced they would not participate in \nthe National Convention, senior officials woke up to find their homes \nsurrounded by soldiers and their movements shadowed by military thugs.\n  In response to this assault on democracy and democratic activities, \nmembers of the business community have made two arguments. First, the \nallegations are exaggerations of the conditions. And, second, trade, \ninvestment, and economic improvements will yield political progress \njust as it has in China and Vietnam.\n  Mr. President, I urge the business community to read Dr. Yokota's \nrecent report and then consider an important difference in Burma. In \n1990 elections were held and the nation spoke with a strong voice. Suu \nKyi's National League for Democracy swept the elections only to find \nthe results brutally rejected by SLORC. We cannot pretend those \nelections did not occur. We cannot turn our back on the legitimate \nGovernment of Burma. We should not trade democracy for dollars in the \npockets of a few companies interested in investing in Burma.\n  Suu Kyi has been absolutely clear. She will welcome foreign \ninvestment in her country just as soon as it makes real progress toward \ndemocracy.\n  The United States must take the lead in supporting not only her \ncourage but her objective which is nothing short of Burma's liberty. It \nis clear U.N. Ambassador Albright understands the importance of our \nrole and the responsibilities of United States leadership in securing \ndemocracy for Burma. In responding to the U.N. Rapporteur's report and \nthe subsequent General Assembly resolution she spelled out the \nalternatives for SLORC: They must--there must be prompt and meaningful \nprogress in political reforms including a transition to an elected \nGovernment or Burma will face further international isolation.\n  Mr. President, I agree with the Ambassador's conclusions. However, it \nis a position that the administration has expressed for more than a \nyear. My definition of prompt differs from the administration's \ntimetable. SLORC has had ample time and opportunity to demonstrate \ntheir intent to in effect return to the barracks and leave the \ngoverning of the country to democratically elected civilians. Burma \nwaited for decades to vote for the National League for Democracy. They \nhave waited for the past five years to benefit from the results of that \nelection. Burma has waited for its freedom long enough.\n\n  In past statements of Burma I have devoted a good deal of my remarks \nto why a country so far away should matter to anyone here in the United \nStates. It is not just a matter of upholding the principles of \ndemocracy and free markets--principles that define our history and \nnational conscience. But, for many, those are ideals that are difficult \nto transplant--it is difficult to see why we should apply sanctions to \nfurther that cause.\n  The reason it is in our direct interest to secure democracy in Burma \nrelates to the surge in narcotics trafficking afflicting every \ncommunity in this Nation. Burma is the source of more than 60 percent \nof the heroin coming into the United States. As the Assistant Secretary \nof State for Asian Affairs has testified, until there is a \ndemocratically elected government in Rangoon, committed to a similar \nset of values, we will not see the active cooperation necessary to \nbring a real halt to this problem. We may see episodic efforts \ndesigned--like Suu Kyi's release--to influence our perceptions of \nSLORC's intentions. But, we will not see a serious effort to eradicate \nopium production unless we can work with a government dedicated to our \ncommon agenda.\n  The credibility of a counternarcotics program directly relates to the \ncredibility of the government.\n  Let me conclude by thanking Senators Moynihan, Leahy, and D'Amato for \njoining me in this legislation. I appreciate my colleague on the \nSubcommittee on Foreign Operations joining me in this important effort. \nI understand the Parliamentarian has decided that this will be referred \nto the Banking Committee, so I am grateful for the cosponsorship of the \nchairman, Senator D'Amato.\n  But, I want to take a moment to single out Senator Moynihan and his \nlong standing commitment to Suu Kyi's safe return to public life. When \nwe were members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1992 \nSenator Moynihan and I worked together to establish conditions which \nmust be met prior to our dispatching a U.S. Ambassador to Burma. Then \nas now, he has been articulate champion for a noble cause.\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky and I \njoin together to propose a modest measure in response to a continued \npattern of egregious abuses of power by the Burmese military junta, the \nState Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC]. The members of SLORC \nhave worked to thwart democracy at every turn. They continue to be \nimplicated in drug trafficking, and they continue to abuse the people \nof Burma in a manner that can only be characterized as inhuman.\n  This bill makes clear our intention that such a regime will no longer \nenjoy investments from the United States. Investments which so often \nsupported--knowingly or unknowingly--its totalitarian and abusive rule. \nThe bill also codifies our intention to withhold our support for loans \nto Burma from international financial institutions, to prevent direct \nassistance to the SLORC, and to exclude the members of SLORC from the \nUnited States.\n\n[[Page S19308]]\n\n  In 1988 the Burmese people took to the streets of Rangoon, to \ndemand democracy for their country. Sadly, government forces turned \npeaceful protests into violent tragedy. In September of that year, \nthousands of unarmed demonstrators were killed by government troops.\n\n  Since then, the SLORC has earned its reputation as one of the worst \nviolators of human rights in the world. The Department of State and \nnumerous human rights organizations document this. The SLORC maintains \npower through violence and intimidation. In effect, the military junta \nhas waged war against its own people. But the will of the Burmese \npeople cannot be squelched. As they continue their fight for democracy, \nsupport from the international community remains steadfast.\n  The SLORC came to power through violence, but it must have cynically \nimagined that a rigged election would be the answer to its untenable \npolitical situation, and one was scheduled for May 1990. The National \nLeague for Democracy [NLD] party, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, won that \nelection while she was under house arrest. Yet the SLORC has never \nallowed the elected leaders of Burma to take office. Instead it has \nforced these leaders to flee their country to escape arrest and death.\n  The U.S. Senate has spoken often in support of those brave Burmese \ndemocracy leaders. We have withheld aid and weapons to the military \nregime, and have provided some--albeit modest amounts--of assistance to \nthe Burmese refugees who have fled the ruthless SLORC. Pro-democracy \ndemonstrators were particularly vulnerable, yet having fled the country \nthey found themselves denied political asylum by Western governments. \nIn 1989, Senator Kennedy and I rose in support of the demonstrators and \nwon passage of an amendment to the Immigration Act of 1990 requiring \nthe Secretary of State and the Attorney General to define clearly the \nimmigration policy of the United States toward Burmese pro-democracy \ndemonstrators. Congress acted again on the Customs and Trade Act of \n1990 to adopt a provision I introduced requiring the President to \nimpose appropriate economic sanctions on Burma. The Bush administration \nutilized this provision to sanction Burmese textiles. Unfortunately, \nthese powers have never been exercised by the current administration.\n  The Senate continued to press for stronger actions. On March 12, \n1992, the Foreign Relations Committee unanimously voted to adopt a \nreport which Senator McConnell and I submitted detailing specific \nactions that should be taken before the nomination of a United States \nAmbassador to Burma would be considered by the Senate.\n  Last year, the State Department authorization act for 1994-1995 \ncontained a provision I introduced placing Burma on the list of \ninternational outlaw states such as Libya, North Korea, and Iraq. Let \nus be clear: The U.S. Congress considers the SLORC regime to be one of \nthe very worst in the world. The Senate also unanimously adopted S. 234 \non July 15, 1994, calling for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and for \nincreased international pressure on the SLORC to achieve the transfer \nof power to the winners of the 1990 Democratic election.\n  After 6 years of unjust detention by the Burmese military, Nobel \nPeace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi was released on July 10, 1995. \nWhile this was cause for celebration and great relief for those of us \nwho have long called for her release, one cannot fail to stress that \nthere is also great outrage that she was incarcerated in the first \ninstance.\n  The struggle in Burma is not over. The SLORC continues to wage war \nagainst its own people. Illegal heroin continues to be produced with \nthe junta's complicity. And the SLORC continues to thwart the transfer \nto democracy in Burma. The New York Times writes appropriately in an \neditorial:\n\n       The end of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's detention must be \n     followed by other steps toward democracy before Myanmar is \n     deemed eligible for loans from multilateral institutions or \n     closer ties with the United States. It is too soon to welcome \n     Yangon back into the democratic community.\n\n  Too soon indeed.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself and Mr. Coats):\n  S. 1512. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to improve \nsafety at public railway-highway crossings, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n THE HIGHWAY RAIL GRADE CROSSING SAFETY FORMULA ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Highway \nRail Grade Crossing Safety Formula Enhancement Act. This important \nlegislation will provide a more effective method of targeting available \nFederal funds to enhance safety at our Nation's most dangerous highway \nrail grade crossings.\n  In America today, several hundred people are killed and thousands \nmore injured every year as a result of vehicle-train collisions at \nhighway rail grade crossings. A significant number of these accidents \noccur in rail-intensive States such as Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, \nCalifornia, and Texas. One quarter of the Nation's 168,000 public \nhighway rail grade crossings are located in these five States. They \naccounted for 38 percent of deaths and 32 percent of injuries caused by \nvehicle-train collisions nationwide during 1991-93.\n  My home State of Indiana ranks sixth in the Nation for number of \ntotal grade crossings with 6,788, third in the Nation for grade \ncrossing accidents with 263, and fifth for fatalities with 27. Last \nyear, I traveled across northern Indiana aboard a QSX-500 locomotive \nand witnessed what engineers see every day--motorists darting across \nthe railroad tracks before an oncoming train. From this experience, and \nfrom my work to improve safety at highway-rail grade crossings, I \nlearned that engineering solutions, along with education and awareness \nabout grade crossing safety are key strategies that can effectively \nprevent grade crossing accidents.\n  Responding to this disturbing national trend, I began working with \nTransportation Secretary Federico Pena and with the Indiana Department \nof Transportation to address this serious safety problem. We worked to \nfind solutions that would help Indiana and other States make better use \nof available funds to target the Nation's most dangerous rail \ncrossings.\n  The Federal Government has played an important role in helping States \nreduce accidents and fatalities at public rail-highway intersections \nsince passage of the Highway Safety Act by Congress in 1973. This act \ncreated the Rail-Highway Crossing Program--also known as the section \n130 program. Since the program's inception, more than 28,000 \nimprovement projects have been undertaken--from installation of warning \ngates, lights, and bells, to pavement improvements and grade separation \nconstruction projects.\n  During the 103d Congress, I introduced grade crossing safety \nlegislation to restore States' discretion over millions of Federal \nhighway dollars lost as a result of noncompliance with the Federal \nmotorcycle helmet law. Indiana and other States affected by this law \nwere prohibited from using a portion of their highway construction \ndollars to improve safety at highway rail grade crossings. While the \nSenate did not approve this legislation during the 103d Congress, I am \npleased the Congress repealed the helmet law penalty this year as part \nof the National Highway System Designation legislation. Repeal of this \nFederal sanction allows States greater flexibility to use their Federal \nhighway dollars for improvements at rail crossings, and for other \ntransportation priorities.\n  In March, 1994, Senator Coats and I asked the General Accounting \nOffice to conduct a survey of rail safety programs in Indiana and other \nrail intensive States experiencing a high number of accidents at \nhighway-rail grade crossings. Released this summer, the report--\n``Railroad Safety: Status of Efforts to Improve Railroad Crossing \nSafety''--evaluated the best uses of limited Federal funds for rail \ncrossing safety, reviewed policy changes that help State and local \ngovernments address rail safety issues, and recommended strategies to \nencourage interagency and intergovernmental cooperation.\n  The report found that in addition to States' efforts to reduce \naccidents and fatalities through emphasis on education programs and \nengineering solutions, changes to the funding formulas to apportion \nhighway funds among States would target Federal funds to areas of \ngreatest risk.\n\n[[Page S19309]]\n\n  Under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 \n[ISTEA], the section 130 program was continued as part of the Surface \nTransportation Program [STP]. Under ISTEA, 10 percent of a State's \napportioned STP funds are allocated to States for highway rail crossing \nimprovement and hazard elimination projects.\n  The GAO reported that key indicators of risk factors used to assess \nrail grade crossing safety in a State are not considered during the \napportionment process. The GAO outlined the Federal Highway \nAdministration's ongoing efforts to review options for STP formula \nchanges that will adjust the current flat percentage allocation from a \nState's apportioned amount to account for these risk factors. Applying \nthese factors to the funding formula creates a more targeted and \nfocused process that maximizes the effectiveness of Federal funds.\n  The risk factors criteria considered includes a State's share of the \nnational total for number of public crossings, number of public \ncrossings with passive warning devices, total number of accidents and \ntotal number of fatalities occurring as a result of vehicle-train \ncollisions at highways rail grade crossings.\n  For example, while Indiana received 3.4 percent of section 130 funds \nin fiscal year 1995, the Hoosier State experienced 6.1 percent of the \nNation's accidents and 5.9 percent of the fatalities as a result of \nvehicle-train collisions from 1991-93. In addition, Indiana has 4 \npercent of the Nation's public rail crossings: 6,788.\n  Preliminary estimates of STP apportionments under this legislation \nindicate Indiana's share of section 130 funds could increase by 33 \npercent, from the fiscal year 1995 level of $4.9 million to $6.6 \nmillion. Overall, about 24 States would receive an increase in section \n130 funds for grade crossing improvements.\n  The GAO cited similar statistical comparisons for Illinois, Ohio, and \nTexas.\n  While the Indiana Department of transportation [INDOT] spent more \nthan $10 million last year on improvements to highway rail grade \ncrossings, a one-third increase in section 130 funds would allow INDOT \nand other State departments of transportation additional flexibility \nand resources to improve safety at dangerous rail crossings.\n  The Formula Enhancement Act addresses the allocation problem by \nadjusting the funding formula for the STP to include a 5-percent \napportionment of funds to States for the section 130 program based on a \n3-year average of these risk factors. The FHWA has been helpful in \npreparing this legislation, and I want to express my appreciation to \nthem for their assistance.\n  This legislation will help improve the way the Federal Government \ntargets existing resources to enhance safety on our Nation's highways \nand along our rail corridors. This legislation does not call for new \nFederal spending, but rather for a more equitable and effective \ndistribution of existing highway funds to States to enhance safety at \ndangerous highway rail grade crossings.\n\n  I am introducing this measure today anticipating congressional \nconsideration next year of a reauthorization bill to succeed the ISTEA \nwhich expires after fiscal year 1997. With the many changes occurring \nin the 104th Congress, it is unclear what direction the next highway \nauthorization bill will take or what the Federal role will be in \nmaintaining the national transportation infrastructure. I wanted to \nshare with my colleagues my interest in ensuring that highway rail \ngrade crossing safety will be a part of these deliberations. I am \nhopeful highway rail grade crossing safety improvement efforts will \ncontinue in rail intensive States and in other States where accidents \nand fatalities continue to occur a result of vehicle-train collisions.\n  I am hopeful this legislation will reinforce the importance of \nhighway rail grade crossing safety issues as the Congress moves forward \nwith the national discussion of U.S. transportation policy for the 21st \ncentury. I believe continued emphasis on finding new and better ways to \nmaximize existing resources that enhance safety at highway rail grade \ncrossings will contribute to the overall effort in Congress and in the \nStates to prevent accidents, save lives and sustain a balanced and \neffective transportation network for the Nation.\n Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the bill which Senator Lugar and I \nare introducing today will help correct a critical deficiency and help \nprevent senseless, tragic accidents at rail grade crossings.\n  Indiana is one State which suffers from high numbers of accidents and \ndeaths at railroad crossings. Rail transportation is important in \nIndiana, playing a key role in the State's agriculture and \nmanufacturing economy. Much of the rail activity goes through northwest \nIndiana which accounts for 75 percent of the State's rail crossing \naccidents. In 1994, Indiana ranked third in the Nation with 263 rail \ncrossing accidents, resulting in the deaths of 27 people; 6.1 percent \nof all rail crossing accidents in America took place in Indiana and 5.9 \npercent of the fatalities occurred there.\n  As Senator Lugar and I became aware that Indiana had a critical \nproblem with rail accidents, we asked the General Accounting Office \n[GAO] to examine the safety conditions in States with a high \nconcentration of rail crossings. When the GAO report was completed in \nAugust 1995, it revealed that although Indiana had a large number of \nrail crossings--6,700, the sixth largest number of all States--the \nState received only 3.4 percent of the Federal funding available \nspecifically targeted to prevent such tragedies.\n  The section 130 program was established in 1973 to help States reduce \naccidents, injuries, and fatalities at public railroad crossings. In \nthe first 10 years of the program, accidents declined by 61 percent and \ndeaths were reduced by 34 percent. Since 1985, however, there has been \nlittle progress made toward further reducing these numbers.\n  The problem becomes apparent when you realize that many of the States \nwith the highest concentration of crossings, number of accidents, and \nfatalities receive less money than States which do not have as great a \nneed. Thus, the GAO concluded that the Federal Government should \nexamine funding formulas and consider using risk factors in determining \nhow to distribute section 130 highway dollars to States for rail safety \npurposes.\n  The current formula funding--based on 10 percent of a State's surface \ntransportation program [STP] funding--does not take into account such \nessential criteria as a State's total number of crossings, amount of \ntrain traffic, as well as the number of accidents and fatalities. I \nbelieve it is critical that these elements--risk factors--be \nconsidered in determining how much money a State should receive for \nrail safety.\n\n  The formula enhancement bill corrects this flaw in the current \nfunding formula. Based on the GAO report and working with the Federal \nHighway Administration, we have crafted legislation which changes the \nformula in way to ensure that States with the greatest risk receive \nmore funding. This bill does not increase Federal spending in any way. \nRather it ensures that current spending on rail safety under section \n130 is done more effectively. Specifically, it sets aside 5 percent of \nthe total apportionment for surface transportation program funding and \ndirects it to the States based on the total number of accidents, total \nnumber of fatalities, number of public railway highway crossings, and \nnumber of passive warning devices.\n  Under this new formula, Indiana--which received $4.9 million in \n1995--could receive $6.6 million. Overall, 24 States would benefit from \nincreased funding to help reduce rail crossing accidents.\n  It is our goal to work with the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks to help ensure that this formula change is considered as part of \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act reauthorization when \nit occurs either next year or in 1997.\n  Money alone will not solve all the problems related to rail crossing \naccidents. I support greater education programs such as Operation \nLifesaver. Continued cooperation among all levels of government: local, \nState, and Federal is essential to stop these sort of tragedies. \nHowever, we should also ensure that a Federal program which was \ndesigned to help States with safety issues at rail crossings is \ntargeted in a \n\n[[Page S19310]]\nway which ensures the most effective use of these resources.\n  It is time for us to direct this program where it has the best hope \nof making an impact and thus reduce the senseless accidents and tragic \ndeaths at rail crossings.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1513. A bill to amend the Trademark Act of 1946 to make certain \nrevisions relating to the protection of famous marks; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   the federal trademark dilution act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am very pleased to introduce today the \nFederal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995.\n  Mr. President, this bill is designed to protect famous trademarks \nfrom subsequent uses that blur the distinctiveness of the mark or \ntarnish or disparage it, even in the absence of a likelihood of \nconfusion. Thus, for example, the use of DuPont shoes, Buick aspirin, \nand Kodak pianos would be actionable under this bill.\n  The concept of dilution dates as far back as 1927, when the Harvard \nLaw Review published an article by Frank I. Schecter in which it was \nargued that coined or unique trademarks should be protected from the \n``gradual whittling away of dispersion of the identity and hold upon \nthe public mind'' of the mark by its use on noncompeting goods. Today, \n25 States have laws that prohibit trademark dilution.\n  A Federal dilution statute is necessary, Mr. President, because \nfamous marks ordinarily are used on a nationwide basis and dilution \nprotection is only available on a patchwork system of protection. \nFurther, some courts are reluctant to grant nationwide injunctions for \nviolation of State law where half of the States have no dilution law. \nProtection for famous marks should not depend on whether the forum \nwhere suit is filed has a dilution statute. This simply encourages \nforum-shopping and increases the amount of litigation.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, the GATT agreement includes a provision \ndesigned to provide dilution protection to famous marks. Thus, \nenactment of this bill will be consistent with the terms of the \nagreement, as well as the Paris Convention, of which the United States \nis also a member. Passage of a Federal dilution statute, Mr. President, \nwould also assist the executive branch in its bilateral and \nmultilateral negotiations with other countries to secure greater \nprotection for the famous marks owned by U.S. companies. Foreign \ncountries are reluctant to change their laws to protect famous U.S. \nmarks if the United States does not afford special protection for such \nmarks.\n  Mr. President, as many Members will recall, a Federal dilution \nstatute was proposed as part of the comprehensive trademark reform \npackage that was enacted into law in November 1988, and took effect 1 \nyear later. The comprehensive bill initially passed by the Senate \nincluded the dilution provision. However, the dilution proposal was \ndeleted from the bill prior to final congressional passage. The current \nproposal, I believe, eliminates any concerns previously voiced in \ncongressional hearings regarding the former Federal dilution provision.\n  Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today is the product of \nyears of consideration and the study by Congress and various experts in \nthis field, including the International Trademark Association, formerly \nthe United States Trademark Association. It would amend section 43 of \nthe Trademark Act to add a new subsection (c) to provide protection \nagainst another's commercial use of a famous mark which results in the \ndilution of such mark. The bill defines the term ``dilution'' to mean \n``the lessening of the capacity of registrant's mark to identify and \ndistinguish goods and services regardless of the presence or absence of \n(a) competition between the parties, or (b) likelihood of confusion, \nmistake, or deception.''\n\n  The proposal adequately addresses legitimate first amendment concerns \nespoused by the broadcasting industry and the media. The bill will not \nprohibit or threaten noncommercial expression, such as parody, satire, \neditorial and other forms of expression that are not a part of a \ncommercial transaction. The bill includes specific language exempting \nfrom liability the ``fair use'' of a mark in the context of comparative \ncommercial advertising or promotion.\n  The legislation sets forth a number of specific criteria in \ndetermining whether a mark has acquired the level of distinctiveness to \nbe considered famous. These criteria include: First, the degree of \ninherent or acquired distinctiveness of the mark; second, the duration \nand extent of the use of the mark; and third, the geographical extent \nof the trading area in which the mark is used.\n  With respect to remedies, the bill limits the relief a court could \naward to an injunction unless the wrongdoer willfully intended to trade \non the registrant's reputation or to cause dilution, in which case \nother remedies under the Trademark Act become available. The ownership \nof a valid Federal registration would act as a complete bar to a \ndilution action brought under State law.\n  Mr. President, the Judiciary Committee, which I chair, looks forward \nto working with all interested parties to secure enactment of a Federal \ndilution statute that adequately meets the needs of trademark owners \nand is consistent with the public interest.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section-by-\nsection analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1513\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Trademark Dilution \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCE TO THE TRADEMARK ACT OF 1946.\n\n       For purposes of this Act, the Act entitled `'An Act to \n     provide for the registration and protection of trademarks \n     used in commerce, to carry out the provisions of certain \n     international conventions, and for other purposes'', approved \n     July 5, 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1051 and following), shall be \n     referred to as the ``Trademark Act of 1946''.\n\n     SEC. 3. REMEDIES FOR DILUTION OF FAMOUS MARKS.\n\n       (A) Remedies.--Section 43 of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 \n     U.S.C. 1125) is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new subsection:\n       ``(c)(1) The owner of a famous mark shall be entitled, \n     subject to the principles of equity and upon such terms as \n     the court deems reasonable, to an injunction against another \n     person's commercial use in commerce of a mark or trade name, \n     if such use begins after the mark becomes famous and causes \n     dilution of the distinctive quality of the famous mark, and \n     to obtain such other relief as is provided in this \n     subsection. In determining whether a mark is distinctive and \n     famous, a court may consider factors such as, but not limited \n     to--\n       ``(A) the degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of \n     the mark;\n       ``(B) the duration and extent of use of the mark in \n     connection with the goods or services with which the mark is \n     used;\n       ``(C) the duration and extent of advertising and publicity \n     of the mark;\n       ``(D) the geographical extent of the trading area in which \n     the mark is used;\n       ``(E) the channels of trade for the goods or services with \n     which the mark is used;\n       ``(F) the degree of recognition of the mark in the trading \n     areas and channels of trade of the mark's owner and the \n     person against whom the injunction is sought;\n       ``(G) the nature and extent of use of the same or similar \n     marks by third parties; and\n       ``(H) the existence of a registration under the Act of \n     March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905, or on the \n     principal register.\n       ``(2) In an action brought under this subsection, the owner \n     of a famous mark shall be entitled only to injunctive relief \n     unless the person against whom the injunction is sought \n     willfully intended to trade on the owner's reputation or to \n     cause dilution of the famous mark. If such willful intent is \n     proven, the owner of a famous mark shall also be entitled to \n     the remedies set forth in sections 35(a) and 36, subject to \n     the discretion of the court and the principles of equity.\n       ``(3) The ownership by a person of a valid registration \n     under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, \n     1905, or on the principal register shall be a complete bar to \n     an action against that person, with respect to that mark, \n     that is brought by another person under the common law or \n     statute of a State and that seeks to prevent dilution of the \n     distinctiveness of a mark, label, or form of advertisement.\n       ``(4) The following shall not be actionable under this \n     section:\n       ``(A) Fair use of a famous mark by another person in \n     comparative commercial advertising or promotion to identify \n     the competing goods or services of the owner of the famous \n     mark.\n       ``(B) Noncommercial use of a mark.\n       ``(C) All forms of news reporting and news commentary.''.\n       \n[[Page S19311]]\n\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--The heading for title VIII of \n     the Trademark Act of 1946 is amended by striking ``AND FALSE \n     DESCRIPTIONS'' and inserting ``FALSE DESCRIPTIONS, AND \n     DILUTION''.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITION.\n\n       Section 45 of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1127) is \n     amended by inserting after the paragraph defining when a mark \n     shall be deemed to be ``abandoned'' the following:\n       ``The term `dilution' means the lessening of the capacity \n     of a famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or \n     services, regardless of the presence or absence of--\n       ``(1) competition between the owner of the famous mark and \n     other parties, or\n       ``(2) likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take \n     effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Section-by-Section Analysis of the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of \n                                  1995\n\n       Section 1. Section one of the bill provides the short title \n     of the bill, the ``Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995.''\n       Section 2. Section 2 of the bill clarifies the references \n     in the bill to the ``Trademark Act of 1946,'' giving the full \n     title of the law and statutory citations.\n       Section 3. Section 3 of the bill would create a new Section \n     43 of the Lanham Act to provide a cause of action \n     for dilution of ``famous'' marks. A new Section 43(c)(1) \n     would provide protection to the owners of famous marks \n     against another person's commercial use in commerce of the \n     mark which dilutes the distinctive quality of the mark. The \n     section would provide protection to famous marks, whether or \n     not the mark is the subject of a federal trademark \n     registration.\n       Section 3 identifies a list of nonexclusive factors that a \n     court may consider in determining whether a mark qualifies \n     for protection. These factors include: (1) the degree of \n     distinctiveness of the mark; (2) the duration and extent of \n     use of the mark; (3) the geographical extent of the trading \n     area in which the mark is used; and (4) whether the mark is \n     federally registered.\n       With respect to relief, a new Section 43(c)(2) of the \n     Lanham Act would provide that, normally, the owner of a \n     famous mark will only be entitled to an injunction upon a \n     finding of liability. An award of damages, including the \n     possibility of treble damages, may be awarded upon a finding \n     that the defendant willfully intended to trade on the \n     trademark owner's reputation or to cause dilution of the \n     famous mark.\n       Under section 3 of the bill, a new Section 43(c)(3) of the \n     Lanham Act would provide that ownership of a valid federal \n     trademark registration is a complete bar to an action brought \n     against the registrant under state dilution law. In this \n     regard, it is important to note that the proposed federal \n     dilution statute would not preempt state dilution laws.\n       A new Section 43(c)(4) sets forth various activities that \n     would not be actionable. These activities include the use of \n     a famous mark for purposes of comparative advertising, the \n     noncommercial use of a famous mark, and the use of a famous \n     mark in the context of news reporting and news commentary. \n     This section is consistent with existing case law. The cases \n     recognize that the use of marks in certain forms of artistic \n     and expressive speech is protected by the First Amendment.\n       Section 4. Section 4 of the bill defines the term \n     ``dilution'' to mean the lessening of the capacity of a \n     famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or services, \n     regardless of the presence or absence of (1) competition \n     between the owner of the famous mark and other parties, or \n     (2) likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception. The \n     definition is designed to encompass all forms of dilution \n     recognized by the courts, including disparagement. In an \n     effort to clarify the law on the subject, the definition also \n     recognizes that a cause of action for dilution may exist \n     whether or not the parties market the same or related goods \n     and whether or not likelihood of confusion exists.\n       Section 5. Section 5 of the bill makes the legislation \n     effective upon enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/29/senate-section/article/S19306-9", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SENATE RESOLUTION 206--MAKING MINORITY PARTY APPOINTMENTS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY (for Mr. Daschle) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am honored today to recognize a \nmomentous occasion in the history of the great State which I have the \nprivilege to represent, the proud Lone Star State of Texas. This month \nwe recognize and celebrate Texas' statehood sesquicentennial, 150 years \nduring which we have been blessed and have prospered.\n  The spirit of Texas has been evident since our earliest days, when we \nwere conceived in the eternal struggle for freedom. The men and women \nof Texas have an innate and inherent commitment to God and country, and \neven our flag displays a single star--our people have always looked to \nthe Heavens.\n  No utterance in our State's history better represents the spirit, \nvirtue, and values of Texas, then or now, than the remarkable letter \nwritten on February 24, 1836, by William Barret Travis at the Alamo:\n\n       To the People of Texas and all Americans in the world--\n       Fellow citizens and compatriots--\n       I am besieged, by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under \n     Santa Anna--I have sustained a continual Bombardment and \n     cannonade for 24 hours and have not lost a man--The enemy has \n     demanded a surrender at discretion; otherwise, the garrison \n     are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken--I have \n     answered the demands with a cannon shot, and our flag still \n     waves proudly from the wall--I shall never surrender or \n     retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, or \n     patriotism and of everything dear to the American character, \n     to come to our aid, with all dispatch--The enemy is receiving \n     reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to three or \n     four thousand in four or five days. If this call is \n     neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as \n     possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due \n     to his own honor and that of his country--Victory or Death.\n                                            William Barret Travis,\n                                    Lieutenant Colonel Commandant.\n\n  Colonel Travis' letter captures the heart and soul of the people of \nTexas, and I am honored to recognize the statehood sesquicentennial of \nmy beloved Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/29/senate-section/article/S19311-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SIGNING DULY ENROLLED BILLS\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, today when the Senate convened, the \nPresident pro tempore, Senator Thurmond, appointed the Senator from \nIdaho, Senator Kempthorne, to be Acting President pro tempore for the \nday. It is my understanding Senator Thurmond is necessarily absent \nattending business in South Carolina and attending the funeral of the \npresident pro tempore of the South Carolina State Senate, the Honorable \nMarshall Williams.\n  While Senator Kempthorne was Acting President pro tempore for today, \none of his responsibilities was to sign duly enrolled bills. Signing \nenrolled bills is part of the process necessary prior to the documents \nbeing sent to the White House for the President's approval or \ndisapproval.\n  Senator Kempthorne had the distinct pleasure to sign the following \nenrolled bills, therefore facilitating their being sent to the White \nHouse: H.R. 4, welfare reform; H.R. 394, State pensions; H.R. 1878, \nenrollment of HMO's; and H.R. 2627, Smithsonian coin.\n  I want to commend Senator Kempthorne and congratulate him on his work \ntoday. I hope the President signs all the bills. That may or may not be \nthe case.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/29/senate-section/article/S19311-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19311-S19312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REAUTHORIZING THE TIED AID CREDIT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 1295, just received from the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1295) to amend the Trademark Act of 1946 to \n     make certain revisions relating to the protection of famous \n     marks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, passage of this bill is part of our effort \nto improve intellectual property protection around the world. I hope \nthat it will serve to improve trademark enforcement domestically and \nserve as a model for our trading partners overseas.\n  Along with the Anti-Counterfeiting and Consumer Protection Act of \n1995, S. 1360, which recently passed the Senate and has already been \nthe subject of a hearing and markup before the House Judiciary \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property, this bill \nwill help protect the good names, reputations for quality, and \ninvestments of American companies from IBM to Ben & Jerry's.\n  Although no one else has yet considered this application, it is my \nhope that this antidilution statute can help stem the use of deceptive \nInternet addresses taken by those who are choosing marks that are \nassociated with the products and reputations of others.\n  I thank our House colleagues for their work on this bill. It is a \npleasure to work with Chairman Moorhead and the House subcommittee on \nthese matters. I commend, in particular, Representative Schroeder for \nher outstanding work on this measure. Our House colleagues have \nannounced their intention not to seek reelection next fall. Their \nleadership and judgment will be greatly missed.\n  When we in the Senate last considered and passed a similar bill to \nprovide an injunctive remedy against the dilution of the effectiveness \nof distinctive marks, we did so as part of more comprehensive trademark \nrevision legislation in 1988. Since that time the dilution of well-\nknown marks has become a greater problem both domestically and, \nespecially, internationally.\n  We intend for this legislation to strengthen the hand of our \ninternational negotiators from the Office of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative and the Department of Commerce as they press for \nbilateral and multilateral agreements to secure greater protection for \nthe world famous marks of our U.S. companies. Foreign countries should \nno longer argue that we do not protect our marks from dilution, nor \nseek to excuse their own inaction against practices that are \ndestructive of the distinctiveness of U.S. marks within their borders.\n  I am delighted that bill now includes express reference to fair use, \nnews reporting, and news commentary. I continue to believe, as our \nHouse colleagues also affirm, that parody, satire, editorial, and other \nforms of expression will remain unaffected by this legislation.\n  Finally, I want to acknowledge the strong support of the U.S. Patent \nand Trademark Office, the Department of Commerce, and that of the \nInternational Trademark Association and its many members. Without their \nefforts, we would not be in position to approve this legislation and \nsend it to the President for his signature.\n  Mr. President, this was an example of Senator Hatch, myself, and \nothers working in a bipartisan effort to get a major piece of \nlegislation through. I thank the leader for his efforts in getting it \nthrough.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill be placed at \nthe appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the bill (H.R. 1295) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/29/senate-section/article/S19311-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, let me indicate that we have had a meeting \nall afternoon at the White House, and I will say, without violating our \nagreement on statements, afterward we had a good working session. We \ncovered a lot of ground. We are going to meet tomorrow morning. We are \ngoing to be there all day, and probably through the evening. We will \ndetermine then whether or not we will be here Sunday or Monday. I think \nit is fair to say that we had a constructive session where everybody, \nin my view--regardless of party, regardless of being from the White \nHouse, Democrats or Republicans, the House or the Senate--had one thing \nin mind: trying to move the process along to get a balanced budget over \nthe next 7 years.\n\n  I think there is a recognition that most Americans, regardless of \nparty, want us to do that. We are not there yet. We have a lot of work \nto do. But I would say that today has been a day of progress.\n  I would also say that it had been my hope earlier that we could work \nout an agreement where Federal employees could go back to work. A week \nago today we passed a measure in the Senate by unanimous consent that, \nin effect, deemed all Federal employees ``essential'' and also \nguaranteed that they would be paid. That bill went to the House, but it \nhas not been considered.\n  I was advised today by the majority leader in the House, Congressman \nArmey, and the speaker, Congressman Gingrich, that if we would send to \nthe House the same measure we passed last week, and the so-called \nMideast Peace Facilitation Act, and a third provision with reference to \nexpedited procedures, so that once an agreement is reached there will \nbe some expedited procedure in the Senate so that we will be certain we \nget a disposition of it, that they would be able to take that up today, \nFriday, by unanimous consent in the House. That was their best \njudgment. And so I was in hopes that we could work that out on the \nSenate side.\n  I was advised at the White House by the distinguished Democratic \nleader, Senator Daschle, that they would have to object because of the \nexpedited procedure language, which seems to me something we ought to \nbe able to work out. If we want people to go back to work and we want \nto make certain they will be paid and we also want to pass another very \nimportant piece of legislation, we ought to be able to reach some \nagreement on how we are going to handle the bill if we have an \nagreement, or if we do not have an agreement, how would we handle the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I will ask that the text of this be printed in the Record after I ask \nunanimous consent, which will be objected to. But we have just taken \nthe Budget Act, reduced the time to 10 hours, open to amendment during \nthat 10 hours. Otherwise, we kept the Byrd amendment, for example. So \nwe hope that the Democratic leader will have an opportunity between now \nand tomorrow to maybe come back with a counteroffer, because we are \nready to act, put people back to work, and my view is that it is a very \nimportant matter that should be attended to.\n\n[[Page S19313]]\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 2808\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2808, regarding Middle \nEast peace facilitation, that there be one amendment in order, which \ncontains identical text of H.R. 2808, identical text of S. 1508, the \nso-called back to work provision, and expedited procedure language with \nrespect to Senate consideration of the Balanced Budget Act by 2002, \nthat the amendment be deemed agreed to, the bill be read the third \ntime, and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nall without any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. There would \nbe no objection to the passage of the Middle East Peace Facilitation \nAct, which I think the majority of Senators on both sides of the aisle \nwould like to see passed and I think would be critical in the interest \nof the countries in the Middle East for peace, but also in our own \nnational security interests.\n  The back to work provision was passed, as the distinguished majority \nleader knows, with the support of the Democratic leader and all Members \non this side of the aisle and on his side by unanimous consent last \nSaturday. And the other body had decided to take off and, I guess, go \nhome on the Christmas vacation and not take it up. So we would have no \nobjection to that.\n  The last part is the part I object to, Mr. President, because what we \nare saying is we will change the Senate rules on the time of debate and \nall on a bill, which nobody--neither the distinguished majority leader \nnor myself--knows what is in it. We all know we have the same goal, and \nboth he and I agree to have a balanced budget by 2002. But we do not \nknow what is in it. I do not think I would be able to get consent of \nmany Members to waive, basically, the Senate rules on a piece of \nlegislation that we have not yet seen. But I certainly hope that some \ntype of procedure can be put together, and I assume that at the time \nwhen the budget comes up, it will be under some form of expedited \nprocedure.\n  So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate that, of course, under one \nscenario, if an agreement is reached, it will be reached with the \nPresident of the United States and with the Democratic leaders of the \nHouse and the Senate. So it is not something that has not been \ndiscussed. I know they are doing--as we are doing--checking with every \ncommittee chairman on every issue that might affect anyone's \njurisdiction. The Democrats are doing it and the Republicans are doing \nit. We want to make certain that as many people as possible can be \nconsulted as we proceed to try to reach some agreement on a balanced \nbudget over the next 7 years scored by the Congressional Budget Office \nwhich the American people by a large margin want.\n  For the last couple of weeks, there has been this problem of Federal \nworkers and whether or not they could go to work. Some tried to go, and \nthey were turned away. There is a lot of gnashing of teeth by Federal \nworkers through no fault of their own because the appropriations bill \nwere vetoed--for example, whether it was the HUD-VA, or Interior, or \nthe State, Justice, Commerce veto by the President. Those people are \nnot working.\n  The President signed the Agriculture bill. So the people in the \nDepartment of Agriculture are working.\n  Labor-HHS is being held up on a party-line vote. We cannot bring it \nup on the floor. There are a lot of employees there who are not \nworking.\n  We did by unanimous consent cover the District of Columbia until \nJanuary 3.\n  That leaves one bill, foreign operations, which is hung up over one \namendment, and we believe that could and should be resolved at an early \ndate.\n  But the point is now we are in the position where at least by deeming \nthe Federal workers to be essential employees and by in effect \nguaranteeing pay, that they will get it right away, but once the budget \nagreement has been agreed to, it would happen. All that is holding us \nup now and everybody going back to work tomorrow, or Sunday, or Monday, \nor Tuesday after the holidays is whether or not my colleagues on the \nother side will help us expedite the passage of a balanced budget \nagreement.\n  Now, it seems to me that we ought to be able to work that out. I am \nprepared to do that. I think the Senator from South Dakota, the \nDemocrat leader, indicated after we left the White House that he was \ncertainly willing to discuss it further.\n  We will be in session tomorrow. The House is on call. They can be in \nsession tomorrow. And it is my hope that we can figure out some way to \npass this package, unless there is a modification that we have not \nthought of. We could put a time agreement on how long it would be in \neffect. So it would only be a temporary modification of the present \nrules maybe until February 15, whatever. But I hope that we will sit \ndown and work it out.\n\n  I think the White House has an interest in trying to resolve this \nissue. And they have copies. I have given a copy of this to the \nPresident. I discussed it with the President myself before I left the \nWhite House. Mr. Panetta has a copy. Hopefully there will be enough \nideas and thoughts on it overnight so that early in the morning we can \nreach some agreement, get it passed, and let people go back to work--\nthe people who are caught in the middle, so to speak--and let them go \nback to work knowing that they will be paid.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill I proposed be \nprinted in the Record so my colleagues may have an opportunity to study \nit tomorrow.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL CONSIDERATION OF THE BALANCED BUDGET \n                   BILL.\n\n       (a) Introduction and Consideration of the Balanced Budget \n     Agreement.--\n       (1) Introduction.--The balanced budget bill, described in \n     (a)(3), shall be introduced in the House of Representatives \n     by the Chairman of the Budget Committee of that House and, in \n     the Senate, by the Majority Leader, after consultation with \n     the Minority Leader. In the Senate, the balanced budget bill \n     shall not be referred to committee but shall be placed \n     directly on the Calendar.\n       (2) Consideration.--In the Senate, the balanced budget bill \n     shall be considered as if it were a reconciliation bill \n     pursuant to section 310 of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974, with the following exceptions:\n       (A) Debate in the Senate on the balanced budget bill, and \n     all amendments, thereto and debatable motions and appeals in \n     connection therewith, shall be limited to not more than 10 \n     hours.\n       (B) Upon expiration of the 10 hours of debate, without \n     intervening action, the Senate shall proceed to vote on the \n     final disposition of the balanced budget bill.\n       (3) Balanced budget bill.--As used in this section, the \n     term ``balanced budget bill'' means the bill that achieves a \n     balanced budget not later than fiscal year 2002 that is \n     introduced pursuant to subsection (a).\n       (b) Revised Aggregates and Allocations.--\n       (1) Revision.--The chairman of the Committee on the Budget \n     of the House of Representatives and the chairman of the \n     Committee on the Budget of the Senate shall each submit to \n     its House--\n       (A) revised levels of total new budget authority, budget \n     outlays, and Federal revenues set forth in House Concurrent \n     Resolutions 67 (One Hundred Fourth Congress) as required by \n     section 301 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974; and\n       (B) revised allocations of new budget authority and total \n     outlays and in the House entitlement authority set forth in \n     the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference \n     report on that concurrent resolution as required by section \n     602 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974,\n\n     consistent with the balanced budget bill introduced pursuant \n     to subsection (a).\n       (2) Adjustments.--The adjustments required under (1) shall \n     be made upon the introduction of the balanced budget bill \n     pursuant to subsection (a).\n       (3) Effect of revised allocations and aggregates.--In the \n     House of Representatives and the Senate, revised levels and \n     allocations submitted under paragraph (1) shall be deemed as \n     the levels and allocations for purposes of sections 302 and \n     602, and 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n       (4) Upon the enactment of a bill referred to in subsection \n     (b), the chairmen of the Committees on the Budget may make \n     necessary technical revisions to the revised allocations made \n     under subsection (b).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/29/senate-section/article/S19312-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19313-S19314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MAKING MINORITY PARTY APPOINTMENTS FOR THE COMMITTEE ON VETERANS' \n                                AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

I believe \nit should be passed. I do not think it is right to be holding that up. \nWe are also willing to pass the back-to-work provision. After all, we \nagreed to it and worked on drafting it last week.\n  I would express the same concern I expressed earlier today, that it \nis very difficult for Federal workers, who do want to go back to work, \nwho are unable to pay their bills as time goes on, who are greatly \nneeded just to have this country run the way it is supposed to, not \ngoing back to work, and yet they have seen, frankly, in the other body \nthose who did not want to take this up have the taxpayers pay for their \nairfare to go back home for Christmas vacation and to pay their \nsalaries of about $500 a day every day they are home for Christmas \nvacation, and have them say, ``We can't go forth.''

Tuesday, that may happen because right now \nthere is the urgency to get the Federal employees back to work. So it \ncould even be Monday that we would be in session. So I am not going to \nrefer to some of these things.\n  But in the event we are not in session until Wednesday, we will be in \nat 11:55 a.m., Wednesday, and we will adjourn the first session of the \n104th Congress; and then the second session of the 104th Congress will \nbegin at noon on Wednesday. I do not anticipate any rollcall votes. I \nhave told my colleagues on both sides of the aisle we at least will \ngive them 24 hours notice.

Mr. President, first, I want to repeat what I said earlier \ntoday. I commend the distinguished majority leader and the \ndistinguished Democratic leader for their efforts. And I commend the \nPresident of the United States. I have talked with the distinguished \nmajority leader about this, and without going into that discussion, I \nhave discussed it also with the distinguished Democratic leader, and I \nhave discussed the budget discussions with the President. I am \nabsolutely convinced that all three want to find our way out of this. I \nam also convinced that the Republican leader, the Democratic leader, \nand the President want to have a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  Obviously, as I said earlier today, there will not be a budget that \nhas everything President Clinton wants in it and there will not be a \nbudget that has everything the distinguished majority leader wants in \nit or the distinguished Democratic leader wants in it or everything I \nmight want in it. But we can reach agreement.\n  I am concerned that some in the other body seem to think of this as \nsome kind of a holy crusade where they must have every single item they \ncan think of, irrespective of the damage it does to the majority of \nHouse and Senate Members of both parties. That is not what was \nconsidered by the Founders of this country. It is not the reason we \nhave different parties. It is not the reason why we have two bodies of \nthe Congress and a President.\n\n  It is difficult for other countries around the world to look at this, \nthe most powerful Nation on Earth, the largest economy on Earth, a \ndemocracy which is held up as a shining example around the world, to \nsee us paralyzed in this way. It is not the way it was intended to be. \nIt is not the way it should be.\n  So I suggest that perhaps it is time to stop the gimmicks of holding \nup tin foil keys or saying we will be here and work this out, and then \nimmediately afterward hopping on an airplane at taxpayers' expense to \ngo home for Christmas vacation, and to do what the distinguished \nmajority leader and the distinguished Democratic leader and the \nPresident are doing, sit down and try to work this out.\n  But I hope, Mr. President, and I believe I am joined by most Members \nof this body in this hope, that we let those Americans who are out of \nwork in the Federal Government, who have a vital role to play in making \nthe greatest, most powerful Nation on Earth operate, let them go back \nto work.\n  Every one of us joined in sorrow when so many of those Federal \nworkers in the home State of the distinguished Presiding Officer died. \nWe did not ask whether they were Republicans or Democrats, liberals or \nconservatives, we just knew that brave Americans who support our \ncountry and help our country operate died in the terrible terrorist \nblast.\n  But we have a lot of other Americans too who come with pride to work \nfor their country. And that pride has to be shaken. And their whole \nquestion of being has to be shaken. I hope we can put them back to \nwork. And I hope that we can show the rest of the country and the rest \nof the world how a great nation operates in a democracy.\n  Certainly that does not mean that I will agree with everything that \nthe distinguished majority leader might propose in this budget, nor he \nwith me, nor perhaps either one of us with all the things that the \nPresident might propose. But I have been here for 21 years, the \ndistinguished majority leader has been here for 27 years, and had \nserved with distinction in the other body prior to that. He and I have \nbeen on many committees of conference. We have been in many leadership \nmeetings where we have debated proposals. We know that nobody ever \nwalks out a winner on every single point that they came in wanting.\n\n  But I think it is safe to say he and I many times have been in \nmeetings, sometimes contentious, sometimes not, but ultimately \neverybody wanted to do what was best for the country. So I wish him \nwell. I wish Senator Daschle \n\n[[Page S19315]]\nwell. I wish the President well. I wish everybody else who is involved \nin these negotiations well because this country needs it. This has gone \nbeyond party or person. It is what the country needs. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will not extend this but just to thank the \nSenator, my colleague, my friend from Vermont, and to indicate I think \nthere is this sense, at least in our meeting today, that everybody is \ngoing to have to give. It is not all going to be one way or the other. \nSo I think there is that recognition by parties on both sides.\n  Obviously, it has to continue. We would like to have everything. They \nwould like to have everything. But the American people, what they \nreally want is a 7-year balanced budget using CBO numbers or the same \nnumbers. They may not understand congressional numbers, White House \nnumbers, but they understand using the same numbers. So I hope we can \naccomplish that. I would not bet the farm on it yet.\n  In any event, many of us would like to be other places--like Iowa or \nNew Hampshire--today, but we are working on a balanced budget. I hope \npeople there will understand that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/29/senate-section/article/S19314-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECESS UNTIL 10 A.M.
