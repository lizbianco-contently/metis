Mr. President, today, there is a period for morning \nbusiness, with the following Senators in control of the designated \ntimes: Senator Hollings, 30 minutes; Senator Domenici will be \ncontrolling the time from 1 to 3:30; Senator Daschle, or his designee, \nfrom 3:30 to 4:30; Senator Coverdell, or his designee, from 4:30 to \n5:30.\n  It is hoped that any Senator wishing to speak on the budget \nresolution conference report will do so today in order to complete \naction on the budget during tomorrow's session--hopefully before noon--\non that matter. Rollcall votes are possible today.\n  I indicated, I think, on Thursday that we are still trying to clear a \nnumber of the nominees. We have cleared some. We have not had much \nsuccess in the judicial nomination area. I would like, where we can, to \ndispose of those before I leave the Senate tomorrow. If you want to \nhave a vote, let us have a vote. I hope we can move the nominations \nthat may be on the calendar--maybe with one or two exceptions--so that \nthose people who have been nominated and have had their hearings will \nbe able to pursue their careers.\n  I have suggested that, if we cannot agree on the package, we can \nstart down the list and go one at a time. If people want to vote, we \nwill vote on judge A, judge B, judge C. That way, at least we can \ndispose of some of those matters.\n  It is also my hope today that we can clear for immediate \nconsideration Calendar No. 253, S. 1438. This deals with the World \nTrade Organization. In fact, it is an agreement I made with President \nClinton. We are talking about passage of the GATT agreement. I was \nconcerned about the World Trade Organization and concerned about there \nnot being enough input from Congress. So there was an agreement between \nmyself and Mickey Kantor, the Trade Representative, and the President, \nthat we would pursue legislation to give Congress additional input and \npermit Congress, in certain cases, to withdraw--or at least initiate \nproceedings to withdraw--from the World Trade Organization. It was \ncarefully worked out at one time. At one time, it had cleared on both \nsides. Senator Byrd had a problem, and I think that problem has now \nbeen resolved.\n  I have not asked for much around here, as far as clearing things for \nmyself, although I have done it for other people. I hope we might be \nable to clear this without amendment today and send it to the House, so \nthe President will have it on his desk for signature--which he is \nperfectly willing to do.\n  It is my understanding that a new offer will be made with reference \nto health reform, the bill that passed this body by a large margin. It \nis still my hope--maybe only a hope--that we can complete action on \nthat matter, if not today, sometime tomorrow. In any event, it is my \nhope that we can get the agreement. If I am not here to vote on it, I \nhope we can have the agreement. It is going to take some give on all \nsides. We cannot have people dictate to us and attack us up in the \nPress Gallery and expect to make any progress. I will not engage in \nthat myself. I do not think that advances the cause of what we are \nattempting to do.\n  Hopefully, we can reach some agreement on that today. I will do all I \ncan to make it happen. I think there has to be give and take on each \nside. I think, in this case, the House has been very\n\n[[Page S5986]]\n\nforthcoming on a number of issues that we did not want in our bill. It \nis not in the Senate bill. It is down to the issue of medical savings \naccounts. The House feels very strongly about it, and I think about \nhalf of the Members here feel very strongly about it.\n\n  So it seems to me that we ought to reach some accommodation on \nmedical savings accounts and send this bill to the President for his \nsignature. I assume he will sign it. There have been a lot of different \nproposals made--some rather useless, and others that I think have some \nmerit. Hopefully, we can resolve that.\n  I understand Senator Kassebaum will be sending us--and maybe it is in \nmy office now--a counterproposal, on which I will meet and discuss with \nmy House colleagues, in the hopes that we can resolve that, too, before \nthe day is out.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator be willing to yield briefly on that \nsubject matter?\n  Mr. DOLE. Sure.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. If the Senator will suspend for a \nmoment, I will take care of another matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/10/senate-section/article/S5985-5", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 3120\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader \nyielding. I join with him in the eternal hope that, perhaps while he is \nstill here, there may be a successful conclusion of this legislation; \nor, if not, at least an agreement can be made that can be followed up \nin his absence. I have stated on other occasions that the majority \nleader has been very much involved in this legislation.\n  Senator Kassebaum has been a real leader on this issue. It has been a \nbi-partisan process in the Senate. Many of the ideas that have been \nincorporated in the legislation dealing with preexisting conditions, \nand portability have been incorporated from the legislation that the \nmajority leader has offered in the past. Although we have had \ndifferences on the MSA issue, he, nonetheless, has indicated, since the \ntime that he announced he was going to leave the Senate, that he was \nvery hopeful that this legislation could be achieved while he was still \nhere.\n  As recently as June 6 he indicated that its chances of success--and I \nthink, he accurately portrayed it--are much greater with his presence \nhere than without it. So I urge that the majority leader, because of \nthe importance of this legislation, as well as the importance that he \nhas placed on this legislation, and his involvement in it, that we \nwould get the agreement, hopefully pass it while he was here; and I was \neven bold enough to suggest that he might want to remain here for the \nnext few days until we were able to get this accomplished. More than 25 \nmillion Americans will be helped each year by this legislation, so it \nshould be a top priority.\n\n  I want to ask the leader about his willingness to accept a reasonable \ncompromise. I know that I speak in this instance for the President, who \nis most interested in getting a test of the idea of the MSA's, which is \nthe principal issue at this point. The proposal from the House would \nprovide the MSA's for approximately 80 percent of all the workers in \nthe country. This obviously is unacceptable. I am hopeful that, with \nthe majority leader's assistance, we could have a test of the idea so \nthat we could explore whether it is helpful. I think reasonable people \ncould find ways of finding a test without adopting a proposal which in \neffect moves toward coverage of 80 percent of the people and then \neventually moves toward complete coverage without additional Senate \nintervention. This program is potentially too destructive to go that \nroute. I hope he will use his own good offices to try to work with all \nparties to see if a legitimate proposal that could accurately be \nportrayed as a real test of the idea could be put into place.\n  There have been four separate proposals that have been advanced by \nthe President and by others. There have been some which have been \nadvanced by our Republican friends.\n  But this would be a great victory for the American people which I \nthink the majority leader ought to share in if we are able to over the \nperiod of these next several hours agree on a real test of the idea, \nand I mean a reasonable kind of test and examination and evaluation \nprior to expanding the proposal.\n  Am I correct that at least the leader is going to try to see if that \nconcept could be at least included in these negotiations?\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. I \nunderstand we have now received a proposal from my colleague, Senator \nKassebaum. We are in the process of reviewing that proposal. I am not \ncertain that the Senator from Massachusetts has a copy of it. But it \nindicates that we might be able to reach some compromise. I would like \nnothing better if we could conclude that today, have conferees \nappointed, and come to a satisfactory conclusion because, as the \nSenator outlined, it affects millions of Americans. It should be done. \nAnd maybe--speaking for myself, I would like to have it done before I \nleave. But at least if that cannot happen, I would like to have the \nagreement before tomorrow at 2 o'clock, and maybe under the Senate \nrules we could deem it passed sometime after the House takes it up. I \nwill have to check with the Parliamentarian on that. But if we have \nsomething to agree to, everybody in the Senate, as the Senator knows, \nthe original bill passed unanimously--hopefully we could reach some \nagreement today, and at least have the agreement entered. Then the \nSenator from Massachusetts, the Senator from Kansas, and others could \ndispose of it later this week.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have not seen the proposal, and I would welcome a \nchance to review it--and others who have been involved in that endeavor \nas well; not just myself but others. Senator Kassebaum--we take \nobviously her leadership role very seriously. I hope that this time \nthat we could work out a real evaluation of the concept without \nexposing tens of millions of our fellow citizens to serious disruption \nin their health insurance if this does not work as well as its \nadvocated claim. That is basically the issue. I know Senator Kassebaum \nwas strongly committed toward an evaluation, a reasonable \nexperimentation, a reasonable assessment, and reporting back. I say \nthat would certainly offer an opportunity to move this forward. I hope \nthat would be the proposal that would be out there rather than just the \nimposition of the program on a vast number of our citizens. But we will \ncertainly look forward to it.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, if I could use my leader time. Is leader \ntime reserved?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Leader time is reserved.\n  The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/10/senate-section/article/S5986-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5986-S5987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SAM NUNN\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, on August 4, 1789, in the first year of \nexistence, the U.S. Senate approved legislation to establish the \nDepartment of War. In the nearly 207 years since that date, the Senate \nhas always devoted a great deal of attention to matters of national \nsecurity.\n  Few Senators in that time, however, have devoted as much attention as \nSenator Sam Nunn of Georgia, who will leave this Senate next January \nafter 24 years of service. While Senator Nunn and I have not agreed on \nevery issue, I am just one of many Republicans who has always respected \nhis expertise and admired his patriotism.\n  I especially recall the affection and admiration which our former \ncolleague Barry Goldwater had for Senator Nunn. During the first 6 \nyears of the Reagan administration, Senator Goldwater and\n\n[[Page S5987]]\n\nSenator Nunn worked on a bipartisan basis to rebuild America's \nmilitary.\n  Senator Nunn has also worked with another military expert, Senator \nRichard Lugar, in working with the former Soviet Republic to relinquish \ntheir nuclear weapons.\n  On nondefense matters, I have appreciated Senator Nunn's strong \nsupport for a balanced budget amendment, product liability reform, and \nanticrime and antidrug efforts.\n  The high respect in which Senator Nunn is held in Washington, DC, is \nechoed in his home State of Georgia. In 1978, Senator Nunn won \nreelection with 83 percent of the vote. In 1984, he received 80 \npercent, he ran completely unopposed.\n  It goes without saying, then, that Senator Nunn could have won \nreelection this year. He has chosen to leave on his own terms, and I \nhave no doubt that his voice will continue to be an important one for \nmany years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/10/senate-section/article/S5986-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO AL SIMPSON\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as I look back on my years in the Senate, \nthere are many Members to whom I am indebted for the friendship and \nsupport they have given me. I can think of no better friend, however, \nand no more reliable ally than Al Simpson.\n  As all Members know, Al served for 10 years as Republican whip. And \nno doubt about it, he made being Republican leader a much easier job. \nEvery time I needed help, every time there was work to be done, every \ntime something was needed as soon as possible, Al Simpson was there, \ngetting the job done, and doing it with the one of a kind sense of \nhumor that is his trademark.\n  Al Simpson is not only one of the wittiest men in Washington, he is \nalso one of the most courageous.\n  From immigration to entitlement reform, he has made a habit of \ntackling the toughest and most controversial of issues, calling them as \nhe sees them, and letting the cards fall where they may.\n  A few weeks back, much of Washington gathered to salute Al Simpson. \nWell, actually, much of Washington gathered to salute Al's wife, Ann. I \nregret that a delayed flight kept me from attending what by all reports \nwas a wonderful evening. Speaker after speaker--Republicans and \nDemocrats alike--rose to salute Al and Ann for all they have done for \nthis institution and this city.\n  The highlight of the event was when former President George Bush \noffered an emotional tribute to the man who he called his best friend \nin the Senate. While Al's retirement means that President Bush is \ngaining a fishing buddy, it means that the Senate is losing one of its \nfinest.\n  I have said before that Al Simpson embodies the American spirit many \nassociate with the American cowboy. He is honest, independent, and he \nalways judges people not by money or position--but by character.\n  It was once written that ``out where the handclasp's a little \nstronger, out where the smile dwells a little longer, that is where the \nWest begins.''\n  If that is the case, then the fact of the matter is that the West \nbegins wherever Al Simpson is, because wherever he goes, he brings \nhandclasps and smiles with him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/10/senate-section/article/S5987-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO NANCY KASSEBAUM\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I guess it is hard to pay tribute to my \ncolleague, Senator Kassebaum, because she has done such an outstanding \njob. And there is no question about it. She is the most popular \npolitician we have had in our State--the most popular ``politician in \npolitics,'' let us put it that way; some do not like the word \n``politician''--for years.\n  Over the past several days, I have paid tribute to those colleagues \nwho are retiring from the Senate at the conclusion of the 104th \nCongress; this is my final tribute.\n  During my years representing Kansas in the U.S. Senate, it has been \nmy privilege to serve alongside two remarkable colleagues from Kansas.\n  The first was Jim Pearson, who was a Senator of great common sense \nand great integrity--a Senator who was widely respected by Members on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  For the past 18 years, I have had the privilege of serving alongside \nanother person respected by all Senators for her common sense and \nintegrity--Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum.\n  Senator Kassebaum is retiring at the end of this session, so she can \nspend more time with her children and grandchildren. The voters of \nKansas, who have cast their ballots for her in overwhelming numbers, \nunderstand her desire to come home, but they also understand that this \nChamber will be losing one of its most thoughtful and effective \nMembers.\n  Nancy Kassebaum does not speak in a loud voice. She does not clamor \nfor media attention. But as all Senators know, while her voice may be \nquiet, her will is strong. For 18 years she has simply represented the \npeople of Kansas to the best of her abilities, and she had made a \npositive difference for Kansas and America in the process.\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Kassebaum has \nmade a habit of staking out policies that provide to be prophetic. She \nwas instrumental in the policies that helped to move South Africa away \nfrom apartheid, and she saw Saddam Hussein as a danger long before many \nothers.\n  As ranking member and then Chair of the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee, she had fought to return dollars and decisions to the local \nlevels, remembering the words of her father, Alf Landon, who once said, \n``There are some smart people in Washington, DC. There are more of them \nin Topeka.''\n  Although as of tomorrow, I will no longer be Nancy's colleague, I \nwill still be her constituent. And along with all other Kansans, I will \ntake great pride in being able to say for 6 more months--as I have for \n18 years--that Nancy Kassebaum is my Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/10/senate-section/article/S5987-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JIM EXON\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I have often said that the people of Kansas \nand Nebraska share a great deal in common besides a border. We share \ncommonsense values. We share agricultural interests. We share a \npreference for public officials who say what they will do, and who do \nwhat they say.\n  For the past 26 years--8 in the Governor's office, and 18 here in the \nSenate--one of Nebraska's preeminent public officials has been Jim \nExon.\n  A small businessman before he entered public service, Senator Exon \nhas devoted a great deal of time to restoring fiscal responsibility to \nGovernment. Senator Exon practices what he preaches, regularly \nreturning a substantial portion of his office allowance to the \ntreasury.\n  Senator Exon has also proposed a budget freeze, and did vote for the \nbalanced budget amendment last year. And Senator Exon knows how much I \nregret his decision to now oppose that amendment.\n  Senator Exon and I have disagreed on a variety of issues over the \nyears, but with me--as with every other Senator--Jim Exon was always \nupfront and to the point.\n  I join with all my colleagues in wishing Jim and Pat Exon the best as \nthey return to the State they love so much and have served so well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/10/senate-section/article/S5987-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5987-S5988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ROBERT BYRD\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, during 1987 and 1988, I delivered a series \nof nearly 300 brief speeches on the Senate floor to commemorate the \nlong history of this great institution.\n  Each of these so-called Senate bicentennial minutes focused on a \nsignificant person, custom, or event associated with the Senate's \ndevelopment during its first two centuries.\n  The inspiration for this project came from my fellow floor leader \nduring that 100th Congress, Senator Robert C. Byrd. Beginning in 1980, \nSenator Byrd launched an unprecedented series of hour-long addresses to \nthe Senate detailing this body's rich history. The 100-part series was \ncompleted in November 1989.\n  In recognition of this extraordinary achievement, Congress agreed to \npublish these addresses in four richly illustrated volumes that today \nare universally known as ``Byrd's Senate History.''\n  Senator Byrd has not only written about the Senate's history, he has \nalso made it.

Mr. President, during my more than 11 years as Republican \nleader, it has been my privilege to serve across the aisle from three \nDemocrat leaders.\n  Senator Byrd sat in the leader's chair for 4 of those years, Senator \nGeorge Mitchell for 6, and Senator Tom Daschle for the past year and a \nhalf.\n  When Senator Daschle became leader in January 1995, I said then that \nI had learned that the only way the Senate can run effectively is for \nthe two leaders to have a relationship based on absolute trust.\n  While Senator Daschle and I have disagreed on the vast majority of \nissues before the Senate, and while he used the Senate rules to the \nminority's full advantage--just as I did when I was in his position, \nour relationship has been one of trust and mutual respect.\n  In fact, Senator Daschle has seemed to enjoy the job of minority \nleader so much, that I have told him one of my wishes on departing the \nSenate is that he will continue to serve as minority leader for many \nyears to come.\n  I have also told Senator Daschle that serving as a Senate leader when \nyour party holds the While House is oftentimes more frustrating than \nserving as leader when the opposition party holds the White House. And \nit is my hope that he will experience those lower frustrations next \nJanuary.\n  But I want to thank Senator Daschle. We both come from the same part \nof the country, South Dakota and Kansas, where the weather can do us \nin, or do the farmers in, which does everybody else in. We both \nunderstand the importance of agriculture, but we also understand the \nimportance of other issues that affect our colleagues, whether it is \nhealth care or whether it is the WIC Program or food stamps or other \nthings that I worked on a long time ago with another Senator from South \nDakota named George McGovern.\n  So I just congratulate Senator Daschle for his great success as the \nDemocrat leader. I thank him for the courtesies he and Linda have \nextended to me and Elizabeth over the past year and a half. And I wish \nhim the best of luck--not everything he would wish, but the best of \nluck, particularly when it comes to his own personal work in the Senate \nand his own personal life.\n  He does a good job. He works hard. We do not surprise each other. We \ntrust each other; no games. And that is what makes the Senate work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/10/senate-section/article/S5988-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the insistence of the House Republican \nleadership on forcing medical savings accounts into the Kassebaum-\nKennedy bill has become the Trojan Horse that could destroy health \ninsurance reform.\n  This untried and dangerous proposal does not belong in the consensus \ninsurance reform bill. It has already been rejected by the Senate. A \nbill containing it cannot be enacted into law and signed by the \nPresident.\n  The Democrats and the White House have offered a fair compromise, \nwhich would provide for a controlled demonstration of the MSA concept \nto see if it should be expanded. But the House Republican leadership \nhas said that it will be their way or no way. As Majority Leader Armey \nsaid yesterday, ``I will not give up medical savings accounts,'' and he \ndared the President to veto the bill.\n  Senator Dole is the only one who can break this impasse and persuade \nHouse Republicans to abandon their intransigence and pass a bipartisan \nbill that the President can sign. Senator Dole clearly understands how \nimportant this program is to the American people. When the bill was \npassed, Senator Dole said:\n\n       Common sense has finally prevailed. Passage of this bill \n     will not only improve our health care system, it could very \n     well restore the faith of the American public that the work \n     of Congress is not just a series of political stalemates. \n     Even in an election year, we can work on a bipartisan basis \n     to pass legislation that will improve the lives of so many \n     Americans.\n\n  Senator Dole deserves considerable credit for this bill. All of its \nreforms were also included, in one form or another, in the health \ninsurance bill he introduced in the last Congress. It also includes \nconstructive proposals that he offered for aid to small business, and \nto help families meet the high cost of long-term care, and to crack \ndown on fraud and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Last week, Senator Dole said, ``I'm afraid if I leave and it's not \ndone, it might not happen.'' He is right. No one else has the ability \nto persuade House Republicans to back off their extreme position. If \nSenator Dole means what he says, he should postpone his departure from \nthe Senate for a few days and pass this bill. He can do a great deal of \ngood for the American people by staying for a few days and finishing \nthis legislation.\n  Medical savings accounts are a highly controversial issue that does \nnot belong on this bill except on the basis of a carefully controlled \ntest. MSA's have the potential to severely undermine the current health \ninsurance system that millions of Americans rely on--particularly those \nwith serious illnesses or disabilities.\n  MSA's are likely to raise health insurance premiums through the roof \nand make insurance unaffordable for large numbers of citizens. They \nwill discourage preventive care and raise health care costs. They are a \nmultibillion-dollar tax giveaway to the wealthy and healthy at the \nexpense of working families and the sick. Their cost could balloon the \ndeficit.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill contains consensus reforms that virtually \neveryone agrees on. It guarantees that no American will be denied \nhealth insurance or be saddled with exclusions for preexisting \nconditions because they change their job or lose their job, or because \ntheir employer changes insurance companies. It provides help to small \nbusinesses that want to join together to negotiate lower insurance \npremiums of the kind that only large corporations can obtain today.\n  The bill is truly bipartisan. It passed the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee 16 to 0. without medical savings\n\n[[Page S5989]]\n\naccounts. It passed the Senate 100 to 0, without medical savings \naccounts. It will pass the House of Representatives by a wide margin, \nif the House Republican leadership will permit it to be offered. But, \nso far, they continue to insist that if medical savings accounts for \nthe special interests are not added to the legislation, there will be \nno insurance reform for the American people.\n  Medical savings accounts sound good in theory. Why not encourage \nbusinesses and individuals to buy less costly high deductible health \ninsurance policies and put the premium savings into a tax-free account \nthat can be used to pay routine medical costs? But in this case, what \nsounds like good medicine in theory is quack medicine in practice.\n  Medical savings accounts are an idea whose time should never come. \nUnder estimates by the Joint Tax Committee, they are a $3 billion tax \nbreak for the wealthy and healthy.\n  As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said, ``MSA's create \nnew tax shelter opportunities. Use of an MSA would be highly \nadvantageous to substantial numbers of higher income taxpayers. Low- \nand moderate-income taxpayers would receive little or no tax benefits \nfrom using MSAs, because they either do not pay income taxes or pay \ntaxes at much lower rates.'' The American Academy of Actuaries \nconcluded that medical savings accounts are ``Taking money from the \nunhealthy and giving it to the healthy.'' The Joint Tax Committee \nestimated that only 1 percent of the tax benefits would go to people \nwith incomes of less than $30,000.\n  If more people enroll in these accounts than the estimates predict, \nthe cost could rise to tens of billions of dollars. The Joint Tax \nCommittee estimated that only about 1 million policies would be sold. \nBut other analysts have estimated that enrollment could be many times \nhigher. Those who are loudest in their clamor to reduce the deficit are \nwilling to waste vast sums on this destructive, special interest \nboondoggle. If we have billions of dollars to spend on health care, we \nshould spend them on reducing the cost of coverage for hard-working \nAmerican families or on deficit reduction--not on a perverse scheme to \ntransfer benefits from the poor and the sick to the healthy and the \nrich.\n  The most troubling aspect of medical savings accounts is the risk \nthat they will destroy the health insurance pool, and price \nconventional insurance out of the reach of most American families. \nMedical savings accounts raise premiums for the vast majority of \nAmericans--especially those who are sick and need coverage the most--by \nsiphoning the healthiest people out of the insurance pool. As premiums \nrise for everyone else, more and more working families will be forced \nto drop coverage. In the words of the Congressional Budget Office, \nmedical savings accounts ``could threaten the existence of standard \nhealth insurance.'' Mary Nell Lenhardt, senior vice president of Blue \nCross and Blue Shield concluded that MSA's destroy ``the whole \nprinciple of insurance.''\n  The Urban Institute found that, even under conservative assumptions \nabout how many people would use medical savings accounts, the premiums \nfor comprehensive policies could increase by 62 percent. If employers \nchose to contribute only the cost of the MSA, the worker's share of the \npremium for a comprehensive policy would rise by 300 percent.\n  American families who choose medical savings accounts could be \nexposed to financial crisis if someone in the family becomes seriously \nill. As the American Academy of Actuaries said, ``individuals and \nfamilies who experience significant medical expenses soon after the \nestablishment of MSA programs will face high out-of-pocket costs. These \nhigh out-of-pocket costs will not be randomly distributed. They will be \nconcentrated among older workers and their families and among those \nwith disabilities and chronic illness.'' The last thing that the \nAmerican people need--especially those who need health care the most--\nis another massive increase in the cost of medical care.\n  Because they encourage high deductible plans, medical savings \naccounts discourage preventive care. According to the Congressional \nResearch Service, the high deductible plans that come with MSA's mean \nthat poor children are 40 percent less likely to get the care they \nneed, compared to fully insured children. Abandoning preventative care \nis the wrong direction for health policy.\n  Medical savings accounts are also a giveaway to the insurance \ncompanies who have the worst record of profiting from the abuses of the \ncurrent system. It is no accident that a company like the Golden Rule \nInsurance Co. favors medical savings accounts. This company is ranked \nnear the bottom by Consumer Reports because of its inadequate coverage, \nfrequent rate increases, and readiness to cancel policies.\n  When the Golden Rule Insurance Co. withdrew from Vermont because it \nwas unwilling to compete on the level playing field created by the \nState's insurance reform, Blue Cross and Blue Shield took over the \npolicies. They found that one in four policies included controversial \nextensions. Sometimes, arms, backs, breasts, and even skin were written \nout of coverage. Newborns were excluded unless they were born healthy.\n  The Republican medical savings account plan includes no provisions to \nprevent abuses like these. Although MSA's are billed as providing \ncatastrophic protection, there are no prohibitions on unreasonable \nlife-time limits, or excessive copayments when the deductible level is \nreached. The $3,000 per family deductible level in the bill is a \nminimum--not a maximum. Companies can establish a much higher level--a \n$5,000 or $10,000 deductible for example.\n  The Golden Rule Insurance Co. has refused to share any data about its \nplans with the American Academy of Actuaries or other impartial \nanalysts. Golden Rule knows that medical savings accounts can't stand \nthe light of day.\n  Further, Republicans are also anxious to include MSA's in the \ninsurance reform bill, because MSA's are part of their longrun plan to \ndismantle Medicare and turn it over to private insurance companies. \nTactics like that have no place in a consensus insurance reform bill.\n  Proponents of MSA's make a number of claims about the merits of \nmedical savings accounts--but these claims can't stand the truth-in-\nadvertising test. One major false claim is the allegation that the \nsavings on the premium of a high deductible policy will pay for a \nmedical savings account covering the entire deductible.\n  The Urban Institute concluded that for an individual policy with a \ndeductible of $2,000, the savings to the employer that would be a \nmeager $251--leaving you exposed to $1,749 in medical costs if you \nbecame seriously ill.\n  The American Academy of Actuaries compared a family comprehensive \nplan to an MSA with a deductible of $3,000 and found that the family \nwould be exposed to $1,800 in costs before reaching the deductible \nlimit.\n  Nothing in the Republican plan requires the employer to give all of \nthe savings to the employee. Nothing requires the deductible to cap \nyour liability. The insurance company could continue to charge a 20-\npercent or even a 50-percent copayment. In fact, they would not be \nrequired to have any limit at all on your out-of-pocket payment.\n  Another claim of the proponents of medical savings accounts is that \nthey would reduce costs because people would shop around for the best \ncare, and wouldn't go to the doctor for trivial illnesses. Every family \nknows that when someone is sick, the last thing on their minds is going \nfrom doctor to doctor to see who will charge the least. No family wants \nto be in the position of trying to decide whether chest pains or any \nother symptoms are something that will pass, or something that needs \nmedical care immediately.\n  Proponents of MSA's try to justify this claim by relying on the Rand \nhealth insurance experiment of the 1970's. Joe White of the Brookings \nInstitution points out that, in fact, high deductibles had the effect \nof reducing necessary care just as much as unnecessary care. People who \nare sick are not responsible for the high cost of care--health care. \nProviders are.\n  Those who support medical savings accounts also say they increase \nportability by giving you money to spend on health care while you are \nbetween\n\n[[Page S5990]]\n\njobs. That assumes there will be something in your savings account when \nyou leave your job--and that won't be true for anyone with significant \nhealth problems. With hospital costs running $1,000 a day or more, no \none can afford the cost of care without insurance. The Kassebaum-\nKennedy bill is designed to guarantee access to coverage to people who \nleave their jobs--but it won't become law if medical savings accounts \nare attached to it.\n  Advocates also say that MSA's increase choice, but the American \npeople know better. The choice to pay thousands of dollars for health \ncare you need but cannot afford because of a high deductible is no \nchoice at all.\n  In addition, Republican proponents of medical savings accounts note \nthat some Democrats have changed their position since the last \nCongress. The fact is that MSA's have received much more analysis in \nrecent years, and the pitfalls are better understood. I voted against \nthem both times they were offered in the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee. In the past, President Clinton said that they are something \nwe might explore and experiment with but he has never supported their \nwidespread adoption. Democrats who supported them in the context of \ncomprehensive health reform understood that they would be an add-on to \ncomprehensive coverage with effective cost-control, not a substitute. \nIn fact, the sense of the Senate resolution approved by the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee on the Health Security Act in 1994 \nspecifically said that they were to be used ``in conjunction with the \ncomprehensive benefit package'' established by the bill.\n  Few respectable health policy analysts support medical savings \naccounts under today's conditions. Editorials in the Washington Post, \nthe New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and the Boston Globe have \ncondemned them.\n  Most important, the people who need good coverage are strongly \nopposed to this program. The major organizations representing \nconsumers, the elderly, the disabled, and working families have \nvehemently condemned them. Who is best capable of speaking for the \ninterests of American families and who need health care--these \norganizations, or the Golden Rule Insurance Company?\n  Most Republican leaders know that Americans want the consensus \nreforms in this bill and have little interest in medical savings \naccounts. That is why Representative Kasich said, on March 24, ``We \nwill not let medical savings accounts destroy the ability to give \npeople portability and eliminate pre-existing conditions.'' He made a \nsimilar statement yesterday.\n  On March 29, Speaker Gingrich said he would not let medical savings \naccounts stand in the way of a Presidential signature.\n  But actions speak louder than their words. The House Republican \nleadership has been unwilling to accept the fair compromise that the \nPresident and Democrats have offered on medical savings accounts. And \nnow Republican House Majority Leader Armey has made it clear that the \nRepublican strategy is to force the President to veto the legislation, \nand then try to blame him for the failure to enact the consensus \nreforms the American people need and deserve.\n  Whether the issue is tax fairness, preservation of comprehensive \nhealth insurance for the vast majority of Americans, or the special \ninterests versus the public interest, medical savings accounts are bad \nmedicine for our health care system. They are a poison pill that will \nkill health insurance reform. The President has offered a reasonable \ncompromise--but he cannot fulfill his obligation to protect the health \nand welfare of the American people by swallowing this Republican poison \npill.\n  Senator Dole understands the importance of insurance reform. Two \nyears ago, on August 17, 1994, he stated on the floor of the Senate, \n``We will be back. . . . And you can bet that health care will be near \nthe top of our agenda. . . We ought to take all the common parts of \nthese plans, put them together and pass that bill.'' A week later, he \nidentified the components of reform that he thought were most \nimportant. He said, ``My second suggestion is one that I have made for \nalmost a year and a half. That we pass into law provisions to help \nthose Americans who cannot afford insurance, who cannot get insurance \nbecause of pre-existing conditions, or who cannot keep insurance due to \na job change.''\n  Medical savings accounts were not on Senator Dole's list then, and \nthey should not be on his list now.\n  Senator Dole is planning to leave the Senate tomorrow. But he can do \nthe American people an immense service if he will put off his departure \nfor a few days and help pass this bill. He knows how important this \nbill is. He knows that his participation is essential if House \nRepublicans are to be persuaded to accept a reasonable compromise. I \nhope he will act now to end this shameful gridlock and give the \nAmerican people the health reforms they deserve.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/10/senate-section/article/S5988-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5990-S5997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me revise my original topic. Because \nthe distinguished majority leader is leaving, I want to talk in that \ncontext.\n  When Senator Dole first came to the U.S. Senate, I had recommended \nClement Haynesworth for the U.S. Supreme Court. My distinguished senior \ncolleague had recommended another individual for that post, and I was \nlooking to the Republican side for leadership in support of the \nHaynesworth nomination. The then distinguished junior Senator from \nKansas, who had recently arrived in the Senate, was very, very helpful \nto this Senator from South Carolina.\n  Let me get right to the point, Mr. President. I have the greatest \nrespect for Senator Dole. The fact is that when we had the recent \nRepublican primary in my State of South Carolina, I was asked to give \nmy thoughts regarding who I thought was the best candidate in the \nRepublican field. I categorically replied that of those vying for the \nRepublican nomination, the distinguished Senator from Kansas, Senator \nDole, could handle the job, and there is no doubt in my mind that he \ncould.\n  I think his difficulties arise from the crowd he has to carry with \nhim, which gets right to the point of this so-called balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution.\n  On last week, the distinguished majority leader said:\n\n       We tried to reach out to those Senators to ensure Social \n     Security surpluses can never again be used to mask deficit \n     spending. I believe that after a suitable phase-in, the \n     Federal budget could be balanced without counting the \n     surpluses in the Social Security trust funds.\n\n  Mr. President, that is a remarkable statement, in light of the \nhistory of Social Security and the Social Security trust fund.\n  Specifically, in 1983, the distinguished majority leader served on \nthe Greenspan Commission which was charged with rescuing Social \nSecurity. The Greenspan Commission recommended that after a certain \nperiod of time--which later that year was agreed to be 1992--Social \nSecurity should be off budget. We now talk in the context of \nPresidential campaigns and children and grandchildren. But the same was \ntrue some 13 years ago, when the majority leader, himself a member of \nthe Greenspan Commission, issued its report and said, ``Let's put \nSocial Security off budget.''\n  Thereafter in 1990, I offered a resolution before the Senate Budget \nCommittee that removed Social Security outlays and receipts from \ndeficit calculations. By a vote of 20 to 1, the Budget Committee \nadopted my amendment.\n  When it reached the floor, I teamed up with the former distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Senator John Heinz, and on October 18, 1990, \nsaw the full Senate adopt our amendment by a vote of 98 to 2. We said, \nSocial Security should not be used to obscure the size of the deficit, \nthat it should be off budget and that it should never be included in \nany reporting of the deficit whether by the President or by Congress.\n  The distinguished Senator from Kansas voted for that amendment. And \non November 5, 1990, President George Herbert Walker Bush signed it \ninto law. Today it stands as section 13301 of the Congressional Budget \nAct. So much\n\n[[Page S5991]]\n\nof the confusion over the budget is brought about by the failure of \npoliticians to respect this law. This is true even though the \ncontinuing validity of the law has since been reconfirmed several \ntimes, by Senator Dole and Senator Hollings and others.\n  So I say when the distinguished majority leader says, ``We tried to \nreach out to those Senators to ensure that the Social Security surplus \ncan never again be used to mask deficit spending''--that is already the \nlaw. It is required. They act like the constitutional amendment would \ngive us something new. The truth is, Mr. President, that the \nconstitutional amendment trumps and repeals the existing law. That is \nwhy we did not get the votes for the balanced budget amendment.\n  Here is House Joint Reslution 1. The language in section 7 clearly \nincludes Social Security trust funds in deficit calculations. It \nstates, ``Total receipts shall include all receipts of the United \nStates Government except those derived from borrowing.''\n  But the Government not only borrows from the public markets but also \nfrom the Social Security trust fund. As a result, at least five \nSenators have said, ``You have got our votes if you spell out the \nexclusion of Social Security trust funds from deficit calculations.'' \nIf we had included such language, we could have easily passed the \namendment.\n  But the majority leader paints a different picture. That somehow or \nother we need a constitutional amendment that repeals the protection \nthat we already have in the law. That is where I differ with the \ndistinguished leader. He knows and I know that there are three stages \nof denial with respect to the Social Security trust fund, as my \ndistinguished friend, Senator Dorgan, has pointed out. First, the \nstatement is made that there is no Social Security trust fund; second, \nthat there is one, but we are not spending it; and, third, there is \none, we are spending it, but we will stop in the future.\n  Therein is the source of the intentional confusion that is being \nperpetrated on the American public. They know it, and I know it. That \nis why I wanted to come and correct the record, particularly with \nrespect to the statements made by the chairman of the Budget Committee, \nSenator Domenici, and recent statements made in the press.\n  Let me just allude to ``Clinton's Budget Game,'' by David S. Broder \nin the Washington Post, dated Sunday, June 9, 1996.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this particular editorial \nbe printed in the Record in full.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 9, 1996]\n\n                         Clinton's Budget Game\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       A recent exchange between Sen. Christopher (Kit) Bond (R-\n     Mo.) and Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown casts a \n     clear light on the reality behind the partisan rhetoric of \n     the past week's budget debate.\n       Bond is chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that \n     handles the VA budget. He was grilling Brown on President \n     Clinton's budget proposal for veterans' health care and \n     hospitalization. For next year, Bond noted, Clinton is urging \n     a level of spending for this politically important \n     constituency more than $1 billion higher than it was in 1995. \n     But in the following two years--after the election--Clinton's \n     budget would cut that spending from $17 billion down to $14 \n     billion, and then slice it further.\n       How can you meet your obligations to veterans under that \n     budget? Bond asked. ``Sen. bond, we cannot,'' Brown replied. \n     If funding were to remain flat (as Republicans have \n     proposed), ``it would force us to deny care to about a \n     million veterans and it would force us to close the \n     equivalent of 41 hospitals. So obviously . . . we will not be \n     able to live with the red line'' showing the postelection \n     cuts suggested by Clinton.\n       And then Brown made this eyebrow-raising statement: ``The \n     president understands that. I talked with him personally \n     about it and . . . he gave me his personal commitment that he \n     was going to make sure that the nation honors its commitments \n     to veterans and that he will negotiate the budget each and \n     every year . . . with the veterans of the nation.''\n       Bond: ``So you are saying that these out-years mean \n     nothing. It is all going to be negotiated in the future, so \n     we should not worry about the president's budget plan. . . . \n     You are not planning to live with that budget?''\n       Brown: ``I am not planning to live with it. I am not \n     planning to live with your budget . . . nor am I planning to \n     live with the president's line.''\n       Bond: ``You do not work for us. You work for the president. \n     You are saying that you do not like our budget, but you know \n     that his budget does not mean anything.''\n       After this remarkable exchange, Bond made similar inquiries \n     of the director of another huge agency, Dan Goldin of NASA. \n     He too said that White House budget officials had told him to \n     make no plans based on the sharp cuts indicated for future \n     years in Clinton's budget. As Goldin put it, ``the White \n     House has instructed us to take no precipitous action on out-\n     year budgets, and we are taking them at their word.''\n       To Bond and other Republicans, this looks suspiciously like \n     a shell game. The president has told Congress and the country \n     that he can achieve a balanced budget by 2002, without the \n     serious savings in Medicare and Medicaid that Republicans \n     have proposed. At the same time, he has said that he can keep \n     spending in five or six priority areas at least even with \n     inflation.\n       He can do all that, he has said, by cutting ``less \n     important'' spending. Veterans and space budgets are not on \n     his priority list. But the men running these programs say \n     they have assurances that the numbers the White House has \n     given Congress are just paper figures--not mandates to \n     prepare for belt-tightening.\n       White House Budget Director Alice Rivlin has assured Bond \n     and his colleagues--and then tried to convince me--that there \n     is no contradiction. ``Simply put,'' Rivlin wrote Bond, ``the \n     president is committed to the discretionary savings needed to \n     help reach balance in 2002 . . . but will continue to revisit \n     decisions about specific programs one year at a time.''\n       ``Nobody is cheating,'' Rivlin insisted in an interview \n     with me.\n       ``I don't think it washes,'' Bond said. ``It's not an \n     honest budget.''\n       Two things are going on here. Clinton, in his desire to \n     dodge serious cuts in politically popular programs such as \n     Medicare and Medicaid, while promising more spending for \n     education, the environment and law enforcement, is projecting \n     cuts in other programs that are so severe they will be very \n     hard to achieve. That is why people like Brown and Goldin say \n     the cuts are unimaginable.\n       And second, in order to postpone the pain, Clinton is \n     telling not just the constituents of the endangered programs \n     but their managers that they will have plenty of \n     opportunities in future years to stave off the cuts.\n       That may not be ``cheating,'' as Rivlin says, but it is \n     playing a game that is too clever by half. Balancing the \n     budget means making tough choices. Clinton is postponing \n     those choices and--by giving people the sense that the goal \n     can be reached without giving up anything that is important--\n     making it that much harder when the crunch comes.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The most objective, most analytical journalist and \neditorialist that we have writing talks about a budget game. He argues \nthat the ``President's budget is suspiciously like a shell game,'' \nquoting the distinguished Senator from Missouri, Senator Bond as \nsaying, ``It is not an honest budget.''\n  Then let me quote Mr. Broder's words further down.\n\n       That may not be cheating, as Rivlin says, but it's playing \n     a game that is too clever by half. Balancing the budget means \n     making tough choices. Clinton is postponing those choices, \n     and by giving the people the sense that the goal can be \n     reached without giving up anything that's important.\n\n  Heavens above. Have we just discovered these budget games? Is the \nClinton budget the only one deserving of blame? Just look at the \nRepublican budget. Look at the Bush budgets. Look at the Reagan \nbudgets. Look at the Carter, Ford, and Nixon budgets. We have not had \nanything but a shell game since Senator Lyndon Baines Johnson balanced \nthe budget back in 1968-1969.\n  The press--Mr. Broder and others--continually refer to the Republican \nbudget as balanced, but the facts say otherwise. I have in my hand the \ndocument itself, the fiscal year 1996 budget resolution conference \nreport. That is what Mr. Dole says is balanced. ``Last year we passed \nthe first balanced Federal budget in a generation.'' Absolutely false. \nAnd they know it.\n  On page 3 of their own conference report, it shows in black and white \nthat the expected deficit in the year 2002 is $108,400,000,000. And \nover on page 4, the debt increases in the year 2002--the year of \nsupposed balance--by $185,100,000,000.\n  How can they talk about a balanced budget when on the face of the \ndocument itself it shows a $108 billion deficit? The distinguished \nmajority leader has to know better when he says, ``Last year we passed \nthe first balanced Federal budget in a generation.'' It is absolutely \nfalse.\n  Let me take one other particular statement, because the distinguished \nleader is, of course, the Republican candidate for President. We are so\n\n[[Page S5992]]\n\nquick to accuse the other of not leading. In fact, Senator Dole says \nthat the balanced budget amendment demonstrates that the President \nlacks leadership. I quote again:\n\n       President Clinton's opposition continues to be the single \n     largest obstacle standing in the way of a balanced budget \n     amendment to the Constitution.\n\n  I have not heard anything from President Clinton or the White House \nconcerning the balanced budget amendment. But then again I happen to \nknow that the single greatest obstacle to a balanced budget amendment \nis the intransigence of the Republican leadership with respect to not \nprotecting the Social Security trust fund.\n  Because my time is limited, let me say a word about deficits and \nrefer immediately to another article.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe article in full, the ``Ace in the Hole'' by John Cassidy in the \nrecent New Yorker magazine dated June 10, 1996.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the New Yorker, June 10, 1996]\n\n                            Ace in the Hole\n\n                           (By John Cassidy)\n\n       It was James Carville, Bill Clinton's fast-talking \n     political consultant, who in 1992 put up a now famous \n     handwritten sign at the Little Rock campaign headquarters \n     saying, ``The Economy, Stupid.'' Actually, as Carville \n     reminded me recently, the sign also contained two other \n     statements--``Change vs. more of the same'' and ``Don't \n     forget health care''--but it was the first one that captured \n     the moment. Indeed, were it not for the economic malaise that \n     gripped the country in late 1991 and early 1992 we might now \n     be discussing a Quayle-Gore Presidential race.\n       This time around, the economy looks different, which is \n     excellent news for the White House, although it tends to be \n     overshadowed by more dramatic stories, such as the recent \n     Whitewater convictions. A glance at history confirms the \n     point. Of the sixteen occasions over the past century in \n     which sitting Presidents have run for another term, just five \n     incumbents lost: Taft, Hoover, Ford, Carter, and Bush. The \n     elections of 1912 and 1976 must be seen as anomalies--thanks \n     to Teddy Roosevelt's Bull Moose campaign and Richard Nixon's \n     Watergate coverup, the incumbent Republican Party self-\n     destructed in those years--which leaves 1932, 1980, and 1992, \n     all years of financial gloom. In 1932 and 1980, the economy \n     was actually in a slump, and in 1992 it was just emerging \n     from a recession the previous year.\n       Despite some suggestions to the contrary--notably by the \n     Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank--this year \n     cannot be compared with 1992, let alone 1980 or 1932. In the \n     first quarter of 1996, inflation-adjusted growth in national \n     output, which is the broadest index of economic performance, \n     was 2.3 per cent on an annualized basis; over the full \n     course of the Clinton Administration, such growth has \n     averaged around 2.5 percent a year. This record is about \n     average for the post-1973 era but well above the growth \n     rate of 1.6 per cent eked out during the Bush Presidency. \n     A number of other measures also suggest that the economy \n     is doing significantly better than it was four years ago: \n     two of the most widely followed are the ``misery index,'' \n     which is the rate of inflation added to the rate of \n     unemployment, and the size of the federal budget deficit.\n       At the moment, the unemployment rate is 5.4 per cent, and \n     the inflation rate is 2.9 per cent. Added together, these \n     numbers produce a misery index of 8.3, which is an extremely \n     low number. The last year it was lower was 1968, when the \n     unemployment rate was 3.6 per cent and the inflation rate \n     averaged 4.2 per cent. For much of the nineteen-seventies and \n     eighties, the misery index was well into double digits. As \n     recently as 1992, it stood at 10.4.\n       Perhaps the most important, and least heralded, achievement \n     of the Clinton Administration is the improvement it has \n     wrought in the national finances. According to the \n     Congressional Budget Office, the federal budget deficit for \n     the 1996 fiscal year, which began last October, will be about \n     $145 billion. This is a large number, but it is only half the \n     size of the deficit that the federal government recorded in \n     1992, which was $290 billion. And these raw numbers don't \n     tell the full story. In ranking budget deficits, economists \n     usually look at them in relation to the size of the economy. \n     Measured in this way, the federal deficit this year will be \n     about 1.9 per cent of the gross domestic product, according \n     to the C.B.O. This figure is down from 4.9 per cent in 1992; \n     indeed, it is the lowest such figure recorded since 1979, the \n     year before Ronald Reagan was elected, when the budget \n     deficit was just 1.7 per cent of G.D.P.\n       Statistics like these are what prompted President Clinton \n     to make the recent claim, which had all the earmarks of \n     election-year hyperbole, that the United States economy is \n     ``the healthiest it's been in three decades.'' Surprisingly, \n     the President is not the only one making such apparently \n     outlandish statements. In March, DRI/McGraw-Hill, a leading \n     firm of economic consultants, issued a report saying that \n     ``normal economic indicators'' suggest that the economy ``is \n     in its best shape in decades.'' When I asked David Wyss, the \n     Harvard-trained economist who is the research director of \n     DRI/McGraw-Hill, how he came to make that statement, he \n     explained, ``If you look at the economy during the Clinton \n     Administration, you have to say that it's been a success. We \n     have low inflation, full employment, and steady growth. This \n     is really just about the best of all macroeconomic worlds.''\n       To understand how the present economic situation came \n     about, we must go back to a winter morning in Little Rock \n     thirteen days before the Inauguration. On that day, January \n     7, 1993, the President-elect's entire economic and political \n     team gathered in the Arkansas Governor's Mansion. Leon \n     Panetta, the prospective White House budget director, \n     presented the Bush Administration's final forecast, which \n     had just been released in Washington. It predicted a \n     budget deficit of $305 billion for 1997, an increase of \n     $70 billion over previous estimates. Panetta believed the \n     actual figure could be as high as $360 billion.\n       By the end of that January day, after six hours of \n     discussions, the nascent Administration had agreed on a \n     course of action that would define the forty-second \n     Presidency. Clinton had been elected on a potentially \n     contradictory platform of tax cuts for the middle class, \n     faster economic growth, and budget-deficit reduction; in \n     Little Rock he decided to sacrifice the first promise and \n     prejudice the second in order to achieve the third.\n       The result of this decision, following eight months of \n     intense political struggle, was the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1993, which pledged to reduce the \n     budget deficit by a total of about $500 billion over four \n     years. This would be achieved through a program of about $250 \n     billion in spending cuts and about $250 billion in tax \n     increases.\n       Given the centrality of the 1993 budget act to the Clinton \n     Administration's record, it is surprising how little \n     attention has been paid to its results. Even some people in \n     the White House are reluctant to discuss the subject, for \n     fear of reminding voters of the 1993 tax increases. This is \n     odd, because the story that has not been told is that the \n     deficit-reduction policy turned out to be far more successful \n     than even its authors had dared hope--a point made to me by \n     Alan Blinder, a Princeton economics professor and a former \n     vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who was a White \n     House economic adviser during 1993 and 1994. ``The real story \n     is that a calculated risk was taken, and in this case it \n     turned out far better than anybody had any reason to \n     expect,'' Blinder said. ``There are plenty of gambles in life \n     that don't turn out well. This is one that turned out \n     extremely well.''\n       It is easy to forget how controversial the deficit-\n     reduction policy was in 1993, even within the White House. \n     Two books about the first year of the Clinton \n     Administration--Bob Woodward's ``The Agenda'' and Elizabeth \n     Drew's ``On the Edge''--portrayed a government driven by \n     internal dissension. At various points during that year, \n     Hillary Clinton, George Stephanopoulos, Paul Begala, Stan \n     Greenberg, and Mandy Grunwald all expressed serious doubts \n     about the deficit-reduction strategy. Begala, in particular, \n     complained repeatedly that the White House was ``obsessed'' \n     with the budget. Even the President himself had mixed \n     feelings. According to Drew, he considered deficit reduction \n     a ``rich man's issue,'' and Woodward says he several times \n     referred to his own budget plan as ``a turkey.''\n       The Woodward and Drew books were solid works of reporting, \n     but both essentially stopped at the end of 1993, when the \n     budget act had become law. In terms of how the deficit-\n     reduction policy actually affected the economy, the story \n     only begins then.\n       The biggest danger back in early 1993 had been that the \n     budget package would tip the economy into another recession. \n     As anyone who suffered through Econ 101 will recall, raising \n     taxes and reducing government spending both tend to reduce \n     the over-all level of demand for goods and services in the \n     economy. President Clinton is a lawyer, not an economist, but \n     he knew enough about the dismal science to see a potential \n     fiasco in the making. ``You have to remember that the economy \n     was perceived to be very fragile back then,'' Gene Sperling, \n     a senior White House economic adviser, recalls. ``There was \n     lots of talk about the possibility of a double-dip recession. \n     The President's initial reaction was: If I call for a major \n     fiscal contraction, won't there be a recession?''\n       At the same time, Republican leaders in Congress were \n     warning of imminent disaster. ``I believe this will lead to a \n     recession next year,'' Newt Gingrich declared following the \n     House vote on the budget package, which ended in a nerve-\n     racking 218-216 victory for the President. ``This is the \n     Democrat machine's recession, and each one of them will be \n     held personally accountable.''\n       Even some of the President's economic advisers were worried \n     about the possible impact of the planned spending cuts and \n     tax increases. The economic models they relied on suggested \n     that another slump was unlikely, but the models could not \n     rule out a ``growth recession'' of the sort that so damaged \n     the Bush Administration. Despite their private fears that \n     history might repeat itself, the economic advisers argued \n     that deficit reduction was the right thing to do--on both \n     theoretical and practical grounds.\n       The theoretical argument was one that mainstream economists \n     had been making ever since 1981, when Ronald Reagan's tax\n\n[[Page S5993]]\n\n     cuts put the economy on the path to fiscal chaos: budget \n     deficits lead to higher interest rates and lower business \n     investment, and lower investment, in turn, restricts \n     productivity growth and technical progress, which are the \n     keys to future prosperity. Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the Berkeley \n     professor who headed the White House Council of Economic \n     Advisers, repeated this argument to Clinton but coupled it \n     with a more immediate argument: budget deficits not only do \n     long-term damage but can lead to disastrous financial panics \n     in the short or medium term, and these panics, which have \n     stricken many developing countries, occur when investors lose \n     faith in the political system.\n       From the perspective of mid-1996, it may sound unrealistic \n     to suggest that the United States Treasury could ever \n     experience such a crisis of confidence, but back in 1992 \n     perceptions were different. In the twelve years since \n     Reagan's election, the amount of outstanding federal debt had \n     risen, from $909 billion to more than $4 trillion. Even \n     allowing for growth in the economy, that rise was dramatic. \n     The total federal debt as a percentage of G.D.P. had risen \n     between 1980 and 1992 from 34.4 per cent to 67.6 per cent, \n     and it seemed to be on an inexorable upward trend. ``We all \n     attached some not insignificant probability to a scenario \n     of financial-market instability if we didn't take a \n     credible position on the deficit,'' Tyson told me. ``Given \n     the growth of total debt relative to output, there really \n     was a danger that at some point--nobody could know when--\n     the United States could hit a confidence problem.''\n       Bill Clinton didn't need much convincing that budget \n     deficits were bad, but he did need a good deal of reassurance \n     that doing something about them wouldn't wreck his chances of \n     reelection. In making a practical case for deficit reduction, \n     his advisers relied primarily on one of the institutions that \n     the Democratic candidate had railed against in his populist \n     attack on the Reagan-Bush years; the Wall Street bond market.\n       Their argument was that deficit reduction needn't \n     necessarily be a drag on the economy, as Econ 101 models \n     suggest, because these simple models ignore the effect a \n     credible fiscal plan can have on the bond market. If bond \n     traders could be persuaded that the planned budget cuts were \n     real, they would bid down long-term interest rates, and the \n     decline in rates would provide a boost to the economy which \n     would at least partly offset the proposed higher taxes and \n     lower government spending. The key thing to understand, as \n     the experts explained to the President-elect, was that the \n     long-term interest rate is determined not by the government \n     but by the bond market; in fact, it is basically equal to the \n     nominal coupon on a thirty-year bond divided by the bond's \n     market price, so anything that raises bond prices also \n     reduces long-term interest rates. There was a sequel to the \n     story. If, in addition to the favorable bond-market reaction, \n     the Federal Reserve's response to the budget package was to \n     cut short-term interest rates, which are under its control, \n     then deficit reduction might not slow the economy at all.\n       When this scenario was laid out for the President-elect in \n     Little Rock, it did not go down well, as Woodward recorded: \n     ``At the President-elect's end of the table, Clinton's face \n     turned red with anger and disbelief. `You mean to tell me \n     that the success of the program and my reelection hinges on \n     the Federal Reserve and a bunch of ------ bond traders?' he \n     responded in a half whisper. Nods from his end of the table. \n     Not a dissent.''\n       Clinton's advisers were well aware that relying on the bond \n     market was a high-risk strategy: traders might ignore the \n     budget package, or dismiss it as another Washington gimmick. \n     ``We all believed in the direction of the argument, but even \n     the models themselves were uncertain about the size of the \n     effects and how fast they would occur,'' Tyson recalls. \n     ``There was a range of estimates.''\n       In order to provide an alternative short-term stimulus to \n     the economy, the White House proposed an immediate $16 \n     billion program of public investments. ``People called it \n     old-fashioned Democratic spending, but it was really done as \n     an insurance policy,'' Sperling explains. Congress killed \n     the stimulus package, however, leaving the advisers in the \n     White House even more beholden to Wall Street, a place few \n     of them knew well.\n       The one senior official who knew a lot about bond markets \n     was Robert Rubin, the head of the newly created National \n     Economic Council, for he had only recently left Goldman, \n     Sachs, the highly profitable investment-banking and \n     securities firm, after twenty-six years. Rubin, who later \n     succeeded Lloyd Bentsen as Treasury Secretary, was a \n     passionate believer in deficit reduction; indeed, he saw it \n     as a ``threshold issue,'' which had to be dealt with before \n     anything else positive could happen to the Administration. \n     But even he was far from certain how his former colleagues \n     would react to the budget package. ``We'd seen a long period \n     during which the political process had not dealt with the \n     deficit,'' Rubin explained to me recently. ``Given the very \n     high level of skepticism in the markets about the willingness \n     of the system to make tough decisions, it was unclear how \n     long it would take before the market gave us credit for \n     deficit reduction. There was at least the possibility that \n     the skepticism would last much longer than we projected, in \n     which case it could have upended our program.''\n       In the event, the bond market's reaction to the Clinton \n     fiscal plan was remarkably positive. In the twelve months \n     following Clinton's election, long-term interest rates \n     tumbled from 7.75 per cent to a low of 5.78 per cent--the \n     lowest level since the Treasury started selling thirty-year \n     constant-maturity bonds, in 1977. After spiking up sharply in \n     1994, as the Fed raised short-term rates, long-term rates \n     fell back down, and they have stayed low ever since. At the \n     moment, they are still under seven per cent, which is \n     remarkable for an economy that is in its fifth year of \n     recovery, with unemployment at 5.4 per cent.\n       It is one of the richest ironies of recent years that the \n     much maligned bond traders, acting entirely in their own \n     interest, bailed out a Democratic Administration that was \n     fighting to raise their marginal tax rates sharply. In the \n     White House, officials watched the action on Wall Street with \n     surprise and delight. ``The markets gave credibility to this \n     program more rapidly than folks had expected--and, frankly, \n     more rapidly than I had expected,'' Rubin says. Even Blinder, \n     who had presented the bond market argument to the President-\n     elect in Little Rock, was stunned. ``I never thought we'd get \n     the bond rate down to 5.8 per cent,'' he now admits. ``I \n     don't think any of us thought it would get that low. If you'd \n     polled economists back then and said we're going to drive the \n     long-term interest rate below six per cent, I don't think one \n     in a thousand would have believed you.''\n       With interest rates so low, the economy grew at a rate that \n     made a mockery of the Republicans' dire predictions. In 1994, \n     the first year the deficit package started to bite, the \n     economy expanded by a healthy 3.5 per cent. In 1995, growth \n     fell back to two per cent, but current indications are that \n     it will be back around 2.5 per cent this year.\n       The easiest way to trace the impact of the falling interest \n     rates is to look at the path of investment, the type of \n     spending most responsive to the cost of credit. Business \n     investment has grown by eleven per cent a year since 1993, \n     which, as Tyson points out, is the highest rate of growth \n     since the Kennedy Administration. As a percentage of G.D.P., \n     investment rose from 12.7 per cent in 1992 to 14.8 per cent \n     in 1994. Much of this extra capital spending has gone into \n     high technology, and especially into computers and \n     telecommunications equipment--areas in which American \n     companies now lead the world. Whether this upturn in \n     investment will lead to a higher rate of productivity growth \n     throughout the economy is unclear--the results so far are \n     somewhat disappointing--but it is precisely what economists \n     of all political hues have been recommending for more than a \n     decade. ``I remember saying very clearly in the first year \n     that what this is all about is shifting resources toward \n     interest sensitive private spending,'' Tyson says. ``That is \n     exactly what has happened.''\n       Bob Dole's difficulties in constructing an effective \n     critique of Clinton's economic policies are obvious. (After \n     building a considerable reputation for fiscal rectitude in \n     the Senate, he is now said to be mulling throwing it away by \n     proposing an across-the-board reduction in income-tax-rates.) \n     As a matter of logic, the Republicans have only two \n     alternatives: to say that things are not as good as they seem \n     or to say that things are as good as they seem but Clinton \n     has nothing do with it. Earlier this year, Dole seemed to be \n     veering toward the first approach. Speaking in New Hampshire \n     on February 13th, he said, ``Corporate profits are setting \n     records, but so are corporate layoffs. And middle-class \n     families feel less and less secure about the future. There is \n     a wide and growing gap between what the government's \n     statistics say about our economy and how American families \n     feel about it.''\n       It struck me that these words could have been spoken by \n     Carville, by his colleague Begala, or by Labor Secretary \n     Robert Reich. All of them have put a similar argument to me \n     in recent months, and there is clearly some truth in it. Wage \n     for middle-income households have been stagnant since the \n     mid-nineteen-seventies, and the over-all inequality of income \n     and wealth has risen sharply. These long-term problems have \n     not been solved by the Clinton Administration, and they will \n     continue to plague the country long after November's \n     election. The sad fact is that they are so deeply rooted in \n     the way capitalism is evolving that no Presidential \n     candidate--and certainly not a Republican believer in \n     laissez-faire--is in any position to offer a credible remedy \n     in just four years.\n       Thus, it was always going to be problematical for Dole to \n     pursue a Reichian line for long. Predictably, once a Pat \n     Buchanan was safely in his rearview mirror he eased up on the \n     populist pedal. There may be sound political as well as \n     personal reasons for his switch of tactics. Although the \n     country does face serious problems, there is evidence that \n     most Americans are more upbeat about the economy than \n     Buchanan believes they are. This spring, Frank Newport and \n     Lydia Saad, two top editors of the Gallup poll, published \n     a little-noticed article in The Public Perspective \n     addressing the widespread belief that the electorate is \n     still in a funk about the economy. Their conclusion: \n     ``When compared to four years ago, Americans' current take \n     on the economy and their personal finances is noticeably \n     bright and certainly suggests that . . . incumbent Bill \n     Clinton is in a much better position vis-a-vis reelection \n     than was George Bush four years ago.''\n       At least three of Gallup's findings are worth mentioning. \n     In January of this year, just fourteen per cent of those \n     polled--down from forty-two per cent in 1992--identified\n\n[[Page S5994]]\n\n     the economy as the most pressing problem facing the country. \n     In March, when Gallup asked people to describe business \n     conditions in their own community, seventy-one per cent said \n     local conditions were ``good'' or ``very good''--a number as \n     high as any recorded since 1961. In the same poll, fifty per \n     cent said they were financially better off than a year \n     previously--up from twenty-nine per cent in June of 1993. In \n     interpreting this finding, Newport and Saad wrote, \n     ``Americans are as likely to claim that they are `better off \n     financially' than they have been at any point at which the \n     comparable questions have been asked since 1976.''\n       If doom and gloom won't work against Clinton, what will? \n     One person who might have the answer is Martin Feldstein, a \n     Harvard professor of economics who was the chairman of the \n     Council of Economic Advisers under Ronald Reagan. Feldstein, \n     who is acting as an informal adviser to Dole, recommends the \n     second option open to the Republican candidate: admit that \n     the economy is doing well but tell the voters that Bill \n     Clinton has nothing to do with it. Shortened to two words, \n     Feldstein's argument could be expressed like this: Alan \n     Greenspan.\n       ``I think that the good performance of the economy can be \n     attributed primarily to the Federal Reserve,'' Feldstein told \n     me recently from his home, in Belmont, Massachusetts. \n     ``Having set the goal of low inflation back in the early \n     nineteen-eighties, they have really stuck to it. That is the \n     principal reason interest rates have come down, and why we \n     have had this long recovery. If you put Saddam Hussein aside, \n     we've been in recovery since 1982. That's where I put the \n     credit, rather than in the tax bill of 1993.''\n       According to Feldstein, whose ideas are likely to figure \n     prominently in Dole's campaign, the lower interest rates \n     induced by Greenspan's policies can also explain most of the \n     budget-deficit reduction that has taken place in the past \n     three years. ``If you take the reduction from $290 billion to \n     $145 billion this year, Bill Clinton can indeed say he cut \n     the deficit in half as promised,'' Feldstein said. ``But \n     you can actually explain most of that by the recent \n     decline in unemployment and the rise in economic activity. \n     Only about forty billion of the deficit reduction has been \n     structural.''\n       To support his case, Feldstein and a colleague recently \n     published a research paper arguing that the 1993 tax increase \n     on high-income earners raised less than half as much revenue \n     as the Treasury Department had predicted. The paper covered \n     only the 1993 fiscal year, and the Treasury responded by \n     arguing that the tax shortfall was only temporary, but \n     Feldstein says he is confident that when the data become \n     available the same result will hold up for later years. ``In \n     my experience with tax changes, people who don't want to \n     believe the results always say they are temporary,'' he said.\n       Feldstein's arguments are open to question, particularly \n     his explanation for the sharp fall in interest rates. It is \n     true that the Fed has been pursuing a counter-inflation \n     policy since the early years of Paul Volcker's reign as \n     chairman (1979-87), but long-term interest rates did not dip \n     below seven per cent until early 1993, when the Clinton \n     deficit-reduction package appeared likely to become a \n     reality. At that point, Greenspan had not altered short-term \n     interest rates in almost two years.\n       Alan Blinder, the former Clinton adviser, points out that \n     when the President's deficit-reduction program was being \n     discussed, long-term interest rates fell by two percentage \n     points even as the Fed was holding steady. ``Furthermore,'' \n     he adds, ``you could see that the cadence of the fall had to \n     do with the budget package. In the late spring and early \n     summer, when the budget looked shaky, interest rates stopped \n     falling. Then the budget passed in August and interest rates \n     plummeted.''\n       Officials in the White House were well aware of how closely \n     their actions were being monitored in the bond market. On one \n     occasion, Lloyd Bentsen suggested on ``Meet the Press'' that \n     the deficit-reduction package might include an energy tax, as \n     it eventually did. The very next day, bond prices soared, and \n     interest rates dropped to a six-year low. Bensten was so \n     impressed by the market reaction that he clipped a report \n     from the Wall Street Journal and read it aloud at a meeting \n     of the National Economic Council, in the Roosevelt Room.\n       Feldstein's dismissal of the budget deficit as not being \n     ``structural'' is also questionable. When professional \n     economists speak of ``structural budget deficits,'' they are \n     not referring to the deficit number that dominates public \n     discussion. The publicly discussed deficit number goes up \n     during economic downturns, when tax payments fall, and down \n     in boom times, when tax payments rise. Structural deficits, \n     by contrast, are calculated by stripping out these cyclical \n     effects, so that the underlying relationship between taxes \n     and spending can be seen regardless of where the economy is \n     positioned in the economic cycle. According to Feldstein, the \n     structural deficit has dropped by at most $40 billion \n     since 1992, and most of the $145 billion fall in the over-\n     all deficit is due to the economic upturn.\n       An independent arbiter, the Congressional Budget Office, \n     which regularly estimates the structural deficit, found \n     otherwise. According to the C.B.O.'s latest calculations, \n     published last month, the structural deficit fell from $224 \n     billion in 1992 to $154 billion in 1996. These numbers imply \n     that $70 billion--or slightly less than half--of the total \n     fall in the budget deficit since 1992 was caused by the 1993 \n     deficit-reduction package, and slightly more than half was \n     due to the economic recovery.\n       While the $70 billion estimate is much larger than \n     Feldstein's $40 billion figure, it may actually understate \n     the real impact of the Clinton package--a point I was \n     reminded of the independent economic forecaster David Wyss. \n     According to his calculations, if the 1993 deficit-reduction \n     bill had not been passed the structural deficit would have \n     grown and would now be about $100 billion higher than it \n     actually is.\n       Wyss also made another point that is often overlooked in \n     the current debate about the budget deficit. ``We complain \n     about it, and we should complain about it, but the fact is we \n     now have the lowest budget deficit relative to G.D.P. of any \n     of the major industrial nations,'' he said. When I looked up \n     the official figures in the semiannual O.E.C.D. Economic \n     Outlook, published by the Paris-based Organization for \n     Economic Cooperation and Development, I found that Wyss was \n     correct. According to the O.E.C.D. projections, the United \n     States structural deficit in 1996 will be about 1.7 per cent \n     of G.D.P. The estimated deficits for Japan, Germany, and the \n     United Kingdom are 2.7 per cent, 2.4 per cent, and 2.5 per \n     cent, respectively. The biggest developed economy I could \n     find with a lower structural deficit than that of the United \n     States was that of Australia.\n       There is yet another important statistic that is rarely \n     mentioned in the public debate. For the past two years, the \n     United States Treasury has been collecting more money in \n     revenue than Congress has been spending, not counting \n     interest payments on the national debt. Economists refer to \n     this situation as the government running a ``primary \n     surplus.'' What it means is that if we didn't have to service \n     the vast debts run up during the past fifteen years the \n     budget would now be balanced.\n       Both Alan Greenspan and his predecessor, Paul Volcker, have \n     gone on the record to praise the 1993 package. ``I don't \n     think there is any doubt that the package was part of an \n     honest effort to reverse the trend of the budget deficit,'' \n     Volcker told me. ``I wouldn't call it particularly \n     structural, in the sense that it didn't involve any \n     constructive changes in the tax system, and it certainly \n     didn't resolve the entitlements problem, but it was an \n     honest-to-goodness attempt to come to grips with the budget \n     deficit.''\n       One of the minor mysteries of the current political \n     constellation is why, when deficit reduction is the \n     unquestioned mantra of the moment, President Clinton doesn't \n     get more public credit for reducing the deficit. \n     Unsurprisingly, this infuriates James Carville. ``The people \n     who are never called to the bar of justice are all those who \n     said when the President's economic program was passed that it \n     was going to be a disaster!'' he shouted on the phone to me. \n     ``If people were put on trial for economic stupidity, these \n     people who said the plan would cause hardship would all be \n     felons!''\n       Of course, as I mentioned earlier, one of those criticizing \n     the budget package was Begala, a former colleague of \n     Carville's. Begala no longer works for the White House, but \n     when I tracked him down, in Texas, he was unapologetic about \n     his stand back in 1993. ``If reduced to their core, the \n     arguments were these,'' he said. ``The economic advisers \n     saying, `Do this, because it will be good for the economy.' \n     The political advisers saying, `If you do this it will hurt \n     us politically.' I think history has proved us both right.'' \n     Given the disastrous results for the Democrats of the 1994 \n     midterm elections, even some of President Clinton's economic \n     advisers concede the point. Gene Sperling said, ``The \n     Republicans, by being so repetitious with their `largest tax \n     increase in history' line, were able to reinforce a \n     definition which people already had of Democrats. So it's \n     hard to look back and say the political advice had no \n     merit.''\n       On the other hand, as Sperling and others point out, the \n     1993 deficit-reduction package produced a variety of long-\n     term benefits that are only now paying off. ``We are going \n     into 1996 with a level of achievements that we could never \n     have had if we had not done this,'' Sperling said. ``Also, \n     the fact that we have brought down the budget deficit puts us \n     in a far better position to protect ourselves against the \n     more severe kind of stuff that the Republicans can throw at \n     us.''\n       One of these will be the charge that the President, through \n     his political maneuvering during the past twelve months, \n     scuttled the chances of a bipartisan agreement to balance the \n     budget by the year 2002. Another will be that he had done \n     little to head off the mother of all fiscal crises, which is \n     due to arrive in about fifteen years, when the baby boomers \n     start to turn sixty-five. Both points have merit, and Paul \n     Volcker, for one, believes the President's heart is no longer \n     in deficit reduction. ``They're now playing it politically,'' \n     he said. ``You get into this silly business abut whether you \n     balance the budget in ten years or eleven years or seven \n     years. It's all never-never land.''\n       These criticisms, while important, do not detract from the \n     policy decisions taken by the President during his first year \n     in office; without the 1993 deficit-reduction package, \n     balancing the budget would not be even a remote possibility. \n     In fact, as Robert Rubin pointed out, without the 1993 \n     package the whole political and economic landscape would look \n     quite different. ``We would have continued to have \n     abnormally high interest rates, and that would have choked \n     off the recovery,'' he told me.\n\n[[Page S5995]]\n\n       When I asked Rubin why, with all his Wall Street \n     experience, he thought the markets had reacted so positively, \n     his reply was a modest one. ``I don't know the answer, other \n     than that I know that the President was totally committed to \n     doing this, and he managed to convey that commitment to the \n     American people--and, more important in this case, to the \n     markets--in ways that they believed,'' he said. Volcker made \n     a similar point. ``I think the market had some confidence and \n     satisfaction that this guy came in and took on the budget \n     deficit as a major priority,'' he said. ``The feeling goes \n     beyond the particular budget numbers.''\n       Rubin's image of Bill Clinton as a commanding leader who \n     makes tough decisions and sticks with them through good times \n     and bad is not one that gels in the popular imagination, but \n     it was also evoked by Alan Blinder and Gene Sperling. ``I was \n     amazed at how committed he was to going for a substantial \n     deficit reduction, even when he saw some of the ugly things \n     that you had to do to the budget to get there,'' Blinder \n     said. ``Basically, he didn't flinch.''\n       Sperling praised the President even more highly. ``For us \n     on the economic team, we will always think of him as a good \n     decision-maker,'' he told me. ``When he had hard choices to \n     make, on both the deficit and NAFTA, he listened to everybody \n     for a few days, then he made the call and never looked \n     back.''\n       I reminded Sperling of the passages in Woodward's book \n     where the President berated his own advisers and complained \n     about turning the government over to Wall Street interests. \n     Surely these stories were true, I suggested.\n       ``Yes,'' Sperling conceded. ``Just like any of us, he felt \n     pain at times when things weren't going his way. But Woodward \n     missed the bigger picture, which was that Clinton did what \n     virtually no President had done before. The real issue is \n     that it was a very good, effective deficit-reduction plan.''\n       After talking to Sperling, I reread Woodward's description \n     of a meeting between Clinton and his economic advisers on \n     April 7, 1993. It goes as follows: `` `Where are all the \n     Democrats' Clinton bellowed. `I hope you're all aware we're \n     all Esienhower Republicans here, and we are fighting the \n     Reagan Republicans. We stand for lower deficits and free \n     trade and the bond market. Isn't that great' ''\n       No, not great, but perhaps it's what the country needed \n     after a decade of Reaganomics.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Remember, the entire sing-song and chant, Mr. \nPresident, on the other side of the aisle has been ``When is the \nPresident going to do something?''\n  So I quote from this particular article.\n\n       There is yet another important statistic that is rarely \n     mentioned in the public debate. For the past 2 years the \n     United States Treasury has been collecting more money in \n     revenue than Congress has been spending, not counting \n     interest payments on the national debt. Economists refer to \n     this situation as the Government running a primary surplus. \n     What it means is that if we didn't have to service the vast \n     debt run up during the past 15 years, the budget would now be \n     balanced.\n\n  Imagine that. The very crowd that is accusing the President of not \nwanting a balanced budget and not doing anything about the deficit, is \nthe very crowd that has caused the deficit.\n  Bill Clinton did not cause it. He was down in Arkansas during that \n10-year period actually balancing budgets. He comes here with these \ninherited interest costs, and what does he do? He reduced deficits by \n$500 billion, cuts over 200,000 Federal employees, taxes gasoline, cuts \nMedicare $57 billion.\n  Here is a man that has done something being accused of not wanting to \ndo anything. Instead of commenting on the facts, we're treated to tax \nand spend and liberal Democrats. It is all sloganism. It is all \nsymbols. It is all pollster politicking. It is not the facts. They \nought to have ashes in their mouths. We who have been here the past 15 \nyears can be accused of causing this fiscal cancer, but you cannot \naccuse William Jefferson Clinton of causing any deficit.\n  I read further from Mr. Cassidy's article, Mr. President.\n\n       Both Alan Greenspan and his predecessor, Paul Volcker, have \n     gone on the record to praise the 1993 package. ``I don't \n     think there's any doubt that the package was part of an \n     honest effort to reverse the train of the budget deficit,'' \n     Volcker told me. ``I wouldn't call it particularly structural \n     in the sense that it did not involve any constructive changes \n     in the tax system, and it certainly didn't solve the \n     entitlements problem, but it was an honest-to-goodness \n     attempt to come to grips with the budget deficit.''\n  That was none other than Paul Volcker. Yet, the constant refrain is \nthat the President is dishonest, that he lied, that he is not following \nhis pledge to the people, that he does not care about deficits. Yet he \nis the only person that has done anything about them.\n  Now, quickly, with respect the recent statements of Senator Domenici, \nI had to go back, Mr. President, to his talk on June 6, included in the \nCongressional Record. I refer to page S5879. Here, Mr. President, I \nfinally got him to admit that you cannot truly balance the budget \nwithout increasing taxes. He explains that if Social Security surpluses \nare protected, there are few remaining options:\n\n       Frankly, some would get up and say, ``No. We're going to do \n     it another way.'' How? There is only one other way, and that \n     is to dramatically increase taxes. I do not mean a little \n     bit--a huge amount.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I challenged the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee, last year. I said, ``If you can present to me a \nbalanced budget over the 7-year period that excludes Social Security \nsurpluses and does not increase taxes, I would jump off the Capitol \ndome.'' Now we have confirmation that it cannot be done. It took us \nalmost a year to get it, but better late than never.\n  Someone should tell Mr. Broder that the President's budget and the \nRepublican budgets have all been backloaded. This particular balanced \nbudget that Senator Dole is likewise backloaded. Look at it. Most of \nthe cuts happen after the Presidential election in the year 2000.\n  I read here, quoting Senator Domenici, ``Over the next 6 years, from \n1997 until 2002, the cumulative unified budget deficit, that is the \ntotal receipts less total outlays, a simple proposition, will be $1.1 \ntrillion, according to CBO. Over that same period, Social Security will \nrun a surplus of $525 billion, including $104 billion in the year \n2002.''\n  Now, here is the confusion, the misunderstanding, or the categorical \nfalsity. In reality, whether we owe it to the private markets or to \nfuture Social Security retirees, it is still an obligation. When the \nbill comes due, our children and grandchildren will end up having to \nmake good on $1.563 trillion of Social Security IOU's by the year 2006. \nOur failure to pay back the $522 billion that we already owe Social \nSecurity is the height of irresponsibility.\n  On paper, we should be accumulating a surplus. In reality, we are \nspending these funds to finance current consumption. By the year 2006 \nwe will owe Social Security $1.563 trillion. I repeat, by the year \n2006, under the best case scenario of the Republican plan, $1.563 \nbillion would be owed Social Security.\n  It should be of little surprise as to why I, or the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, or the Senator from California, or others voted against \nsuch a resolution.\n  They are all crying ``Jefferson, Jefferson,'' and ``children and \ngrandchildren.'' But there is a conspiracy of silence when it comes to \nthe $1.563 trillion bill that the Republican plan leaves in the Social \nSecurity trust fund. The best way to protect Social Security is to quit \ndecimating it. The distinguished Senator and the chairman of our Budget \nCommittee continued in his speech last week, ``I am concerned about the \nlooming and massive Social Security deficits that are on the horizon.''\n  But, Mr. President, looming and massive deficits are not on the \nhorizon; they are here. It is not children and grandchildren, it is us. \nWe wrap ourselves in glowing rhetoric about our children and \ngrandchildren and then do nothing. The truth of the matter is, since \nposterity can do nothing to us, we see no reason to do anything for \nposterity. We look to the next election and not the next generation.\n  Entitlements are continually blamed for our current deficit woes. \nYet, Social Security, is in surplus to the tune of $522 billion. \nMedicare has $130 billion surplus in it this minute. They are not \ncausing our current deficits. Thus, the shell game continues. It is one \nof the longest running games in town and we all take part in it.\n\n  The distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, who has the next \nhour and a half, refers to the exclusion of Social Security surpluses \nin the balanced budget amendment as a smokescreen. I can tell you here \nand now that we are in trouble when the fire chief in the firehouse \ncannot only smell the smoke and see the fire, but starts the fire with \nthese misleading statements.\n  We are in desperate circumstances. We have deficits and debt going\n\n[[Page S5996]]\n\nthrough the ceiling. We are spending $1 billion a day just on the \ninterest costs to the national debt, but we continue to fail to face up \nto this particular problem.\n  Republicans charge that President Clinton does not care about the \ndeficit, has not done anything about it. But Paul Volcker, the former \nChairman, says he is the only one who has made an honest try. Find that \nstatement by Paul Volcker about anybody else's budget. President \nClinton made an honest-to-goodness effort in 1993. And the facts show \nthat it is working. I voted for it. But not a single Republican did. \nThey caused the deficits. And if they had not caused this horrendous \ncost of $1 billion a day, we would not be talking about deficits but \nwould be in surplus under President Clinton's budget.\n  Mr. President, since nobody is here, let me complete the thought. I \nuse as my text none other than the daddy rabbit of the budget in \nReaganomics in back in the 1980's. I quote Mr. David Stockman, the \nformer Director of the Office of Management and Budget, dated March \n1993.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From New Perspectives Quarterly, March 1993]\n\n                      America is Not Overspending\n\n                         (By David A. Stockman)\n\n       President Clinton's economic plan deserves heavy-duty \n     critcism--particularly the $190 billion worth of new \n     boondoggles through FY1998 that are euphermistically labelled \n     ``stimulus'' and ``investment'' programs. But on one thing he \n     has told the unvarnished truth. There is no way out of the \n     elephantine budget deficits which have plagued the nation \n     since 1981 without tax increases.\n       In this regard, the full-throated anti-tax war cries \n     emanating from the GOP since February 17 amount to no more \n     than deceptive gibberish. Indeed, if Congressman Newt \n     Gingrich and his playmates had the parental supervision they \n     deserve, they would be sent to the nearest corner wherein to \n     lodge their Pinocchio-sized noses until this adult task of \n     raising taxes is finished.\n       The fact is, we have no other viable choice. According to \n     the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecast, by FY1998 we \n     will have practical full employment and, also, nearly a $400 \n     billion budget deficit if nothing is done. The projected red \n     ink would amount to five percent of GNP, and would mean \n     continuing Treasury absorption of most of our meager net \n     national savings through the end of the century. This is \n     hardly a formula for sustaining a competitive and growing \n     economy.\n       The root problem goes back to the July 1981 frenzy of \n     excessive and imprudent tax-cutting that shattered the \n     nation's fiscal stability. A noisy faction of Republicans \n     have willfully denied this giant mistake of fiscal \n     governance, and their own culpability in it, ever since. \n     Instead, they have incessantly poisoned the political debate \n     with a mindless stream of anti-tax venom, while pretending \n     that economic growth and spending cuts alone could cure the \n     deficit.\n       It ought to be obvious by now that we can't grow our way \n     out. If we should happen to realize CBO's economic forecast \n     by 1998, wouldn't a nearly $400 billion deficit in a full \n     employment economy 17 years after the event finally \n     constitute the smoking gun?\n       To be sure, aversion to higher taxes is usually a \n     necessary, healthy impulse in a political democracy. But when \n     the alternative becomes as self-evidently threadbare and \n     groundless as has the ``growth'' argument, we are no longer \n     dealing with legitimate skepticism but with what amounts to a \n     demagogic fetish.\n       Unfortunately, as a matter of hard-core political realism, \n     the ritualized spending cut mantra of the GOP anti-taxers is \n     equally vapid. Again, the historical facts are overwhelming.\n       Ronald Reagan's original across-the-board income tax cut \n     would have permanently reduced the federal revenue base by \n     three percent of GNP. At a time when defense spending was \n     being rapidly pumped up, and in a context in which the then \n     ``conservative'' congressional majority had already decided \n     to leave 90 percent of domestic spending untouched, the \n     Reagan tax rate cut alone would have strained the nation's \n     fiscal equation beyond the breaking point. But no one blew \n     the whistle. Instead, both parties succumbed to a shameless \n     tax-bidding war that ended up doubling the tax cut to six \n     percent of GNP--or slashing by nearly one-third the permanent \n     revenue base of the United States government.\n       While delayed effective dates and phase-ins postponed the \n     full day of reckoning until the late 1980s, there is no \n     gainsaying the fiscal carnage. As of August, 1981, Uncle Sam \n     had been left to finance a 1980s-sized domestic welfare state \n     and defense build-up from a general revenue base that was now \n     smaller relative to GNP than at any time since 1940!\n       In subsequent years, several ``mini'' tax increase bills \n     did slowly restore the Federal revenue base to nearly its \n     post-war average share of GNP. The $2.5 trillion in \n     cumulative deficits since 1981, however, is not a product of \n     ``over-spending'' in any meaningful sense of the term. In \n     fact, we have had a rolling legislative referendum for 12 \n     years on ``appropriate'' Federal spending in today's \n     society--and by now the overwhelming bi-partisan consensus is \n     crystal clear.\n       Cash benefits for Social Security recipients, government \n     retirees and veterans will cost about $500 billion in 1998--\n     or six percent of prospective GNP. The fact is they also cost \n     six percent of GNP when Jimmy Carter came to town in 1977, as \n     they did when Ronald Reagan arrived in 1981, Bush in 1989 and \n     Clinton in 1993.\n       The explanation for this remarkable 25 years of actual and \n     prospective fiscal cost stability is simple. Since the mid-\n     1970s there has been no legislative action to increase \n     benefits, while a deep political consensus has steadily \n     congealed on not cutting them, either. Ronald Reagan pledged \n     not to touch Social Security in his 1984 debate with Mondale; \n     on this issue Bush never did move his lips; and Rep. Gingrich \n     can readily wax as eloquently on the ``sanctity'' of the \n     nation's social contract with the old folks as the late \n     Senator Claude Pepper ever did.\n       The political and policy fundamentals of the $375 billion \n     prospective 1998 cost of Medicare and Medicaid are exactly \n     the same. If every amendment relating to these medical \n     entitlements which increased or decreased eligibility and \n     benefit coverage since Jimmy Carter's inauguration were laid \n     end-to-end, the net impact by 1998 would hardly amount to one \n     to two percent of currently projected costs.\n       Thus, in the case of the big medical entitlements, there \n     has been no legislatively driven ``overspending'' surge in \n     the last two decades. And since 1981, no elected Republican \n     has even dared think out loud about the kind of big changes \n     in beneficiary premium costs and co-payments that could \n     actually save meaningful budget dollars.\n       To be sure, budget costs of the medical entitlements have \n     skyrocketed--but that is because our underlying health \n     delivery system is ridden with inflationary growth. Perhaps \n     Hillary will fix this huge, systemic economic problem. But \n     until that silver bullet is discovered, there is no way to \n     save meaningful budget dollars in these programs except to \n     impose higher participation costs on middle and upper income \n     beneficiaries--a move for which the GOP has absolutely no \n     stomach.\n       Likewise, the ``safety net'' for the poor and price and \n     credit supports for rural America cost the same in real \n     terms--about $100 billion--as they did in January, 1981. That \n     is because Republicans and Democrats have gone to the well \n     year after year only to add nickels, subtract pennies, and, \n     in effect, validate over and over the same ``appropriate'' \n     level of spending.\n       On the vast expanse of the domestic budget, then, \n     ``overspending'' is an absolute myth. Our post-1981 mega-\n     deficits are not attributable to it; and the GOP has neither \n     a coherent program nor the political courage to attack \n     anything but the most microscopic spending marginalia.\n       It is unfortunate that having summoned the courage to face \n     the tax issue squarely, President Clinton has clouded the \n     debate with an excess of bashing the wealthy and an utterly \n     unnecessary grab-bag of new tax and spending giveaways. But \n     that can be corrected in the legislative process--and it in \n     no way lets the Republicans off the hook. They led the \n     Congress into a giant fiscal mistake 12 years ago, and they \n     now have the responsibility to work with a President who is \n     at least brave enough to attempt to correct it.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I quote:\n\n       The root problem goes back to the July 1981 frenzy of \n     excessive and imprudent tax cutting that shattered the \n     Nation's fiscal responsibility. A noisy faction of \n     Republicans have willfully denied this giant mistake of \n     fiscal governance and their own culpability in it ever since. \n     Instead, they have incessantly poisoned the political debate \n     with a mindless stream of anti-tax venom, while pretending \n     that economic growth and spending cuts alone could cure the \n     deficit. It ought to be obvious by now that we cannot grow \n     our way out.\n\n  Mr. President, there it is. Someday, somehow, David Broder and these \nother columnists will pick up the truth and quit ipso facto reporting \nbalanced budgets. We have do not have a balanced budget plan; all plans \nuse the trust funds. We owe the Social Security trust fund; we owe the \nMedicare trust fund; we owe the highway, airport, and Civil Service \ntrust funds. We have been borrowed well over a trillion dollars from \nthese trust funds.\n  In addition, other sleights of hand include factoring in speculative \ninterest dividends for budgetary savings. Mr. President, we started \nthat back in 1990. You know what the projection was? In the 1990 \nbudget, we said we would not only have a balanced budget by 1995, but a \n$20 billion surplus. Can you imagine that? Instead, there is a $277 \nbillion deficit. That is how far off these are. Yet, Mr. Broder comes \nup alleges that, ``This is too clever by half.'' Tell him to wake up. \nHe should know better than that.\n\n[[Page S5997]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am watching history repeat itself. I joined in the \nopposition to Reaganomics and what Stockman says was the worst mistake \nwe ever made. I joined in the tax increases to try and reverse it. I \njoined in Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. When they write now, as Senator Rudman \nhas, that Senator Hollings wanted a divorce, they should be clear about \nthe facts. Instead of using the automatic cuts as a spear to urge and \nrequire fiscal discipline, they started to use it as a shield for \nfiscal irresponsibility, and I wanted no part in that. I voted for the \ntax increases here in 1993. At the time, my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle said, ``Well, you cannot trust that Washington crowd. \nIf they increase the taxes, that means all they will do is increase the \nspending.'' False.\n  In 1993, we increased taxes and cut spending to the tune of $500 \nbillion. In direct result, we have an economy with low unemployment, \nlow interest rates, steady growth, and low inflation. And they say that \nthe President is ``too clever by half,'' and is ``postponing choices.''\n  Once again, Mr. President, when they say the President did not make \nany honest try, perhaps we should remember Mr. Volcker's words on the \n1993 package:\n\n       I don't think there is any doubt that the package was part \n     of an honest effort to reverse the trend of the budget \n     deficit.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry; what is the order of business \nbefore the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). We are in morning business. The \nSenator from New Mexico has control of the time from 1 o'clock until \n3:30.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/10/senate-section/article/S5990-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am disappointed that we could not work \nout an agreement with the minority that would allow us to complete \naction on the conference agreement on the budget today. I had hoped we \ncould do that so our distinguished majority leader would have an \nopportunity before he left the Senate to cast his vote in favor of this \nbudget resolution and a balanced budget by the year 2002. The \nconference agreement on the 1997 budget resolution was completed last \nThursday evening and filed Friday morning. Copies of the conference \nreport have been available since early this morning. The House of \nRepresentatives Rules Committee will act this evening to report a rule \nthat will allow the House to act on the conference report tomorrow \nmorning and complete action by noon.\n  Normally, we would simply call up the conference report, discuss the \nconference report, since it would not be subject to amendment, yield \nback the statutory 10 hours of time and vote on final passage. Without \nconsent to the contrary, however, here in the Senate, if we were to act \non a conference report before the House has acted, the conference \nreport would be subjected to unlimited recommittal motions, and the \nminority is aware of this opportunity to subject the Senate, and I say \nLeader Dole, to an unlimited number of such motions. Therefore, they \nhave not been willing to grant us consent that would allow us to do \nwhat we are going to do tomorrow. Once the House sends us this, we will \ntake it up, and obviously there will be no recommittal motions in \norder, as I understand it, at that point.\n  We were trying to get the minority to let us start that process today \nand perhaps complete this before the leader leaves sometime tomorrow, \naround 12 or 1 o'clock. It means he will not have a chance to vote on \nit. It does not mean that there will be anything happen to the budget \nresolution. I assume we will have his successor Senator voting with us, \nas we have had him.\n  I will have more opportunity tomorrow to discuss the significance of \nthis budget resolution and what it does. I might just start with one \nconcept for everybody to understand. On the discretionary \nappropriations, which has been the subject of an awful lot of debate \nlast year which caused many appropriations bills to be vetoed by the \nPresident and caused the closure of Government from time to time during \nthat long process of trying to get appropriations completed, we have \nresolved our differences between the House and Senate.\n  We have produced a budget resolution that, essentially, has all of \nthe domestic discretionary programs combined at a freeze--same level as \nlast year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That is the \nnumber that we agreed upon. That means if we take all the riders off \nthose appropriations bills, and I understand that there is some \nmovement in that direction, we can clearly be sending to the President \nappropriations bills that he ought to sign. Clearly, the American \npeople will understand it very easily. The Republicans do not want to \nreduce spending. They want to freeze it. They are not out there to \nclose down Government. They just want to say, in a very difficult year, \nwe should freeze the expenditures of the appropriated accounts at last \nyear's level. That is what we will be doing. That is what the \nappropriations bills are going to reflect in the next 5, 6, 7 weeks.\n\n  Hopefully, if we get those done, we can finish our work early or even \nahead of time with reference to the appropriations bills which caused \nso much commotion last year and so much ill-will and ill-feeling \nbetween many people in the country and this various series of vetoes \nand closures. That will be the essence of the Republican approach. \nObviously, big savings come in the entitlement reform programs. We will \nmove those through in due course. Once again, we believe we are on the \nright path. We will discuss what we think the President's approach to \nMedicare has been. Clearly, he is playing a major shell game with this \nbig program that the senior citizens need so desperately to have \nattended by way of reform.\n  We will get into those details tomorrow. I have not sought approval \nfrom any of the leadership here to make this statement, but, frankly, I \nam very hopeful when we finally get on this budget resolution tomorrow, \nthat even though there are 10 hours of debate equally divided, we will \nfinish tomorrow. No motions are in order, no amendments are in order. I \nsee no reason why we cannot finish it tomorrow, even if we take it up \nsometime in the middle of the afternoon tomorrow. That ought to be \nplenty of time to debate it and finish tomorrow to get on with other \nSenate work.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/10/senate-section/article/S5997-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5997-S5999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Senator Domenici opened debate on the \n1997 budget conference committee report, the agreement that has been \nironed out on the differences between the House and the Senate, for \npresentation to the Senate for final passage, so that the 1997 budget \nwill be behind us and we can start making changes in the programs that \nwill fit these programs into the budget that balances by the year 2002, \n6 years from now.\n  CBO has scored it that way. CBO is a nonpartisan agency that rules on \nwhether or not budgets are balanced and what programs cost and how much \nincome is coming in. They said that this will balance by that time.\n  The year 2002 is the year that we selected last year to balance the \nbudget by. Our bill was presented to the President last year, and he \nvetoed it. We are not going to take an extra year to balance the budget \nwhen we do it this year. We are going to do it in 6 years now because \nthat is all we have left between now and the year 2002. I hope that my \ncolleagues will vote for that.\n  In a sense, as the famous baseball player said, ``It's deja vu all \nover again.'' It is kind of that way with the Balanced Budget Act that \nwe are dealing with today, tomorrow and the next day until it is \npassed. Because last year we worked for 8 months in 13 committees to \npass this 1,800-page Balanced Budget Act of 1995. This was a bill that \n13 committees worked on to produce\n\n[[Page S5998]]\n\nchanges in the programs so that the budget would balance in 7 years. We \npresented this to the President prior to Thanksgiving last year. The \nPresident vetoed it, I believe, on December 5.\n\n  I remind people of that document existing, that we had the votes to \npass it, because often I get the question, which is a question coming \nfrom a cynical attitude that people have because we promise more than \nwe can deliver, where people ask, ``Do you think you can ever balance \nthe budget?'' Well, I like to carry this around with me and remind \npeople, yes, we can balance the budget. Here is the act that for the \nfirst time in a generation Congress not only had the document, but the \nvotes to pass it and to present it to the President.\n  Of course, that is history now. Ultimately, people are going to \ndecide who won or lost with the veto that the President had of that \nbill last year. It also reminds you that one person can make a \ndifference of having a balanced budget or not. We had a majority in the \nSenate, we had a majority in the House to pass the Balanced Budget Act \nof 1995. But one person, the President of the United States, stands \nbetween the people and a balanced budget. So historians will have a \nchance to look at who the big economic losers are in that veto of the \nBalanced Budget Act.\n  But the 1997 budget resolution gives us another chance without \nnecessarily losing time because we still meet the deadline by the year \n2002. But while we talk about balancing the budget, and we delivered a \nbill to the President last year to balance the budget and he vetoed it, \nthe time clock is running, the national debt is growing, and interest \nis accruing on that national debt.\n  Of course, since we did not balance it last year, and if the \nPresident vetoes it this year, we are not going to suffer; it is our \nchildren and grandchildren that will suffer because we live high on the \nhog today, spending beyond our means, satisfying our own materialistic \ndemands, and engaging in the immoral act of worrying about today and \nforgetting about tomorrow because our children and grandchildren are \npicking up the bill.\n  Every one of us in this body, whether we vote for it or against it, \nbears some of the blame for the situation that this country is in after \na generation of deficit spending. Those of us who voted for it last \nyear showed we were a year ahead of everybody else in balancing the \nbudget.\n\n  Still, that does not overcome the sin of the deficit spending of a \ngeneration and the tremendous load of $18,000 per newborn baby that \nthey carry of that additional debt. Or the 80 percent tax rate that the \nPresident's own budget document says our children will have to assume \nfor the interest and the principal of that great debt.\n  None of this is done in a very perfect fashion. The legislation that \nwe pass is not perfect. How we go about it may not be the perfect way \nof balancing the budget, but it must be done. It will be done. \nEverybody is going to pay a little bit towards this effort to get to a \nbalanced budget. Maybe as a practical political exercise, that is the \nonly way it can be done. Some people would say, ``Cut out completely \nthis program,'' and others will say, ``We have to save this program,'' \nor ``increase that program.'' It can be done that way. Basically, the \nway we have done it is to make sure every program pays a little bit in \nthe effort to get to a balanced budget.\n  Ultimately, as a political system, it seems we have figured out we \ncan indeed vote ourselves more money. That is why we have the problems \nwe have. All the people have to do is vote for the guy who promised to \nprotect expensive programs and who promised to let entitlements run \nwild. That is what has been going on. That is why we have a $5 trillion \nnational debt.\n  Last year, as a result of a mandate from the election of 1994, the \nnew Members of Congress felt it is time to call a halt to deliver on \nthe promises that have been made to balance the budget, and to do it in \n7 years. I am enthused about the 1997 budget resolution before the \nSenate. I think it is a belt tightener, a conservative one. Every item \nin it might not be exactly as it would be if I had written it, but \nbroad representation is the nature of our Government. Compromise is the \nonly way to accomplish some of our goals--everybody to give a little \nbit in the process. This gets us, as the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office has said, to balance in 6 years. The nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office shows that we should even have a $5 billion \nsurplus by the year 2002. To me, that is a pretty good report card. I \nnote, for significance, that the 1997 budget resolution is the only \nplan that gets us to zero deficit in 6 years.\n  Now, somebody would say, ``Well, the President says he has offered a \nbudget,'' but it does not balance as he says it would. The President's \naide, Dr. Tyson, has been on the morning talk shows saying that the \nPresident's budget balances. What she has not made clear is that the \nPresident relies on certain contingency proposals or emergency triggers \nin the year 2001 that either increase taxes or cut unspecified \ndiscretionary spending in order to reach balance by that year. It could \nbe both a tax increase and unspecified discretionary spending cuts.\n  If the President is on a path of spending throughout the 6-year-\nperiod of time that he sets us on in the year 1997, there is no way you \nget to a balanced budget by the year 2002. You have an $81 billion \ndeficit. Of course, in the meantime, even if this President is \nreelected, he is back in Arkansas at the time there are future tax \nincreases and/or unspecified spending cuts have to be put in place, so \nit is not really his worry.\n  Now, for the President's advisers to say on television that this \nbudget balances, when that is the situation, is a failure to mention \nthe balloon payments that the President has built into his budget plan. \nThese balloon payments are similar to those magic asterisks that David \nStockman put in President Reagan's budget when President Reagan \npromised he would balance the budget in 1984, at the end of his first \nterm. When the President's budget did not balance--and some of the new \nSenators voted against it at that particular time--the President \nobviously was a little bit embarrassed, because he made a promise to \nbalance the budget, and his first budget submitted in his \nadministration did not do it by the time he said it would be doing it. \nSo we were all sold on the proposition it could be done in the years \n1983 and 1984, so David Stockman put that magic asterisk into the \nPresident's first budget.\n\n  Did that ever materialize? Of course it did not. Do you think the \nPresident's balloon payments of 2001 and 2002 will materialize, whether \nthe balloon payments result in tax increases or in spending cuts, or \nboth? I think it is less than candid for either the President or his \nEconomic Advisers to go on television saying somehow that is going to \nhappen in the year 2001 and 2002, when the President is back in \nArkansas, and is going to result in a balanced budget.\n  Now, when it comes to the budget that we present to this body for \napproval this week, the 1997 budget resolution conference report, it \nhas no hidden gimmicks or balloon payments in it. Instead, there are \nonly clear, specifically illuminated promises. In other words, we get \nto true balance in 6 years, because we set this budget on a course to \nbalance much sooner than the President of the United States does. In \naddition, we get a 6-year $122 billion tax cut primarily made up of a \n$500 per child tax credit. Some people will criticize that. Some will \nsay it is for the rich when they know in their heart that is not true. \nThey forget that a $1,000 tax cut for a family of four can make a big, \nbig difference, that everybody in this country is not rich, and that \nthe middle-class families of America are going to benefit from that tax \ncut.\n  Why a tax cut for families with children? It is because the tax on \nchildren is presently unfair. It used to be that the dependency \nexemptions for children almost nullified the tax liability for \nfamilies. Those families, obviously, use the tax savings to raise their \nchildren. For the personal exemption today that is in the Tax Code, to \nhave the same value relative to family income that it had in 1948, it \nwould have to be $8,000 per child exemption in 1996, instead of the \n$2,600 per child it is now. Truthfully, to be fair, we need a credit in \nexcess, then, of that $500 per child, to put families back with the \nsame purchasing power that they deserve.\n  Even with the new tax credit, families will have to continue to \ntighten their belts. But remember this credit is\n\n[[Page S5999]]\n\na credit and not an exemption or deduction. Thus, each child in any \nfamily is going to be worth $500 more, regardless of the income of the \nfamily. And the phaseout ranges of the credit begin at a lower level of \nincome than do the phaseout ranges of the current dependency credit.\n  So if any Senators claim that they want to defend families in this \nbudget, the best place to start is by taking money away from Washington \nand returning it to the families. Families can spend that money more \nwisely than Washington can spend that money.\n  Besides that $500 tax credit per child to help empower families, this \nbudget resolution of 1997 reforms entitlements. It would be wonderful \nif we can continue to allow entitlements to grow unchecked, but that is \nnot possible. Without legislative maintenance, entitlements are going \nto swallow themselves. We know now that if we do not do something about \nentitlements, by 2012, the entire budget will be made up of \nentitlements and interest on the national debt, with nothing even for \nnational defense.\n  Also, our budget resolution will save $53 billion in welfare programs \nas we reform welfare and turn it back to the States. Medicare spending \nis going to go up at a rate that will allow us to consume $72 billion \nless than under present payout. Of course, we just heard last week that \nMedicare is racing toward bankruptcy in 5 years. We will not allow that \nto happen. We allow Medicare spending to go up from $4,700 per person \nper year to $6,800 per person per year, and its solvency is extended 10 \nyears in this budget resolution. We do this without increasing the \nregressive payroll tax, and we do it with keeping the part B premium at \nits present level of 25 percent of total program cost. We freeze \ndiscretionary budget authority in this legislation in 1997 at the 1996 \nlevel. One place where I disagree with Republicans is that defense \nspending in our bill is too high. I made an effort on the floor of the \nSenate to cut that back by $11 billion, but that lost. This budget \ncompromise between the House and Senate reflects that higher level of \nDefense expenditures. I think that if families are tightening their \nbelts, and other programs in Washington are tightening their belts, and \nif entitlements have to have their belts tightened, defense contractors \nought to have their belts tightened as well.\n  Finally, the budget process is somewhat changed from last time. This \nbudget resolution offers three separate and independent reconciliation \nbills. Each bill can live without any of the previous bills. The \nstructure of the two succeeding bills depends upon the success of the \npreceding one. This is a sound and flexible plan that will allow us to \npresent to the President something that he will not have any excuse for \nvetoing, as far as I am concerned, considering the fact that he vetoed \nlast year's budget that we gave to him.\n  The days of our living beyond our means, hopefully, come to an end \nwith the adoption of the budget resolution for 1997. Hopefully, it puts \nus on a path, for the first time in a generation, to get to a balanced \nbudget. Hopefully, it means that each generation is going to assume its \nfair share of pain for our programs and for ending the principle of \npassing on to future generations the cost of our programs for today.\n  I yield the floor.

Mr. President, sometime late tomorrow or early on \nWednesday the Senate will begin formal consideration of the budget \nresolution adopted late last week by a conference committee. That \nbudget resolution, in common with its predecessor a year ago, will \nclearly put the United States on the road to a balanced budget, a goal \nshared by more than 80 percent of all of our fellow citizens.\n  To a certain extent, Mr. President, a balanced budget is a goal in \nthe abstract. It is a phrase that sounds good, sounds responsible, but \nnonetheless is divorced from our day-to-day concerns. It is, however, \nvitally important to our future, but most particularly to the future of \nour children and our grandchildren, to those who come after us.\n  Almost 200 years ago Thomas Jefferson spoke of it as a moral \nimperative, that it was simply a moral wrong for the politicians of his \nday or of ours to spend money on programs, however worthy, that they \nsupported, but to refuse to pay the bill, to send that bill to someone \nelse.\n  Thomas Jefferson's words are as important and as valid today as they \nwere at the beginning of the 19th century. It is our obligation to seek \nthis goal, and not just to seek it, but to put the Nation on a path \npursuant to which it will be attained.\n  It does, of course, go beyond a pure moral imperative. It is a \nfinancial imperative as well.\n  We know by the almost unanimous opinion of economists who dig deeply \ninto this issue that the mere promise of a balanced budget, accompanied \nby a set of policies that will lead us shortly after the turn of the \ncentury to reach one, will have a positive impact. Such a promise will \nlower the interest rates that men and women pay on the homes they \npurchase or wish to purchase, on their automobiles and other large \nconsumer purchases, on their businesses, small and large, designed for \ntheir own future, and for the creation of opportunity in our society \nand our economy.\n  The actual accomplishment shortly after the turn of the century of a \nbalanced budget will mean somewhere between $1,000 and $2,000 per \naverage American family additional in their pockets, partly because of \nthe lower interest rates that I have already described and partly \nbecause, all other things being equal, the economy will be that much \nstronger. There will be that many more and better jobs for Americans in \njust a very few years from now. This is a case in which the moral \nimperative and the financial desirability as a course of action lead us \nin precisely the same direction.\n  Mr. President, under those circumstances, why is this not only a \nunanimous goal, but why are not the policies that lead to that equally \nunanimous? I do not remember during the course of the last year any \nMember of this body standing before the body and saying, ``It is a poor \nidea. It is not something that we should bother with at all.'' No, Mr. \nPresident, everyone gives at least lip service to the idea, but that \nlip service goes little further when it comes to the practical methods \nof attaining the goal. With those who voted no as recently as last week \non a constitutional amendment that would mandate attaining a goal, to \nthose who will vote no tomorrow or the next day, the answer will \nconstantly be, ``We have to do it differently. I do not like this \nbalanced budget.'' It is some other balanced budget, my own or someone \nelse's, that is the only way to go. In other words, the details, the \ntendency for perfection in the mind of each individual Member, \ninterferes with attaining a goal so important both morally and \neconomically.\n  Mr. President, perhaps all of us could have been accused of that \ncourse of action as recently as a handful of years ago. Almost never, \nin my memory, did anyone seriously propose a budget that led to that \nbalance until the dramatic vote of something more than a year ago in \nwhich the balanced budget constitutional amendment, having been \napproved by the House of Representatives, was defeated here by a single \nvote. Following that dramatic loss, many Members took much more \nseriously the lip service they previously had given to a balanced \nbudget. In fact, a majority of this body came up with a budget \nresolution and then enforcing statutes that would reach that goal by \nthe year 2002.\n  Regrettably--I think profoundly regrettably--the President of the \nUnited States vetoed that proposal with the statement that we ought to \ndo it in a different way. Now, that statement came in spite of the fact \nthat the President of the United States had never\n\n[[Page S6000]]\n\npreviously proposed any way of reaching that goal. Since that veto, Mr. \nPresident, not surprisingly, given the predictions of what success \nwould bring, failure has brought an increase in interest rates. Almost \nhalf of last year's gain has now been lost. The prospects of the good \neconomics that result from a balanced budget are limited.\n  The President criticized the budget by reason of what it did to \nstrengthen and preserve Medicare. Yet, just last week, his own Medicare \ntrustees have said the very challenges in the Medicare system that last \nyear's balanced budget was designed to cure have become not better, but \nworse. Even so, Mr. President, we now have a proposal from the \nadministration called a ``balanced budget'' that has been severely, and \nI think appropriately, criticized by Members on this side of the aisle \non the ground that it was not real.\n\n  Just yesterday in the Washington Post we saw an analysis of some \nelements of that proposal by a normally relatively liberal columnist \nwho pointed out what we already knew, the President's budget for this \nyear increases spending on a number of politically popular programs and \nproposes dramatic cuts in those programs next year and the year after. \nHowever, Mr. President, when his Cabinet Members in charge of \nadministering those programs were asked how they would deal with those \nreductions in future years, they assured Members of Congress that, in \nfact, the President had privately assured that they would never, in \nfact, take place; that they were, in effect, phony figures designed to \ncreate a paper balance that never, in fact, would take place.\n  Now, Mr. President, we are faced with a dramatic choice: Do we vote \nin favor of the one proposed budget resolution now available to us that \nincludes difficult but necessary policy decisions to reach this goal \ndesired by so many Americans for so many good reasons, or do we \ncontinue to say, ``Not this one, not now, wait until next year, do it \ndifferently''?\n  Mr. President, I was one of the dozen Republican Members who joined \nwith a dozen Democratic Members to come up with a different proposal, a \nbipartisan proposal, to reach the same goal in approximately the same \nperiod of time, a proposal that I thought at least in some respects to \nbe superior to the one that is about to come to the floor of this U.S. \nSenate. Mr. President, that proposal received 46 affirmative votes out \nof 100 Members of the Senate. That is not quite enough. The reason that \nit did not quite go over the top was that the President of the United \nStates rejected that proposal to exactly the same extent that he \nrejected the Republican proposal. He would not endorse it. He would not \neven say he would sign it if its enforcing legislation was to be \npassed.\n  So the first bipartisan attempt in a decade at solving this \ncontracted budget problem has been rejected. Now we are faced with \nanother proposal, almost as good, certainly plenty good enough to reach \nthe goal, which is very, very likely to be passed by a strictly \npartisan vote, and then to have its enforcing legislation vetoed by the \nPresident of the United States. I regret that, Mr. President.\n  I hope during the course of the debate in the next 2 or 3 days some \nMembers of the other party who worked so hard and so sincerely and so \ndiligently on the bipartisan proposal will see the many similarities \nbetween their product, our product, and the one that is now before \nus, and will generously and with a good heart determine that if they \ncannot have perfection, they can certainly get--even from their own \nperspective, with our budget--a vastly superior program to that \nproposed by the President's administration. I hope that some of them at \nleast will have courage enough to join with us to move the whole \nproject forward, to help us see to it that we do something that we are \nenjoying to do, like no less a historic personage than Thomas \nJefferson, as a matter of moral imperative, and something that will \nhave such a tremendously positive impact on our children and \ngrandchildren in general and generations yet to come, who do not have \nthe right to vote in this fall's election, but who are our \nresponsibility nevertheless.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a fine resolution. It is a courageous \nresolution. It is a moral resolution. It is an effective resolution. It \nshould be passed, and it should be enforced.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that time allocated \nto Senator Domenici in this period of time be allocated to me and that \nI may use as much time as I may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/10/senate-section/article/S5999-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6000-S6003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           GETTING BACK TO BASICS: NATO'S DOUBLE ENLARGEMENT\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the visit to Washington of Lech Walesa, the \nformer President of Poland, and the introduction of the NATO \nParticipation Act on the floor of the Senate, suggests that it is time \nfor the Senate to begin to seriously consider the future of the \nAtlantic Alliance.\n  It is a particularly important time to take stock of where we stand \nin the Alliance. Over the past 2 years, the Alliance has discussed and \nstudied many issues ranging from enlargement to command reform to the \nbroader structural reform of the Alliance in order to enable it to \ncarry out new missions.\n  The time for discussing and studying is now coming to an end. Over \nthe next 12 months, NATO must make decisions in three key areas which \nwill cast the die for European security and the transatlantic \nrelationship for the next decade.\n  Starting with last week's Ministerial meeting in Berlin, Alliance \nleaders must decide:\n  First, will NATO enlarge its membership, and what policies, \nrecognition, and certainty should it give to countries which will not \nbe included in the first selection?\n  Second, how will NATO reform itself internally to be able to carry \nout new missions? This includes article 5 defense commitments as well \nas other non-article 5 missions such as crisis management beyond \nAlliance borders.\n  Third, what should be the NATO relationship with Russia during the \nenlargement process? Should NATO build a parallel cooperative \npartnership with Moscow?\n  The ramifications of how well or poorly NATO does its job on these \nissues are far reaching. We are talking about the laying of the \ncornerstones of a new European peace order and building a new NATO \nwhich deserves that name not only in theory but in reality. If we \nsucceed, we will have set the foundation for decades of European peace \nand prosperity. If we fail, historians may look back at the early post-\ncold-war period as a tragic loss of opportunities.\n  It is in this context that we must weigh the utility of legislative \nefforts such as the NATO Participation Act.\n  Above all, we must realize that we are headed into a historical \ndebate over NATO's future, one that will reverberate for many years to \ncome. It is a debate that will be public and which will undoubtedly be \ncontroversial--as befits an alliance of democracies wrestling with such \nimportant issues. Much of the discussion about the pros and cons of \nenlargement and other issues have been limited to elites and experts--\nalong with the occasional Senator or Minister. That, too, is going to \nchange.\n  I look forward to this public debate. I believe that we have an \nhistorical window of opportunity to take steps that will secure \nEuropean peace and stability and which will lock in the freedom and \nindependence won in the revolutions of 1989 and the collapse of \ncommunism. I believe that we will win this debate, both in the U.S. \nSenate and elsewhere in the Alliance, provided that we follow some \nsimple, common-sense guidelines.\n  Before charting those guidelines, I want to review the basic \nquestions we will undoubtedly face in the U.S. Senate, as well as in \nthe parliaments of both NATO allies as well as candidate countries.\n\n\n                            The Vision Thing\n\n  In the United States, our political leaders are often asked about \nwhat we call the vision thing. What is it you want to achieve and why? \nWhat is your vision and how will individual policies fit together with \nan overall set of objectives? As a U.S. Senator, I am often asked, by \nsome of my colleagues and\n\n[[Page S6001]]\n\nconstituents, why I am still so concerned about NATO and issues such as \nNATO enlargement now that the cold war is over.\n  The more distant we get from the heady days of the fall of the Berlin \nWall and the collapse of communism, it is more clear that we entered a \nnew era. Dangers still abound in post-cold-war Europe. The revolutions \nof 1989 not only led to the collapse of communism but also to the end \nof the peace orders established after two world wars. What is at stake \nhere is order and stability in Europe as a whole. And that is why \nAmerican interests are involved.\n  NATO cannot by itself solve all of Europe's problems. But without a \nstable security framework, we run the risk that the reform and \ndemocracy in the East of Europe will not persist but will instead be \nundercut by destructive forces of nationalism and insecurity. The \nfailure of democracy in the East could not help but have profound \nconsequences for democracy in the continent's western half as well. If \nhistory teaches us anything, it is that the United States is always \ndrawn into such European conflicts because our vital interests are \nultimately, albeit somewhat belatedly, engaged.\n  That, in a nutshell, is one reason why I have always been in favor of \nNATO enlargement. But this is only one reason and one part of my \nvision, which consists of what I want to prevent, and also what I want \nto build. I want to build a new transatlantic bargain of a unified and \nintegrated Europe--whole and free--in permanent alliance with the \nUnited States. It is a vision of the United States and Europe in a \npartnership of equals devoted to managing the security of Europe as \nwell as to the pursuit of common interests beyond Europe. The old \ntransatlantic bargain which offered the Europeans a form of American \nprotection in return for American influence must be replaced by a new \ntransatlantic accord.\n  This is a vision for the Alliance that is no longer necessarily \nfocused on or limited to Europe. This is also a vision for the Alliance \nthat transcends the old cold-war rationale, namely--to deter and, if \nneeded, defend Western Europe against a Soviet attack. It is a vision \nfor a new covenant between the United States and Europe as a force for \npromoting Western values and interests in Europe and beyond. We need a \nnew and much broader transatlantic agenda and dialog, one that focuses \non where and how the United States and Europe can and should act \ntogether.\n  I was one of the earliest proponents in the Congress of NATO \nenlargement. But I always spoke of enlargement not in isolation but \nrather as part of a new security partnership between the United States \nand a unified Europe. The United States is a global power, a country \nwith interests in Europe and beyond. It is also a country that \nincreasingly requires like-minded allies and partners to manage that \ninternational security agenda. And as Americans look around, they see \nno better candidates than our European allies in NATO as that partner.\n  If this is the vision, then how do we get there? I like the phrase \n``double enlargement'' to capture the twin processes of reform that I \nbelieve must take place. NATO must enlarge eastward to integrate the \nnew democracies and it must expand its functional missions beyond \nborder defense to include crisis management and perhaps peacekeeping \nbeyond Alliance borders. In both cases, the Alliance must decide how \nfar it wants to go, both in terms of new members and in terms of new \nmissions. There is no escaping the fact that NATO must simultaneously \nreform in both areas if it is to successfully meet the challenges we \nare likely to face in the years ahead. It is a basic American interest \nthat the Alliance not only enlarge to help stabilize Eastern Europe, \nbut that enlargement be part and parcel of a broader transformation \nthat turns Europe into an increasingly effective strategic partner of \nthe United States in and beyond the continent.\n\n\n                   Conditions for Senate Ratification\n\n  One of the key questions for the NATO Alliance is whether NATO \nenlargement can be ratified in the U.S. Senate. Nearly every visitor I \nhave in my office from Europe asks me this question. And it is a \nquestion about which I have thought a great deal in recent years. The \neasy answer is that, of course, enlargement is ratifiable--provided a \nnumber of preconditions are met. I am going to list my six commandments \non what must be done to ensure successful ratification in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  But first I want to lay out several broader factors which I believe \nwill help shape the debate in the U.S. Senate. First, the debate about \nNATO enlargement in the U.S. Senate will not only be about enlargement. \nIt will be about the U.S. role in post-cold-war Europe. It will be \nabout NATO--why we still need it, who should be in it, what it should \ndo, and how it should be reformed.\n  This will be the first time that this set of issues will be debated \nat the national level since the end of the cold war. Although many \nvoices in the United States, myself included, have been calling for \nsuch a national debate for some time, it simply has not happened. But \nthe NATO enlargement issue is likely to be the catalyst for precisely \nsuch a debate. This makes some of my colleagues in Congress nervous. \nThey fear that the isolationists of the left and the right will band \ntogether in some kind of unholy alliance to defeat the internationalist \ncenter in U.S. politics. In short, they fear that the NATO enlargement \ndebate will kill NATO.\n  But I think they are wrong. Such a debate can have a very healthy and \npositive impact in terms of reaffirming the U.S. role in, and \nconsolidating the American commitment to, the new post-cold-war Europe. \nAnd, equally important, it is an opportunity to initiate the broader \ntransformation and revitalization of the alliance which is now clearly \noverdue.\n  Second, this debate will also be about Eastern and Central Europe and \nour moral, political, economic, and strategic stake in this part of the \nworld. Several years ago there was a cartoon in an American magazine \nwhich showed a young boy pointing to a map and saying to his father: \n``Eastern Europe, isn't that where the wars start?'' Eastern Europe is \nwhere two world wars, as well as the cold war, originated in this \ncentury. It is a part of Europe that has seen great injustices and \nenormous cruelty. It is a part of Europe that has had a \ndisproportionate impact on the course of European and world history.\n  For some Americans, these are reasons to keep the United States out \nof future instability and possible conflicts--as if a policy of \nisolation would insulate and protect us from such instability. The \nlesson I draw is exactly the opposite. The best way to ensure that the \nUnited States must never fight a war again over Eastern Europe is to \nanchor and integrate Eastern Europe into the West once and for all. We \nmust do for Eastern Europe what we did together for Western Europe in \nthe early post-war period--make it secure and integrate it into a \nbroader trans-Atlantic community.\n  How important is Eastern Europe to the United States? A growing \nnumber of Europeans are trying to analyze the size of the Polish ethnic \nvote, or the political clout of the Baltic-American community and what \nrole they will play in the United States Senate debate. Will the NATO \nenlargement issue, it is sometimes asked, be the swing issue in key \nbattleground States in the U.S. Presidential race? While interesting, I \nthink all these questions miss the real point. Eastern Europe is \nimportant to the United States because it is here that the future \ndestiny of the European Continent will be decided. Eastern Europe, in \nmany ways, holds the key to the future stability of the continent. That \nis why it is a vital U.S. interest.\n  The third reason I believe that Senate ratification will happen is \nthat the arguments of the opponents of enlargement can be met and \nsubdued. But let's take a closer look at them, for they will be part of \nthe debate. Critics insist, first and foremost, that the U.S. Senate \nwill not be willing to extend a security guarantee to Eastern Europe. \nThey cite the divisive debates we have seen on Somalia, Haiti, and \nBosnia as proof that Americans are tired of foreign commitments.\n  What these critics overlook is the basic difference between Bosnia \nand Poland as well as the lesson we should learn from the Bosnia \nexperience. Poland's future stability is seen as central to that of \nEurope as a whole. Rightly or wrongly, Bosnia's was not. I wish it had \nbeen otherwise. But one\n\n[[Page S6002]]\n\nsimply cannot compare the issue of extending a security guarantee to a \npro-Western democracy like Poland with the confusing debate we had \nabout what to do as Yugoslavia broke up. This was a conflict whose \ncauses were poorly understood, where the stakes for the United States \nwere not always comprehended, where the United Nations was involved \nwith a confusing mandate and a morally ambiguous set of policies and \nwhere the military, political, and humanitarian options of the West \nwere extremely difficult. The lesson from Bosnia is not that we should \nreject NATO enlargement. It is that the West needs to take steps to \nprevent the rise of such destructive nationalism and ethnic hatred and \nwe must enlarge NATO to stabilize Eastern Europe before other disasters \nare imminent.\n  Moreover, in many ways the West already has an implicit security \nguarantee to a country like Poland. Can we really imagine the West \ntoday not coming to Poland's defense if it were ever to be threatened \nagain? I, for one, cannot. And because I cannot, I think that we must \ncodify that commitment through NATO in order to make sure that it is \ncredible and that deterrence works. If ever confronted with the \nquestion of whether the West will stand by Poland or once again betray \nit to those who seek to do it harm, I believe that the United States, \nincluding my colleagues in the Senate, will do the right thing.\n  The second major reason critics cite against enlargement is cost. Of \ncourse NATO enlargement will cost money and resources. But the costs of \nenlargement may not pose as large an obstacle as some assume. Let us \nnot forget that there are also costs in not enlarging. And alliances \nsave money. By pooling our resources together, we are able to \ncollectively defend our common interests less expensively.\n  How much NATO enlargement will cost will depend in large part upon \nhow the alliance decides to defend and reassure new members. Because \nthere is no immediate threat to these countries, the alliance can \nafford to adopt a light defense posture backed up by the ability to \nreinforce in the region during a crisis. Moreover, the costs of \nbuilding such a posture can be spread over an extended period. A recent \nstudy conducted by the Rand Corp. clearly shows that the costs of \nenlargement can be kept manageable and spread across the alliance.\n  The package proposed in the Rand study, for example, could cost an \nestimated $30 to $40 billion for the alliance as a whole--both new and \nold members spread over a 10- to 15-year period. While these numbers \nmay seem large, bear in mind, for example, that the cost of building \nand operating one U.S. Army division for a 10-year period is estimated \nat $60 billion. In any event, the alliance will be spending a \nconsiderable amount of money for defense over the next 10 to 15 years, \nand the costs of enlargement are unlikely to amount to more than 1 to 2 \npercent of planned defense spending. The point here is that enlargement \nis affordable if handled properly, done in a step-by-step fashion and \nif the costs are spread fairly among both old and new members.\n  The third reason critics cite against enlargement is the claim that \nenlargement will only draw new lines in Europe and alienate Moscow. But \nlet us not pretend that lines don't already exist in Europe. What I \nhave never understood about this argument is why these critics are so \nattached to and nostalgic about the old artificial cold war lines, \nlines drawn by the acts of Hitler and Stalin over 50 years ago. \nExpanding and consolidating democracy in the East is not drawing new \nlines. If allowing new democracies in the East to seek entry into the \nalliance of their choice is an exercise in line drawing, it is also an \nexercise in erasing the old artificial lines of Yalta and the cold war. \nAnd I look forward to erasing more lines. There is something odd about \npeople in the West who already enjoy a NATO security guarantee telling \nthose who do not have one that extending the guarantee would somehow \ncreate a new security problem.\n\n  In short, I am not especially impressed by the arguments of the \nopponents of enlargement. Their prescriptions are really a recipe for \ndoing nothing, for postponing all key decisions. We must demand of them \nwhat their future vision of the alliance and the trans-Atlantic \nrelationship is.\n  But this does underscore that we are going to have a debate in the \nSenate.\n  How can we win this debate and ensure successful ratification in the \nU.S. Senate? I'd like to share with you six commandments on NATO \nenlargement which, if followed, should help to ensure ratification.\n  First, show leadership. Leadership is key, above all, Presidential \nleadership. There is no substitute. This will be a national debate and \nthe President must lead. He must also work closely with the leadership \nof the U.S. Senate. The sooner he starts this process, the better.\n  Leadership must not only come from the United States. It must come \nfrom Europe too and Germany in particular. And such leadership must be \nvisible both within NATO and beyond. Let me give you one example. If \nthe European Union falters in terms of its own plans for enlargement, \nit will make NATO enlargement more difficult to sell in the United \nStates because it will be seen by Americans as a European failure to \npull its fair share of the bargain.\n  Second, have a clear moral and political vision and rationale. \nEnlargement must be seen as the right thing to do. While NATO \nbureaucrats and diplomats may be consumed by the details of tactics and \ncompromise communique language, what will be crucial in the public \ndebate will be occupying the moral and political high ground. We will \nask the opponents of enlargement to lay out their alternative vision--\nand we will see whose vision is more convincing.\n  Third, start with the strongest candidates and keep the door open. \nThe enlargement of NATO will start with the strongest candidates for \nmembership. But this does not mean that the alliance is drawing new \nlines or forgetting about those who, for whatever reasons, cannot be \nincluded in the first tranche. Those who are first have an obligation \nto ensure that stability be extended beyond their borders as well.\n  Fourth, know the costs and commitments--and who will bear them--in \nadvance. This must be clear and known in advance. We need to understand \nthe burdensharing arrangements before we assume the new commitments. \nThe U.S. Senate will not ratify enlargement until it knows the costs \nand consequences for both the U.S. Armed Forces and the American \ntaxpayer.\n  Talking about important details of defense planning issues should not \nbe seen as militarizing the debate. Instead, it is simply prudent and \nresponsible to sort out among ourselves just what these new commitments \nmean in practice and to develop plans and programs to ensure that NATO \nhas the capabilities to carry them out. This is what alliances are all \nabout.\n  Fifth, have a strategy for dealing with the have nots. The initial \nselection of members may be small. When another round of enlargement \nwill take place may be uncertain. Thus, the need to have a clear \nstrategy to underscore that enlargement will not produce a new Yalta. \nIn some cases, the United States has a special relationship with \ncountries that, at that moment, seem unlikely to be included in the \nfirst tranche.\n  The United States and Germany have a special responsibility toward \nthe Baltic States. No U.S. President can enlarge NATO without having an \nadequate set of policies to sustain Baltic independence. The Baltic \nStates may not be included in the first round of NATO enlargement. This \nunderscores the need for an active policy of engagement with them. It \nis important that we make it clear that they will be full members if \nthey meet the qualifications; that the door for eventual NATO \nmembership for these countries remains open and that we will expand our \ncooperation with them in the interim period. Non-NATO countries such as \nFinland and Sweden should also be encouraged to expand their \ninvolvement in the region. Countries such as Germany should take the \nlead in trying to bring the Baltic countries into the European Union as \nsoon as possible and, if they qualify, in the first tranche.\n  Sixth, realize the U.S. need for partners beyond Europe. While many \nEuropeans do not want to acknowledge it, the reality is that there is a \nlinkage between burdensharing arrangements within Europe and outside of \nit. As a U.S. Senator, it is easier for me to\n\n[[Page S6003]]\n\nargue the case for NATO's double enlargement to the American people \nthan it is for NATO's eastward enlargement alone. Americans understand \nthat we have vital interests in Europe and they are willing to do their \nshare to ensure that the new Europe which is emerging remains stable. \nThey understand a strategy that posits that we and the Europeans are in \nthis together and that we will work together to defend shared \ninterests--both in Europe and beyond. What they will not understand is \nan arrangement where the United States is asked to do more in terms of \nextending new security guarantees, and more in terms of budgetary \ncommitments, in order to extend stability to Europe's eastern half--and \nat the same time be expected to carry, more or less on its own, the \nresponsibility for defending common Western interests outside of \nEurope.\n\n\n                                 Russia\n\n  This brings us to a discussion of Russia. We all know how important \nRussia's future is for the future of European and international \nsecurity. But where does Russia fit into the vision of the trans-\nAtlantic relationship I have laid out? My vision of the alliance does \nnot depend on the existence or possible emergence of a new Russian \nthreat in the East. We do not want an alliance whose vitality and \nsuccess depends on failure in Russia. Instead, we want a Russia that \nwill successfully reform--and whose success at reform make it a more \ninteresting and useful strategic partner for the alliance.\n  The United States and Europe have an enormous stake in the success of \nthe reform process in Russia. A stable and reformed Russia can be an \nactive partner in maintaining security in Europe, in resolving regional \nconflicts, and in fighting the spread of weapons of mass destruction. \nWe wish to establish a strategic partnership with Russia that takes \naccount of Russia's position in Europe, a partnership that could and \nshould, lead to formalized relationship with the alliance.\n  Russia's place, in my vision, is clear. I do not see Russia as a \ncandidate member of the alliance. Russia is simply too big, too \ndifferent. No member of the alliance today or in the foreseeable future \nwould be willing to extend an article 5 guarantee to the Russo-Chinese \nborder. And the Russians--unlike the East Europeans--are not really \ninterested in assuming the obligations and responsibilities that NATO \nmembership entails. At the same time, Russia will inevitably be more \nthan a mere neighbor of this new and enlarged alliance. We hope it will \nbecome a partner, indeed a country with which we have a privileged \npartnership.\n  The NATO I envision is one which guarantees stability in Central \nEurope, a stability which is just as much in Russia's interest as our \nown. The Russians should realize that enlargement is not directed \nagainst anyone, certainly not against them. Stabilizing democracy in \nEastern Europe does not threaten democracy in Russia. Russia will be \nbetter off with Poland in NATO than outside of NATO. A Poland that is \nsecure within NATO will be less anti-Russian and more interested in \ncooperation and bridge building. We cannot save reform in Russia by \npostponing or retarding reform in Eastern Europe.\n\n  The Alliance can and should have close strategic relations with \nRussia. NATO and Russia are allies in IFOR in Bosnia. We hope that this \nis not a one time affair but the start of a longer and more stable \nrelationship. I hope to see the day when the border between an enlarged \nNATO and its Eastern neighbors, including Russia, are just as stable \nand secure as any others in Europe.\n  But it takes two to tango. Moscow has increasingly spoken out against \nenlargement, with some Russian commentators already bringing out their \nlist of real or imagined countermeasures that they claim Moscow will \nhave to take. Such talk is counterproductive.\n  I belong to those who not only supported NATO enlargement from the \noutset, but who believed that the Alliance should have moved sooner and \nmore resolutely in enlarging. The Clinton administration, as well as \nthe Alliance as a whole, opted for a slower approach than I would have \npreferred. And they did so in the hope that dealing with Moscow on the \nNATO enlargement issue would get easier over time as Russia came to \nunderstand the Alliance's true motivations.\n  But by now I think it is crystal clear that a policy of postponing \nkey decisions has not made our lives easier. Some in Russia have \nmisinterpreted Western patience as a sign of Alliance weakness and lack \nof resolve. Some Russians still believe that they can stop \nenlargement--and some of them are still tempted to try. As it has \nbecome increasingly clear that Russians do not support NATO \nenlargement, our policy increasingly looks to them like a kind of \nChinese water torture. For several years, NATO has issued every couple \nof months a statement saying that it will enlarge, to which Moscow \nfeels obliged to say that it opposes enlargement. When nothing happens, \nsome observers in Moscow think that they have slowed or even stopped \nthe NATO train.\n  It is too late now to go back and undo the policy decisions on \ntiming. What is important now is that NATO not waver, that it stick to \nthe agreed-upon timetable and move ahead with the initial decision on \nenlargement--irrespective of the outcome of the Russian elections.\n\n\n                              Conclusions\n\n  Let me sum up.\n  There are many other factors that could yet shape the U.S. politics \nof NATO enlargement. If democratic reforms in the candidate states were \nto stall, the entire enlargement plan might be put on hold. It also \nmakes some difference whom the next President appoints to key posts \nsuch as Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense. Overall, however, \nwhile ratification of new NATO members faces many obstacles and \npitfalls, there is little evidence for the claim that it is politically \ninfeasible.\n  The real tragedy would be if the Senate, in successfully encouraging \nthe administration through legislation to proceed with the inclusion of \nnew members in the Alliance, jeopardized or neglected the development \nof a bipartisan consensus and public support necessary to secure the 67 \nvotes it will take in the Senate to ratify NATO enlargement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am just going to make a very brief \nstatement to begin this hour. I understand the Presiding Officer would \nlike to comment. So if he will allow me, I will make an opening \nstatement, and then I will relieve him in the Chair so that he might \nmake the remarks he chooses.\n  Mr. President, I have always felt that there should be a relevance, a \nconnection, a linkage between what a public policymaker contends or \ndiscusses in\n\n[[Page S6004]]\n\nthe pursuit of office and what he or she does, if fortunate enough to \nachieve it. I think that much of the cynicism and anxiety that we have \nseen growing in our country can be tracked back to the failure of too \nmany of us who seek public office relating what we said if we sought it \nto what we do if we achieve it.\n  I believe this administration is particularly vulnerable on at least \nthree major subjects. The first one is taxes. This administration came \nto America and said, ``We are going to lower taxes on the middle \nclass.'' That is what was said. But what was done was that they were \nincreased to unprecedented proportions.\n  We talked about and have heard the administration talk about its \ngrave concern over drugs and crime, and drug abuse or drug usage, under \nthis administration's watch, have skyrocketed to epidemic proportions. \nJust last week, there was a perfect example, where the President has \nsaid, ``I am for a balanced budget,'' repeatedly, but stood foursquare \nin front of passage of the balanced budget amendment.\n  So, as I said, Mr. President--and I want to reiterate it here this \nafternoon--it is important that there be a linkage, a connection of \nrelevance between what we say as we pursue public office and what we do \nif we are successful enough to achieve it.\n  Mr. President, I am going to relieve the Chair. I do not think I need \nto call for a quorum call. I will relieve the Chair so that he may make \nhis comments.\n  (Mr. COVERDELL assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to follow up on some of the comments \nthat you were making.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/10/senate-section/article/S6003-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6004-S6009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       A DIFFERENCE IN PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, it is easy to campaign as a champion of the \nmiddle class. As you know, President Clinton did it in 1992, when he \nmade the middle-class tax cut the centerpiece of his campaign. His very \nfirst television commercial that year featured the candidate looking \ndirectly into the camera and telling the voters that they deserve a \nchange. ``That is why I have offered a plan to get the economy moving \nagain, starting with a middle-class tax cut,'' he said.\n  Of course, we all know what happened to that tax cut a year later. \nThe candidate who pinned his campaign to the hopes and dreams of the \nmiddle class became the President who let the middle class down once he \nmoved into the Oval Office. His campaign promise of a tax cut was \ntransformed into a $270 billion tax increase--the largest tax increase \nin American history. It was change, all right--but certainly not the \nkind of change the people had asked for or were promised.\n  Everyone who drives a motor vehicle knows what the President's 4.3-\ncent-per-gallon tax increase has done to their annual gasoline bills--\nespecially recently, with gas prices around the Nation at such high \nlevels. By boosting the cost of gasoline by nearly $5 billion every \nyear, the gas tax has been particularly damaging for truckers, farmers, \nand anyone who lives in rural areas of the country.\n  Senior citizens, even those making as little as $24,000 a year, saw \ntheir taxes rise as well once the President's 1993 tax bill increased \nthe taxable portion of their Social Security benefits by 70 percent.\n  For the more than 80 percent of small business owners who file their \nincome taxes as individuals, President Clinton's 1993 tax increase \nforced them to pay taxes at a rate as high as 44.5 percent. That is \nsignificantly above the corporate rate of 35 percent, and means the \nfolks who run the local plumbing business or TV repair shops are paying \ntaxes at a higher rate than Microsoft or General Motors.\n\n  Families, job providers, retirees, motorists--all of us felt the \npinch when the President signed his 1993 tax bill into law.\n  Since President Clinton's election, the Government is taking more \nfrom the paychecks of middle-class Americans than it ever has before. \nThe administration and the Democrats in Congress who voted for it and \npassed it say, but it was only targeted at the rich. But, today, the \ntypical American family faces a total tax burden of 38 percent. In \nhuman costs, this means we taxpayers are turning more money over to the \nGovernment than we are spending for our family's food, clothing, \nshelter, and transportation combined. Tax freedom day--the day the \nAmerican taxpayers are no longer working just to satisfy Uncle Sam and \ncan begin keeping our dollars for ourselves and our families--has \njumped ahead an entire week since President Clinton took office.\n  The various budget plans the President has submitted to Congress over \nthe last year and a half paint a very different picture of priorities. \nThe priorities for which Bob Dole and our Congressional majority have \nrepeatedly fought have been to protect families from the unreasonable \ndemands of an unregulated Federal Government. The priorities of the \nPresident and the Democratic leadership have always been to protect the \nstatus-quo government, and too often, at the family's expense.\n  In his State of the Union Address in January, President Clinton \nboldly declared that ``the era of big Government is over.'' ``Big \nGovernment'' presumably meant the high taxes that have squeezed the \nmiddle class--the gigantic bureaucracy that has made redtape synonymous \nwith Washington inefficiency, and the wasteful spending that has \ndrained the taxpayers of their precious dollars.\n  But big Government remained alive and well in the budget the \nPresident submitted for fiscal year 1997.\n  That budget was nothing more than the status quo the current \nadministration continues to defend. It did not rein in the big spending \nthat has generated our massive deficit and put our children and \ngrandchildren on the line for decades of our financial mismanagement. \nIt called for $60 billion in tax increases over the next 7 years.\n  And where are the tax cuts the President has repeatedly promised \nAmerican families? He offered nothing but token tax relief. His child \ntax credit began at just $300 per child, was slowly ratcheted up to \n$500, and then eliminated just 2 years later. By the way, teenagers \nwere too old to qualify for that tax break.\n  Under the guidance of President Clinton and the Senate Democratic \nleadership, my colleagues across the aisle attempted to break the 1993 \ntax increase record when the President's budget came before this body \nin May. Had they prevailed, the amendments they offered during debate \nover the budget resolution, combined with the President's own tax \nmandates, would have amounted to another tax increase of $295 billion, \ndwarfing the $270 billion increase of 1993. Fortunately, the gentleman \nfrom Kansas has heard the demands of the American people in calling for \nfiscal restraint and relief from a crushing Federal tax burden, and \nunder his leadership, we stood with the taxpayers in rejecting those \nattempts to further increase taxes on working-class families.\n  If the majority leader's balanced budget plan, with its $245 billion \nin tax relief, had been signed into law instead of stopped with a \nPresidential veto last December, April 15 would have been very \ndifferent for the millions of Americans who dread the annual arrival of \ntax day.\n  Let me describe the tax day that could have been under the Republican \nbalanced budget plan.\n  A family sits down at the kitchen table to tackle their Federal tax \nreturn, but it is not with the sense of foreboding they usually feel \nthis time of year. They have heard that when Congress and the President \nenacted a balanced budget, they created changes in the tax laws that \nare making a dramatic difference for middle-class families like theirs.\n  Because both parents have jobs--let us say one owns their own small \nbusiness and the other works part time at a local hospital--the first \ndecision they have always had to make in the past was whether to file \njointly or as individuals. Back then, filing as a family always came at \na cost because of a glitch in the tax code called the marriage penalty. \nBecause the marriage penalty required joint filers to pay higher taxes \nthan if they had filed separate returns, it seemed as though the \nGovernment was discouraging family life, instead of trying to nurture \nit.\n  But no longer, because they notice immediately under the balanced \nbudget bill that Republicans passed, sent to\n\n[[Page S6005]]\n\nthe President and which he vetoed, they notice that under that plan the \nmarriage penalty has been eliminated, meaning families are no longer \nunfairly penalized through higher taxes.\n  That is the tax day I fought for. That is the tax day every \nRepublican supported.\n  That is hypothetically again under a tax date that could have been.\n  As this family works through the form, they discover several other \nways in which the Federal Government has rewritten the tax code to help \nbring families together and keep them strong.\n  They are the proud parents of three children, the youngest of whom \nthey adopted just last spring. To help defray the enormous costs a \nfamily can incur during the adoption process, the new laws allow them \ntake a tax deduction of up to $5,000 for adoption expenses. By reaching \nout to families willing to make room for a child without a home, this \nnew tax policy makes sense, they decide.\n  To keep their family together, the young couple decided several years \nago to move an elderly parent into their home and care for them there. \nThey count themselves fortunate that they have been able to keep three \ngenerations together under the same roof, but it has stretched the \nfamily budget at times. They are pleased to learn that Congress has \nrecognized this by allowing them to subtract $1,000 from their total \ntax liability to help offset the cost of caring for an older relative.\n  For families, the cost of health insurance and medical care can be \noverwhelming, and the challenges are even greater when they own a farm \nor a business.\n  While most working people receive their insurance through their jobs, \nsmall business owners and farmers usually purchase their own. Our \nmythical taxpayer has been able to deduct 30 percent of the cost of the \nhealth insurance premiums in past years, but they discover today that \nunder the tax bill, the Balanced Budget Act that the Republicans \npassed, sent to the President, but again he vetoed, under that bill, \nthe new tax rules would have allowed them a 50-percent deduction for \nself-employed individuals. It is still not the full 100-percent \ndeductibility that large employers enjoy, but think it is a good start.\n\n  One unanticipated expense that recently came their way was the \npurchase of a new home. That required dipping into an IRA to help \nfinance the downpayment, which used to mean a hefty tax penalty. No \nlonger--families are now allowed to withdraw up to $10,000, penalty \nfree, for first-time home purchases and certain other expenses.\n  And by the way, the student loan that helped finance a college \neducation is no longer the financial drain it used to be, now that the \nFederal Government is allowing taxpayers to deduct up to 20 percent of \nthe interest--as much as $500--every year for 5 years.\n  As they reach the end of the tax form, they discover the best news \nhas been saved for last. After they have calculated their total tax \nliability, they then subtract a $500 tax credit for each of their three \nchildren. That is $1,500 of their own money that Washington is not \ngoing to take, which they can put toward meeting the needs of their \nfamily, not merely feeding the Federal bureaucracy. And best of all, \nthis $500 per-child tax credit comes in addition to the $2,500 tax \nexemption for dependents.\n  They sign their 1040 and seal it away in its envelope, pleased that \nWashington is finally enacting tax policies that are putting families \nfirst.\n  That is the tax day Bob Dole delivered to the American people by \npassing the Balanced Budget Act. Unfortunately, because President \nClinton has an entirely different view of tax day--and proved it with \nhis veto pen--the April 15 I have described is nothing more than the \ntax day that could have been.\n  While this administration went on the offensive against families by \nvetoing the $500 per-child tax credit, elimination of the marriage \npenalty, adoption and eldercare tax credits, and tax incentives \ndesigned to create jobs and boost salaries, Republicans, Bob Dole, and \nNewt Gingrich put this Congress on record as standing squarely \nalongside the working families of America.\n  As long as taxes keep rising, the dollars Americans have left over to \nprovide for their families will keep falling. And so it has been the \nRepublicans' goal--the Dole-Gingrich goal--to help Americans earn more \nmoney and keep more of the money they earn, so they can do more for \nthemselves, their kids, their communities, their churches.\n  I look forward to having a President who will sign legislation which \nhelps the hard-working middle-class taxpaying families of America.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Faircloth pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1853 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Who yields time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, in just a moment I am going to yield up \nto 5 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. President, over the last couple of years--since August 1993 when \nwe got the largest tax increase in American history--instead of the tax \nreduction that had been promised--the figure of about $250 billion has \nbeen used over and over, and we need to put that figure in context--the \nactual tax increase from 1994 to the year 2002, or the 7 years that we \nall talk about, is $500 billion--$500 billion in new taxes from this \nadministration, half a trillion dollars; that instead of the tax relief \nthat was promised. And that is why I say there should be a relevance \nbetween what one says as he seeks office and what he does if he is \nfortunate enough to achieve it.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield up to 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think there is nothing more important as \nwe look toward an election, as we look toward closing this session of \nthe Congress, as voters and citizens, than examining some of the things \nthat are really important in making these decisions.\n  I think I must tell you I have been distressed, somewhat, over the \nlast couple of years about this tremendous communication system we have \nwhere, for the first time ever, whatever happens in the world, you just \ninstantly know about it. I compare that to what it must have been like \n100 years ago. In my State of Wyoming, people did not know what in the \nworld happened in Washington. They probably did not care very much, but \nthey did not know for a very long time. Now we know and we have the \ngreatest communications system, but I have to say I think we have \ndeveloped this sort of spin process to where it is very difficult for \nus to know what the facts are so we can make decisions. That is really \nwhat this whole thing is about. That is what this Congress is about, \nwhat this Senate is about, is making choices, hard choices.\n  I guess, again, I reflect on elections where--obviously, you are not \nable to talk with candidates about 800 different issues which will be \ntalked about during the course of a year here. So, instead, you have to \nsort of talk about philosophy and talk about where you stand and talk \nabout the values that you have that you measure the issues against so \nthe people that you talk to can say, ``Yes, I understand. I understand \nthat set of issues. So when I measure against that, I have a pretty \ngood hunch as to how those decisions will be made.''\n  Never have we had, I do not think, as clear a set of choices as we \nhave had this year and will have in the coming year. I certainly \nrespect that there are different philosophies and different points of \nview. We get up here and argue, often, the merits of the issues, which \nis valid, but when you really get down to it, what we are really \ntalking about is the difference in philosophies.\n  A balanced budget is probably the most significant item we have \ntalked about this year, the most significant item that has been brought \nbefore all of us as citizens: Whether we are going to be responsible \nfor the spending, whether we are going to be morally responsible to pay \nfor it as we use it, whether we are going to be fiscally responsible, \nto not spend more than we\n\n[[Page S6006]]\n\ntake in. Everyone says that is a great idea, but not everyone agrees \nwith doing something about it. That is the choice you have. We have \neveryone saying, yes; we want to balance the budget. But then we have a \nvote and we do not have enough to get a constitutional amendment to do \nit.\n  So I think we have some real choices. We have to decide for ourselves \nwhat it is that we think is important.\n  Regulatory relief--I do not think anyone would reject the notion or \nresist the idea that we are overregulated. Overregulation is difficult \nfor the economy, it causes fewer jobs, it causes less prosperity. We \ncan change it. Everyone is for it, except when you get to it, and then \nthey do not do it.\n  Welfare reform--we all talk about welfare reform. Is there anybody \nwho says, ``Oh, no, we do not he need to change welfare, it is \nperfect''? Of course not. Do we get it done? No; we sent it to the \nPresident, and he vetoed it. This is the same President who campaigned \non welfare reform.\n\n  So, these are the kinds of choices we have to make all the time. It \nseems to me it has become increasingly important that there is some \ncredibility to where you stand, philosophically, on issues. Should we \nhave less Federal Government or more? That is pretty basic, pretty \nbasic stuff. When you talk about many of these issues, that is really \nthe core issue. Should we do it here? Does it need to be done? Could it \nbe done better? Could we, in fact, shift it to the States, closer to \npeople, where it can better be done? That is a good issue. Less \ngovernment or more? More regulation or less?\n  There are even some more basic issues, I think. They have to do with \npersonal responsibility. They have to do with whether or not you really \nbelieve--and I really believe, I do believe --that we are responsible \nfor our own actions. My wife happens to be a high school teacher. She \nprobably says more often than anything else, ``You are responsible for \nyour own behavior. You are responsible for your own actions.'' If that \nis good enough for kids, it is good enough for us, too. That is how you \nbuild a strong freedom, a democracy, is people being responsible for \ntheir own actions.\n  But when you take a look at some of the issues we find ourselves \nsaying, discretely, ``Well, no, the Government really ought to be \nresponsible for that. After all, there are a lot of things I am really \nnot responsible for, so somebody else must be.'' That is pretty basic \nstuff.\n  Bob Dole will be here for the last time tomorrow. I cannot help but \nthink here is a man who has served his country for so long and has \nconsistently been for the things that he said he was for, voted for \nthem and supported them. He is not someone who has said, ``Yes, I think \nI am for that,'' and then shortly after, ``Well, I am not sure, I am \nreally for something else. Yes, I am for it, but I am not going to vote \nfor it, not that.'' Bob Dole has been consistent in what he is for.\n  Responsible spending--throughout his career he has been for less \ngovernment rather than more. He has been on the side of moving more and \nmore government back to the States and local government, closer to \npeople, so people can participate. He has been for self-responsibility, \nfor sacrificing for his country. These are the things that--as I said, \nI think we had 800 votes or something last year on all these issues. \nBut when you peel it all away, there is some pretty basic, fundamental \nstuff people either believe in or they do not.\n  There is another legitimate point of view--more government. A lot of \npeople think the Government does a better job of spending money, that \nthe way to balance the budget is to raise taxes, not to decrease \nspending. That is a legitimate point of view. I do not happen to share \nit, but it is a legitimate point of view.\n  I guess what I am really saying is, we are going to have another \nopportunity, our biennial opportunity, as citizens, to evaluate where \nwe think we should go, in your Government--in our Government; what you \nthink are the fundamental pillars of defending democracy and freedom.\n  I have had a couple of chances the last couple of years to go some \nother places. Frankly, I come back feeling more strongly about the \nelements of democracy and freedom and self-government than I ever did \nbefore. So we have that opportunity now. We will be measuring all of \nour candidates and all of our issues based on what we think is right \nand who we think will follow what they said they were going to do, \nwhere the credibility lies; people upon whom you can depend to stay \nwith what they say. Mr. President, it seems to me that is kind of the \nreal, old-fashioned, fundamental issue of this country. I am excited we \nare getting onto it.\n\n  I appreciate my friend from Georgia having this conversation about \nwhere we are going, his conversation of credibility, of being able to \nrely on what we say we are going to do, and do it. We have set about to \ndo that this year. I am pretty proud about what we tried to do. I am \nsorry we have not come to closure on more things, but we have changed \nthe total debate here.\n  Two years ago, no one was talking about balancing the budget. Now it \nis not a question of whether we are going to do it, it is a question of \nhow we are going to do it. And that has been because I think we \nbrought, from the last election, many of us, a message that said: \n``Look, we expect you to make some changes. You say you are going to \nhave less Government, it is going to cost less and have less \nregulation. Do it.'' That is what we are seeking to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I know the Presiding Officer would like \nto make some comments. In a moment, I will replace you so you can do \nthat.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Wyoming, once again, for the \nexcellent presentation he makes over and over on the Senate floor.\n  Just a moment ago, I mentioned this $500 billion tax increase that \noccurred in August 1993. The point I am making, Mr. President, is in \n1992, the President said this:\n\n       I've offered a plan to get the economy moving again, \n     starting with a middle-class tax cut.\n\n  ``Starting with a middle-class tax cut.'' Within 8 months, it became \nthe largest tax increase in American history on the middle class. An \naverage family in my State is paying $2,600 more in taxes and economic \nburden as a result of the actions and policies of an administration \nthat promised just the reverse. With that, I will be glad to relieve \nthe Chair.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from Georgia for his courtesy and \nhis support and his leadership in putting together this afternoon's \nobjectives.\n  As I understand it, we are talking this afternoon about the \ncrossroads that America finds itself at in this quadrennial year, 1996. \nIt is leap year; it is the year for the Olympics; and it is the year \nAmericans decide who gets to stay in the White House until the next \nleap year and the next Olympics.\n  As I look back on 1992, the last time we had one of these elections--\nI have a very clear memory, because 1992 was the year that I ran for \nthe Senate. It was a very interesting year. President Clinton was then \nGovernor Clinton, and he was attacking an incumbent President. \nUltimately, the Clinton message in 1992 came down to a single word. The \nword was ``change.'' President Clinton was campaigning in favor of \nchange and was calling upon Americans to vote resoundingly for change. \nI had a very strong reaction to that, because ultimately my campaign \nfor the Senate came down to a single word, and that word was \n``change.'' I campaigned for change.\n  I got here and met the other freshman Senators in that group and \nfound that virtually every one of them, regardless of party, had \ncampaigned for change. I remember one of my colleagues on the \nDemocratic side saying that she received a phone call some 3 weeks \nafter the election and the voter said: ``I voted for change. Where is \nit?''\n  She said: ``I haven't even taken office yet.''\n  The caller said: ``Well, you promised me change, and you haven't \nproduced, and I'm impatient.''\n  What kind of a change did President Clinton give us once he did take \noffice and take the oath of office? It was very interesting here as a \nMember of this body to see what happened. He became, if you will, co-\nopted by the Democratic leadership in this House and in the other one.\n\n[[Page S6007]]\n\n  Senator Mitchell said, ``You don't need to talk about reducing the \nsize of the congressional staff, we already did that.''\n  ``Oh,'' said President Clinton, ``I didn't know that, so we'll allow \nspending as usual to go on in the Congress.''\n  ``Well, what about changing the Tax Code?''\n  ``Oh, you don't need to do that,'' said Senator Mitchell and Speaker \nFoley, ``we've already taken care of the Tax Code. As a matter of fact, \nwhat changes you do need in the Tax Code should be on the upside rather \nthan the downside.''\n\n  ``Oh,'' said President Clinton. ``Well, as long as you tell me that's \nwhat it ought to be, I will do it.''\n  I remember the first major battle we had in this Chamber on the issue \nof change. The President proposed an emergency appropriations bill. \nNow, Mr. President, what does it mean when you say ``an emergency \nappropriations bill''? I had to ask that question. I was new; I didn't \nunderstand. They explained it to me. If you have an emergency \nappropriations bill, that means it does not have to fall under the \nrestrictions of the reconciliation bill or the budget bill. That means \nit goes directly into the deficit without stopping any way through. We \nhad a $19 billion emergency appropriations bill on this floor that we \nhad to have to meet all the emergencies.\n  What were the emergencies? Well, there was a warming hut that needed \nto be built by a skating rink somewhere in New England. Great \nemergency. Somehow they had gotten by skating on that pond or that \nlocal rink for a long time, but now there was an emergency; we had to \nhave that warming hut. We had to have a whole series of things that \nwere in that genre, and Bob Dole from this desk stood up and said, \n``No.''\n  I realized, from that desk way over there, as a very new freshman, \nthat what we were seeing was not change; it was business as usual. \nPromise one thing, then when you get to the Congress, when you get in \noffice, cloak everything you do in confusing terms, call this an \nemergency; but basically pork-barrel spending for the President's \npolitical base in the same pattern as it had always been.\n  What we were seeing was an attempt at business as usual and from \nSenator Dole an attempt to stop business as usual and produce change in \nthe way things were done. From this very desk where I stand today, Bob \nDole organized the Republicans in this Chamber who stood together in \ndefiance of business as usual and brought about the first demonstration \nof real change in the way business is done when, by use of the \nfilibuster, they stopped the President's stimulus package and insisted \nthat those spending items had to be put in the budget.\n  I remember, Mr. President, we wore buttons that said, ``Just pay for \nit.'' Do not let it go directly to the deficit and borrow money. Find a \nplace where you would pay for it with some kind of spending cuts \nsomeplace else for these emergencies.\n  When it finally happened, the Presiding Officer remembers, we ended \nup passing that portion of that appropriations bill that was really \nneeded, but somehow the rest of it disappeared and the Republic \nsurvived. The emergency passed and no dire consequences occurred.\n  I must confess, I do not know if the warming hut on the skating rink \never got built. I rather suspect that it did, if the local community \nthat wanted it wanted it badly enough. But somehow we saw the beginning \nof real change by virtue of Bob Dole's leadership standing up to \npolitical business as usual in that circumstance, and that went on all \nthrough the 103d Congress, until in the election of 1994, the American \npeople said, ``We want change,'' even more loudly than they said it in \n1992. Only this time the President got the message in a different \nfashion. Not one single incumbent of the party opposing the President \nwas defeated in that election. Not one. That is an extraordinary \nhistorical fact. This has never happened before, that I know of, in \nAmerican history.\n  The Republicans took control of both Houses of Congress and the \nPresident suddenly got very, very nervous on the issue of \nchange, because the Republicans were determined to produce change, the \nchange that President Clinton promised before he slipped into the \ncontrol, if you will, of the Democratic leadership of the Congress, and \nblame the advocate of business as usual.\n\n  As I say, we are coming up to another election. I was at a dinner \nparty a month or so ago where a number of people were talking politics. \nIt is hard to go to a dinner party in this town where people do not \ntalk politics. The host said, ``I want to pose a couple questions.'' He \nsaid, ``If Bill Clinton is reelected, what will he do in his second \nterm?'' or, conversely, ``If Bob Dole is elected, what will he do in \nhis first term?\"\n  Interesting. No one at the party had the slightest idea what the \nanswer to the first question was. Nobody knew what Bill Clinton will do \nin his second term. Will he revive health care as a major issue? No one \nknew. Will he try to restructure the Tax Code, either raising or \nlowering? Nobody knew. What will he do about balancing the budget? \nNobody had the slightest idea.\n  Then someone said, ``Well, what would Bob Dole do if he got \nelected?'' ``Oh, he'll work on restructuring the Tax Code. He'll work \ntoward a balanced budget.'' He will do a whole list of things. I said, \n``Wait a minute. Bob Dole is supposed to be the candidate with no \nvision. Bill Clinton is supposed to be the candidate that has a clear \nidea where he wants to take the country. Why can't any of you tell me \nwhat Bill Clinton will do in his second term, but you all can give me \nanswers to what Bob Dole would do in his first term?\"\n  We all looked at each other as if we made a great discovery, that \nBill Clinton talks about this and he talks about that, and he gives \nspeeches saying we have to reform welfare, and he says the Republicans \nare right on a whole bunch of issues, and he seems to be co-opting all \nof the Republicans' positions, but he never really makes it clear what \nhe intends to do if he gets elected.\n  In the language of the business world, he is keeping his options \nopen. In other words, he is keeping himself in a circumstance where he \ncan go wherever he wants if he gets elected without ever tipping his \nhand as to what his intentions really are.\n  Mr. President, let me tell you what I think his intentions really \nare. I have tried to examine the entrails of this particular owl and \nsee if I can read them and come up with a prediction of the future. So \nlet me take a stab at it.\n  I believe Bill Clinton does have a clear idea of where he wants to \ntake America. I go back to the 1992 campaign when he was asked for his \nvision and he said, ``I am concerned about the security of every \nAmerican, the security of their job, the security of their income. I \nwant an America that will make everyone secure.''\n  Have we heard this before? Yes, Mr. President. This sounds like the \nrhetoric of most European politicians. I believe Bill Clinton wants to \nmake the United States a modern European industrial state. Let us pick \none as an example. I do not know whether he has this one in mind.\n  Germany is a modern industrial European state. I think it is no \naccident that the first priority that President Clinton had was to give \nAmerica a health care system modeled on the German model. What happens \nin a modern European industrialized state? Well, there is a lot of \nsecurity. If you lose your job in Germany, the Government steps in and \nyou can live for a long time on the kinds of payments the Government \nwill give you.\n\n  Indeed, unemployment in Europe is twice as high as it is in the \nUnited States and four and five times as long. If you lose your job in \nthe United States, statistically you are likely to find a new one in 6 \nmonths. The majority of people who are unemployed find a job within 6 \nmonths or less in the United States. Something like 60, 70 percent of \nthe people who are unemployed in Europe stay unemployed for 4 and 5 \nyears.\n  This is the kind of country we would have if we were a modern \nEuropean industrialized state: Unemployment twice what it is in the \nUnited States today, a tax burden of higher income taxes, higher \npayroll taxes, and consumption taxes, to boot, that would be close to \nsomething like a 14 percent national sales tax--that is the value-added \ntax level in Europe, different maybe in different countries, but \nbasically around 14 percent--a much higher\n\n[[Page S6008]]\n\ndeficit, and a much higher national debt in proportion to the size of \nour economy.\n  As concerned as we are about our national debt, our national debt is \nthe lowest of all of the industrialized countries in the world. \nPresident Clinton would like to take us in that direction. I sit on the \nJoint Economic Committee. President Clinton's principal economic \nadviser, Dr. Laura Tyson, testified before the committee after the \nClinton administration took power.\n  She said to us on that committee--I still remember it very clearly--\nshe said, ``Compared to the other industrialized nations of this world, \nthe United States is seriously undertaxed,'' and then implied this \nadministration is going to fix that.\n  No. I think we know the direction in which President Clinton would go \nin a second term. It is the direction toward turning the United States \ninto a North American version of Germany or France or Sweden, just as \nthose countries are desperately trying to get out from under the kind \nof governmental control that has grown up there since the Second World \nWar and are grasping to become more like the United States.\n  There is an alternative, of course, in November. That is the \ncandidate for whom, in my belief, the principal interest is not \nsecurity, but opportunity, an opportunity for a good job, an \nopportunity for a good education, an opportunity to contribute, to \nbuild, to save, to create circumstances for one's family that can make \nthose circumstances better.\n  Opportunity is a little scarier than security. But throughout \nhistory, opportunity pays better. Countries that are built on \nopportunity do a whole lot better than countries that focus entirely on \nsecurity.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for giving us \nthis opportunity to talk about the differences that are going to be \nstarkly portrayed between now and November.\n  As I get ready for the November election, I am going to go back to \n1992 in my old play book and pull out the word ``change'' that worked \nso well in 1992 for all of us, and recognize that in 1996 Bob Dole will \nbe the candidate of change and Bill Clinton will be the candidate of \nthe status quo. Bob Dole will be the one who wants to take the Tax Code \nand turn it into an engine of opportunity. Bill Clinton will be \ndefending the Tax Code and saying, it is just fine except it needs to \nbe a little higher here or there.\n  Bob Dole will be the one who is saying we must change welfare so \nthese people have an opportunity to get off of it. Bill Clinton is the \none who will be saying, no, let us hang on to the basic principles of \nthe status quo and across the board.\n\n  In 1992, the American people said, ``We want change.'' They got \nbusiness as usual. In 1994, the American people even said more loudly, \n``We want change.'' Unfortunately, they have gotten gridlock because \nthe White House has not gone along with the change that came by virtue \nof the Congress.\n  In 1996, the American people will have one more opportunity to say, \n``We want change,'' and this time achieve it if they give Bob Dole the \nopportunity to carry out that which he has told us he will do instead \nof voting to keep the status quo.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. BENNETT assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Utah. The Senator brings a very interesting perspective when he \npoints to trying to determine what the administration's plan would be \nin that second term. When you alluded to the industrialized societies \nof Europe, I was particularly taken with the comment about \nunemployment, I think running around 12 percent, in Germany today. What \nwas once an enormous competitive force, and we have all thought of as a \ncompetitive force, is now struggling with the burdens of a government \nthat ensnares every facet of life for the people of Germany.\n\n  I yield up to 10 minutes to the good Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                 the void in moral leadership--part xi\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we now have the classic example of \nduplicity in budgeting. It's the first clear example of budgetary \nduplicity since the infamous magic asterisk made famous by David \nStockman. This time, it is by the President himself.\n  The example is revealed courtesy of my colleague from Missouri, \nSenator Bond. He has laid out a compelling case that shows when the \nWhite House speaks about its budget, it speaks with two voices. One \nvoice emanates from the left side, the other from the right side. Not \nsurprisingly, this is so the President can have it both ways. They can \nhave their cake and eat it too.\n  The consequence of this duplicity is continued public cynicism. These \ndays, that's a cardinal sin of any political leader. it undermines the \nconfidence of our citizenry in its political leaders and in our system \nof government.\n  Those watching from their homes, Mr. President, often get confused by \nour arcane budget process and terminology. So I want to explain this \nduplicity in normal, everyday language.\n  As a big taxer and big spender, the President's political strategy is \nto spend money to make all his special interests happy. He already \npassed the largest tax increase in the history of the country back in \n1993. Now, he wants to use those revenues to spend more just before \nhe's reelected.\n  The problem is, his budget would deficit-spend forever. It would \nnever be in balance.\n  More than 80 percent of the American people want a balanced budget. \nRepublicans criticized the President for not having a balanced budget. \nThe criticism worked. It was scoring points with the public. That's \nbecause they support a balanced budget overwhelmingly.\n  The President was on the political run. So he had a decision to make. \nHe still wanted to spend all the money necessary to make his special \ninterests happy. But he also wanted the public to think he had a \nbalanced budget. That way, he could put a stop to all the criticism \nabout not having a balanced budget. And, he would also not offend his \npolitical supporters. In other words, he could have his cake and eat it \ntoo.\n  There's only one problem with this. To pull that off, the President \nwould either have to make tough choices, or he'd have to use some \nsleight-of-hand. Sleight-of-hand won out.\n  And so, the President presented his budget to Congress and the \npublic. In doing so, he presented two budgets. One was $67 billion more \nexpensive than the other.\n  Depending on who he was talking to, he would reference one budget or \nthe other. For instance: If he was talking to critics who said his \nbudget didn't balance, he'd point to the one that's $67 billion \ncheaper. If he was talking to his special interest friends whom he \ndidn't want to offend, he'd point to the one that had $67 billion more \nin it.\n  That way, the President hoped to satisfy everyone, and offend no one.\n  There's evidence of this.\n  Senator Bond received testimony from their different heads of \nagencies that confirm the budgetary shell game. EPA Director Carol \nBrowner, HHS Secretary Donna Shalala, and NASA Administrator Dan Goldin \neach suggested that the White House told them not to worry about future \nbudget cuts in their agencies that would occur under the balanced \nbudget version.\n  In other words, the White House fully intends to honor the more \nexpensive budget, rather than the balanced budget. But the President \ndoesn't want to say that before the election so he can't be criticized \nfor having a bloated budget.\n  What this shell game shows is a White House that plays fast and loose \nwith honesty. It is duplicitous. It's saying one thing out of one side \nof the mouth, and another out the other side. In the final analysis, \nthe President intends to abandon a balanced budget, should he survive \nhis effort for a second term.\n  There's an even more serious and destructive game the White House is \nplaying in its budget. The issue is the veterans' budget. The Secretary \nof Veterans Affairs is the Honorable Jesse Brown. Mr. Brown confirmed \nthis before Senator Bond's subcommittee.\n  He confirmed that, even though the President's budget would decimate \nveterans, the President has assured him he will renegotiate the \nveterans' budget every year. In other words, veterans funding, too--\njust like all the others--\n\n[[Page S6009]]\n\nwill also go up, allegedly. That would put even more pressure against a \nbalanced budget.\n  The problem with this example, Mr. President, it's more than simply a \nshell game. It's a total disavowal of the President's veterans budget, \nby the President's own people. Worse, by the President himself. It's an \nofficial budget that's not official. And that, Mr. President, is a \nmatter of budget integrity. And this budget lacks integrity.\n  The budget of the United States represents the official statement of \npolicy of a President. If that is true this President's statement of \npolicy is one of duplicity. And it lacks credibility and integrity.\n  And that, Mr. President, is the mark of a failed leader. A leader who \nundercuts his own moral authority to lead the Nation. You cannot be a \nleader if your policies reflect duplicity, a lack of credibility, and a \nlack of integrity.\n  This is the 11th in a series of talks, Mr. President, that I have \nshared with my colleagues on my observations about the President's \nfailure to lead by example. His failure of moral leadership.\n  If our leaders continue to lead this way, public cynicism--already at \ndangerous levels--will reach critical mass. We cannot continue to serve \nthe people of our country in this way.\n  Republicans have tried to lead by example. We put our money where our \nmouths were. We passed congressional accountability, putting Members of \nCongress under the same laws as we passed for the rest of the country. \nWe passed a balanced budget last year. And, we'll pass another one \nlater this week.\n  But the President will veto a balanced budget again, without an \nhonest alternative of his own. This is failed leadership of the worst \nkind, Mr. President.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I commend Senator Bond for his outstanding \ndetective work in surfacing this budget duplicity on behalf of the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I believe we have gone past the \nallotted time by several minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we be allowed up to 15 more minutes to \nconclude our remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I commend all the Senators who have \ncome to the floor and discussed the general premise that there should \nbe a relationship between what officeholders say during the course of \nseeking the office and what they do once they achieve it.\n  We talked about the fact that the administration talked about a tax \nreduction to the middle class and then raised taxes on them up to $500 \nbillion. We have talked about this budget duplicity, which we just \nheard about here today. We talked about the issue of being for a \nbalanced budget, but then coming foursquare against the balanced \nbudget, an amendment to the Constitution that would do nothing more \nthan allow the issue to go to the several States. Yet, there was fear \neven of letting that go to the people.\n  I am going to mention one other, as we close out, because the \nadministration has talked frequently about its concern over crime in \nour country. By anyone's observation today, you cannot separate crime \nfrom drugs. And if there is one thing laying at the foot of this \nadministration, it is the fact that they altered dramatically the drug \npolicies that governed from 1980 to 1992--that 12-year period that saw \nmassive reduction in the use of drugs at all levels.\n  Between 1979--to give some examples, Mr. President--and 1992, drug \nuse was cut in half in America. There is no way we will ever know the \nmillions of families--sisters, brothers, friends, next-door neighbors--\nthat were saved from tragic consequences because of policies that \ndiscouraged the use of drugs.\n  Under this administration, marijuana use among young people has \nincreased an average of 50 percent across all age groups. Teenage drug \nuse has risen every year under this administration. In 1992, at the \nbeginning of the administration, 2.4 million of our youth used drugs. \nToday, the figure is 3.8 million--up 58 percent. This, Mr. President, \nis an epidemic.\n  Use of marijuana, ages 14 to 15, is up 200 percent since 1992. \nMarijuana use among eighth graders was 3.7 percent in 1992. Today, it \nis 7.8 percent--a 110-percent increase.\n  Hallucinogens, LSD and PCP, were at 5.8 percent up to 1992, and now \nit is 9.3 percent--up 60 percent.\n  There were 146 people in the office of the drug czar when the \nPresident took office. He took it down to 25 people and has only \nrecently discussed increasing it--I am sure as a result of these \nepidemic numbers that I am describing to you here today.\n  The list goes on and on. But what has resulted, Mr. President, is \nthat the combination of changing the policies, moving away from \ninterdiction--those budgets went down--and moving away from law \nenforcement, emphasizing rehabilitation, I would have never believed, \nMr. President, that those changes in policy could have such a massive \nand rapid response. Remember, we had a Surgeon General that was \nsuggesting, early in this administration, that it was OK to legalize \ndrugs.\n  The fact that these drug policies changed was de-emphasized, and the \nWhite House never talked any more about drugs. Some made fun of Nancy \nReagan's ``Just Say No,'' but we can use a little bit more of that now. \nWhat happened was our youth, very quickly, began to believe that drugs \nwere no longer a problem.\n\n  The result has been that, thinking it is no longer a problem, they \nare more willing to experiment with drug use. The result of that is \nthat we have recreated a drug epidemic in our country of immense \nproportions, and there are millions of families that are going to \nsuffer the consequences because we have not put up the fight. Whether \nit is a sister, a brother, a neighbor, someone in our town, someone \nacross the hall in the workplace, we have created millions of \ncasualties in America.\n  The administration is talking more about drugs, but it is still not \ngetting the job done. President Clinton requests 19.4 percent less \nfunding for prevention in 1997 than he requested in 1996. So we still \nhave a pattern that is ignoring this crisis.\n  Now, this crisis reverberates through our hemisphere. Our fellow \ncountries in the hemisphere are now coming under a deluge from the drug \ncartel. President Zedillo of Mexico said that there is no greater \nthreat to his Republic than the drug cartel.\n  This is a massive crisis that must be confronted very quickly in the \nbalance of this decade as we move to the new century, if we are going \nto save millions of American casualties, from crack babies to drug use. \nThis is the first time in my life that we have actually witnessed a war \nthat is directed at kids--people 8 to 12 years old.\n  The last drug crisis focused principally on people who were 16, 17, \n18, 19, and 20 and now it has moved down to 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, and \nthis ought to command the attention of every policymaker--a mayor, a \nGovernor, a county commissioner, and, yes, the President of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I am about to yield the floor. I want to reiterate \nwhat I said when we began--that there should be a relationship between \nwhat policymakers say to our citizens and what they do. You ought not \nto promise tax relief and then raise taxes. You ought not say you are \nfor a balanced budget and then fight it at every turn. You ought not to \nsay that you are fighting to win this drug war and then turn a lot of \nit off, because that creates cynicism in our country. It really does. \nIt makes people sit back and wonder about their Government. In every \nway that we can we ought to stress that relationship between what we \nrun for and what we stand for and what we do. There should not be a \ngreat distance in the rhetoric and the deed. As near as possible they \nshould match. We have emphasized here this afternoon that in all too \nmany cases in the last 36 months they have not.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/10/senate-section/article/S6004-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6009-S6010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATOR BOB DOLE\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Herbert Clark Hoover was the first U.S. President to be born \nwest of the Mississippi River.\n  President Hoover's home until he was 11 years old was in West Branch, \nIA. And the Hoover Presidential Library in West Branch is the place \nwhere he returned upon his death in 1964. Born into a Quaker family in \n1874, he was raised in the Quaker tradition by his parents until their \nuntimely deaths. Then, he was raised by other family members. During \nhis formative years, he was taught the principles of honesty, hard \nwork, simplicity, and generosity.\n  Herbert Hoover's life was one of great undertakings. An accomplished \nand successful engineer, he put his organizational skills to work \nduring the First World War. In England at the outbreak of the war he \nhelped, often with his own money, to get his fellow Americans back \nhome. When Belgium was invaded and the Belgian people were in need of \nfood, Herbert Hoover responded. He instituted food relief efforts as \nthe head of the Belgian Relief Campaign. He organized the acquisition, \ndelivery, and distribution of tens of thousands of tons of food. \nThousands were saved from a horrible death by starvation. Herbert Clark \nHoover proved himself to be one of the great humanitarians of the \nworld.\n  President Woodrow Wilson subsequently appointed Herbert Hoover as \nFood Administrator of the United States. From this position he oversaw \nthe Government's food conservation program for the duration of the war.\n  During the terms of Presidents Harding and Coolidge, Hoover served as \nthe Secretary of Commerce. Then in the election of 1928, the people of \nthis great country honored him by electing him their 31st President. It \nis important to note that during his public service, Herbert Clark \nHoover did not accept a salary from the people. His reward was in his \nservice to his fellow Americans. I wonder how many of us today are \nprepared to do the same.\n  Honesty, hard work, simplicity, and generosity--the principles that \nHerbert Hoover learned as a boy and practiced all of his adult life. \nThese are principles which all of us try to teach our children. Once \nlearned and once practiced, they can change the world.\n  Lou Henry Hoover, a Waterloo, IA native, was active alongside her \nhusband. She was the first Iowan to be First Lady. Such a splendid \ncouple they made together.\n  Lou Hoover received eight honorary degrees in recognition of her \npublic service. Twice she was president of the Girl Scouts of America. \nWhile in that position, she began the Girl Scouts cookie sales program, \nwhich has become an American tradition.\n  Lou also promoted women's athletics, helping to found the National \nAmateur Athletic Federation. She served as president of the Women's \nDivision from 1922 to 1940.\n  Significantly, in 1929, First Lady Lou Henry Hoover broke the White \nHouse racial barrier by entertaining the wife of Oscar DePriest, a \nblack Congressman from Chicago.\n  Many Americans are cynical of those of us in public life today. They \nthink of us as being self-serving. This is unfortunate. This is not \nhealthy for our country. Perhaps if we look closely at the lives of men \nand women like Herbert and Lou Hoover and try to follow more closely in \ntheir footsteps of humanitarianism, dedication to public service, and \nthe spirit of giving freely of themselves, we could begin to regain \nmore of the public's trust.\n  Iowans proudly gave up the Hoovers to the world. And when the Hoovers \ngave up this world, Iowans were deeply honored that they chose to \nreturn home to Iowa. Herbert and Lou Hoover--great humanitarians of the \nworld--exemplify the Iowa spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/10/senate-section/article/S6010-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to pay tribute \nto the American Legion Auxiliary Unit No. 230 in Aurora, SD, for their \nactions to encourage democracy. The Pike-Huska Unit provided a forum \nfor voters to meet the candidates for city council and learn more about \neach candidate's individual platform. As this election year evolves, we \nare reminded by the Pike-Huska American Legion Auxiliary of the \nimportance of voter education and participation. I believe citizens \nshould closely follow the voting records of their elected officials and \nkeep up on current events. An informed electorate is central to \nmaintaining a truly representative democracy. It is no wonder South \nDakotans historically have one of the highest voter participation rates \nin the Nation--South Dakotans are active believers in democracy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the information sent to me by the \norganization's secretary, Margaret Allstot, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                   Aurora, SD,\n\n                                                   March 27, 1996.\n     Hon.

We had printed flyers notifying both \n     the candidates and the residents of the community of this \n     event. We asked the local Boy Scout Troop to hand distribute \n     the flyers which they did. We asked local residents to be \n     moderator and time-keeper for our forum. We also contacted \n     the local radio station and newspaper to publicise this \n     event. We served coffee and cookies at the end of the forum.\n       The forum was well attended and issues brought forth and \n     discussed along with meeting the candidates, some of whom \n     were not well known. We felt we had offered a worthwhile \n     project for our Auxiliary Unit, for both Americanism and for \n     Community Service.\n       I am proud to be a part of an organization who recognizes \n     as its responsibility of helping citizens to be better \n     informed to use their privilege of freedom of voting.

Mr. President, I would like to just make reference to a \nstatement about D-day, which I should have made a few days ago. I want \nto at least have it in the Record before I leave.\n  Mr. President, 52 years ago on June 6, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower made \nthis dramatic announcement from London:\n\n       People of Western Europe: A landing was made this morning \n     on the coast of France by troops of the allied expeditionary \n     force . . . the hour of your liberation is approaching.\n\n  As Eisenhower made that announcement, 130,000 American and Allied \ntroops under his command, stormed onto the beaches along the coast of \nNormandy, France.\n  On that same day--June 6, 1944--another 23,000 British and American \nairborne forces were parachuted or taken by glider to secure critical \ninland areas.\n  The courage and dedication exhibited by these soldiers on that day \nand in the weeks that followed led to the liberation of Europe and the \ndefeat of fascism.\n  As we mark the 52d anniversary of D-day, we must also look to the \nfuture, and remember the lessons that World War II taught us--and holds \nfor us still.\n  We learned that we cannot turn our backs on what happens in the rest \nof the world.\n  We learned that we can never again allow our military to reach low \nlevels of readiness and supplies.\n  We learned that we cannot appease tyrants and despots.\n  We learned the critical importance of American leadership.\n  And, perhaps above all, we learned that while leadership may carry a \nheavy price--it is a price well worth paying.\n  Mr. President, on this, my final D-day as a U.S. Senator, I would \nlike to pay tribute to my colleagues who along with this Senator, \nserved their country in World War II.\n  That rollcall includes the names of: Senator Daniel Akaka, U.S. Army; \nSenator Dale Bumpers, U.S. Marine Corps; Senator John Chafee, U.S. \nMarine Corps; Senator James Exon, U.S. Army; Senator John Glenn, U.S. \nMarine Corps; Senator Mark Hatfield, U.S. Navy; Senator Howell Heflin, \nU.S. Marine Corps; Senator Jesse Helms, U.S. Marine Corps; Senator \nErnest Hollings, U.S. Army; Senator Daniel Inouye, U.S. Army; Senator \nFrank Lautenberg, U.S. Army; Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, U.S. Navy \nReserve; Senator Claiborne Pell, U.S. Coast Guard; Senator Bill Roth, \nU.S. Army; Senator Ted Stevens, U.S. Army Air Corps; Senator John \nWarner, U.S. Navy; and, of course, our colleague who landed a glider \nbehind enemy lines on D-day, Senator Strom Thurmond, U.S. Army.\n  Mr. President, on June 6, and all the days to follow, we can best \nhonor those who risked and gave their lives for freedom by rededicating \nourselves to the promise that President Reagan made on behalf of \nAmerica on the beaches of Normandy 12 years ago:\n\n       We will always remember. We will always be proud. We will \n     always be prepared, so we may always be free.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/10/senate-section/article/S6011-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6011-S6012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SMALL BUSINESS AGENDA\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, this is Small Business Week, a time when we \nhonor the entrepreneurs and risktakers who make this country great. It \nis also a good time for taking stock of what we are doing to enable \nthis Nation's small businesses to grow and prosper--especially without \nthe Federal Government standing in the way. The administration has \nportrayed itself as a friend of small business, claiming numerous \naccomplishments. Not surprisingly, those claims are hollow. The Senate \nand House Small Business Committees each had oversight hearings during \nthe last few days. These hearings were intended to examine \nimplementation of the small business agenda, all of which were part of \nthe final recommendations of the 1995 White House Conference on Small \nBusiness. In almost every case, on issues of paramount importance to \nsmall business, the administration has opposed its agenda by either \nthreatening to veto legislation, by actually vetoing legislation that \ngets to the President's desk, and by failing to implement the \nlegislation he has signed into law. One example of the administration's \ntendency to talk but not to follow through is implementation of the \nPaperwork Reduction Act. GAO reported yesterday that the administration \nhad set a Government-wide goal of 10 percent reduction. EPA set a 25-\npercent reduction goal. The reality has been less than 1 percent \nreduction. The overall paperwork burden remains about the same: around \n7 billion hours per year, a huge problem for small businesses which \nhave real work to do.\n  The Small Business Committee cited a number of legislative \ninitiatives which we have tried to advance. In every case, the \nadministration has stood in the way. The Small Business Committee's \nreport card on these issues gives the administration a failing grade.\n  In some cases, President Clinton actually vetoed legislation of great \nimportance to small business. Like the Balanced Budget Act, or product \nliability, which limited the amount of punitive damages that may be \nassessed against small businesses, but where the administration sided \nwith the trial lawyers. President Clinton vetoed legislation which \nwould have increased the deduction for health insurance costs of the \nself-employed. He vetoed estate tax reform, which would have reduced \nthe estate tax when a family-owned business passes from one generation \nto the next. Almost as bad, the administration has threatened to veto \nalmost every bill small business needed. Regulatory reform, which \nrequired that every rule ensure that benefits justify costs, was veto-\nbait to the President. Ironically, these are requirements contained in \nPresident Clinton's own Executive order. But an Executive order lacks \nthe enforceability of a statute, and apparently here, too, the \nadministration did not have the courage of its convictions. Likewise, \nhe has threatened to veto legislation that\n\n[[Page S6012]]\n\nwould ensure that farmers, small landowners, or any citizen would be \nentitled to the constitutional right of compensation if the Government \ntakes his property. The property rights bill would also help small \nbusiness get through the judicial quagmire they face now.\n\n  President Clinton said he would veto OSHA reform legislation. He has \nthreatened to veto the Team Act, which would allow managers and \nemployees to work together to resolve workplace issues. Likewise, he \nhas threatened to veto repeal of the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act, which makes \nit hard for many small businesses to participate in Federal contracts.\n  All in all, the issues of great importance to small business have \nbeen blocked by this administration. But we will keep trying to clear \nthe way for the real entrepreneurs who are the backbone of this Nation. \nWe owe them all our thanks. But more importantly, we owe them real \naction, not just rhetoric.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/10/senate-section/article/S6011-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENT BY THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the weekend in my home State of \nNorth Carolina, a small black church--the Matthew Murkland Presbyterian \nChurch was destroyed by fire.\n  This is truly a terrible act. I cannot think of a more despicable act \nthan to burn any church. Nevertheless, this is the 30th such fire for a \nblack church in the last 18 months. In fact, there are reports of \nanother occurring last night.\n  At this time, we do not know if this is a nationwide effort by some \nhate group, or the acts of crazed individuals. I would suspect that \nsome of this has been organized, and that some of these are copycat \ncrimes.\n  Whatever the motivation, the legislation I am introducing would \nclarify that to burn any church is a Federal crime. Further, this \nlowers the threshold of damage necessary to make it a Federal crime \nfrom $10,000 in damages to $5,000 in damages.\n  This makes certain that those that are doing this on an organized \nbasis across the Nation will surely be brought to justice for the \ncrimes they are committing.\n  This is the same bill that Congressmen Hyde and Conyers have \nintroduced in the House of Representatives.\n  The President has announced his support for this legislation. It is \nmy hope that the Congress can act on this bill soon and send it to the \nPresident.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ASHCROFT (for Mr. Dole (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Lott, \n        Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Grassley,  and Mr. Inhofe)):\n  S. 1854. A bill to amend Federal criminal law with respect to the \nprosecution of violent and repeat juvenile offenders and controlled \nsubstances, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n      THE VIOLENT AND REPEAT JUVENILE OFFENDER REFORM ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it seems like the latest \nincomprehensible tragedy is only the next newspaper away. Today we have \nan epidemic of juvenile crime. It means that frequently students are \nunable to focus on their lessons as they seek to enhance their capacity \nto be of service to themselves, their family, and fellow man as they \nare in school. They are diverted and distracted because they have \nconcerns about their own safety. They fear they might be robbed or \nraped. It is not a question of someone throwing spit balls. As a matter \nof fact, an 8-year-old girl from St. Louis wrote me that crime is real. \nIt has to do with weapons. It has to do with people losing their lives. \nYoung children are afraid. Citizens are afraid to leave their homes \nbecause they fear the senseless, mindless attack of predatory \nyoungsters who have become a major threat to the personal security and \nintegrity of individuals in our culture.\n  We rejoice in the fact there has been some drop in overall crime \nrates. Frankly, crime rates had nowhere else to go, in general, but \ndown. But they are coming down, and I am pleased by it. But I think it \nis important we not be deluded, we not be fooled. The fact that, \noverall, crime rates are coming down should not mask something which \nshould alert us and should literally prompt us into significant \nresponse, and that is that, while, overall, crime rates are going down, \njuvenile crime rates have been skyrocketing. So those components of the \ncrime rate which would signal what we can expect in the future are \ntelling us to beware, to be alert, to brace ourselves, because between \n1988 and 1992, juvenile arrests for violent crime increased by 47 \npercent while adult violent crime arrests increased only by 19 percent. \nSo we had a 2.5-to-1 higher increase, higher explosion in growth in \njuvenile crime.\n  Juvenile murders increased by 26 percent, forcible rapes by 41 \npercent, juvenile robberies by 39 percent, aggravated assaults by 27 \npercent--an exploding,\n\n[[Page S6014]]\n\ngrowing, expanding threat to the safety and security and integrity of \nthe population. Frequently, because we are talking about juveniles, we \nare finding these individuals are being sent back into classrooms. \nTeachers do not know what these individuals have done because juvenile \nrecords are most frequently sealed. Other students are not aware of the \nspecific conduct, though they frequently know someone has been in \ntrouble. So you get a tremendous wave of insecurity in the classroom.\n  I think most of us understand, when we work on legislation here, we \nneed a secure environment. We invest substantially in a secure \nenvironment here. Yet, when we are preparing the next generation to \nliterally lead America, we have students in our public schools, and \nteachers, who are having constantly to look over their shoulders, \nunaware, not knowing, not confident, distressed, discomfited by the \nfact that we have frequently sent these folks right back into our \nschools. And our schools are unaware.\n  I talked to a teacher who indicated she knew there were several \npeople in her classroom who were being housed in a residential juvenile \ndetention facility, sent into the school, some of them even having \nthese electronic shackles, the bracelets they have to wear around their \nankle that allows the law enforcement community to monitor their \nwhereabouts. But these students would refuse to tell the teacher the \nkinds of crimes or offenses which they have been convicted of, so a \nteacher in the classroom looks at the student and the student says: You \nknow I have been convicted of a crime but I am not going to tell you \nwhether I raped someone or murdered someone or assaulted someone. You \njust cannot know that.\n  I submit to you that is not a healthy environment. But it is not just \nthe school environment for which we must be concerned. It is the \nenvironment in which we maintain our homes. It is the streets of \nAmerica, which we must literally reclaim.\n  I believe the Dole-Hatch bill, which I have just sent to the desk, is \na much needed effort to curtail these astronomical growth numbers and \nto fulfill the first duty of government. We have gotten awfully \nexpansive of government. We teach people how to raise flowers. We \naddress a wide variety of issues--research. But the first, the \nfundamental duty of government, the reason for which government was \ninitially convened, is to provide for the safety and security and the \nintegrity, the dignity of individual human beings, so we can be free \nfrom assault, so we can have the potential of reaching the level of \nachievement for which God created us and for which God placed in us \nthis potential.\n\n  I believe we have to return to that fundamental. The Dole-Hatch bill \nis a bill which is designed to address violent juvenile criminal \nactivity. It is designed to sweep away the sort of idea that it is \nsomething we can ignore or simply patch over. We have to address it \nconstructively. It will remedy misguided Federal efforts to excuse \njuvenile behavior because people are just juveniles. It will begin to \nprovide a basis for accountability.\n  I have to say I understand there are a number of juveniles who will \nnot become career criminals. We do not want them to. We would not make \nthat any more likely with this bill. But I think, for very serious \njuvenile offenders, we have to send a serious signal to them about the \nnature of their activity.\n  President Clinton yesterday warned of a potential wave of juvenile \ncrime in the next 5 years. The truth of the matter is, it is not a \nwave, it is an explosion. The President recommended a so-called gentle \ncombination of laws and prevention programs to deflect this onslaught \nof violent teens.\n  I have to say I believe a gentle combination will not get the job \ndone. I think we have to begin to treat criminals as criminals. For \nthose individuals who commit rape, armed robbery, murder, armed \nassault, major drug offenses, we cannot have any more gentle \napproaches. We have to say you are going to have to stand for trial as \nan adult.\n  The Federal Government's response, and President Clinton's response, \nhis solution, is always to offer more money for social programs such as \ndelinquency prevention, treatment, recreation. I have held hearings \naround my State. I know the Senator from Iowa has held hearings around \nhis State. We have talked to juvenile officials, those who deal with \nthe juveniles. We have talked to sheriffs. We have talked to \nprosecutors. We have heard them tell us how juvenile individuals who \nare involved in criminal acts are simply playing the system. They \nsometimes look forward to a juvenile detention facility. They know they \ncan hide behind their status as juveniles, that they do not have to be \nreally answerable for their activities.\n  The administration has not been active in prosecuting those who have \noffended the Federal laws. There have only been 233 convictions in the \nClinton administration of juveniles as adults. I think for the major \ncategories of criminal activity when juveniles are committing crimes \nwhich, if committed by adults, would be felonies, we need a serious \napproach.\n  One of the things that stunned me about the testimony of Prof. John \nDiIulio from Princeton, one of the leading criminologists in America, \nis his report that when he interviews inmates of major prisons, their \nmain worry is about the young prisoners who are going to be sent in. \nThey are so hardened as criminals and have been allowed to be so \nindiscriminate in their violence before they finally get thrown into \njail that the old-time criminals are scared stiff. They are afraid of \nwhat is happening.\n  Those on the inside, the old-time, long-time criminal element in our \nNation's prison systems, are fearful because they see what we have done \nby turning our heads to activity, so long as it is conducted by a \njuvenile, and allowing individuals to harden their approach to the \nsafety and security and integrity of other individuals, and they are \nafraid. America needs to respond, and it needs to respond dramatically.\n  The Dole-Hatch bill, also cosponsored by Senator Lott and myself and, \nI am pleased to say, Senator Grassley is to be added as an original \ncosponsor of the bill, is a measure which would begin to focus the \nenergy and resources of the Federal Government on this part of crime, \nwhich is exploding, this part of crime which is growing at an \nincredible rate: juvenile crime; violent repeat juvenile criminal \nbehavior.\n  The estimated total amount of Federal appropriations used for at-risk \nand delinquent youth was more than $4 billion last year. Of these \nbillions sent to the States, a very few million were to be used for \ninvestigation, prosecution, and detention. It is time we looked \ncarefully at how we can assist States and how we can carry our share of \nthe load in the Federal Government as it relates to actually \nprosecuting those individuals who are guilty of committing acts which, \nif committed as adults, would be clearly and simply felonies.\n  They threaten the lives of people, they undermine the security of \ntheir property, they destabilize and disrupt our educational process. \nIt is something which we cannot tolerate, it is something with which we \ncannot be coddling, it is something with which we must be forthwith. We \ncan do much more, and the Dole-Hatch bill is an enormous step in the \nright direction.\n  Let me briefly give you some of the things that are important about \nthe Dole-Hatch bill which I believe make it a very promising way to \naddress this most serious problem.\n  One of the difficulties in the area of juvenile laws is the fact that \njuvenile records frequently have been sealed. Proceedings of juveniles \nare closed proceedings. Records are not available. Teachers who have to \ndeal with these individuals in schools do not know what they have on \ntheir hands.\n  I talked to the sheriff--and I am sure my colleague from Iowa, \nSenator Grassley, has talked to local officials--but I talked to the \nsheriff in Moniteau County, MO. The biggest town in Moniteau County is \nCalifornia, MO. People say they are going to California in central \nMissouri. People do not think you are going to the west coast, they \nthink you are going to California, MO. It is not a big town.\n  I asked what his No. 1 crime problem was, and he said it was \njuveniles coming in from out of State trying to set up a drug operation \nin Moniteau County and he could not call the States from which these \njuveniles came and get their records, because there was a\n\n[[Page S6015]]\n\nbig blanket of security, security for the criminal but not for the \nsociety, a blanket of nondisclosure over juvenile records. I think it \nis high time that when people commit felonious acts, when they are \ncriminals, that we have an understanding of what they have done and \nthen when they move on to another jurisdiction, we have to be able to \nfind out what their history is.\n\n  I talked to a judge not too long ago. He said he was sentencing an \n18-year-old for murder. He thought it was the individual's first \noffense. Inadvertently did he discover the individual was originally \nfrom the west coast and had a juvenile record that included other \nmurders. I do not think it is fair to expect a judicial system to \noperate in relation to repeat offenders, repeat violent predators and \nto allow those repeat violent predators to have the presumption that \nthey are first offenders when they have a rap sheet as long as from \nhere to Chicago.\n  The truth is, if those people do criminal acts, those acts ought to \nbe made available to law enforcement officials, judges, schoolteachers \nand school officials, not only because we will know how to take steps \nto protect the other students and the school environment--that would be \nenough of a reason--but we can do our best to change the way people \noperate, we can do our best to help them redirect their lives if they \nare not allowed to hide under a shield of juvenile laws that keep their \nrecords from being known.\n  A significant part of the Dole-Hatch proposal is that such records \ncan be maintained and developed at Federal expense if such records are \nmade available to law enforcement and school authorities, including \nthose outside the State. The juvenile community in America is very \nmobile. The Bloods and the Crips are no longer focused on the seaboards \nof this country. I am sure they are in Oklahoma City, like they are in \nKansas City and some, from time to time, are found in smaller cities of \nMissouri and across the United States of America.\n  It is fundamentally important that we not provide this blanket of \nsecurity for criminal activity; that we expose to the light of day the \nacts of individuals whose conduct threatens the very security and \nintegrity and dignity of the American public and also threatens \nsubstantially our ability to operate our public schools. I, for one, am \nloath to see us fail to protect our public education system.\n  Second, this measure provides States will get 50 percent more in \nfunding if they prosecute as adults juveniles 14 or older who commit \nmurder, rape, armed robbery, aggravated assault, and distribution of \ncontrolled substances. The funding will be substantially greater to \nStates who decide to get serious.\n  I do not think it is unfair at all for the Federal Government to say \nwe are not interested in providing resources just for social programs. \nIf we are really worried about the threat to the integrity, to the \nsecurity, to the safety of our citizenry, then for States who are \nreally serious about protecting them, we will provide more funding. \nStates who are serious enough to provide real prosecutions will get \nadditional funding.\n  The bill establishes an Office of Juvenile Accountability to assist \nthe States in the prosecution of offenders and in combating youth \nviolence. To get funding, States would have to make reasonable efforts \nto ensure by 2002 that juvenile proceedings will be open to the public, \nthat juvenile records will be made available to schools and law \nenforcement agencies, and that fingerprint records will be kept for all \njuvenile offenders.\n  The idea that we have repeat, serious predatory criminals who are not \nfingerprinted because they are juveniles and we do not have the \ncapacity to follow their activities and to monitor what they are doing \nis an idea whose time has passed. It is time for us to understand that \nit is not spitballs in the hall and it is not just truancy. We have \nmajor criminal activity, and we should respond to it as such.\n  Reform of the Federal juvenile justice system would be included here. \nIt would hold juveniles 13 or older accountable as adults for the \ncommission of violent crimes, such as murder and robbery, drug \ntrafficking, or if they have been adjudicated delinquent on three \nprevious offenses which, if the activity had been committed by an \nadult, would have been felonies.\n  What we are really talking about here is focusing our attention on \nthose juveniles who have been extremely disruptive and violent and who \nhave decided that they can game or take advantage of the system, and, \nwhen they take advantage of the system, to hide under it as juveniles. \nWe have to say there is no hiding place down here. We simply have to \nsay very clearly, ``If you're going to make a conscious decision to be \ninvolved in criminal activity, then you'll be treated as a criminal, \nnot as a juvenile.''\n\n  Note what we do not do here. We do not say that everyone's first \nencounter with the law, if it is for some kind of activity which is not \nserious, automatically puts them into the adult criminal system. Ninety \npercent of all the juveniles that encounter our system encounter it \nonce. They have learned their lesson.\n  This system does not do anything to deal with those individuals \nunless they have committed murder, rape, armed robbery, armed assault, \nor major drug trafficking crimes. And you are pretty sure that is not a \nfirst encounter of someone with the system. So for the individuals in \nour juvenile justice system for whom the system has worked, this system \ndoes not affect them. But it begins to say, for those in the 10 percent \nthat are involved in the serious, repeat, predatory, violent crimes of \nrape, armed robbery, armed assault, murder, major drug trafficking, \nthose individuals are to be treated as criminals because they are \ninvolved in criminal activity.\n  It is my judgment that it is beyond time for us to recognize that the \ntimes have changed, that criminal activity and juvenile delinquency is \nnot what it once was. It is a new category of offense. It demands a new \ncategory of response.\n  The same responses that have worked in the past will not work in the \nfuture, not unless we are willing to accept the tidal wave, this \nexplosion of countercultural crime. It is against the culture which \nsays crime is going down overall. It is countercultural because it is \ngoing up dramatically.\n  We owe it to every man, woman, and child in America to do what we can \nto protect their integrity for their personal safety, the safety and \nsecurity of their property as well as their persons. We owe it to every \nschoolteacher. We owe it to every schoolchild. We owe it to individuals \nwho are trying to prepare themselves for a future in these United \nStates of America so they can build these United States of America \nrather than tear down these United States of America. We owe them \nschools that are safe enough in which to learn.\n  The Dole-Hatch bill, which addresses the core problem of violent, \nhard-core, repeat juvenile offenders, will do exactly that. It focuses \nthe resources on investigation and prosecution. It does not focus the \nresources where we have had $4 billion spent previously, coinciding \nwith the explosion of juvenile crime in the culture. It does not deny \nthat effort that is being made to try to provide the right \nreinforcements and support for individuals who want to stay straight, \nbut it says that effort can no longer characterize solely what we are \ndoing.\n  We must be willing to get involved in investigation, prosecution, \ndetention, and punishment for individuals involved in predatory crimes \nwhich deprive us of our security, of our integrity and our safety. And \nwe must treat those who choose to be criminals as criminals in order to \naddress this serious problem.\n  So I am pleased to have this opportunity to submit the Dole-Hatch \nmeasure addressing this serious problem of violent, repeat, hard-core \njuvenile offenders and to commend the majority leader and the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee for this farsighted measure, which will take \nserious steps to curtail this threat to the liberty which all Americans \nhave a right to enjoy.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRAMM (for himself and Mr. D'Amato):\n  S. 1855. A bill to reduce registration fees required to be paid by \nissuers of securities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n    the securities and exchange commission fee reduction act of 1996\n\n Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today, I am joined by Banking \nCommittee\n\n[[Page S6016]]\n\nChairman D'Amato in introducing the Securities and Exchange Commission \nFee Reduction Act of 1996. This legislation is similar to a bill that \nwas approved overwhelmingly by the House of Representatives earlier \nthis year, and it should enjoy similar support in the Senate.\n  Today, so-called user fees collected by the Securities and Exchange \nCommission [SEC] will pay for the entire SEC budget nearly three times \nover. These fees have become transformed into a tax on investment and \ncapital formation. The legislation that we are introducing today will \nreduce these excess fees in stages over a period of 5 years until the \namounts collected are approximately in line with the budget of the SEC.\n  Mr. President, permit me to review the history of these fees, so that \nthis bill, and its importance, can be placed in context. For many years \na variety of user fees have been assessed to support the budget of the \nSEC. The most significant of these fees is assessed on new securities \nissues as they are registered with the Commission. A lesser fee is \nimposed on New York and American Stock Exchange trades.\n  From their inception, fees were kept minimal, closely related to the \ncost of actually running the SEC, and therefore could be called user \nfees, paid so that the SEC could guard the integrity of our securities \nmarkets, a clear benefit to everybody. That began to change with the \n1990 budget. The slump in market activity following Black Monday in \n1987 caused worry in some quarters that the money generated by existing \nfees might not keep pace with the growing budget of the SEC. So the \nregistration fees were raised, temporarily. That not only made up for \nlost revenue, it inadvertently produced annual surpluses of up to $70 \nmillion over and above the SEC's budget.\n  Creating a surplus by raising a fee is a dangerous precedent. Before \n1992, the SEC user fees had become a cash cow. Even so, the \nregistration fee ratio was altered again. The surplus then jumped to \n$180 million and had continued to climb each year since. It will \napproach $400 million this year.\n  It it improbable that a more destructive way to raise revenues could \nbe found. Not unlike an increase in interest rates, the registration \nfees increase the cost of raising equity capital, with the unavoidable \nresult that equity investment is lower than it would otherwise be. \nThese fees have raised the cost of entry into the equity markets.\n  The cost to the economy is immense. These fees tax our economy's seed \ncapital--the money needed to create a harvest of new jobs, goods, \nservices, economic growth, and opportunity. Clearly, the cost of these \ntaxes imposed on new stock issues and stock trades measured in loss of \neconomic activity must be counted in billions of dollars.\n  Since a tax on new issues and equity transactions must be among the \nmost inefficient ways to raise revenues, such a tax should never be \nused to fund general government. That is why I oppose setting fees at a \nlevel higher than necessary to fund the SEC. The adoption of this bill \nwill return us to this principle, which governed SEC fees prior to the \nchange in 1990.\n  These excess fees have been recognized as a tax by the House Ways and \nMeans Committee. This fact resulted in a near shutdown of the SEC 2 \nyears ago in a dispute between the Appropriations and Ways and Means \nCommittees over jurisdiction for tax legislation. To prevent a \nrecurrence of that problem, a compromise was reached whereby the Ways \nand Means Committee will withhold its objections to such fees being \nraised in appropriations bills, but only while the excess fees are on \ntrack to their elimination. This bill implements that compromise, which \nalso has the full support of the authorizing committee in the House and \nthe SEC.\n  This legislation is revenue neutral, since the excess SEC fees have \nnot been used for deficit reduction but rather as offsetting \ncollections in appropriations bills. The fees collected for deficit \nreduction purposes remain unchanged.\n  Mr. President, this position finds a strong consensus in this \nCongress. The legislation adopted by the House of Representatives had \nthe support of Republicans and Democrats and was carefully crafted in \nconsultation with the Ways and Means, Commerce, and Appropriations \nCommittees of the other body. I believe that the companion bill we are \nintroducing today will find similar support here.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1855\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my \ndistinguished colleague and Securities Subcommittee Chairman, Senator \nGramm, in sponsoring legislation to fully and fairly fund the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission. The Securities and Exchange \nCommission Fee Reduction Act of 1996 provides a long-term solution to \nthe SEC's current funding problems.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission is funded through offsetting \ncollections to increases in its section 6(b) fees. Section 6(b) fees \nare paid by issuers who register their securities with the Securities \nand Exchange Commission. In the last several years, the section 6(b) \nfees assessed on issuers has resulted in fees collected by the agency \nthat far exceeds the cost of regulation. Any fees raised over and above \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission's budget are deposited into the \nGeneral Treasury for deficit reduction. Last year, the SEC raised \napproximately $750 million in fees to pay for a budget of less than \n$300 million.\n  The section 6(b) fees have become a tax on capital formation. These \nuser fees now raise enough money to fund the SEC three times. The \nproposed 1997 budget continues this trend by raising the statutory fee \nlevel and expanding the fee base. The 1997 budget proposal raises $776 \nmillion in fees to fund the SEC's $307 million budget.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission Fee Reduction Act will \nstabilize the SEC's fee structure by reducing fees and increasing \nappropriations over a 5-year period. It will return the section 6(b) \nregistration fees closer to the statutory level of one-fiftieth of 1 \npercent and it will create a more equitable fee structure by expanding \ncurrent section 31 trading fees now paid only for transactions executed \non securities exchanges to include transactions on the over-the-counter \nmarket. As fees are reduced over the 5-year period, direct \nappropriations will be used to fund the SEC.\n  Mr. President, the bill Senator Gramm and I introduce today will \ncreate a permanent funding structure for the SEC that enables the \nagency to pay for itself. At one point several years ago, Congress \nconsidered making the SEC a self-funded agency. The fee structure in \nH.R. 2972 allows the SEC to be virtually self-funded, yet gives \nCongress greater control over the agency.\n  It is critical for Congress to ensure that a stable and fair funding \nstructure exists for the agency responsible for safeguarding our \npreeminent capital markets. Further, fees paid by participants in the \nsecurities markets--particularly for capital formation--should bear a \nrational relationship to the cost of regulation.\n  In the words of Securities and Exchange Commission Levitt when \ntestifying before the Commerce, State, Judiciary Appropriations \nSubcommittee: ``In order to continue the Commission's excellent record \nof effective law enforcement, market oversight, and investor protection \nthe SEC will need a long-term funding mechanism.''\n  Mr. President, the bill we introduce today resolves the long-debated \nproblem of how to provide the Securities and Exchange Commission with a \npermanent funding structure that allows the SEC to pay for itself. I \ncommend my colleague from Texas for his leadership on this legislation \nand look forward to working with him to enact the Securities and \nExchange Commission Fee Reduction Act of 1996.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/10/senate-section/article/S6013-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6017-S6018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 794\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lugar, the name of the Senator from California \n[Mrs. Boxer] was added as a cosponsor of S. 794, a bill to amend the \nFederal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act to facilitate the \nminor use of a pesticide, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 800\n\n  At the request of Mr. Cochran, the name of the Senator from Arkansas \n[Mr. Pryor] was added as a cosponsor of S. 800, a bill to provide for \nhearing care services by audiologists to Federal civilian employees.\n\n\n                                S. 1166\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lugar, the name of the Senator from Michigan \n[Mr. Abraham] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1166, a bill to amend the \nFederal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, to improve the \nregistration of pesticides, to provide\n\n[[Page S6018]]\n\nminor use crop protection, to improve pesticide tolerances to safeguard \ninfants and children, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1189\n\n  At the request of Mr. DeWine, the name of the Senator from Maine [Ms. \nSnowe] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1189, a bill to provide \nprocedures for claims for compassionate payments with regard to \nindividuals with blood-clotting disorders, such as hemophilia, who \ncontracted human immuno- \ndeficiency virus due to contaminated blood products.\n\n\n                                S. 1460\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Boxer, the name of the Senator from Colorado \n[Mr. Campbell] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1460, a bill to amend the \nMarine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to support the International \nDolphin Conservation Program in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1505\n\n  At the request of Mr. Pressler, the name of the Senator from Alaska \n[Mr. Stevens] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1505, a bill to reduce \nrisk to public safety and the environment associated with pipeline \ntransportation of natural gas and hazardous liquids, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1612\n\n  At the request of Mr. Helms, the name of the Senator from Virginia \n[Mr. Warner] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1612, a bill to provide for \nincreased mandatory minimum sentences for criminals possessing \nfirearms, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1735\n\n  At the request of Mr. Pressler, the names of the Senator from \nPennsylvania [Mr. Santorum], the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], \nand the Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] were added as cosponsors \nof S. 1735, a bill to establish the United States Tourism Organization \nas a nongovernmental entity for the purpose of promoting tourism in the \nUnited States.\n\n\n                                S. 1831\n\n  At the request of Mr. Pressler, the name of the Senator from Alaska \n[Mr. Stevens] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1831, a bill to amend \ntitle 49, United States Code, to authorize appropriations for fiscal \nyears 1997, 1998, and 1999 for the National Transportation Safety \nBoard, and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/10/senate-section/article/S6017-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                  COMMEMORATING THE BIRTH OF IMRE NAGY\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr President, I rise today to call my colleagues' \nattention to the 100th anniversary of the birth of Imre Nagy, the Prime \nMinister of Hungary during the Hungarian revolt against Soviet \nCommunist domination. Born on June 7, 1896, Nagy was executed after a \nsecret trial for his role in leading the revolt.\n  His contribution to the Hungarian people and to the cause of freedom \ndid not end with his execution on June 16, 1958. Thirty-one years \nlater, after his secretly interred remains were exhumed, on June 16, \n1989, over 100,000 people took part in public funeral services. This \nwas a significant step in the fall of the Soviet Empire, lending \nimpetus to Hungary's internal liberalization.\n  Over the summer of 1989, Hungary began to dismantle its part of the \nIron Curtain on its western border. In September 1989, Hungary opened \nthe border for East German refugees to travel to the Federal Republic \nof Germany.\n  This action sparked the exodus of East Germans to the West, and \nignited a revolution in East Germany that later spread to \nCzechoslovakia. It led directly to the fall of the Wall, an event most \nAmericans never expected to see in their lifetimes, and the eventual \ncollapse of the Soviet Union, an even more improbable event.\n  Imre Nagy was a dedicated Communist, but he was also a patriotic \nHungarian, and original thinker, a leader, and a very brave man. He \nfought for the Bolshevik forces during the Russian Revolution of 1917, \nand participated in the Bela Kun Communist regime in Hungary in March \n1919.\n  After the fall of that regime, he spent the inter-war years in the \nSoviet Union, studying and making propaganda broadcasts back to \nHungary.\n  After the Red Army drove Nazi forces out of Hungary at the end of \nWorld War II, Nagy returned and participated in the newly established \nGovernment, eventually becoming Prime Minister on July 4, 1953.\n  His rise to power in Hungary coincided with the death of Josef \nStalin. He attempted to liberalize the Stalinist system that had been \nimposed on Hungary. His program of National Communism, however, posed a \ngrave threat to Soviet domination. He was removed from government and \nexpelled from the Hungarian Communist Party in 1955.\n  However, as the only communist who had the trust of the Hungarian \npeople, he was recalled to be Prime Minister on October 24, 1956, after \nthe Hungarian revolt had begun. He held that position until November 4, \n1956, when the Soviet Red Army crushed the revolt in bloody combat.\n  Nagy sought asylum in the Yugoslav Embassy in Budapest, where he \nremained until November 22, 1956. Then, apparently believing the \npromises of safe conduct issued by the Janos Kadar government, he left \nthe safety of the Embassy only to be arrested by Soviet forces.\n  He was turned over to Hungarian authorities, who tried him in secret \nand sentenced him to death. He refused an offer of clemency and was \nexecuted on June 16, 1958.\n  He had made the error of taking the promises of communism at face \nvalue, when they were false and fundamentally corrupt. He paid with his \nlife for that mistake.\n  The selflessness, fearless valor, dedication to the cause of freedom, \nand love for his country Imre Nagy displayed throughout the Hungarian \nrevolt of 1956 helped highlight the hypocrisy and reveal the basic evil \nnature of Soviet-style communism. It started a fire in the hearts of \nHungarians that Soviet tanks and secret police were never able to \nextinguish.\n  Imre Nagy gave his life for eternal ideals: freedom, liberty, human \ndignity, and selfless love of his people. He saw that evil, in the form \nof Soviet-style communism, triumphed because too many good people, \nincluding political leaders, did nothing. Imre Nagy dreamed of change \nfor the better for all Hungarians. He acted upon his dreams, showing \ntrue leadership, courage, and determination.\n  He paid the ultimate price for his convictions, but his sacrifice was \nnot in vain. Hungary, along with other Eastern European nations, \nregained its independence in 1990, and the Soviet Union itself \ncollapsed in 1991. His executioners killed Imre Nagy's physical body, \nbut they could not kill his spirit. In the end, freedom triumphed, and \nI am confident that future generations will draw inspiration and \ncourage from his example.\n  For his contributions to his country and the cause of freedom, Imre \nNagy deserves to be remembered, not just by all those of Hungarian \ndescent, but by all who love freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/10/senate-section/article/S6018-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6018-S6019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JUNE 11, 1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, let me also indicate to my colleagues that \nwe have just completed a very successful meeting with Republican House \nMembers and Republican Senators on health care reform. We have now \nreached agreement on the Republican side. Senator Kassebaum, Senator \nRoth, Congressman Archer, Congressman Hastert, Congressman Armey, the \nSpeaker, myself, Congressman Kasich, and many others have been involved \nin this process.\n  We believe that we have put together a good, solid, health reform \nbill that will help millions and millions of Americans. My only regret \nis that we cannot vote on it before I leave at 2 o'clock tomorrow. But \nwe have the agreement. That is the important thing. I hope now that the \nDemocrats, including the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, \nwill take a hard look at what we have been able to put together. In our \nview it goes a long way in ensuring portability. It does a great deal \nfor the self-employed. It does a great deal in making health care \naffordable. It also will start the MSA process, medical savings \naccounts, which have broad appeal in this country.\n  We believe we are on the right track. So now it is up to the White \nHouse. It is up to the President. I hope the President will say this is \ngood, this is close enough, maybe not everything he wanted. It is not \neverything we wanted, but that is the way it works when you go to \nconference.\n  So the Republicans have agreed. Now we need to appoint conferees. \nHopefully our Democratic colleagues will let us do that tomorrow. They \nrefused to let us appoint conferees. But now since the Republicans have \nagreed--we are the majority party--I hope there will be an effort to \ncome together. I want to thank particularly my colleague, Senator \nKassebaum, and also Congressman Archer. They both had to give up--you \ncannot have everything. They both gave considerable amounts in the \nnegotiations. But I think we reached a very good agreement, I mean good \nin the sense for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/10/senate-section/article/S6019-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WE ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, this is the last time I will close the \nSenate. I will open the Senate tomorrow morning. I will make a \nstatement sometime around noon tomorrow. But I want to thank all the \nstaff and all my colleagues. And we will all be looking back at what \nhappens in this Congress, what action was taken, what did we do for the \nAmerican people, what did we do to the American people.\n  I believe when the record is added up, the asset side, the debit \nside, the assets will far outweigh the debit side. We are on the right \ntrack. We are trying to reduce the role of Government. We are trying to \nbalance the budget, which 83 percent of the American people think we \nshould do. We failed to pass a balanced budget amendment by two votes--\ntwo votes last week, and last March by one vote. That is not the end. \nAnd I hope that that will happen sometime, if not this year, next year.\n  But whether it is welfare reform or Medicaid reform or trying to save \nMedicare, trying to change the tax system, to downsize the IRS, and a \nlot of things we think should be done, my view is the American people \nwill believe we are on the right track, as long as they are told the \ntruth, and as long as we keep our word. If we do not tell the truth, \nthen you cannot fault the American people for being cynical about \nCongress and about those of us who have been honored and privileged to \nserve in the Congress.\n  So I will keep an eye on all you people now that I am leaving. We \nwill look back from time to time and see how Congress is responding. \nAnd I will be back from time to time as my party's nominee to visit \nwith the leadership in the House and the Senate and many of my other \nfriends in the Senate.\n  So it has been a good ride. I have certainly enjoyed my time as \nleader of the Republican side, as the majority leader and the minority \nleader. But I must say, I enjoyed more being the majority leader. There \nis a thing about being in the majority that is a bit better than being \nin the minority, particularly when as Republicans we waited so long for \nit to happen, 40 years. I think the Democrats agree, 40 years is a long \nwait. But it happened. We are proud of it. And we are proud of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/10/senate-section/article/S6019-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
