Mr. President, the President was in my State and city \nyesterday in what was promoted as an economic summit. I think one could \ntake some question with that definition, but we will let that stand.\n  The day before that, I had an opportunity to come to the Senate floor \nand to discuss findings of the bipartisan entitlements commission. I \nspecifically referred to one piece of data that just stares at you from \nthat report. It should make every American somber and humble. Because \nwhat it essentially says is that within 10 years--historically that is \na snap of the finger, Mr. President--within 10 years, all of our U.S. \nrevenues, all of it, are consumed by 5 things; 5 expenditures, 5 out of \n1,000--Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Federal retirement, and the \ninterest on our debt, and then there is nothing left. There is nothing \nfor the School Lunch Program that we are pointing fingers at each other \nabout. There is not a Defense Department, a road, a canal, a port \nwidening, an Education Department, an agricultural bill, nothing.\n  Mr. President, this is a calamity that this generation of Americans \nmust confront. I said that it was, in my judgment, a calling so \nextraordinary to put it in the league of the Founders of the Nation--\nthe fight to keep the Nation united, the fight in Europe. It is of that \nconsequence.\n  When I hear the President and his administration suggesting that we \ndo not have a problem, I am stunned and appalled--stunned and appalled. \nTo be moving across the country suggesting that everything is a tulip \npatch, to bring a budget, in the face of the balanced budget amendment \nand the bipartisan entitlements commission, and to give us a budget \nthat adds $1.4 trillion to the debt, $200 billion in deficits for as \nfar as the eye can see, shows either a total disconnect with what is \nhappening in the country or contempt.\n  Mr. President, Secretary Rubin said:\n\n       Another way to look at this is that, without the interest \n     the Federal Government pays on the national debt, the Federal \n     budget would now be running a small surplus.\n\n  That is like saying, arsenic is OK, if it was not poisonous.\n  Mr. President, I am told that the President himself, speaking to \nstudents at Emory University, said the same thing--that we are really \nrunning a surplus here.\n  [[Page S4838]] Outside of being patently wrong, it is exceedingly \ndamaging for these kinds of messages, in the face of what we are \nconfronting as a people and a nation. That would be like, instead of \nsaying to the Nation, as President Roosevelt did, that this day will \nlive in infamy and charging the Nation for what it had to do--which was \nnot a very pretty picture--to have traveled around the country and \nsaying the world is in pretty good shape, those fellows are really nice \nguys.\n  You are robbing the people of the will that is going to be required \nto meet this test when you tell them things like this--we are actually \nrunning a surplus, if it were not for the debt.\n  And while they are saying this, they have already added $1 trillion \nin new debt or increased it by 20 percent. The incongruities of this \nmessage are befuddling.\n  But the real damage is if it misleads the American people.\n  I will give the other side this. We can argue about what priorities \nare. The priorities that I might feel important may be different from \nthose of the Senator from Minnesota, who was on the floor the other \nmorning while we were talking about these issues of debt. We can argue \nabout what we believe more important or less important. But it is not \ndebatable that the United States is expending moneys it does not have. \nWe are piling debt upon debt. We have spent every dime we have and $5 \ntrillion we do not have, and now we are spending the livelihood of our \nchildren and grandchildren and the clock is running out, Mr. President.\n  Everybody can contemplate 10 years from now. You are either moving \ninto retirement or your children are about ready to go to college or \nthey are looking for a job. They would be staring down the barrel of \nthis great democracy having no revenues left to do anything. That is a \nserious problem. And it is going to take a serious response. The \nadministration needs to recognize that. They seem to be in denial, \nsending budgets that accelerate the problem, saying things such as \nSecretary Rubin has just said here. This is what the President said \nbefore Emory University students yesterday, March 29: ``After two years \nwe have a reduction in the deficit of $600 billion for the first \ntime''--much applause, and they would--``this is the first time since \nthe mid-sixties when your Government is running at least an operating \nsurplus.''\n  An operating surplus, Mr. President? This is just staggering and \nstunning. So like I said, Mr. President, we have an enormous problem. \nThe clock has run out. It has run out. We cannot pass this baton to \nanybody else. The living Americans, the caretakers of this great \ndemocracy, have it in their lap. We must confront it. We cannot ignore \nit. And worse, to mislead is so damaging, so harmful, because it is \ntaking the will away. Everybody would much rather hear a rosy story.\n  I want to say, in conclusion, that my message is not one of gloom. We \ncan turn this around. We can tighten our belts fairly. We can remove \nthe obstacles to an expanding economy. That means get the taxes down, \nMr. President, get Government regulation down.\n  If your prescription for America is to raise taxes, make more \nGovernment, and regulate our lives, and in the meantime, tell them \nmessages like this, there is going to be a very serious day of \nreckoning, a very serious day of reckoning.\n  Mr. President, I invite the President to an economic debate. I can \nsuggest to him that the empirical evidence is, through all of time, you \nhave to keep taxes down, government down, regulations down, and let \npeople go to work. That is the way to get out of this problem. You do \nnot get there by suggesting to people, in the face of everything, we \nknow that we are running an operating surplus.

Mr. President, last week, the Senate Commerce Committee \nreported out a piece of legislation, the Telecommunications Competition \nDeregulation Act of 1995, that I consider to be a very important piece \nof legislation.\n  I have come to the floor here this morning, though, to alert my \ncolleagues, who are also interested and excited about this legislation, \nthat I think it would be very unwise for Members to rush the enactment \nof this bill.\n  I take that position not because I have major objections to the \nlegislation. Indeed, I have been intimately involved not just with this \nbill, but 1822 and the farm team coalition that worked it, trying to \nmake certain there would be universal service for high-cost rural \nareas.\n  I have been very much involved with the deregulation of \ntelecommunications. I suspect I am the only Member of Congress who is \nactually able to say I have signed a significant deregulation act in \n1985 when I was Governor.\n  The delay that I am suggesting, Mr. President, comes as a consequence \nof a very interesting, what I would call, disconnect.\n  Just last November I finished a successful reelection campaign. In \nmeeting after meeting, in debates and so forth that we have when facing \nthe voters, they were asking me about term limits, balanced budgets, \nhealth care, and agriculture policy. Crime, of course, dominated almost \nevery discussion and debate. What are we going to do about crime?\n  I must say, Mr. President, that never in my campaign did the issue of \ntelecommunications arise.\n  I say to my colleagues, as important as this legislation is, and I \nthink it is an urgent and exciting opportunity here, the citizens, in \nmy judgment, are not prepared for the change that this legislation \nwould bring to them--significant change.\n  I suspect the occupant of the Chair can remember in 1983 when the \ndivestiture occurred. I know in Nebraska, if I put it to the voters, do \nvoters want to go back to the old AT or do voters like the new \ndivestiture arrangement, a very large percentage would have said, \n``Give me the good old days.''\n Because, all of a sudden, choice meant confusion, choice meant \ncompetition, choice meant a lot of problems that people were not \nprepared for.\n\n  The same, in my judgment, is apt to occur here. I believe that we \nneed to come to the floor and argue such things as access charges, so \nwe not only understand what an access charge is but what happens when \nthe access charges are decreased, understand what happens when \nsomething called rate rebalancing occurs at the local level in a \ncompetitive environment--which I am an advocate of. Chairman Pressler \nand Senator Hollings deserve an enormous amount of credit for being \nable to move this bill out of committee.\n  One of the things I brought in a focused way to this argument was the \nneed to make sure we had straightforward competition at the local \nlevel. So when an entrepreneur comes to the information service \nbusiness and wants to go to a household and sell information, and that \nentrepreneur buys his lawyers at $50 an hour, he should know with \ncertainty they are going to prevail over a company that buys, at $500 \nor $1,000 an hour, its lawyers who have regular, familiar contact with \nthe regulators. If we are going to have that competition, we need that \nlevel playing field for the entrepreneur. They need to know with \ncertainty they are going to be able to offer their services to the \ncustomer as well.\n  But in a competitive environment, you cannot price your product below \ncost for very long. That is what we \n[[Page S4839]] have been allowing for 60 years, basically. We used to \nhave a competitive environment prior to 1934. The country made a \nconscious decision at the time that we wanted a monopoly, both at the \nlocal and long-distance level. We changed the law in 1934. We created a \nmonopoly arrangement. And, as I said, people, I think, would be hard \npressed to argue against the statement that it has resulted in the \nUnited States having the best telecommunications system in the world. \nThough monopolies in general do not seem to work, this particular one \ndid.\n  We made a good decision, although it was unpopular, in 1983 to \ndivest. The divestiture has worked in the context of providing \ncompetition in the long-distance area. We now see rates have gone down. \nWe see increased quality. We see improvement as a consequence of this \ncompetitive environment.\n  But, again, to be clear on this, all of us should understand the \nimplications of the statement that in a competitive environment you \ncannot price your product below cost for very long. What that means is \nthat if I have a residential line into my home and I am paying $12 a \nmonth for that residential line and a business is paying $30 a month \nfor the very same thing, we cannot, as residential users, count on that \nfor long. If the price and the cost to provide that residential service \nis $14 or $15, we are not going to be able to count for very long on \nbeing able to get that service for $12. And many of our rural \npopulations now enjoy $4, $5, $6, $7 a month for basic telephone \nservice.\n  There are other issues that I think are terribly important for us to \nbring to this floor under the rules of the Senate, which allow \nunlimited debate. We need to have a debate. There is tremendous promise \nin telecommunications, promise for new jobs, particularly in a \ncompetitive environment, particularly from those entrepreneurs who are \napt to create most of the new jobs. Those individuals who come in as \nsmall business people with a great new idea tend to be enormously \ninnovative and competitive when it comes to pricing their good or \nservice. I am excited about what competition is going to be able to do, \nnot just for price and quality, but also for the creation of new jobs \nin the country.\n  There is tremendous promise, second, Mr. President, in our capacity \nto educate ourselves. I give a great deal of praise, again, to Senator \nPressler and Senator Burns and Senator Rockefeller and others on the \ncommittee who put language in here to carve out special protection for \nour K-12 environment.\n  Some will say, why? If it is going to be market oriented, why would \nyou do that? For the moment, at least, our schools are not market-\noriented businesses. By that I mean they are government run. At $240 \nbillion a year, about 40 million students at $6,000 apiece have to go \nto school for 180 days a year and learn whatever it is that the States \nhave decided they are supposed to learn. It is a government-run \noperation. And they are going to be unable, if property taxes and State \nsales and income taxes are the source of revenue, they are going to be \nunable to take advantage of this technology. So I was pleased we carved \nout provisions for schools in this legislation.\n  We are going to have to debate how do we get our institutions at the \nlocal level to change. It is not going to be enough for us merely to \nchange the Federal regulation, giving them the legal authority to ask \ntheir local telephone company for a connect and to get a subsidized \nrate. There is a need for institutional change, both at the local level \nand at the State level. There is tremendous promise, in my judgment, in \ncommunication technology to help our schoolchildren and to help our \npeople who are in the workplace to learn the things they need to know, \nnot just to be able to raise their standard of living, but also to be \nable to function well as a citizen and to be able to get along with one \nanother in their communities.\n  Finally, there is tremendous promise with communication technology in \nhelping a citizen of this country become informed. When you are born in \nthe United States of America or you become a citizen of the United \nStates of America through the naturalization process, it is an \nextraordinary thing to consider. We are the freest people on Earth. No \none really seriously doubts that. And the freedoms that we enjoy as a \nconsequence of being a citizen are very exciting.\n  But balanced against that, a citizen of this country also has very \ndifficult responsibilities. It is a hard thing to be a citizen, a hard \nthing. Pick up the newspaper, and if you read a newspaper cover to \ncover today, you have processed as much information in one single \nreading as was required in a lifetime in the 17th century. We are \ngetting deluged with information. Suddenly a citizen needs to know \nwhere is Chechnya, for gosh sakes? What is the history of Haiti, for \ngosh sakes? All of a sudden I have to know things that I did not have \nto know before. To make an informed decision is not an easy thing to \ndo. This technology offers us an opportunity to help that citizen, our \ncitizens--ourselves included, I might add--make good decisions.\n  That will necessitate institutional change, I believe, at the Federal \nlevel, but also at the State level to get that done. This, along with \neducation, along with jobs, and along with the changes that our people \ncan expect to have happen, need a full and open and perhaps even \nlengthy debate on this floor before we enact what I consider to be a \npretty darned good piece of legislation.\n  The committee finished the bill. They are fine tuning it now. They \nhave not actually introduced it yet or given it a title. I am very \nappreciative of the fine work that Chairman Pressler has done and that \nSenator Hollings and other members of the committee have done to bring \nthis legislation out. I consider it to be at least as important as many \nother things that we have debated thus far this year. Indeed, over the \ncourse of the next 10 years it is apt to be the most important thing \nthat we do.\n  Therefore, I believe it is incumbent upon us not to just come here \nwith an urgency to change the law, but it is incumbent upon us to come \nhere and examine the law we propose to change and examine the details \nof the law as we propose to change them and engage the American people \nin a discussion of what these changes are going to mean for them.\n  Again, I have high praise for the committee and look forward and hope \nwe have the opportunity to come to this floor for a good, open, and \ninformative debate for the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell).

Mr. President, in a few moments we will be voting on \nconfirmation of Dan Glickman to be Secretary of Agriculture. I \ncompliment the President on his nomination for that position. I think \nthat former Congressman Glickman is preeminently well qualified for \nthat position.\n  I would like to say that I have known Dan Glickman since before he \nwas born because we come from the same town, Wichita, KS. Actually we \ncome from a number of towns; Wichita, KS and Philadelphia, PA. But at \nvarious times in my life I have lived in those places, and lived in \nWichita. The Specter family and the Glickman family were friends for \nmany, many years. In fact, my father, Harry Specter, was a business \nassociate of Dan Glickman's grandfather, J. Glickman. Maybe that is too \nhigh an elevation. Actually, my father borrowed $500 from J. Glickman \nin about 1936 or 1937 at the start of a junk business. In those days my \ndad would buy junk in the oil fields of Kansas and ship them in \nboxcars, and ship them through Glickman Iron and Metal. And J. Glickman \ngot the override on the tonnage. So our family relationship goes back \nmany, many years.\n  My family left Wichita in 1942, a couple of years before Dan Glickman \nwas born. So that I like to say that I have known Dan since before he \nwas born. But I have certainly have known him for his entire lifetime. \nI have a very, very high regard for him.\n  [[Page S4840]] He had a very, very outstanding record as a Member of \nthe House of Representatives from Wichita, KS. He has a very thorough \ngrasp of the agriculture community and farm problems in America; a \nbackground that I share to some extent. Russell and Wichita and all of \nKansas are in the wheat country, and as a teenager I drove a tractor in \nthe farmland. It is quite an experience to drive a tractor in the \nharvest, round and round knocking down grain; pulling a combine, again, \nagain, and again. It is a great incentive to become a lawyer, which I \ndid after moving out of Kansas.\n  But beyond his professional qualifications and his experience, Dan \nGlickman is a great human being, compassionate, understanding, and will \nreally be able to work with the problems of the American agriculture \nindustry.\n  Still I think he has a keen eye for budget deficits and cost \nreductions to fit into the trend of the times as we try to move to \nbalance the Federal budget for the target year 2002.\n  So I do not know that my colleagues will need too much urging because \nDan has such an outstanding record and an outstanding reputation. But I \nwanted to add these few words in support of his nomination for \nSecretary of Agriculture.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to support the nomination of Dan \nGlickman. I could not help but notice the Senator from Pennsylvania \nsaying that he was driving a tractor and that encouraged him to become \na lawyer. Well, I failed to become a lawyer.\n  But I rise to support the nomination of Dan Glickman as Secretary of \nAgriculture.\n  As the distinguished majority leader has indicated, Dan Glickman has \nan outstanding record on agricultural issues and I am certain that he \nwill serve this Nation well as its Secretary of Agriculture.\n  As Secretary, I am optimistic that Mr. Glickman will take an even-\nhanded approach to agricultural regulations. Recently, legislation has \nbeen introduced which is intended to provide special treatment for a \nlimited class of poultry producers. I am referring to S. 600--the so-\ncalled Truth in Poultry Labeling Act of 1995. It is anything but truth \nin labeling.\n  This legislation is just one example of the pressures which may be \nbrought to bear on the Department of Agriculture during Mr. Glickman's \ntenure as Secretary.\n  I am hopeful that he will not yield to special interests seeking \npreferential market treatment under the guise of antifraud legislation. \nIf successful, S. 600 would result in significant economic harm to \npoultry producers across the Nation--so that a limited class of local \nproducers could achieve market dominance.\n  I hope that as Secretary, Mr. Glickman will send a clear signal that \nsuch tactics have no place in the rulemaking procedures of the \nDepartment of Agriculture under his leadership or at any other time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in a thoughtful article in the Boston \nGlobe entitled ``Funding the Arts Enriches the Nation,'' John Silber, \npresident of Boston University, provides an eloquent reminder of the \nimportance of the arts to the spirit of our Nation. President Silber \neffectively rebuts the negative myths about the National Endowment for \nthe Arts and states the necessity and desirability of continued funding \nof the arts. NEA represents only one-half of 1 percent of the Federal \nbudget. The program it funds and disseminates to neighborhoods and \ncommunities across America are eminently deserving of this moderate \nlevel of Federal support.\n  I commend this article to my colleagues and I ask unanimous consent \nthat it may be printed at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Mar. 20, 1995]\n\n                  Funding the Arts Enriches the Nation\n\n                            (By John Silber)\n\n       The 104th Congress has brought with it an open season on \n     federal support for culture. Members of the congressional \n     leadership have proposed defunding public broadcasting, and \n     two former heads of the National Endowment for the Humanities \n     testified that it ought to be terminated and advised the same \n     fate for the National Endowment for the Arts.\n       The most common charge made against public broadcasting is \n     bias toward the left, and those who would impose a death \n     sentence on two endowments continually trot out the same \n     horror stories.\n       With regard to the NEA, the cases in point are some items \n     in an exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs, an \n     alleged work of art called ``Piss Christ'' by Andres Serrano \n     and a piece of blood-spattered performance art by Ron Athey.\n       The NEH has subsidized a ludicrously tendentious set of \n     standards for the teaching of history and has funded the \n     Modern Language Association, the professional association of \n     literary scholars, as it deconstructs into vulgarity and \n     irrevelence.\n       These genuine horror stories are not so much the doing of \n     the endowments as irrepressible eruptions of contemporary \n     culture. It is very likely they would have occurred without \n     government subsidy. We live, after all, in an age when John \n     Cage was taken seriously as a composer.\n       But these are only the horror stories. The solid \n     achievements of the endowments are ignored in favor of their \n     few sensational mistakes.\n       The NEA has provided startup funds for a vigorous movement \n     of regional theaters and enriched the\n      musical life in the nation through the support of orchestras \n     and other performance groups. The NEH has, among other \n     activities, supported some of the most distinguished \n     programs on public television, such as ``Masterpiece \n     Theatre'' and ``The Civil War.''\n       Such successes have enriched the intellectual and artistic \n     life of millions of Americans, and they have been far more \n     influential than the comparatively few failures.\n       Nor is it true that PBS is, as a whole, a liberal enclave. \n     There are, of course programs on PBS made from a liberal \n     perspective and sometimes this perspective amounts to a bias \n     that distorts reality. But PBS is also studded with programs \n     produced from a conservative perspective.\n       And the great majority of PBS programs are about as free of \n     ideology as is humanely possible. Consider one recent case, a \n     history of the Cold War called ``Messengers from Moscow.'' \n     The final episode of the series was made up largely of \n     interviews with Soviet politicians, bureaucrats and generals. \n     Most of them agreed that the Soviet Union had been a fraud, \n     and that the US challenge, orchestrated largely by Ronald \n     Reagan, had brought the Soviet system down and made them see \n     reality.\n       Jimmy Carter appeared as the man who first terrified the \n     Soviets by considering the neutron bomb, and then was \n     snookered into abandoning it by a massive propaganda assault. \n     A Russian general explained that had the neutron bomb been \n     deployed, the Soviet strategy of overwhelming NATO with tanks \n     would have been rendered useless.\n       This politically incorrect program was produced by a PBS \n     station with major funding from the NEH. It is representative \n     of federally subsidized culture at its objective best, and it \n     is impossible to imagine it on commercial television.\n       [[Page S4841]] If we extended the standard of perfection \n     now being applied to PBS and the endowments to other \n     institutions, we should have long ago terminated the \n     Congress, the State Department, the presidency and every \n     known agency of government. In addition we should have \n     eliminated all hospitals, schools, colleges and universities \n     and dealt with all churches as Henry VIII dealt with the \n     monasteries of England.\n       The NEA has frequently endorsed the motion that the sole \n     duty of art is to provoke and outrage. Great art will, \n     sometimes, do exactly that. But that is a consequence, not an \n     end. Monet outraged many of the bourgeoisie, but that was not \n     his intention, only a result of the impact his vision of \n     light had on people raised on a diet of academic realism.\n       Public broadcasting and the Endowments consume only \\1/\n     50\\th of 1 percent of the federal budget. By helping to \n     preserve and disseminate culture they have contributed value \n     far exceeding their modest funding. Terminating these useful \n     agencies on the basis of a few sensational mistakes will do \n     little to balance the budget but will deprive the country of \n     much value.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/30/senate-section/article/S4840-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4841-S4842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          CENSORING CYBERSPACE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about legislation \nthat would impose Government regulation on the content of \ncommunications transmitted over computer networks.\n  Ironically, this legislation was accepted without debate by the \nCommerce Committee as an amendment to a draft telecommunications bill \nwhose purported purpose is to remove regulation from significant parts \nof the telecommunications industry.\n  It is rumored that this matter could be headed for consideration by \nthe Senate on Monday, although the bill has yet to be introduced and \nthe Commerce Committee has yet to issue its report on the measure.\n  There is no question that we are now living through a revolution in \ntelecommunications with cheaper, easier to use and faster ways to \ncommunicate electronically with people within our own homes and \ncommunities, and around the globe.\n  A byproduct of this technical revolution is that supervising our \nchildren takes on a new dimension of responsibility.\n  Very young children are so adept with computers that they can sit at \na keypad in front of a computer screen at home or at school and connect \nto the outside world through the Internet or some other online service.\n  Many of us are, thus, justifiably concerned about the accessibility \nof obscene and indecent materials online and the ability of parents to \nmonitor and control the materials to which their children are exposed.\n  But Government regulation of the content of all computer \ncommunications, even private communications, in violation of the first \namendment is not the answer--it is merely a knee-jerk response.\n  Although well-intentioned, my good friend from Nebraska, Senator \nExon, is championing an approach that I believe unnecessarily intrudes \ninto personal privacy, restricts freedoms, and upsets legitimate law \nenforcement needs.\n  He successfully offered the Commerce Committee an amendment that \nwould make it a felony to send certain kinds of communications over \ncomputer networks, even though some of these communications are \notherwise constitutionally protected speech under the first amendment.\n  This amendment would chill free speech and the free flow of \ninformation over the Internet and computer networks, and undo important \nprivacy protections for computer communications. At the same time, this \namendment would undermine law enforcement's most important tool for \npolicing cyberspace by prohibiting the use of court-authorized wiretaps \nfor any digital communications.\n  Under this Exon amendment, those of us who are users of computer e-\nmail and other network systems would have to speak as if we were in \nSunday school every time we went online. I, too, support raising our \nlevel of civility in communications in this country, but not with a \nGovernment sanction and possible prison sentence when someone uses an \nexpletive.\n  The Exon amendment makes it a felony punishable by 2 years' \nimprisonment to send a personal e-mail message to a friend with \nobscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy or incident words in it. This penalty \nadds new meaning to the adage, ``Think twice before you speak.''\n  All users of Internet and other information services would have to \nclean up their language when they go online, whether or not they are \ncommunicating with children.\n  It would turn into criminals people, who in the privacy of their own \nhomes, download racy fiction or indecent photographs.\n  This would have a significant chilling effect on the free flow of \ncommunications over the Internet and other computer networks. \nFurthermore, banning the use of lewd, filthy, lascivious or indecent \nwords, which fall under constitutional protection, raises significant \nfirst amendment problems.\n  Meanwhile, the amendment is crafted to protect the companies who \nprovide us with service. They are given special defenses to avoid \ncriminal liability. Such defenses may unintentionally encourage conduct \nthat is wrong and borders on the illegal.\n  For example, the amendment would exempt those who exercise no \neditorial control over content.\n  This would have the perverse effect of stopping responsible \nelectronic bulletin board system [BBS] operators from screening the \nboards for hate speech, obscenity, and other offensive material. Since \nsuch screening is just the sort of editorial control that could land \nBBS operators in jail for 2 years if they happened to miss a bit of \nobscenity put up on a board, they will avoid it like the plague. Thus, \nthis amendment stops responsible screening by BBS operators.\n  On the other hand, another defense rewards with complete immunity any \nservice provider who goes snooping for smut through private messages.\n  According to the language of the amendment, online providers who take \nsteps to restrict or prevent the transmission of, or access to obscene, \nlewd, filthy, lascivious, or indecent communications are not only \nprotected from criminal liability but also from any civil suit for \ninvasion of privacy by a subscriber. We will thereby deputize and \nimmunize others to eavesdrop on private communications.\n  Overzealous service providers, in the guise of the smut police, could \ncensor with impunity private e-mail messages or prevent a user from \ndownloading material deemed indecent by the service provider.\n  I have worked hard over my years in the Senate to pass bipartisan \nlegislation to increase the privacy protections for personal \ncommunications over telephones and on computer networks.\n  With the Exon amendment, I see how easily all that work can be \nundone--without a hearing or even consideration by the Judiciary \nCommittee, which has jurisdiction over criminal laws and constitutional \nmatters such as rights of privacy and free speech.\n  Rather than invade the privacy of subscribers, one Vermonter told me \nhe would simply stop offering any e-mail service or Internet access. \nThe Physician's Computer Co. in Essex Junction, VT, provides Internet \naccess, e-mail services, and medical record tracking services to \npediatricians around the country.\n  The President of this company let me know that if this amendment \nbecame law, he feared it would cause us to lose a significant amount of \nbusiness. We should be encouraging these new high-technology \nbusinesses, and not be imposing broad-brush criminal liability in ways \nthat stifle business in this growth industry.\n  These efforts to regulate obscenity on interactive information \nservices will only stifle the free flow of information and discourage \nthe robust development of new information services.\n  If users realize that to avoid criminal liability under this \namendment, the information service provider is routinely accessing and \nchecking their private communications for obscene, filthy, or lewd \nlanguage or photographs, they will avoid using the system.\n  I am also concerned that the Exon amendment would totally undermine \nthe legal authority for law enforcement to use court-authorized \nwiretaps, one of the most significant tools in law enforcement's \narsenal for fighting crime. The Exon amendment would impose a blanket \nprohibition on wiretapping digital communications. No exceptions \nallowed.\n  This means the parents of a kidnapping victim could not agree to have \nthe \n[[Page S4842]] FBI listen in on calls with the kidnapper, if those \ncalls were carried in a digital mode. Or, that the FBI could not get a \ncourt order to wiretap the future John Gotti, if his communications \nwere digital.\n  Many of us worked very hard over the last several years and, in \nparticular, during the last Congress, with law enforcement and privacy \nadvocates to craft a carefully balanced digital telephony law that \nincreased privacy protections while allowing legitimate law enforcement \nwiretaps. That work will be undercut by the amendment. Our efforts to \nprotect kids from online obscenity need not gut one of the most \nimportant tools the police have to catch crooks, including online \ncriminals, their ability to effectuate court-ordered wiretaps.\n  The problem of policing the Internet is complex and involves many \nimportant issues. We need to protect copyrighted materials from illegal \ncopying. We need to protect privacy. And we need to help parents \nprotect their children.\n  I have asked a coalition of industry and civil liberties groups, \ncalled the Interactive Working Group, to address the legal and \ntechnical issues for policing electronic interactive services. Instead \nof rushing to regulate the content of information services with the \nExon amendment, we should encourage the development of technology that \ngives parents and other consumers the ability to control the \ninformation that can be accessed over a modem.\n  Empowering parents to control what their kids access over the \nInternet and enabling creators to protect their intellectual property \nfrom copyright infringement with technology under their control is far \npreferable to criminalizing users or deputizing information service \nproviders as smut police.\n  Let's see what this coalition comes up with before we start imposing \nliability in ways that could severely damage electronic communications \nsystems, sweep away important constitutional rights, and undercut law \nenforcement at the same time.\n  We should avoid quick fixes today that would interrupt and limit the \nrapid evolution of electronic information systems--for the public \nbenefit far exceeds the problems it invariably creates by the force of \nits momentum.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/30/senate-section/article/S4841-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4842-S4843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            JENNIFER HARBURY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, imagine a government, a democracy, whose \nofficials withheld information about its involvement in the death of \none of its citizens, and lied about its knowledge of the torture and \ndeath in a secret prison of the spouse of another of its citizens.\n  Imagine if at least one of the people connected to those atrocities \nhad been trained by that government, paid by that government, and \ncontinued to receive payments of tens of thousands of tax dollars even \nafter the government knew of his crime.\n  It would be bad enough if I were talking about a foreign government, \nbut I am not. I am talking about the United States, where an American \ncitizen, Jennifer Harbury, practically had to starve herself in order \nto get her government to admit that it had information about the fate \nof her husband, Efrain Bamaca, who disappeared in Guatemala in 1992.\n  Ms. Harbury fasted for 32 days before she was told that, contrary to \nwhat she, I and other Senators had been told by both the Guatemalan \nGovernment and the State Department, her husband had been captured by \nthe Guatemalan army and tortured.\n  The Guatemalan army, many of whose members were trained in the United \nStates at the School of the Americas, claimed Mr. Bamaca had shot \nhimself. Then, when it turned out that someone else was in the grave \nwhere they said he was buried, they denied he had ever been captured.\n  Then they tried to discredit Ms. Harbury, who unfortunately for them \nwas not intimidated. Two years ago a witness told her that her husband \nhad been captured alive and tortured, but she could not prove it and \nthe administration did little to find the truth until the press stories \nabout her hunger strike became too embarrassing.\n  Even today, the Guatemalan army denies it captured Bamaca, and the \nGuatemalan Government says it has no information about his fate even \nthough it has had the information for at least a month.\n  Mr. President, I was sickened, as were we all, by the murder of the \nJesuit priests in El Salvador, by soldiers trained in the United \nStates. Almost as bad was the attempt of the Salvadoran army, including \nthe Minister of Defense who for years had been coddled by American \nofficials, to cover up its involvement in that heinous crime and so \nmany other atrocities there.\n  But here we have a situation where the CIA, presumably believing by \nsome\n twisted logic that it was furthering some national interest, \nreportedly paid a Guatemalan colonel, probably one of many, who it \nbelieved was involved in torture and murder.\n\n  The CIA continued its payments to Colonel Alpirez even after it had \ninformation about his connection with the murder of an American \ncitizen, Michael DeVine.\n  According to reports, the CIA sent millions of dollars to the \nGuatemalan military even after the Bush administration cut off military \naid on account of the Guatemalan military's cover-up of the DeVine \nmurder.\n  I remember that, Mr. President, because I was among those who urged \nthe cut-off of aid, and I was assured by the State Department that it \nhad been cut off. Now we learn that was false, because the CIA was \nsecretly keeping the money flowing.\n  The CIA withheld information about Colonel Alpirez' involvement in \nthe DeVine and Bamaca murders, even while President Clinton and State \nDepartment officials were saying publicly that the U.S. Government had \nno information.\n  And now we have reports that the U.S. Army and the National Security \nAgency not only may have known about those murders, but may have \nrecently tried to conceal their involvement by shredding documents.\n  Mr. President, that is deplorable. What national interest does that \nserve? What is served by the CIA withholding information from the \nPresident of the United States? What message does it send, for our \nAmbassador to be telling the Guatemalan army how much we value \ndemocracy and human rights, when the CIA is paying them to commit \ntorture and murder, and to betray their own Government?\n  Those soldiers knew there were criminals in their own ranks who were \non our payroll, while our Ambassador was making lofty speeches about \nhuman rights.\n  The State Department said it had stopped aid to the Guatemalan \nmilitary to send a message about the murder of Michael DeVine, while \nthe CIA was subverting that policy by paying them under the table. What \nnational interest did that serve?\n  You would have thought we learned our lesson after so many similar \nepisodes during the 1980's in Central America, but obviously the CIA \nnever did. It orchestrated the overthrow of the Guatemalan Government \nin 1954. During the Reagan years, the CIA repeatedly behaved like it \nwas above the law, and apparently little has changed. Even when the \nsordid truth came out, the CIA's response was that it had not\n known about Colonel Alpirez' involvement at the time the crimes \noccurred. What a typical, feeble attempt to hide its own responsibility \nduring the years since.\n\n  Mr. President, our goals in Central America today should be \nunambiguous. They are democracy, human rights, civilian control of the \narmed forces, and economic development for all people. Absolutely no \nnational interest is served by subverting those goals.\n  Before we lecture the Guatemalans about democracy and human rights, \nmaybe we should pay attention to what is going on in our own country. I \nam very encouraged by reports that President Clinton has a \ngovernmentwide review of these allegations, and has said that anyone \nwho intentionally withheld information will be dismissed. That would \nsend a strong message that there is a price for this kind of outrageous \nbehavior.\n  I am also pleased that the White House has ordered that all documents \nrelating to these allegations be preserved. I only wish someone had \nthought to do that weeks or months ago.\n  [[Page S4843]] Jennifer Harbury has been trying to get the facts \nabout her husband ever since she learned for sure that he was captured \nalive. She still does not know when her husband died, how he died, who \nkilled him and what was done with his body. She is like the widows and \nmothers of tens of thousands of other Guatemalan victims of the army's \nbrutality and impunity, but at least one would hope that her own \nGovernment would give her whatever information it has that might lead \nto answers.\n  Any information concerning the fate of Ms. Harbury's husband should \nbe promptly turned over to her.\n  Mr. President, the deaths of Michael DeVine and Efrain Bamaca are but \ntwo examples of the tragic consequences of many disgraceful \nrelationships our intelligence agencies have cultivated in Central \nAmerica. They have given money and protection to the worst criminals. \nThey have withheld information from the White House, the State \nDepartment and the Congress, and from American citizens who are the \nvictims of their intrigues. They have even behaved like criminals \nthemselves.\n  What is this intelligence for? It causes the murder of innocent \npeople. It corrupts. It obstructs justice. It is contrary to our \npolicy. There is no national interest in that.\n  Mr. President, with a new director of intelligence about to take \noffice, it is long past time to take whatever steps are necessary, and \nI mean whatever steps, to ensure that this kind of activity stops once \nand for all. People paid by the CIA should be warned that they will not \nbe shielded if they commit murder or other gross violations of human \nrights. And the Congress should have prompt access to information from \nany government agency about the fate of American citizens or their \nrelatives. If the law needs to be changed to make that happen, then let \nus change the law.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/30/senate-section/article/S4842-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session to consider Executive Calendar No. 50, the \nnomination of Daniel Robert Glickman to be Secretary of Agriculture.\n  The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Daniel Robert Glickman, \nof Kansas, to be Secretary of Agriculture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 10 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I support the nomination of Dan Glickman to be \nSecretary of Agriculture. Mr. Glickman is a former chairman of the \nHouse Intelligence Committee and was, for 18 years a highly respected \nmember of the House Agriculture Committee. Senators involved in \nagricultural debates and conferences with the House know Dan Glickman \nas a conscientious, studious, and thoughtful legislator.\n  Mr. Glickman will begin his tenure at an important moment in the \nAgriculture Department's history. USDA is among the largest Federal \nDepartments. It comprises agencies that oversee national forests, \nadminister the School Lunch Program, distribute food stamps, and \nprovide agricultural supports.\n  In essence, 43 branches of USDA will be consolidated into 29 under \nthe reform legislation adopted by the Congress last year. Thus, USDA is \nin need of strong leadership and direction at this moment. It requires \nactive management by a Secretary who is knowledgeable, engaged, and \nassertive. Only in this way can the Department effectively implement \nits much needed reorganization. Only through vigorous leadership can \nthe Department guide the development of the 1995 farm bill. The omnibus \nlegislation we are about to consider in Congress will reauthorize many \nof USDA's programs. So far, the administration has made no proposals to \nthe Congress detailing its views on what should be in that farm bill.\n  The nominee has stated that he will become involved immediately in \ndeveloping administration positions on the farm bill. Senate hearings \non the subject have already commenced. It is important that the new \nSecretary be confirmed promptly.\n  Mr. Glickman appeared before the Agriculture Committee of the Senate \non March 21 and his nomination was favorably reported on March 23 by a \nunanimous vote. He answered Senators' questions on a wide variety of \ntopics and was presented to the committee by our distinguished majority \nleader, Senator Dole; the chairman of the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee, Senator Kassebaum; and the chairman of the House Agriculture \nCommittee, Mr. Roberts. All of these distinguished Kansas legislators \nspoke highly of him.\n  In his responses to Senators' questions, Mr. Glickman was forthright \nand thoughtful. He and I do not agree on every issue, but we expect to \nwork together cordially and cooperatively even when we have \ndifferences. I anticipate that there will be many more areas of \nagreement than disagreement.\n  Dan Glickman should be confirmed by the Senate as Secretary of \nAgriculture, and I urge my colleagues to vote for his nomination.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Dan Glickman for the position of Secretary of \nAgriculture. Mr. Glickman is uniquely qualified to lead the Department \nof Agriculture through this vital time in its history.\n  For the first time in my career serving in Congress, the very \nexistence of the farm programs is being debated. In past farm bill \ndebates, we have vigorously debated the content and substance of the \nfarm program. But this year we are debating whether any type of farm \nprogram is justified.\n  Some in the agricultural community view this debate as an assault on \nthe traditional way of providing for a stable food supply and a strong \nagriculture sector. I view this debate as an opportunity to make our \ncase for agriculture. Agriculture contributes 16 percent to this \ncountry's gross national product. The United States continues to export \nmore agriculture products than it imports. So in a time when the United \nStates suffers from a substantial trade deficit, agriculture continues \nto enjoy a trade surplus.\n  Dan Glickman is well qualified to argue the case in favor of \ncontinuing the farm programs. Others have spoken of Mr. Glickman's 18 \nyears in Congress and his work on three prior farm bills. While \nrepresenting the Fourth Congressional District in Kansas, Mr. Glickman \nwas a champion for the wheat and feed grains programs. Mr. Glickman \nknows the details of the farm programs, and more importantly, he \nunderstands why the country needs to provide a safety net for the \nfamily farm system.\n  I would like to address one issue that Dan has championed from his \nfirst days in Congress, an issue in which I also strongly believe. One \nof the first bills Dan introduced in Congress was a bill to promote the \nincreased use of ethanol, a form of fuel manufactured with the use of \ncorn. From his first days in Congress, Dan advocated the use of \nalternative fuels in order to promote new uses of agricultural products \nand promote national security interests by reducing the U.S. dependency \non foreign oil. Later, Dan served on the National Alcohol Fuels \nCommission where he continued to support this vital cause. I urge him \nto continue to work hard for the interests of alternative uses of \nagricultural products, and specifically the increased use of ethanol.\n  Another issue that I would like to urge Dan Glickman to focus on in \nhis \n[[Page S4844]] term as Secretary is foreign trade. As I stated earlier, \nagriculture enjoys a trade surplus. Furthermore, the early evidence \nindicates that farmers have greatly benefited from recent free-trade \nagreements such as GATT and NAFTA. I understand that Mr. Glickman's \nrecord has been supportive of agricultural trade, although he felt it \nnecessary to vote against the GATT for other reasons. I would just urge \nMr. Glickman to do everything within his authority to open new markets \nfor U.S. agricultural exports. As chairman of the Finance Subcommittee \non International Trade, I would be happy to work with him on this \nendeavor.\n  In closing, I would reiterate my support for the nomination of Daniel \nGlickman for Secretary of Agriculture and look forward to working with \nhim in his new position.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the President has \nnominated and the Senate is about to confirm former Congressman Dan \nGlickman as the new Secretary of Agriculture. He has an encyclopedic \nknowledge of U.S. and international agriculture and the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture. He will make an excellent addition to the Cabinet. I \nstrongly support his confirmation.\n  Secretary Glickman and I had a chance to talk recently about \nMichigan's agricultural picture. I did not have to spend a lot of time \nimpressing him with my knowledge of the vibrancy and diversity of the \nagriculture sector in Michigan. He was already familiar with it, as he \nhad the good fortune to attend college in Michigan.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with the new Secretary to \npromote and legislate wise agricultural policy and continuing his \npredecessor's efforts to improve efficiency at the Department in the \ncoming years. I am particularly looking forward to working with him and \nthe Department on promulgating a Federal marketing order for tart \ncherries, and getting some of Michigan's most abundant crops and \nagricultural products, like tart cherries, into the School Lunch \nProgram.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on the confirmation of \nthe nomination of Daniel Robert Glickman, to be the Secretary of \nAgriculture.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Daniel Robert Glickman, of Kansas, to be \nSecretary of Agriculture? The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] and the \nSenator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams] are absent due to a death in the \nfamily.\n  Mr. FORD.

The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I believe we were proceeding under a \nunanimous-consent agreement reached yesterday relating to the Daschle \namendment being laid down at this time. Has that been vitiated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that be vitiated \nat this moment, on the basis that Senator Daschle would like to take \nanother opportunity to present his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, let me just briefly outline the status \nof this bill, where we are.\n  I need not say that there are many amendments that we are aware of \nthat have been indicated that many wish us to consider. I will say to \nthe authors of each of those amendments that we are ready to consider \nthose amendments and will be happy to do so.\n  I have checked with the Republican leader and the Republican leader \nhas indicated support for the matter of pushing this bill to completion \ntoday. I say today, and possibly tomorrow--but tomorrow will be 12:01 \na.m. onward, not beginning at 10 o'clock tomorrow, if we have to push \nit over. We are going to continue this bill through the night, if \nnecessary into the a.m., in order to complete this bill.\n  So, consequently I think everyone ought to be on notice that the time \nagreements that everyone has been so cooperative on thus far, in \nreaching time agreements--we would like to be able to consider every \namendment and we will consider every amendment, hopefully with some \ntime agreement for each one.\n  I just make that comment because we must complete this bill tonight. \nWe are, at the same time, I say to my colleagues, functioning on about \neight subcommittees in conference on the first appropriations bill. We \nare doing that right now.\n  So we will accommodate each Member if we can have a little ``heads \nup'' as to the content of your amendments, so we may have the \nsubcommittee chairmen present on the floor when you offer your \namendment in order to engage in discourse. Those subcommittee chairmen \nare now with the House committee chairmen, working out the first \nsupplemental appropriations bill. So give us a few moments in order to \nsecure their presence on the floor to take up and discuss your \nparticular amendment.\n  If it would be possible, I would like to have the listing, so we can \nget a little ``heads up'' ourselves, of what to expect \n[[Page S4845]] in terms of amendments. So I ask Members to give us that \nopportunity to know the content and therefore identify the \nsubcommittee. We have our staff of these subcommittees here to assist, \nto expedite the whole process. We are happy to work with them.\n  So with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask the manager of the bill, the \nSenator from Oregon, if it is appropriate to send an amendment to the \ndesk. He indicates it is.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 426 to Amendment No. 420\n\n(Purpose: To restore funding for programs under the Community Services \n                            Block Grant Act)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Simon, proposes an amendment numbered \n     426 to amendment No. 420.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 14, line 19, strike ``$100,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$113,000,000''.\n       On page 31, line 9, strike ``$26,988,000'' and insert \n     ``$13,988,000''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senators Daschle and Simon. It is an amendment to restore \nthe funding for the Community Services Block Grant for homeless \nassistance. This funding, which flows through the States to community \naction agencies, accomplishes many badly needed services throughout the \nNation. It is my understanding it is particularly important in \naddressing the problem of homelessness because it is one of the few \nsources of funds that can be used to prevent homelessness before it \noccurs. It can and is, however, used in a variety of ways by the \ndifferent States.\n  In my home State of New Mexico, for example, this funding was used to \nhelp over 260 families and individuals last year in cases in which at \nleast one family member had a job but could not yet obtain housing \nwithout assistance.\n  Grants were made to help these families make one-time deposits for \nutilities or for rent. The assistance helped provide the stability of a \npermanent home and thus helped to ensure that the persons assisted \nwould be able to keep their jobs and stay out of homelessness.\n  This sort of help is especially important in States--like New \nMexico--which have a shortage of transitional housing because most \nshelters have time limits on the time that one could stay there. \nFamilies could face constant relocation while they save for the \nnecessary deposits to move into a permanent living situation.\n  In New Mexico this use has proven to be cost effective. The average \none-time grant under this program has been about $500. While the cost \nto house and feed a single individual has been at least $600 a month in \nmy State, a family would be more expensive, of course, to house and to \nfeed.\n  Other States do equally good things with this homeless assistance \nfunding. Massachusetts, for example, in addition to paying for rent \ndeposits, also used funding of this type last year to prevent \nevictions, to prevent utility shutoff, to purchase blankets and \nheaters, provide counseling to children in domestic violence situations \ninvolved with the homeless. The other States have accomplished other \nworthy purposes with this relatively small amount of funding.\n  Mr. President, it appears to me that this block grant program which \nbenefits the neediest in our society is exactly the sort of program \nthat many of our colleagues, particularly on the House side but here in \nthe Senate as well, have been arguing for. It flows the money through \nto the States, and allows the States to dedicate it as they think it \nshould be dedicated within the larger framework of homeless assistance.\n  It is particularly surprising to me that it is one of the programs \nthat has fallen victim to the present budget-cutting efforts under the \npretense that we need to make this cut in order to meet the emergency \nneeds in California from the last earthquake or the last flood. I \nbelieve that we need to restore this funding. Many States such as mine \nhave not yet completed the fiscal year 1995 funding application \nprocedure.\n  Let me go through the list of States that will be hurt if this \nrescission is allowed to stand. These are the States that have not yet \nfiled their application for funding in this fiscal year. They are still \nworking on that application. They still hope to access these funds for \ntheir homeless populations. The States that stand to gain from the \nrestoration of these funds and from the adoption of my amendment are \nArkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, \nGeorgia, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New \nJersey, my home State of New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Puerto \nRico, Rhode Island, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming.\n  Mr. President, other States, in addition to this list, may also face \nfunding cuts as a result of the rescission that is proposed in the bill \nif we do not adopt my amendment. There is no doubt in my mind that the \nrescission is likely to result in increased human suffering that can \neasily be prevented or reduced through programs like the one we have in \nNew Mexico if we just continue the funding for the program.\n  I would like to briefly mention the offset because I know there is a \ngreat concern which I share that we find offsets in these various \nareas. I have offered to restore this funding, this $13 million that is \ninvolved here. The Defense environmental restoration and waste \nmanagement fund, as noted by the committee itself in its report on this \nlegislation, has a very large amount of unobligated funding in a total \nprogram of $5 billion. Furthermore, a special commission, the Galvin \nCommission, has found that this money is not accomplishing its mission \nin an efficient manner and that we as a country, and the Department of \nEnergy more specifically, should delay or modify this planned \nexpenditure of funds.\n  I will read a very short excerpt from the so-called Galvin Report on \nAlternative Futures for the Department of Energy National Laboratories. \nOn page 30 of that report in talking about various environmental \ncleanup activities funded under this pot of money that I am going to \nget the $13 million from, the Galvin Commission said:\n\n       Other activities should be delayed or modified so as to \n     await more effective and less costly technologies.\n\n  Mr. President, what we are proposing here in this offset is taking \n$13 million out of a combined fund of approximately $5 billion, or \nessentially one-third of 1 percent. It is a mere drop in the bucket \ncompared to the total funding flow. The committee itself has recognized \nthat $100 million should be taken out of that. This amendment would \nsimply increase that rescission from $100 million to $113 million so \nthat we could go ahead and use the funds for homeless assistance, as we \nhad planned to do when we authorized and appropriated funds last year. \nAlthough that $13 million will be a mere drop in the bucket of the \nDefense environmental restoration and waste management fund, it is two-\nthirds of the total 1995 funding for the CSBG homeless assistance \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, I think that fairly accurately describes what my \namendment does. I think it is an excellent amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it. I think that the shift of funds to this \npurpose and the maintenance of effort in this purpose is essential.\n  I conclude my remarks at this point and reserve any time. I believe \nthere is a time limit. Mr. President, let me ask if we are operating \nunder a time limit at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). I advise the Senator from New \nMexico that there is no time limitation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. In view of that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. I \nurge my colleagues to adopt the amendment.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I am very happy to accept the amendment.\n  [[Page S4846]] Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, could I address a \nquestion to the Chair for information from the chairman of the \ncommittee?\n  I would just want to know. My main concern--and I appreciate the \noffer and willingness to accept the amendment very much--I am anxious \nthat the Senate prevail in the conference with the House. And for that \nreason, it has been my intention to go ahead and have a rollcall vote \non this matter so as to make clear that the Senate feels strongly about \nthis. I ask the Senator from Oregon if he thinks that is the \nappropriate course to follow.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, in response to the question, I urge the \nSenator not to follow that procedure on the basis that we can expedite \nthese amendments, especially ones like Senator Wellstone's amendment \nyesterday on his priority for children. We reached an agreement on \nthat. I think I can base that on the fact that this bill we have before \nus has made some major changes as to what we received from the House of \nRepresentatives. We have spent less dollars in this bill, and we have \nrescinded fewer dollars. But we have moved those rescissions from some \nprograms of less personal need of character to programs of need. We \ndemonstrated that as a part of our creation of this bill--everything \nfrom children's needs to homeless needs to low-income energy assistance \nto student aid.\n  So I say to the Senator that the amendment fits compatibly to the \nbasic structure of this particular bill. Any Senator can ask for a \nrollcall. I am not suggesting that I can prevent that. I could not if I \nwanted to. But nevertheless I urge the Senator let us accept this \namendment as a part of a Senate version of a rescission and \nsupplemental for FEMA.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have great respect for the Senator \nfrom Oregon. If he is confident with the Senate position with regard to \nthis, I know that the $13 million rescission in this homeless \nassistance was also adopted by the House. Since we would not be \nadopting the rescission, I think it is very important that we would go \nto conference intending to prevail on that issue. If I have the \nassurance of the Senator from Oregon that he believes that will happen \nwithout a rollcall vote, then I will defer to him.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I say to the Senator that there is a pattern in \nhandling a bill of this kind that you have seen operate on the floor; \nthat is, to move to table amendments. I do not know how that vote will \nturn out. But that is sort of our option. I would much rather see this \namendment merged with the bill giving us further leverage with the \nHouse in terms of our conference and trading and what have you that has \nto go on to find a consensus, and I do not want to make a motion to \ntable such an amendment because I think it has validity.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Based on that assurance, Mr. President, I will not ask \nfor a rollcall vote at this time and allow the amendment to be voice \nvoted. I urge all my colleagues to support it. I think it is a major \nimprovement in the legislation, and hope it will be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment of \nthe Senator from New Mexico.\n  The amendment (No. 426) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 427 to Amendment No. 420\n\n    (Purpose: To require congressional approval of aggregate annual \nassistance to any foreign entity using the exchange stabilization fund \n established under section 5302 of title 31, United States Code, in an \n                    amount that exceeds $5 billion)\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato], for himself, Mr. \n     Domenici, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Helms, Mr. Brown, Mr. Shelby, Mr. \n     Faircloth, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Grams, and Mr. Pressler, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 427 to amendment No. 420:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL OF CERTAIN FOREIGN \n                   ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 5302(b) of title 31, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: ``Except \n     as authorized by an Act of Congress, the Secretary may not \n     take any action under this subsection with respect to a \n     single foreign government (including agencies or other \n     entities of that government) or with respect to the currency \n     of a single foreign country that would result in expenditures \n     and obligations, including contingent obligations, \n     aggregating more than $5,000,000,000 with respect to that \n     foreign country during any 12-month period, beginning on the \n     date on which the first such action is or has been taken.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, the amendment made by subsection (a) shall apply to \n     any action taken under section 5302(b) of title 31, United \n     States Code, on or after January 1, 1995.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I have proposed hundreds of amendments. \nOn very few occasions have I not asked that the clerk dispense with the \nreading of the amendment. But this time I wanted the clerk to read the \nentire amendment because it is rather concise. It says that we shall \nnot permit more than $5 billion of our taxpayers' funds to be utilized \nfor a loan program or to be given or made available to any foreign \ncountry without the approval of the Congress of the United States, \nwithout the approval of the people of the United States.\n  What we have taking place is one of the most incredible, most \ndismaying abdications of our constitutional responsibility as Members \nof the Congress. As well-intentioned as the Mexican bailout may be--and \nI do not question the motivations of those in the administration--as \nmuch as we might want to help a neighbor, we have a system of laws in \nthis country that requires the authorization and the appropriation and \nthe expenditure of money be approved by the Congress of the United \nStates.\n  Now we have a fiction. A fiction has been created as it relates to \nthe establishment of the Exchange Stabilization Fund which came into \nbeing when the United States moved from the gold standard. So as to be \nable to protect our currency against currency fluctuations, this fund \nwas established and great authority was given to the Secretary of the \nTreasury. As a matter of fact, he could not be second-guessed as it \nrelated to the utilization of this fund to protect the American dollar. \nCongress could not intrude. Congress could not second-guess. He was \ngiven that authority, and that is as it should be.\n  However, even in the Treasury Department, its memorandum as it \nrelates to the utilization of these funds states quite clearly that \nthese funds cannot be used for loan or aid programs--page 6. And I will \nask permission to be able to submit that letter from the general \ncounsel of the Treasury to the Secretary of the Treasury and call \nparticular attention to page 6, the paragraph which says it cannot be \nused for a loan or foreign aid.\n  Let me tell you, Mr. President, when you send $5 billion and have \nplans to send up to $15 additional billion to a country and that \ncountry can utilize these dollars for up to 7 to 10 years, that is a \nforeign aid program. That is not currency stabilization. The fact is, \nif they did not get the foreign aid, maybe their currency would \ndevalue. But by any stretch of the imagination, I defy any Member to \nreally buy into this fiction and say that this is not foreign aid or \nthis is not an emergency loan program, an emergency loan program that \nwill take anywhere from 1 to 7 to 10 years to repay.\n  It has been difficult to get adequate information from the \nadministration as it relates to the administration of this program, the \nconditions of repayment, for what these dollars are being used. I think \nit is rather ironic that at this point in time when we have a \nrescission bill and we are talking about rescinding anywhere from $14 \nto $17 billion--and let me tell you some of the programs we are looking \nat, nobody can argue as to their merit. It is not a question whether we \ncan afford it. It is a question of whether or not we are \n[[Page S4847]] going to get our house in order. I think it is rather \nironic that when we have the Nation's Capital, right here, with a $1 \nbillion deficit, we are sending $20 billion to Mexico--taxpayers' \nmoney. Incredible. What about an aid program here in the District of \nColumbia?\n  I find it ironic when my State of New York is at a $4 billion \ndeficit, when the Governor and the legislature are facing hard choices, \ncutting back on Medicaid programs, cutting back on other worthy \nprograms because we just do not have the money and you cannot continue \nto tax and tax and spend and spend, and we are cutting back, State \nafter State, making the tough choices, here we are talking about a \nbalanced budget 7 years out. My State has a $4 billion deficit. Why not \na loan guarantee program to help bail them out? What about Orange \nCounty, $2.2 billion, laying off people--policemen, firemen, teachers.\n  How about some foreign aid right here at home?\n  Twenty billion dollars, to where? To a democracy? No way. To a \ncorrupt government, narco dealers, an agricultural Secretary who served \nfor 25 years as a billionaire, whose sons are involved in narco \ntrafficking. We are bailing out currency speculators.\n  How much of the $5 billion that we have already sent down there went \nto pay off currency speculators? And they got every single dollar back \nand, in some cases, 20 percent.\n  Mr. President, I have had colleagues say to me, ``Well, you know \nsomething, if you don't go forward with this and the Mexican market \ncollapses, they are going to blame you.''\n  Well, let me tell you, we have a constitutional responsibility. And \nif we are going to make aid available to them, then let us make the aid \navailable to them under conditions necessary, let us understand where \nthe money is going. Let us control, not one of the these secret back-\nroom things with the administration, secrecy we do not know, giving it \nto them in tranches.\n  Now I understand a very significant amount, up to $5 billion, is \ngoing to go out within the next couple of weeks. We are told, ``Don't \nworry. You don't have to worry. There will be repayment.''\n  When they first told us about this program, the administration came \nforward and they said, ``If we have to use any money, any money \nwhatsoever, then the program is a failure. Don't worry, because when \nthey see the guarantees that are there, it is just like the United \nStates, we are banking this, the world community is banking this. You \ndon't have to worry.''\n  Well, we have already sent $5 billion down. And, by the way, some of \nthat money, they say they are going to repay us over the next 5 to 7 \nyears. Do you believe a government down in Mexico can guarantee we are \ngoing to get the money back? They say, ``Don't worry. We are funding \nwith the oil revenues.''\n  Well, I see my friend, Senator Murkowski, here. Maybe he will talk to \nyou about the possibility of a repayment as it relates to the oil \nrevenues; very, very, tenuous.\n  How are you going to get the money? Are we going to send troops in to \nseize the collateral, the oil?\n  Let me tell you something, if they wanted to do something, if they \nwanted to really have privatization, that is one thing. Let the free \nmarket determine. Why is the United States attempting to do what the \nfree market should be doing? If they collapse because they were \noverspending, if they collapse because there was no value there, then \nlet the market determine. Why should we rush in artificially to, so-\ncalled, prop up their dollar, to pay their foreign debts, to pay off \ntheir obligations? It does not make sense.\n  Mr. President, the Mexican bailout is a failure. What this \nlegislation says is, before you send down more money, you come to the \nCongress the way you should. You get the authority from the Congress of \nthe United States.\n  And for my friends in the Congress to say, ``Oh, no, don't do \nanything; don't do anything,'' is wrong.\n  If you think that the program is a good program, being administered \nthe right way, then we should say ``Fine, vote against my amendment. \nVote against it.'' But let me tell you something. If you think you know \nall of the facts and you are comfortable, you know all the facts, you \nknow how that money is being administered, who is getting it, how we \nwill be repaid, then I have respect for people who would then say, \n``Alfonse, this is a bad amendment. I can't support it.''\n  But, if, on the other hand, we do not know how the money is being \nspent, we have doubts as to its being used in this manner, we have \ndoubts as to the ability of the Mexican Government to deal with the \nproblem, we have doubts that the free market system should be employed \nin this system, we have doubts about prepaying speculators who make \nvast fortunes, billions of dollars as we are bailing them out--they are \ngetting their money, by the way, they are not putting their money \nback--I say this has been a failure.\n  Yesterday, the Mexican market went down. It has already collapsed. \nNow they are talking about it went up 10 percent. Ten percent from \nwhat, when some of the stocks in the fund had a value of $5-plus and \nthey are down now to 38 cents. And they say it went up 10 percent, 10 \npercent on 38 cents. I think the administration is being a little bit \ndisingenuous with us when they give us those kind of numbers.\n  Look behind the numbers. Look to see whether revenue is coming back \ninto Mexico.\n  Do you really think the private sector is going to invest in there? \nThe only time they are going to invest is if they are going to buy \nsecurities that are backed up by our money, because we say that we are \ngoing to see to it that we will pay off those debts and obligations. \nThat is what has been taking place. It has collapsed.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, will my friend from New York yield for \na question?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  The reference was made by the Senator from New York relative to \nbailing out speculators. We have never really had any acknowledgement \nfrom the administration as to just who held the debt, the Mexican \nbonds. We were told sometime ago, in an earlier discussion that the \nSenator from New York and I participated in, that these were bearer \ninstruments. In other words, they were not issued in the name of a John \nDoe or a Sally Smith, but if you bought one you were a holder and, as a \nconsequence of becoming a holder, there was no identification as to \nwhom the holder is.\n  This loan and guarantee program started out at $6 billion. It \nescalated to $40 billion and when the administration end-runned the \nCongress, the total package exceeded $50 billion--at least $20 billion \nof which comes from the United States.\n  But my question specifically to the Senator from New York is, Why can \nwe not find out who the holders of this debt are, the so-called \nspeculators out there? And what is the difference between investing in \na Mexican bearer bond and investing in the stock market?\n  If you buy IBM shares today at 82 and then next week it goes down to \n62, do we expect the Federal Government to bail out that sophisticated \ninvestor who, with his or her eyes wide open, went in and bought that \nIBM stock? What is the difference between that and a Mexican bearer \nbond?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. There is very little difference. Except that in this \ncase, we, the U.S. Government, participated in repurchasing billions of \ndollars' worth of these instruments that people invested in and we have \nliterally guaranteed that they would suffer no loss. Indeed, not only \ndid they suffer no loss but, to add insult to injury, instead of--by \nthe way, if, in the free market, you had the free market working, they \nwould have gone down, just like the IBM stock and, in most of those \ncases, that Government could have repurchased them when they came in \nfor 20 cents on the dollar, 30 cents on the dollar.\n  No, we did not allow the free market to work. We went in and said, \n``Don't worry. The United States, Big Brother, the working middle-class \nfamilies of America, we are going to provide you with $20 billion.''\n  So those currency speculators, sophisticated investors, they got \nevery dollar back they put in and, in some cases, a 20-percent \nincrease. So instead \n[[Page S4848]]  of allowing the free market to work, the stock, IBM \ngoes down--Lou Gerstner would not like to hear that--but if you bought \nthe stock and it went down, you would think you lost. Can you imagine? \nWhy should not the American people have us guaranteeing, whenever \nthey--and I think that is the Senator's point--whenever they make an \ninvestment, whether it is in bond market or whether it is in the stock \nmarket, that if it goes down enough, we will come in and guarantee that \nthey will be paid, plus get whatever the interest that they were \npromised on that bond, in this case 20 percent.\n  It is the most fallacious--by the way, how did that help the Mexican \neconomy? It did make some very sophisticated investors whole, made them \nhappy. And I am sure that prior to this agreement being worked out, \nthey understood they were going to take really substantial losses.\n  So we took American taxpayers' money to bail out investors and \nspeculators in this situation.\n  I have to tell you, we are preparing to do more. That is right. In \nthe next several weeks, if we do not do something like adopt this \nlegislation, we will be shipping down to Mexico billions of dollars \nmore. It is not enough that we gave them $5 billion. We are ready to \ngive them more. Now I find that incredible. And we do not even know who \nthese people are.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me again ask my friend from New York, you say we \ndo not know who those people are. I find that very curious, and \nbasically unacceptable. We are committing $20 billion from the economic \nstabilization fund as the Secretary of the Treasury see fit without any \ncongressional oversight. The proposal of the Senator from New York that \nis before us would curtail any further utilization of that fund, and $5 \nbillion has already been committed, I gather.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. It has already been sent down there.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. We do not know how much has been expended, but the \nholders of these instruments, as they become due, are cashing in. They \nare not rolling over their investment. I assume that they have decided \nthe best thing to do is get their cash. They got their 20-percent \ninterest, and now they are pulling their funds out of Mexico.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. They are taking the ``dough,'' as they say, and running. \nAnd if anybody thinks that they are going to reinvest, the only time \nthey are going to reinvest is if they know we are going to guarantee \nrepayment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder where that investment would be going. Would \nit be going into marks or yen outside the country, possibly?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. There is no doubt that those dollars are being taken \nout. We have seen huge outflows of money by the currency speculators, \nby the people who are reclaiming their bonds. Not all of this $20 \nbillion is being used for bonds. But a substantial portion is even \ngoing to refinance Mexico's public debt.\n  Now, if that is not a loan or foreign aid in contravention to what \nthe Treasury Department's own general counsel said--if I might, in an \nopinion by Robert Rubin, the general counsel, in a letter which I would \nlike to have my staff get so I can put it in the Record, said:\n\n       Although loans and credits are clearly permitted under the \n     ESF, their purpose must be to maintain orderly exchange \n     arrangements and a stable system of exchange rates, and not \n     to serve as foreign aid.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if my friend will yield for another question.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Yes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. In view of this commitment--and I was just given \nfigures relative to the total of $52 billion as the extent of the \nfunding--some $17 billion from the IMF, $20 billion from the United \nStates, which we have identified, and $10 billion from the Bank of \nInternational Settlements, and from about five other sources, totaling \n$52 billion. The American taxpayer has a right to know who are the \ngeneral beneficiaries of this fortunate commitment by the Treasury \nDepartment, because the average American that invests, if he loses, \ntough; he has lost.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, my friend is so right. If you ask, are we \nsecond guessing; sure we are. Our duty is to have oversight, not just \nto ship $20 billion and say we cannot micromanage. I am not looking to \nmicromanage, but when you are reclaiming billions of dollars in \nsecurities, why would we not want to know who the people were? Why \nwould we not send a representative down, as we do where you have \nfinancial collapses, and arrange to stretch out the repayment and to \nsay to some of these people: Here is my million dollars; I want my \nmillion-dollar bond honored. I want you to pay a million dollars plus \n20-percent interest.\n  You say: Wait a minute, Mr. Smith or Mr. Jones or Mr. Chou, because \nsome of these come from abroad, we cannot. But I will tell you what we \nwill do. We will pay you over a 10-year period. We are not going to pay \nyou 20 percent interest. We will pay 3 percent interest, or maybe we \nwill give you 60 cents on the dollar or 30 cents. To simply allow \nthem--them being the Mexican Government and authorities--to repurchase, \nnot even knowing who the people are, and how many are American citizens \nand how many are the investing bank houses of Germany, Japan, and other \nnations? We are told everything is going to collapse.\n  I tell you that the only thing collapsing is our dollar. By the way, \nwhy should we not use some of that money to reduce the deficit here in \nthe United States? We can do away with the rescission bill. Why do we \nnot take the money right here and say that we are going to use this \nmoney for deficit reduction? We do not need a rescission bill. That is \nrather absurd, but it makes more sense than sending it down to a group \nof people who have demonstrated to the Mexican Government that they do \nnot have the capacity to be entrusted with billions of dollars, \nparticularly when it is not even their money.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, why is this deal different than any \nother deal that basically turns out to be unsatisfactory, and when it \ncomes down to a point where the Government cannot meet its obligation, \nor the financial house that has issued an instrument cannot meet the \ndemand, the parties sit down and work something out relative to how the \ncreditor is going to get paid. As the Senator from New York said, maybe \n50 cents, 20 cents, 30 cents on the dollar. And it addresses itself in \na business fashion, and there is a winner and a loser. In most cases, \nboth sides lose if the investment is not successful. But it has been \npointed out here in this instance that the Federal Government has seen \nfit to step in.\n  Why, I ask the Senator from New York, is it not more appropriate that \nwe bail out, say, the investors in the Orange County debt?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I agree.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Somebody says charity begins at home once in a while. \nIs there a difference here between the Federal Government's obligation \nto step in and bail out the investors that hold the Mexican tesobonos? \nWhy not those that hold the Orange County debt?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I agree. It seems to me that if we were going to use \ntaxpayer dollars, a much better case could be made as it relates to \nguaranteeing and giving a loan guarantee, for example, to Orange \nCounty, so they could repay these dollars over a period of time. They \nhave taxpayers. These are the citizens of Orange County that are being \nhurt. These are our constituents, U.S. citizens. That, to me, would be \nmuch more understandable.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Why do we know who those holders of the debt are, and \nwe do not know who the holders of the tesobonos are?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Because our administration did not take the time to say, \nin negotiating in this agreement--and again we are rushing down to make \nthis money available--look, we are not going to pay back dollar for \ndollar, and we want to identify who these people are, have them come \nin, and we will negotiate with them. I would like to know how much \nfurther the market would have collapsed. It went from 10 to 2 on a \nrelative scale. I mean, would it have gone down to 1\\1/2\\?\n  All this business about the damage being done--the Americans are \nhated there in Mexico now because interest rates have gone up. Home \ninterest mortgages have gone from 20 to 80 percent. The Mexican people \nare blaming us, the bad Yankee. We are looked upon with disdain. We are \nnot getting any credit for making American taxpayer dollars available. \nMeantime, \n[[Page S4849]] working men and women are scrimping and scraping to \nprovide a better way of life for their families, and we just willy-\nnilly turn the other way and send this money down to Mexico and we pay \noff speculators. I think maybe some would have been embarrassed.\n  I do not know how many large institutions who invested money there \nwere bailed out and made substantial profits. But I think the American \npeople have a right to know whether they are American, whether they are \nJapanese, or whether they are German. But who were they, and who are we \nbailing out?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me ask the Senator from New York a \nquestion relating to the obligation of a holder of an investment. If, \nthrough a mutual fund or a broker, an individual American acquired some \nof these bearer bonds--tesobonos--now, what obligation does that person \nhave to report the gain or loss to the Federal Government on his or her \nincome tax?\n  Is that not a way of identifying who these holders are? Would not the \nInternal Revenue Service have a record of who held these bonds and have \nto report that information?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. At some point in time, that is absolutely right, when \nthe reported year for that transaction takes place they will be able to \nassert.\n  Having said that, the IRS will--that will take some time, probably \nrun into the next calendar year--but the IRS will be able to get an \nidea.\n  It seems to me, though, that the Treasury people themselves have an \nobligation, before allowing these dollars to be used, to say we want to \nidentify with specificity exactly ``who,'' when people come in and get \npaid off on the institutions.\n  We have an obligation to know that. They never do this.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, one of the explanations given in an \nearlier meeting that I think the Senator from New York was at when the \nquestion was asked: ``Who holds this debt?'' The explanation was ``They \nare bearer instruments.'' Like a check payable to cash, whoever holds \nit, owns it and can basically turn it into cash.\n  I think there was a comment suggested, if this thing settles down and \nwe try to work it out, then those that hold the debt will be known \nbecause they will be represented by themselves as they come in with \ntheir pile of tesobono and say we want to work something out with the \nMexican Government to get paid.\n  Why did the Treasury Department not see fit to try and address \nidentification? Who are the beneficiaries of this $52 billion bailout?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Senator, an interesting point is raised. I will digress, \nas I do very often.\n  We rightfully come under great criticism related to the savings and \nloan collapse and the bailout. In that case, people still think that we \nbailed out wealthy bankers, et cetera. They were the people--we can \nidentify every one of them--and the average amount of money was in the \nnature, and I am hazarding a guess, of under $20,000. They were the \nsmall, middle-class depositors. They were the people who held harmless \nbecause the Federal Government made a guarantee.\n  Our different case here, we are talking about sophisticated \ninvestors. We are talking about large brokerage houses. We are talking \nabout mutual fund situations where we came in and did not even ask.\n  In the case of the failed banks we obviously asked to see--these are \nour own citizens. We had to identify the banks, every single citizen, \nbefore he or she got back his money.\n  Let me say, if some of them had over $100,000, they had multiple \nchecking accounts. And we had a case of a charity in New York who did \nnot know. They thought because they had multiple checking accounts and \neach was under $100,000, they are covered. They would be wiped out.\n  We had to get special legislation by the Congress to see that our own \ncitizens got back their money. Forget about interest--just got back \ntheir money.\n  Here we are paying off foreign speculators who invested in foreign \nobligations 100 percent on the dollar, plus their interest on top of \nthat, and we are told, ``We couldn't find out who they were.''\n  Can you imagine? Of course we could have. We should have insisted on \nit. We should have insisted that they negotiate. Maybe we would want to \nmake certain rules if some of the institutions that invested were \npeople, pensioners, et cetera.\n  We might say, ``Let's give them a break.'' If some of them were not, \nwe would say we have no legitimate claim and maybe we will pay them 20 \ncents on the dollar, 30 cents on the dollar.\n  No, we ship this money around like it does not belong to us. Well, it \ndoes more than belong to us.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if the Senator from New York would yield for \na minute for an examination of how risk works?\n  Many of the bearer bonds were sold with the promise they would return \n20 percent interest or thereabouts. Very much, much higher than we can \nget in the United States on bonds.\n  Of course, the investor has to look at that 20 percent and say, ``Why \nare they willing to pay so much more than the going rate that is \nprevailing in the United States?''\n  Unlike what the investor would get if he or she went to his bank, \ntheir deposit would be basically guaranteed by the Federal Government--\n$100,000 through the insurance that the Federal Government mandates \nthat banks must carry.\n  So, clearly, we have a case here where there was a consideration of a \nhandsome return, 20 percent, by the issuance of these bonds. These \ninvestors had to make a decision whether to invest their money and run \nthe risk associated with having to offer 20 percent to get the \ninvestment, or not invest at all.\n  They had to be fairly sophisticated, because a person looking for an \ninvestment for his or her old age would be foolish to invest and try \nand generate 20 percent return because he or she would know that is \nvery, very risky. If investors knew the Federal Government would bail \nthem out, why, then, they are home free.\n  Now, how in the world could we have made this transition? What were \nhigh-return, high-risk, investments have now been converted into an \nobligation of the U.S. Government.\n  Now, as the Senator from New York knows, as the Senator from Alaska \nknows, if we can get the guarantee or if we can get the kind of bailout \nthat this has developed, why, a person will take it. In the meantime, \nthe American taxpayer is taking it in the pants.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. There is no doubt, Mr. President, that this is one that \ngoes down in history as one of the most misguided operations to rescue \nthe Mexican economy. It is not working. It is not working.\n  Again, if we read the reports now, it is stabilized. The peso, at \n6.7, approximately, to $1, where it used to be 3.5. It really has not \nrecaptured any ground. It hit a high of 7.\n  The fact of whether it is 6.7 or 8 or 9 is not in the final analysis \ngoing to rescue the economy. I will say, all the drums are already \nbeating.\n  My legislation, oh, horrible things--the Mexican economy has \ncollapsed. The Mexican people have been injured as a result of what we \nhave done. They hold us in disdain. We are in complicity with the group \nof corrupt politicians who have--we were sold a bill of goods about how \ngreat and decent and wonderful Mr. Salinas--how his administration was \ndifferent, how free markets were working.\n  I will say, the megaspeculator did well. The people in that \ngovernment who sold out early in terms of the currency in the billions \nof dollars of currency transactions, they made out.\n  I will say, that this administration, the President, the Secretary of \nthe Treasury, withheld vital information and seduced the world and the \nAmerican people into believing that everything was hunky-dory last \nyear.\n  Do not believe me, read the Washington Post. I will quote them. \n``Despite warnings, U.S. failed to see magnitude of Mexico's \nproblems.'' We not only failed to see, we covered it up. Now, it is one \nthing not to reveal the problems and the failings of an ally, \nparticularly when so important, and it is another thing to be totally \ndisingenuous and untruthful with the American people.\n  Here we have, back in April, May, August, September, people in the \nadministration, when they knew that there were serious problems, when \nthe intelligence agencies of this country said, ``You got real problems \nthere.'' \n[[Page S4850]] September, Treasury Secretary expresses support for the \npolicies of the Zedillo government, after he is elected--September, \nlast year.\n  In July and August, we had serious misgivings and warned--warned--the \nMexican Government and officials that there were real problems. We knew \nwhat was taking place. We knew that there was a drain on the foreign \nexchange. But we did nothing. Yet, the Secretary of the Treasury, when \nhe met with President Zedillo, said he supported his policies.\n  In November, President Zedillo met with President Clinton and \nSecretary Bentsen in Washington. Nothing was said. In December, he is \nsworn in; December 9, the President of the United States touts Mexico.\n  Listen to this. December 9--we knew that they were a basket case. The \nadministration knew it. Do you mean to tell me the Secretary of \nTreasury did not tell the President of the United States what was going \non? And they said--this is an article, not me, the Washington Post:\n\n       President Clinton touts Mexico as a case study in \n     successful economic development at the Summit of the \n     Americas.\n\n  This article was February 13, 1995. It is quite comprehensive. By the \nway, that was just less than 2 weeks before the Mexican Government then \nwent through the devaluation, on December 20.\n  So here we are, all during that period--August, September, October, \nNovember, December--our administration knowing, and we are telling \neverybody everything is wonderful, a case study in success.\n  Let us talk about complicity. This is absolutely something that was \nhorrendous. Now, to compound it by sending $20 billion down to people \nwho do not have the ability--and not even ask who are we bailing out? \nWho are the people who are reaping the dividends? That is immoral.\n  I have to tell you something else. If we in the Congress of the \nUnited States, for whatever political reasons, are seeking political \ncover, look the other way--we are absolutely deviating from what we \nshould be doing. We are in dereliction of our duty and \nresponsibilities.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Would the Senator yield. I would just like to explore \na theory.\n  I think the Senator from New York will recall at a meeting that was \nheld in the leader's office in January, the Secretary of the President \nof Mexico was there, and at that time we were under the illusion that \nthe current debt was somewhere in the area of $40-some-odd billion. I \nbelieve the Secretary indicated that the current debt, that is the debt \nthat is due within the current year, was somewhere in the area of 70--\nit was substantially more than we were led to believe by the Department \nof the Treasury.\n  Let us assume for a moment that most of this debt was held by \nAmerican investors who held these tesobonos; the debt is due, and the \nMexican Government cannot meet the debt. What happens to the investment \nthat went into Mexico? Mexico issued these bearer bonds and they got \ndollars. They did things with those dollars, things that we would \nassume would increase the economic vitality in Mexico. In any event, \nthe Mexican Government could not meet the obligations. Is Mexico going \nto be any worse or better off if the American taxpayer reimburses \nAmericans who hold that debt? Americans are going to be better off.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. And other foreign investors.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Any foreign investor. But it makes, really, no \ndifference to Mexico, does it?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Not to its people.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. No.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. As a matter of fact, tied to the repayment schedule, \nwhich they will never be able to carry out, has come the most austere \nmeasures placed upon the Mexican people. The Mexican middle class has \ncollapsed. We are now viewed as truly the ``Ugly American'' in the eyes \nof the Mexican people. They are aghast at our intervention in their \nnational sovereignty. And they happen to be right. It is one thing to \nhelp a neighbor in need. It is another thing to just simply take \ndollars, throw them down, and then tie their people, without the \npermission of their people, to the most incredible tax increases and \ninterest rate increases, and create the business failures and collapses \nthat will be blamed upon the United States of America.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The obligation falls to the Mexican Government, \nreally, to pay back the $52 billion. But we are being told that we have \nto do this to stabilize the Mexican Government, to prevent an economic \ncollapse. But really the beneficiaries are the holders of the debt and \nnot the Mexican people.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Who have taken their money out. They are not going to be \nreinvesting. I think the Senator raised the point before. If you were a \npension fund and you had invested $10 million or $1 million in these \nsecurities in Mexico, and now you got your money out, as a fiduciary--\nor if you were a bank or, again, an investment advisor--under no \ncircumstances would you be permitted, without exposing yourself to \ntremendous liability in terms of investing the dollars in that \nsituation. That would not be the act of a prudent investment manager.\n  So to hope you are now going to stimulate a recapitalization of \nMexico with foreign dollars coming in is ridiculous. It is just not \ngoing to happen.\n  However, Senator Murkowski is absolutely correct, people throughout \nthe world are getting paid back on the moneys that they invested. We \nare paying them back, the American taxpayers. Look around: Working \nmiddle-class families, our farmers, our plant operators, our small \nbusinessmen--we are seeing to it that the people who invested in high \nrisks, we are bailing them out. Terrific.\n  Are the Mexican people saying thank you? They are not. I would not, \nif I were them. If my house mortgage went from 20 percent to 80 \npercent, who do you think I would hate? The banks that are collapsing \ndown there? We are going to bail them out. You want to talk about a \nbailout--sure. So the German speculators, they were there; the Japanese \nspeculators, they were there; the Wall Street interests, they were \nthere--they got bailed out. Not the Mexican people.\n  The economy is worse, much worse. Now they talk about, ``Don't worry, \nthey are going to come across the borders.'' They are coming across the \nborders now. Every time we offer a bill on legislation or we fail to \nsend money down, we are going to be threatened that we are going to be \ninvaded? We are.\n  Let us do a job. We have a job to do. Because the immigration people \nare not doing a job--this administration or the past one--adequately, \ndo not come to the American taxpayer and add to it, compound it, hit \nthem now with $20 billion. And this is just the beginning, and it is \nnot going to work.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. So to walk through this very briefly, so we all \nunderstand the transfer of the obligation here, it has been transferred \nto the American taxpayer and the Mexican taxpayer by this action. The \nholders of the tesobonos are being taken care of by this action by the \nUnited States Treasury, the guarantee, the $5 billion that has already \nbeen extended. You would stop that with this action?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Absolutely.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator's bill would say, ``No more.''\n  Mr. D'AMATO. No more, unless you come to the Congress. And then let \nthe Congress have the courage, let them tell the American people why \nthey are sending money, where they are sending it, and under what \nconditions they are sending it.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. And who would benefit from that.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. And who would benefit.\n  I say to Senator Murkowski, you never really did a finer job than \nbringing us right to the essence of this. What kind of free market are \nwe talking about when the people who invested in the free market system \nhad the Mexican people in Government, and the U.S. people in \nGovernment, guaranteeing their investment? That is not a free market \nsystem. You invest; you take a chance. You win or you lose. You do not \nhave the Government coming to say we are going to bail you out. And \nthat is what we are doing.\n  By the way, to get the facts is incredible. Do you think it is easy \nto try to get the facts from the administration as to what they are \ndoing? ``Oh, we cannot tell you because if we tell you, they will have \na thing and they will \n[[Page S4851]] not know and speculators--the speculators will clean \nup.'' Or the tesobono will go down or the dollar will go even higher; \nthe peso will go to even 7 or 8 or 9.\n  The damage has been done. Let us wake up. You can just keep the \ncharade up for so long. And after we pay off all the obligations and \nall the speculators, and all the people who invested get their money, \nwhat do you think is going to happen?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Then, theoretically, at least, the poor Mexican \ntaxpayer is expected to come forward, regenerate the Mexican economy, \nand pay back the IMF, the United States--$20 billion, the $10 billion \nfrom the Bank of International Settlements--so the Mexican taxpayer has \nthe obligation in the end, but his country at that time is in terrible \nshape.\n  What we have done is--Mexico issued these bonds. They could not pay \nthem. When they become due, Uncle Sam comes along and puts together a \ndeal under the charade that we have to save Mexico from collapse. But \nwhat we are doing is: We are paying the holders, most of which are \nAmericans who have seen fit to take a handsome return--the brokerage \nfirms and various others--while we are paying foreign investors with \nU.S. taxpayer dollars. And then we look to the Mexican taxpayer and the \nMexican economy to come back and pay these obligations.\n  I wonder if the Senator from New York really believes, as the \nadministration tells us, that our so-called loans are safe because we \nwill have access to Mexican oil, if there is a default? Does the \nSenator believe for one moment that we have access to Mexico's oil or \nthat we are going to have?\n  (Mr. SHELBY assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Absolutely not, notwithstanding every dollar that is \nsupposed to go through the New York Fed as it relates to foreign \nimports. The fact is they are using these dollars. They desperately \nneed these dollars now for their economy to support their social \nprograms, and to support their other programs. The fact of the matter \nis that their exports are going down.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Production is in decline.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Production is in decline, and no one is going to give \nthem the capital to get their production up because it is run by who?--\na bunch of robber barons, a corrupt government.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a couple of \nquestions?\n  First of all, let me applaud the Senator from New York for bringing \nthis to the attention of the American people. I have been presiding and \nlistening, and join the Senator in offering this amendment. I applaud \nhim for it. But I would like to back up a little ways and recall \nsomething to see if the Senator from New York agrees with this; that \nwhen Carlos Salinas first went in the perception was that his policies \nwere stabilizing the economy, the peso was stable, and all of a sudden \nwe had investors from Europe and other places who had never theretofore \nbought Mexican debt. So they came in.\n  Then we had a meeting on the 6th of January--the Senator from New \nYork I believe was attending that meeting of both the House and the \nSenate with the administration--with many officials, including Alan \nGreenspan, Robert Rubin, and others, at which time I asked the \nquestion: Since we are obviously protecting new investors who have \nbought Mexican debt, who are buying debt and being paid somewhere in \nthe neighborhood of 20 to 25 percent, which implies to me that there \nare some risks involved, where are the European countries in joining us \nbehind the guarantees of this debt?\n  The answer was yes, they would be behind us.\n  The question I have for the Senator from New York is that has been 2 \nor 3 months ago now. Has he heard of any of the European countries who \nhave now joined us in underwriting the guarantees?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. To a very limited extent there has been some \nparticipation in this area. One country I believe joined with $3 \nbillion as it relates to short-term--very short-term--credit swaps. \nThey have not been engaged in a massive kind of relief effort that we \nare involved in for loans up to 7 or 10 years. Then, of course, through \ntheir participation through the International Monetary Fund, which in \nthe final analysis we will be called upon to help replenish--this is \nnot just a $20 billion bailout. This is $20 billion plus the \nparticipation we owe the IMF, plus whatever it might be from the World \nBank.\n  So with the exception of some limited credit swaps, there has been no \nkind of coming forth on the scale of the magnitude which have been \nexpected.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That was leading to the second question I have for the \nSenator from New York; that is, another meeting took place on the 13th \nof January 1 week later with somewhat the same participants. At that \ntime they were asked again. Where are the guarantors that are going to \njoin us? At that point, it was not $20 billion, it was $40 billion. I \nhave been fearful, since they had started to come for concurrence from \nboth Houses of Congress and then went ahead and did it by Executive \norder that perhaps this $20 billion we keep hearing about is in fact \ncloser to $40 billion, part one of the question; part two, I picked up \na paper going through Dallas--I believe it was a newspaper in Mexico--\ncharacterizing this amount of money as not loan guarantees but foreign \naid.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I believe the Senator is absolutely correct. It is \nforeign aid when we become involved in not short-term propping up of \nthe currency for 3 months or 6 months, which was traditionally used, \nand it is questionable whether or not it was ever intended to prop up \nforeign currencies. But if you want the argument that it helps us and \nthat it helps our own currency fund, never before have we made a loan \nunder a situation which has gone beyond a year, and in that one case we \nwent the year. That was Mexico; in no other case. Once again, back in \n1982 we participated to the extent of $1 billion. We are now talking \nabout $20 billion.\n  I think the Senator from Oklahoma is absolutely correct. We are not \ntalking about $20 billion. We are talking about $20 billion from the \nESF fund, we are talking another $20 billion from the IMF fund, another \nunsubstantiated participation in the World Bank. We are talking about \nother economic swaps. We are talking about closer to $40 billion of \ntaxpayers' money to maybe drawn down on.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Alaska unfortunately has to leave the \ndiscussion. I wonder if the Senator from Oklahoma would carry on.\n  I want to pledge to my friend from New York that I will work with him \nto stop this hemorrhage of the American taxpayer. In fact, we were able \nto hold a meeting, the Senator from New York as chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, myself as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, I think is an appropriate utilization of our oversight \nresponsibilities. I think it behooves us collectively to work with the \nFinance Committee to develop a methodology so that we can tell the \nAmerican taxpayers specifically who the recipients of this $52 billion \nbailout are because clearly it is not the Mexican people. It is the \nholders of high-risk debt that is generating a very handsome rate of \nreturn at the expense and the exposure of the American taxpayer.\n  I can tell the Senator from New York and the Senator from Oklahoma \nthat, if this $52 billion flows out, the people of Mexico are expected \nto pick up and pay that back. They are not going to be able to do it. \nAnd we know that. We should not kid ourselves. As a consequence, the \nAmerican taxpayer will end up as the fall guy, and the sophisticated \ninvestment community in this country and abroad will be the \nbeneficiaries. I think the American public is entitled to know who \nthose beneficiaries are. I intend to work with my colleagues toward \nthat end in appropriate identification of just where this handsome \nreturn is being funneled.\n  I thank my friend from New York. I am pleased to join with him in \ncosponsoring this amendment.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank my friend and colleague from Alaska for really I \nthink focusing in on the central theme. We talk about free markets. We \nare not allowing them to work. Then we come in and we pledge United \nStates taxpayers and Mexican taxpayers to bail out unknown speculators, \nunknown investors. I would like to know who they are. And in \ncontravention of the statute of the Constitution which says that \nelected representatives of the people of \n[[Page S4852]] Congress must approve the appropriations of taxpayers \nfunds, it is our constitutional duty. It is spelled out in article I, \nsection 9 of the U.S. Constitution. It says no money shall be drawn \nfrom the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law. \nThat exactly is not what is taking place.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from North Carolina is here. I know \nhe has a statement. He is a cosponsor of this legislation. So I am \ngoing to yield the floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Thank you, Mr. President. A perfect example of what we \nare talking about in the conflict and the lack of direction we have \nseen in this entire process has been that, according to the President's \nfiscal year budget of 1996, the net position of the exchange \nstabilization fund is only $18.3 billion. Now he is committing $20 \nbillion out of an $18.3 billion fund. That is by his own figures, not \nanyone else.\n  But I think the most distressing thing about the entire thing is \nnearly 6 weeks ago I asked Alan Greenspan how Mexico got into this \nsituation.\n His answer was over-domestic spending, over-borrowing and an out-of-\ncontrol trade deficit. I asked him which one of those we were doing at \na greater rate than Mexico. And his answer? None, that we were doing \nthem all.\n\n  The real question is this: Who is going to bail us out? That is the \ndifference. There is not anyone to bail us out. When the time comes, \nthere is no bailout. And a perfect example of what is happening--and we \nhave all seen it--is the decline in the dollar. The dollar went into a \nstraight decline after we refused to balance the budget and when we \nbecame entangled with Mexico.\n  President Clinton plans to give Mexico $20 billion. ``Give'' is the \nright word. Do not call it a loan. There is no chance of it being paid \nback under any conditions. It is an absolute giveaway.\n  This type of thing is not new to Mexico. They have been through five \nor six of these so-called crises before. We simply do not have the \nmoney to bail them out. This $20 billion we talk about is supposed to \nbe used to stabilize the currency of this country, and at the rate we \nare going there is no doubt we are going to need it to stabilize the \ncurrency of this country, and quickly.\n  I think the President's plan is a bad idea from the beginning when \nyou look at the fact that Mexico's foreign debt is $160 billion. It is \nhigher than it was in 1982, when Mexico simply took a walk on the \nworld, suspended interest payments, and precipitated the Latin American \ndebt crisis bailout.\n  Unfortunately, in the face of this crisis, President Clinton chose a \nflawed strategy that he has followed before. He followed it with health \ncare. And that is a massive Government intervention. The last thing we \nneed in Mexico is a massive intervention of this Government. And like \nbefore, the plan is being resisted from ordinary Americans who know \nthey are going to wind up paying it back. The working taxpayers of this \ncountry do not understand how we can afford to send Mexico $20 billion \nwhen the United States is going into debt every day at $700 million or \nmore.\n  The thing about it that has been so confusing--and I have talked to \nthe Senator from New York and everybody else about it--is that when we \nfirst heard of this crisis $12 billion was supposed to correct it. \nLater on, they told us it might take $25 billion. Then we went to a \nmeeting and they said $40 billion would absolutely be such an overkill, \nso much extra money that we would not even have to use the $40 billion.\n  Now it would appear now they are talking about $52 billion. We have \nno idea how much is involved. But there is one thing for sure. It is \ngoing to take a lot more money than a country going in debt at $1 \nbillion every working day ought to be spending. This is a problem for \nthe Mexican economy and the Mexican people to address themselves. It is \nnot a problem for the U.S. Government. We simply cannot afford it.\n  The plan thus far has done nothing to stabilize the Mexican currency. \nIt has gone down against the dollar since the announcement of the plan.\n  Now, to add bad news to bad news, as the peso has been dropping \nagainst the dollar, the dollar has been dropping against practically \nevery industrialized country's currency in the world. So we are trying \nto bail out a weak peso with a weakening dollar. It simply does not \nmake sense.\n  As I think Senator Brown from Colorado said, nobody ever falls in \nlove with their banker, and we have seen it clearly in this situation. \nMexico will soon resent our interference in their economy and in their \npolitical affairs. There will be ``Yankee go home'' signs up before we \never finish the bailout. In fact, the evidence is already there. During \nthe deliberation on the President's first plan, the Mexican Legislature \ntook a vote in which they said, yes they, have to approve the bailout. \nIn other words, they have to decide whether they want us to give them \nmoney or not.\n  Finally, with an administration and a Congress that cannot control \ntheir own spending, the ludicrous part of it all is that we are talking \nabout imposing financial constraints on Mexico, what they could spend, \ndomestic spending, telling them to get the trade deficit in line--we, \nthe United States Congress, imposing trade constraints and fiscal \nconstraints on someone when for 35 years we have been totally out of \ncontrol, spending and wrecking our own dollar against the world's \neconomy.\n  So if we cannot control our own, why should we think we are going to \nbe able to control the economy of Mexico? What we need to do is exactly \nwhat this bill does. I assume we have committed the $5 billion, but \nwhen that is up, we should stop until it comes back before the entire \nCongress to make a decision as to whether we go any further or not. \nMaybe we could afford the $5 billion but we cannot afford an open-ended \ncheck.\n  Mr. President, I thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I thank Senator Faircloth not only for \nhis support and cosponsorship of this legislation but for his \npersistence in asking for the facts.\n  Mr. President, I prepared a statement and I am going to stick to it \nand read it at this point.\n  The Mexican bailout is a failure. The rights of the American people \nhave been ignored and disregarded. Might I add, I also believe the \nrights of the Mexican people, who we claim we are interested in, have \nbeen injured as well.\n  People of this Nation clearly do not want to send $20 billion to \nMexico even when there are the implied threats that there will be huge \nimmigration masses illegally coming across our borders.\n  The administration and the President have arrogantly disregarded the \nmen and women of America. They have gone around Congress. The President \ntook money that was supposed to be used to stabilize the American \ndollar, and we are giving it to Mexico, make no mistake about it. We \nare never going to get this money back. And the question as to the use \nof this money is a very real and legitimate question that should be \nanswered. Who are we bailing out?\n  The President has rewarded a corrupt dictatorial Mexican regime and \nsaved global speculators from massive losses. Already, $5 billion--$5 \nbillion--of American taxpayers' money is gone. Yesterday, the Mexican \nmarket still fell. The collapse of the Mexican stock market continues \nunabated. It was a terrible mistake for the President to use $20 \nbillion of the exchange stabilization fund. That fund was intended to \nstabilize and to protect the American dollar, not the peso. This is an \noutrage. It is shocking. It is wrong.\n  The President has made conditions in Mexico worse for the Mexican \npeople. Just think of it. The $5 billion already sent to Mexico has \nbeen used to repay the Mexican public debt to bail out currency \nspeculators and Mexican banks.\n  American taxpayers should not have to repay Mexico's public debt and \nprop up Mexican banks. And that is exactly what is happening.\n  Never before has an administration or an American President taken \nsuch large amounts--$20 billion--from our economic stabilization fund \nto bail out \n[[Page S4853]] a foreign country. It is totally unprecedented. Never \nbefore has an administration sent more than $1 billion or used more \nthan $1 billion from the ESF fund for a foreign country.\n  Never before has a President given a loan to a foreign country for \nmore than 1 year from this fund. He should not give a loan at all. That \nis illegal.\n  But the administration has ignored precedent and did an end-run \naround the Congress. He has given the Mexican regime a line of credit \nfrom the ESF for 5 years, and in some cases up to 7 years. That has \nnever been done before. It is totally unprecedented. It is wrong.\n  Even the Treasury Department recognized that the ESF may not be used \nfor foreign aid. In an opinion to Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, the \ngeneral counsel of Treasury advised, and I quote from page 6:\n\n       Although loans and credits are clearly permitted under the \n     ESF, their purpose must be to maintain orderly exchange \n     arrangements and a stable system of exchange rates, and not \n     to serve as foreign aid.\n\n  This is clear. ESF money cannot be used as foreign aid. And that is \nexactly what is taking place.\n  Treasury also admits that ESF may not be used if American taxpayers' \nmoney is at risk.\n  I want one person to tell me that the American taxpayers' money is \nnot at risk. No one can say that. Treasury officials cannot say that. \nThey cannot say that privately, they cannot say that publicly, that the \nAmerican taxpayers' money is not at risk. Now that is the law. That \ncomes from their interpretation.\n  Treasury admits that ESF may not be used if American taxpayers' money \nis at risk.\n  Now, Mr. President, we have to be kidding ourselves if we are going \nto be saying that that is not the case. We have been told that Mexico \nhas pledged its oil reserves as collateral for repayment. But Mexico \ncan shut off the oil. And, the Mexicans can sell it elsewhere. The \nbottom line is that we have no real assurance that America will be \nrepaid. What will we do? Will we send in the 82d Airborne to collect \nour money if they default?\n  Are we going to seize the oil wells? Are we going to prohibit them, \nsomehow, from an agreement that is made with one administration today \nwith another administration down there tomorrow if they decide, when \ninterest rates at 80 to 100 percent are forcing a revolution, that they \ncan no longer continue this austerity program?\n  Imagine what the middle class is doing and saying right now. How long \ndo you think they can maintain this austerity program? And this is the \nonly chance they have to make it. So what happens when they say, ``We \ncannot meet these onerous repayment schedules''? Are we going to cut \noff all their foreign aid? Are we going to seize all the money that \ncomes through the Federal bank in New York? For how long? How long \nbefore they make a new arrangements for the sale and disregard the fact \nthat money was supposed to go through the Federal bank? Are we going to \nsue them? Are we going to get judgments against them?\n  If you are going to do that, they will sell their oil abroad. If you \ntake a man's life away from him, you take away his ability to make a \nliving, he will stop working, and that is what they will do. You do not \nthink that they are just going to pump oil for the sake of paying this \ndebt if they need the money? It is preposterous.\n  Mr. President, given the unprecedented size and scope of the \nPresident's bailout, it is clear to this Senator, and to a dozen others \nwho have cosponsored this legislation, that it is foreign aid for \nMexico; that it is making a loan and, indeed, a loan which is not \nsufficiently collateralized, and that there is a good chance American \ntaxpayers will suffer.\n  And, giving Mexico $20 billion of American foreign aid without \ncongressional approval is wrong. Giving them $5 billion without \ncongressional approval is wrong. Giving them $1 billion is wrong.\n  But this Senator said, ``All right. You have given them $5 billion. \nLet us hold it. And if, indeed, you can make a case to the American \npeople, to the Congress, that they should continue to get aid, they \nshould continue to get support, then let us have that legislation, let \nus have the ability to review how those dollars will be used, for what \npurposes, who will benefit.''\n  And that is the reason this Congress should be brought into this \nprocess. It happens to be the law.\n  As elected representatives of the people, the Congress must approve \nthe appropriation of taxpayers' funds. It is our constitutional duty.\n  Instead of allowing the free market to decide Mexico's fate, the \npoliticians in Mexico City and in Washington misled the markets. All \nduring 1994, the administration told us that the Mexican economy was a \nmodel for the free world. We supported Mexican President Salinas' \ncandidacy to head the World Trade Organization. President Clinton \npraised Mexico at the Summit of the America's, just days before the \ndevaluation of the peso in December.\n  This administration has made the situation in Mexico far worse than \nit needed to become. The peso will rise and fall because of market \nforces--free market forces--and not because $5, $10, or $20 billion in \nAmerican taxpayers' dollars goes south of the border.\n  What is going on in Mexico rivals any soap opera. There were reports \nof rampant Mexican corruption and collusion with drug traffickers. The \nformer President of Mexico has left the country; his brother is under \narrest for masterminding a political assassination. The Mexican Army is \nfighting rebellion in the southern region.\n  The peso printing press is still continuing--as we talk, they are \nprinting pesos--and the peso continues to fall against other \ncurrencies, taking the dollar with it. The inflation rate in Mexico is \nalmost 70 percent, and bank interest rates in some cases are close to \n100 percent.\n  Mr. President, where is the voice of the people? Do the people want \nus to make a loan in this situation? We have an obligation--a duty--to \nbring this issue into the light. This Senator will not just stand by \nand allow this obligation to be buried under political considerations.\n  Maybe President Clinton does not understand that hard-working \nAmerican people do not want their money being used in this manner, but \nI do. I was sent here to fight for them--not the international \nspeculators, not corrupt foreign governments, as nice as we want to \npaint a coat of fresh paint on them to dress them up.\n  If this administration truly wants to help Mexico, we should do so by \ndemanding fundamental free-market reforms.\n  The first thing the Mexican Government can do, if it wants to pay off \nall its debts, is privatize PEMEX, the Mexican national oil monopoly \nthat has been used as a Mexican piggy bank for corrupt officials year \nafter year after year after year.\n  You have a former agricultural administrator, the Secretary, just \nretired there. He is a billionaire. He earned $50,000 a year, yet he is \na billionaire. And his sons are tied to drug dealings. Sixty percent of \nall the drugs that come into this country in terms of cocaine are from \nMexico as a transshipment place, from top to bottom filled with \ncorruption. Do you think they are going to treat our money like it is \ntheir own? They will take their cut. They will treat it like their own. \nThey will make it their own. Incredible.\n  Let the Mexican Government eliminate wage and price controls. Let \nthem see to it that they do not impose false and arbitrary standards. \nLet them clean up the corruption that is destroying their country and \nthe ability of their people to believe in it.\n  We should not make ourselves the international welfare house, \ncertainly not on this scale. Welfare has failed dismally in those \ncountries in which we have made it the cornerstone of our policy. When \nwill we learn? The road to economic growth is less government, not more \ngovernment. Let us do the people of Mexico a favor. Let us demand free \nmarket reforms.\n  Let us not get into the business of international welfare. Now, when \nCongress must cut domestic programs to balance our Federal budget, is \nnot the time to send $20-plus billion to Mexico. We cannot afford to be \nMexico's banker. The ESF is not the President's personal piggy bank, \nand it is our duty to protect American taxpayers.\n  Who will bail us out if the dollar continues to fall? The Japanese? \nThe Germans? The Mexicans? I doubt it.\n  [[Page S4854]] The time has come for Congress to stand up for the \nAmerican taxpayers. So today, on behalf of the hard-working men and \nwomen of America, I have offered this legislation. This legislation \nreasserts Congress' rights and responsibilities with regard to this \nmatter.\n  Some of my colleagues may not be happy with this, but I think it is \ntheir obligation. They have an obligation to vote ``yes.'' If you \nbelieve that Congress is ultimately responsible for the appropriation \nof funds, you have an obligation to vote ``yes'' if you think these \nfunds are not being used appropriately. On the other hand, if you think \nthat the administration is correct under the law; that these funds can \nbe used for this purpose; that these funds are not being made as \nforeign aid; that these funds are not being made as a loan which may \nnot be repaid, or is in jeopardy of not being repaid, then vote against \nthis.\n  My bill would amend the ESF statute to provide--I think it is far too \ngenerous, but to deal with this situation, I have limited it to $5 \nbillion. I think it should be much lower than that, a lower floor; but \nthe President cannot give a foreign country in excess of $5 billion \nwithout congressional approval. I think that is reasonable.\n  Some have said that I should not introduce this amendment. But I say \nlet us look at the facts. Mexico is in a quagmire. And American \ntaxpayers have been drawn into the quicksand without any authorization \nby their elected representatives. The only long-term financial \ncommitments being made in Mexico right now are being made by the United \nStates of America, using American taxpayer money without their consent. \nWe have dragged in an unwilling IMF and an unwilling World Bank. That \nis not right. If my colleagues think this bailout is appropriate, then \nlet us vote on the record.\n  It is Congress' constitutional responsibility to determine whether to \nsend American tax dollars to a foreign country. We should use the $20 \nbillion that the President has sent Mexico, or intends to send Mexico, \nto help balance the Federal budget. I would rather spend the money to \nhelp New York, Orange County, or the District of Columbia, and whatever \nis left over, use it to reduce the budget, which is far more \nappropriate.\n  Congress could approve more than $5 billion in aid to Mexico. But if \nso, let us do it the right way, in the open, on the record. It is not \ngood enough to say, well, we have congressional leaders who have \napproved. That may be, but that is not the full House, and that is not \nthe full Senate. I am tired of hearing that. I am tired of hearing, oh, \nwell, the leadership agreed. Yes, they agreed in good faith. I do not \nthink good faith was kept with them. They were not told how these \ndollars were going to be used or about the implications in terms of the \ninterest rates that would be imposed on the Mexican people. They were \nnot told about the ability to repay. I was there at the last of the \nbriefings when the Chief of Staff came in from Mexico to the President. \nHe was honest. I have to tell you, he shocked me. I was skeptical up to \nthat time. After he finished briefing us, I said, there is no way this \nworks. I felt sorry for him because at least he was honest and told us \nthe problem: 70 billion dollars' worth of short-term debt coming \nthrough within 12 months.\n  Let me tell you something. You do not stop $70 billion with all of \nthe financing that we have talked about; it is insufficient. They can \nroll it over and roll it over, but you have to pay it back. The \ninterest rates are going to be higher, and there is going to be less \ninvestment in there. You are going to have more money flowing out. Oh, \nfor the short term you will keep it and make this mirage and things \nwill sound better. But that is not right.\n  Mr. President, I submit that Congress must have the final say on \nspending of taxpayer dollars on foreign aid or foreign loans. We owe it \nto the hard-working men and women of this country we represent to stand \nup and do what is right. Sometimes it may take some political courage. \nWe are the Senate of the United States. We have a responsibility to the \npeople of the United States. We cannot be cowards. Now is the time for \naction. I urge approval of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, just another thought or two.\n  The Senator from New York mentioned the ESF has never been used in \nthis magnitude before. I think if we face reality and cut out the \ngossamer facade of calling this thing a loan, we will get to the facts \nquicker. It is not a loan. A loan is a euphemism for a total bailout \ngrant that we are never going to be repaid.\n  Usually, money that has been borrowed from the ESF has been repaid \nwithin 90 days. But with this giveaway, we have no assurance that it \nwill ever be repaid at all.\n  Can you imagine if a Senator came to this floor and proposed a $20 \nbillion appropriation for a domestic project? The first thing he or she \nwould be asked is, ``Where will the spending cut come from to pay for \nit?'' Why should it be different when we send $20 billion as a gift to \nMexico without any idea who is going to pay for it--well, we know who \nis going to pay for it: the American taxpayer.\n  I do not think you need a better barometer of what is going on in \nMexico than the trends of the market themselves, with the lowest \ninterest rate in Mexico at 50 percent and running to 70, 80, and 100 \npercent. What does it tell you about the value of the Mexico's debt \nwhen that kind of interest rate is offered? We have asked repeatedly \nwho this debt is owed to. And never once have we been told. Not once \ndid we find out. But we are taking hard-earned American dollars to bail \nout financial investors and speculators around the world who are \ngetting from 18 to 25 to 30 percent, whatever, on these Mexican bonds, \nand we are bailing them out with American money.\n  One further thought. The immigration problem. This was used of \ncourse, to excite us--and I think I would call it the excitement plan \nused by the administration--to encourage us to support this, at first \n$40 billion, and now as the President took the ESF of $20 billion. But \nsome have estimated that illegal immigration may be as low as 40,000 \nmore immigrants if we do not do the bailout. Well, if you look at $20 \nbillion and 40,000 immigrants, we are putting a half million dollars \ninto every potential illegal immigrant. It simply does not make sense. \nIt is a bad idea whose time has not come and will not come.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote for Senator D'Amato's amendment. We \nare hooked with the $5 billion, but let us not send any more good money \nafter bad.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I see that a number of my colleagues who \nmay share a difference of opinion on this are on the floor and if they \nwish to speak, I would be happy to yield the floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Wall Street Journal, \nentitled ``Americans Grow Ugly in Mexicans' Eyes,'' dated March 21, \n1995, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 21, 1995]\n\n    Americans Grow Ugly in Mexicans' Eyes--Rescue Plan Revives Long-\n                         Simmering Resentments\n\n                           (By Dianne Solis)\n\n       Xochimilco, Mexico.--In this postcard perfect town of \n     canals and floating gardens, a favorite of American tourists, \n     Teresa Garcia fumes that her country is becoming a colony of \n     the U.S.\n       Even though the U.S. helped save Mexico from a financial \n     crash by organizing a $52 billion bailout package, many \n     Mexicans such as Mrs. Garcia view the rescue program as a \n     lead parachute.\n       They worry that the rescue plan calls for such severe \n     austerity measures that Mexico will plunge into a serious \n     recession. They fret about soaring interest rates, which now \n     top 100%. And, perhaps most viscerally, they stew about \n     provisions that make exports by the state oil monopoly, \n     Petroleos Mexicanos, collateral for the rescue package. Many \n     fear the move betrays U.S. designs on Mexico's sacrosanct \n     petroleum operations.\n\n\n                         oil is national symbol\n\n       ``Those jerks want our oil,'' snaps Mrs. Garcia. ``Oil is a \n     great symbol for the middle class and those below. You take \n     it away, you steal our national identity.''\n       As her comments suggest, Mexico's historic anti-\n     Americanism, seemingly vanquished in recent years, is \n     creeping into view again.\n       Signs of the mood shift are cropping up all over. ``We will \n     never agree to the privatization of Pemex,'' the acronym for \n     Petroleos Mexicanos, reads graffiti on a wall across from the \n     Camino Real hotel in Oaxaca, a \n     [[Page S4855]] southern tourist site frequented by Americans. \n     On the Texas border in Ciudad Juarez, workers at a U.S.-owned \n     furniture factory grouse about gringos who won't grant them \n     pay raises, even though labor costs were sliced in half after \n     a Mexican peso devaluation that began last December. ``The \n     only ones who benefit are the American bosses,'' says Carlos \n     Lopez, a 21-year-old worker. Fully 80% of Mexicans polled in \n     a recent survey by the Civic Alliance, a citizens watchdog \n     group, opposed the terms of the U.S. package.\n       Just a year or two ago, such feelings seemed virtually \n     forgotten, Mexico's economy was humming, and more and more \n     citizens were reaching middle-class status, giving them the \n     chance to travel to the U.S. and partake of its material \n     pleasures. Last year's historic North American Free Trade \n     Agreement, which created a giant free-trade zone out of the \n     U.S., Mexico and Canada, seemed to seal the close ties.\n       But the peso devaluation in December, and the prospects of \n     deep economic hardship that followed, have soured the mood. \n     In particular, many Mexicans are distraught that Pemex must \n     now pass all receipts from crude oil exports through the \n     Federal Reserve Bank of New York. This money will only be \n     remitted to Mexico if it remains current on payments it owes \n     on the bailout package.\n       Although both governments insist the arrangement is just a \n     bookkeeping matter and say Mexico has used it in the past, \n     it's harsh medicine for many.\n\n\n                             anger and fear\n\n       Indeed, when Mexican President Lazaro Cardenas nationalized \n     foreign oil companies to resolve a union dispute in 1938, it \n     became one of the country's proudest moments. On Saturday, \n     the 57th anniversary of the nationalization was marked by \n     angry speeches, and overshadowed by rampant-speculation that \n     the government plans to allow foreigners to drill in Mexico's \n     oil fields once again.\n       At a ceremony held by the party of the Democratic \n     Revolution, Mexico's chief leftist opposition party, \n     organizers drew fiery applause when they read a letter from \n     Amalia Solorzano, President Cardenas's widow, warning against \n     giving foreigners any more involvement in Pemex's affairs. \n     ``They won't be satisfied with just draining the veins [of \n     Pemex],'' the letter said. ``They'll keep asking for the head \n     and the docile government will be happy to satisfy them.''\n       But Mexico's complex, love-hate relationship goes beyond \n     oil. Although Mexico occupies only modest space in U.S. \n     history books, Mexican children are drilled by teachers on \n     how the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo forced the sale of \n     Mexico's northern half to the U.S., and on how the U.S. \n     invaded Mexico in 1914 and 1916. In times like these, many a \n     Mexican can be heard to repeat dictator Porfirio Diaz's line \n     from around the turn of the century: ``Poor Mexico. So far \n     from God and so close to the United States.''\n       Although old wounds had healed substantially as the U.S.-\n     Mexico commercial relationship strengthened, memories of \n     domination are being dredged up again. One editorial cartoon \n     has a poor Mexican selling oil under a sign that reads, ``Pay \n     at the booth.'' Collecting the money at the booth behind him \n     is Uncle Sam. Another cartoon shows Mexico as a hungry dog \n     begging at the table of President Clinton, who is holding a \n     plate full of money just out of reach while musing, ``Mmm . . \n     . Let me see if I've forgotten any condition.''\n       A visit to Xochimilco with Mrs. Garcia illustrates some of \n     the frustrations people here are feeling.\n\n\n                             business shut\n\n       A business owner in debt to foreign banks, Mrs. Garcia has \n     suffered such severe credit problems that she shuttered her \n     meat-preservatives and condiments business a month ago and is \n     trying to sell her inventory at a $40,000 loss.\n       Angrily touring her neighborhood, she points out spots \n     where she says people are at least as disillusioned as she \n     is. In front of a tiny restaurant with hand-lettered signs, \n     she says with a sigh. ``The owners are three college \n     professors with masters degrees. They couldn't make ends \n     meet. Look, they had to open this little place to sell \n     [pozole],'' a garbanzo-bean stew popular with the working \n     class.\n       Well past midnight, Mrs. Garcia broods at the home of a \n     neighbor over coffee. The neighbor, an academic from a well-\n     to-do family with servants and nannies, complains her salary \n     has effectively been sliced in half by the devaluation and \n     barely covers her living expenses now.\n       The neighbors direct some of the blame at the Mexican \n     government. But Mrs. Garcia continually returns to the theme \n     of Pemex, and the U.S. threat to its independence.\n       ``What does the U.S. want us to be?'' she sneers. ``A \n     Puerto Rico?''\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, the fact of the matter is the article \ngoes on to talk about how the Mexican people are feeling toward \nAmericans, and the great pain.\n  There are other articles that in graphic detail talk about the \nincredible burdens as it relates to the interest rates that now have \ngone up on small business owners, on the homeowners, on the savage \nprice they are paying.\n  While we may be attempting to help our neighbors to the south, we \nhave enraged their citizens. While we may be well-intentioned, what we \nhave done is seen to it that a select group of investors have been \nbailed out. They have been bailed out by the American taxpayers, by the \nMexican people, who resent our intrusion.\n  They have every right to resent that intrusion, given the sorry, \ndismal performance of their Government in giving out laudatory \nexpressions over the past years, going back to past administrations, \nthat had the United States believe that Mr. Salinas and his people were \nthe answer to all their problems, and represented, truly, free markets \nand democracy, when that was, obviously, now, a myth.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague on the floor who wishes to make his \nstatement. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I have been listening to this exchange \nwith some interest and some bemusement--if one can use that term--with \nrespect to a matter that has such potential serious consequences. This \nought to be underscored: A matter of the utmost gravity.\n  The New York Times on the 25th had an article headlined ``Mexico's \nRecovery Plan Shows Signs It Is Working.'' Two weeks after it was \nintroduced, Mexico's tough new recovery plan is showing the first signs \nthat it may be working.\n  The floundering peso has started to stabilize while the economy is \nbeing squeezed even more tightly. The article ends up with a quote from \nthe director of analysis in a brokerage firm in Mexico City, saying \n``There is a little bit more confidence in Mexico. Things are getting \nbetter. But there is still a long way to go.''\n  Now, if there was any doubt about whether what we do here or what we \nsay here--let alone what we do--may have significant consequences, this \nMexican crisis may prove the point.\n  Let me go back with a little history. On the 11th of January, one of \nmy colleagues took the floor and this is what he said:\n\n       Mr. President, while American diplomats and foreign policy \n     pundits handwring over various crises in Eurasia, and the \n     American military is hand-holding the doomed in a number of \n     Third World quagmires, an economic crisis of alarming \n     proportions is threatening to engulf our nearest neighbor to \n     the south. Could there be a better example of the failure of \n     our foreign policy than the potential collapse of Mexico?\n\n  Continuing with this statement:\n\n       I believe that charity begins at home. Mexico and Canada \n     are part of the American family. Yes, we bicker, we snipe, we \n     engage in the kind of heated battles only family members \n     could get away with, but in the end it is the family ties \n     that bind. We can no longer take our good neighbors for \n     granted. Our national security and our economic well-being \n     are inextricably linked to the health and stability of \n     Mexican society and the Mexican economy.\n\n  Let me repeat that colleagues' statement here.\n\n       We can no longer take our good neighbors for granted. Our \n     national security and our economic well-being, are \n     inextricably linked to the health and stability of Mexican \n     society and the Mexican economy.\n       We face a far greater threat from instability in Mexico \n     than we will ever face from open conflict or economic chaos \n     in most of the places American diplomatic attention and \n     foreign aid are currently focused. We must help the Mexicans \n     stabilize the peso to renegotiate their debt, and to develop \n     an economic strategy of long-term investment and growth that \n     will improve the quality of life of all Mexicans and, by \n     extension, the quality of life of all Americans.\n      To do as we have been doing, to focus on the problems of \n     other continents while ignoring our own, is asking us to \n     worry over a distant storm as wolves gather in our own \n     backyard.\n\n  That is a very strong statement about the Mexican problem and a very \nstrong statement about the United States responsibility to respond to \nthe Mexican problem. That statement was made by my colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from New York, Senator D'Amato, who has just \nspoken at great length here on the floor.\n  This was on January 11. Of course, the administration, I assume in \npart influenced by Senator D'Amato's statement about responding to the \nMexican situation, influenced by this strong, forceful declaration in \nthe Senate as to what needed to be done with respect to Mexico, and the \nresponsibility of the \n[[Page S4856]] United States to respond--I am sure the administration \nwas impacted by that statement. And of course they began to try to \nconstruct some package that would enable the United States to play a \nrole in addressing the economic crisis confronting Mexico.\n  The Treasury and the Federal Reserve came to the Congress to seek \ncongressional authorization for a loan package to provide assistance to \nMexico. That loan package in fact was in the amount of $40 billion. \nWhat we are now talking about is the use of the Exchange Stabilization \nFund for $20 billion, with the international community coming in for \nother amounts to create a larger package which is judged as necessary \nif Mexico is going to be able to move out of this crisis.\n  But the administration came to the Congress to seek approval from the \nCongress of a loan guarantee package of $40 billion. That loan \nguarantee package, the administration's request, was endorsed by the \nRepublican and Democratic leadership of the Congress.\n  We want to be very clear here about where the responsibilities are, \nand clear about this amendment in its historical context. It needs to \nbe made clear that there is a recovery program now underway in Mexico, \nand if the rug is pulled out from under that recovery program the \nresponsibility for that also needs to be made clear.\n  The recovery program has risks connected with it. No one has denied \nthat. There has to be some evaluation of those risks, and weighing \nthem, but on the 12th of January, President Clinton and the \ncongressional leaders issued a joint statement on Mexico's currency \ncrisis after meeting at the White House. I will quote from that \nstatement. This was the statement of the Republican and Democratic \nleadership of the Congress, both Houses.\n\n       We agree that the United States has an important economic \n     and strategic interest in a stable and prosperous Mexico. \n     Ultimately the solution to Mexico's economic problems must \n     come from the people of Mexico. But we are pursuing ways to \n     increase financial confidence and to encourage further reform \n     in Mexico. We agree to do what is necessary to restore \n     financial confidence in Mexico without affecting the current \n     budget at home.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that statement be printed \nin the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. The submission of that proposal was followed by \nextensive consultations between the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and \nMembers of the House and Senate to craft a package that could win \ncongressional approval. A January 14 article in the Washington Post \nreported:\n\n       Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Federal Reserve \n     Chairman Alan Greenspan canvassed Capitol Hill, briefing \n     legislators on the details of the plan and lobbying for \n     support. At a question and answer session attended by more \n     than 100 legislators yesterday morning, many Members of \n     Congress questioned Rubin, Under Secretary Lawrence Summers, \n     about whether the proposed rescue package would put U.S. tax \n     dollars at risk. And some demanded assurances that the United \n     States would extract broad promises of economic reform from \n     the Mexican Government before the Treasury extended any \n     financial support. But at the close of the 2-hour meeting, \n     House Speaker Newt Gingrich told the gathering that the \n     Republican leadership in the House stood firmly behind the \n     administration's rescue plan, ``We have zero choice on \n     this,'' he said, according to those who attended the meeting. \n     ``Republican leadership,'' he added, ``is committed to doing \n     everything we can to make it work.''\n       ``There is generally a consensus that as the leadership \n     agreed last night, we need to do what is necessary to make \n     this work,'' Senate majority leader Robert J. Dole said after \n     the morning meeting. ``We do not have the luxury of waiting \n     very long,'' he added.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that article be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, there then followed 2 weeks of extensive \nefforts by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and congressional leaders \nto craft the package. A January 19 article in Roll Call reported, ``Not \nonly did House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate majority leader Bob \nDole immediately back President Clinton in offering a $40 billion''--\nand I emphasize that $40 billion--``loan guarantee to Mexico, but House \nand Senate task forces have been working tirelessly with the \nadministration and Mexican officials to craft legislation to put the \nguarantee into effect. This period ensued with these discussions with \nthe Congress, with the Federal Reserve and the administration.''\n  And an article in the Financial Times recounts what transpired. I \nquote it:\n\n       It was around 8 p.m. on Monday, January 30, that Leon \n     Panetta, White House Chief of Staff, finally accepted that \n     the administration's plan to rescue Mexico with up to $40 \n     billion of loan guarantees was not going to work. Two phone \n     calls in the space of a few minutes had virtually made up his \n     mind.\n      One was Newt Gingrich, the new Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, the other from Mexico, Guillermo Martinez \n     Ortiz, the Mexican Finance Minister. The message from \n     Gingrich was simple and pessimistic. Congress was \n     objecting to the loan guarantee package, and the chances \n     of its rapid and successful passage were slim and \n     worsening. The conversation with Ortiz was also deeply \n     worrying. Money was flowing out of Mexico so rapidly that \n     without U.S. help they would soon have to abandon the \n     convertibility of the peso. According to the article, \n     Speaker Gingrich told Panetta it would take at least \n     another 2 weeks to line up support for the package. If the \n     President acted on his own, Congress would breathe a huge \n     sigh of relief.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       According to the article, Speaker Gingrich told Panetta it \n     would take at least another 2 weeks to line up support for \n     the package. If the President acted on his own, Congress \n     would breathe a huge sigh of relief.\n\n  Let me just recount what has transpired up to this point and where we \nare. The administration, confronted with an economic crisis in Mexico, \nsought to devise a package to respond to the situation. It in effect \nwas urged to do so by Members of the Congress and many other \ncommentators on public policy issues. Some of my colleagues in this \nChamber took the floor to underscore the seriousness of the Mexican \ncrisis, and the interrelationship between our two countries. ``Our \nnational security and our economic well-being are inextricably linked \nto the health and stability of the Mexican society and the Mexican \neconomy.''\n  Statements of that sort, which urged that we must help the Mexicans \nstabilize the peso and renegotiate their debt, were being heard from \nvarious Members of the Congress. The administration came to the \nCongress proposing a loan guarantee program for $40 billion and seeking \nthe approval of the Congress for that loan guarantee package. The \nadministration's proposal was supported by leadership of the Congress, \nand I quoted statements from both Speaker Gingrich and Majority Leader \nDole supporting the administration's effort. As Senator Dole said--this \nis after the administration submitted at a briefing the loan guarantee \npackage--``There is generally a consensus that, as the leadership \nagreed last night, we need to do what is necessary to make this work.''\n  As we all well know, the efforts to muster congressional approval for \nthe loan guarantee package of $40 billion ran into difficulty. And it \nwas then that there was indication from some of the leadership. Speaker \nGingrich stated, ``If the President acted on his own, Congress would \nbreathe a huge sigh of relief.''\n  That Financial Times article, from which I was quoting, then went on \nto say that the decision was then made to abandon the loan guarantee \npackage which leadership had endorsed but for which there was \ndifficulty commanding approval in the Congress. To abandon the loan \nguarantee proposal and develop a new support package centering on $20 \nbillion of finance from the Exchange Stabilization Fund. So a new \napproach was taken.\n  On January 31, a joint statement was issued by President Clinton, \nSpeaker Gingrich, House Minority Leader Gephardt, Senate Majority \nLeader Dole, and Senate Minority Leader Daschle. That statement said, \nand I quote, this is now quoting the statement of the President, \ncongressional leadership, Speaker Gingrich, Majority Leader Dole and \nleaders Gephardt and Daschle.\n\n       We agree, that in order to ensure orderly exchange \n     arrangements and a stable system of exchange rates, the \n     United States should immediately use the Exchange \n     Stabilization Fund to provide appropriate financial \n     assistance for Mexico. We further agree that, under title 31 \n     of the United States Code, section 5302, the President has \n     full authority to \n     [[Page S4857]] provide this assistance. Because the situation \n     in Mexico raises unique and emergency circumstances, the \n     required assistance to be extended will be available for a \n     period of more than 6 months in any 12-month period.\n\n  The statement then goes on to indicate that the support that is \ncoming from other nations, from the IMF, through the Bank for \nInternational Settlement, and then it goes on to say, and I quote:\n\n       We must act now in order to protect American jobs, prevent \n     an increased flow of illegal immigrants across our borders, \n     ensure stability in this hemisphere, and encourage reform in \n     emerging markets around the world. This is an important \n     undertaking, and we believe that the risk of inaction vastly \n     exceed any risk associated with this action. We fully support \n     this effort, and we will work to ensure that its purposes are \n     met. We have agreed to act today.\n\n  That is the end of the statement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full statement of the \nPresident and the congressional leadership be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 3).\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, on that day, the IMF announced that the \nIMF was prepared to provide just under $18 billion standby credit to \nMexico. The central banks of a number of industrial countries also said \nthat they would consider providing $10 billion in short-term support \nthrough the Bank for International Settlement. So the second approach \ndrew in greater support out of the international community than had \nbeen provided for in the first approach.\n  A Reuter's report of January 31 stated, and I quote:\n\n       Senate Republican leader Bob Dole said Congress' Republican \n     and Democratic leaders would write President Clinton a letter \n     backing his new Mexican aid plan. ``He won't be out there by \n     himself,'' Dole told reporters. Dole said he, House \n     Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich, Senate Democratic leader \n     Daschle, and House Democratic leader Gephardt would send \n     Clinton the letter of support. Dole said he had checked with \n     other Senators, including some who had opposed Clinton's \n     request for $40 billion in loan guarantee for Mexico, before \n     deciding to write the letter. ``In my opinion, most everybody \n     is on board supporting Clinton's new plan to commit $20 \n     billion from the U.S. Currency Exchange Stabilization Fund'', \n     Dole said.\n\n  A New York Times article of February 2 quoted Speaker Gingrich as \nfollows:\n\n       ``The President exercised his authority,'' Mr. Gingrich \n     said today. He took a tremendous burden on his shoulders. He \n     did what key leaders felt was necessary.\n       I think people at a minimum should recognize the President \n     had the courage to do what he was being told by the very \n     sophisticated experts was vital to reinforce international \n     markets.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that those two articles be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 2, 1995]\n\n                       Rescue: Durable or Brief?\n\n                          (By David E. Sanger)\n\n       Washington.--President Clinton's move to sidestep Congress \n     and order emergency credits to Mexico halted a monthlong run \n     on the peso, but it left Congressional critics and reluctant \n     American supporters worrying that the bailout's success would \n     prove temporary.\n       A debate over the solidity of the plan arose today as the \n     International Monetary Fund prepared to approve an emergency \n     $17.8 billion in medium-term loans.\n       Officials said the money would be available immediately to \n     help the Mexican Government keep from defaulting on $40 \n     billion in bonds and other liabilities that come due for \n     payment this year. But the deliberations came as Germany and \n     France bitterly complained that they had not been consulted \n     by the White House and that the money might come out of aid \n     to Eastern Europe and Russia.\n       On Capitol Hill, opponents of any American involvement in \n     Mexico's bailout threatened hearings, focusing on what the \n     Administration knew about Mexico's distress last year and how \n     President Clinton diverted $20 billion in Treasury Department \n     funds--intended to stabilize the dollar on world markets--to \n     provide Mexico with emergency loans.\n       Not surprisingly, some of the harshest criticism came from \n     Patrick J. Buchanan, the leader of the effort to kill any aid \n     to Mexico.\n       ``The looting of America, on behalf of the new world order, \n     has begun,'' said Mr. Buchanan. ``Never again should a \n     President be allowed to disregard the will of Congress to \n     raid the U.S. Treasury to bail out Wall Street banks or a \n     foreign regime.''\n       Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican and an expected \n     contender for his party's nomination for President in 1996, \n     said Mr. Clinton was ``filling a bucket that is full of \n     holes.''\n       But the President's action was defended by an unlikely \n     ally: Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the Republican-controlled \n     House of Representatives.\n       ``The President exercised his authority,'' Mr. Gingrich \n     said today. ``He took a tremendous burden on his shoulders. \n     He did what key leaders felt was necessary.\n       ``I think people at a minimum should recognize the \n     President had the courage to do what he was being told by the \n     very sophisticated experts was vital to reinforce \n     international markets.''\n       To sell the President's action, Treasury Secretary Robert \n     E. Rubin assured skeptical Republicans and Democrats on \n     Capitol Hill that Mexico had agreed to fundamental economic \n     reforms and would be held to those commitments.\n       The reforms, spelled out in a letter from Mexican officials \n     to the I.M.F. last week, include a more independent central \n     bank, controls on credit expansion, continued privatization \n     of Government-owned industry and relaxation of many of \n     economic controls, including prohibitions on foreign \n     investment in Mexican banks.\n       But Treasury officials acknowledged today that while they \n     had talked about the loan conditions in general terms with \n     Mexico, there was nothing on paper. Already the conditions \n     are being described in Mexico in far more lenient terms than \n     they are in Washington.\n       For the American economy, the most important question is \n     whether the bailout strengthens the peso. Its current level \n     makes American goods 35 percent more expensive in Mexico than \n     they were in December, and Mexican goods that much cheaper in \n     the United States.\n       The current rate also seems to many economists to be likely \n     to encourage far more illegal immigration across the border \n     as Mexicans seek jobs that pay in dollars.\n       Mr. Clinton offered one of his most impassioned defenses of \n     his action on Tuesday night in Boston.\n       ``I know the surveys say that by 80 to 15, or whatever they \n     said, the American people either didn't agree or didn't \n     understand what in the world I'm up to in Mexico,'' he \n     declared. ``But I want to say to you, it might be unpopular, \n     but in a time of transition it's the right thing to do.''\n       Some of the harshest criticism of the Administration's \n     action today came from European capitals, which were taken by \n     surprise by the International Monetary Fund's decision--under \n     strong pressure from the White House--to add $10 billion in \n     aid to Mexico. That is in addition the $7.8 billion that the \n     I.M.F. approved last week.\n       An I.M.F. official in Washington said some European \n     governments were concerned that the fund's remaining \n     resources might not be enough to deal with crises in other \n     parts of the world.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       Copyright 1995 Reuters, Limited.\n       January 31, 1995, Tuesday, BC cycle.\n       Section: Money Report; Bonds Capital Market; Domestic \n     Money; Financial Report.\n       Length: 151 words.\n       Headline: Dole says Congress's Leaders Back Mexico Plan.\n       Dateline: Washington, Jan. 31.\n       Body: Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said Congress's \n     Republican and Democratic leaders would write President \n     Clinton a letter backing his new Mexico aid plan.\n       ``He won't be out there by himself,'' Dole told reporters.\n       Dole said he, House Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich, \n     Senate Democratic Leader Thomas Daschle and House Democratic \n     Leader Richard Gephardt would send Clinton the letter of \n     support.\n       Dole said he had checked with other senators, including \n     some who had opposed Clinton's request for $40 billion in \n     loan guarantees for Mexico, before deciding to write the \n     letter.\n       ``In my opinion, most everybody's on board'' supporting \n     Clinton's new plan to instead commit $20 billion from the \n     U.S. currency exchange stabilization fund, Dole said.\n       The new plan does not need Congress's approval. Dole said \n     the $40 billion in loan guarantees would not have been \n     approved by Congress this week or next.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Now, these are the steps that transpired that led us to \nthis point. And pursuant to this support of the leadership, the backing \nof the congressional leaders, the very explicit statements of Speaker \nGingrich and Majority Leader Dole, the administration proceeded to use \nthe Exchange Stabilization Fund on the basis of the package that had \nbeen outlined. Now, in effect, that approach would be negated by this \namendment. That is what this amendment would do. And obviously, such a \nnegation has very broad consequences, conceivably even immediately as \nthe markets would react to this proposal that is before us.\n  Now, make no mistake about it, an effort was made to provide \nassistance to Mexico. Many Members of this body \n[[Page S4858]] urged that that be done. The administration submitted a \nloan guarantee proposal to the Congress and sought the approval of the \nCongress. Time passed. That approval was not immediately forthcoming. \nThe crisis worsened. The administration then responded, in effect, to a \nsignal from the leadership in which they indicated that they would \nwelcome the President acting.\n  So the President moved to use the Exchange Stabilization Fund, a \nprovision under existing law. That use was strongly supported in a \njoint statement by the leadership, and a package was put into place \nwhich gives some signs of working. No one can guarantee it. And there \nare risks associated with it. One would be clearly imprudent to pass \nover the risks. But the risks connected with not doing anything were \nvery clearly made earlier by majority leader Dole in one of his \nstatements as we were proceeding to consider this matter.\n  So, Mr. President, this is an interesting exercise that is going on \non the floor today, but I think it very important to place it in the \ncontext of what has transpired and to make very clear, first, the \nadministration coming to the Congress, the response of the \ncongressional leaders, and then the support of the congressional \nleaders for using the Exchange Stabilization Fund.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n            white house, congress joint statement on mexico\n\n       Washington, Jan. 12 (Reuter).--President Clinton and \n     Congressional leaders issued the following joint statement on \n     Mexico's currency crisis after a meeting at the White House.\n       ``We agree that the United States has an important economic \n     and strategic interest in a stable and prosperous Mexico. \n     Ultimately, the solution to Mexico's economic problems must \n     come from the people of Mexico. But we are pursuing ways to \n     increase financial confidence and to encourage further reform \n     in Mexico. We agree to do what is necessary to restore \n     financial confidence in Mexico without affecting the current \n     budget at home.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 14, 1995]\n\n U.S. Plan To Aid Mexico Calms Financial Markets; Loan Guarantees Get \n                         Cautious Hill Backing\n\n               (By Clay Chandler and Martha M. Hamilton)\n\n       The Clinton administration's plan for bailing out Mexico's \n     economy calmed investors yesterday and buoyed the peso. It \n     also drew cautious, but generally favorable reviews from \n     members of the new Congress.\n       The Mexico rescue plan--a package of $40 billion in loan \n     guarantees outlined Thursday night after a White House \n     meeting between President Clinton and congressional leaders--\n     boosted stock prices and currencies throughout the hemisphere \n     yesterday. Analysts said the size of the package--at the high \n     end of the range described Thursday night--appeared to be big \n     enough to sustain investor confidence.\n       The peso rallied sharply to close at 5.25 to the dollar, a \n     strong gain from Thursday's 5.5 rate. When the crisis began \n     Dec. 20, the peso was trading at about 3.4 to the dollar. \n     Stock prices surged 4.6 percent on the Mexico City market, \n     with the main index up 97.7 points to close at 2,216.55.\n       ``There is definitely a floor under the market that wasn't \n     there before the announcement,'' said Thomas Trebat, Chemical \n     Banking Corp.'s managing director responsible for emerging \n     markets research.''\n       John Daly, senior vice president-global fixed income of \n     John Hancock Mutual Funds, declared: ``The worst of it is \n     behind us.''\n       Yesterday morning, as markets took the measure of Thursday \n     night's announcement, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and \n     Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan canvassed Capitol \n     Hill, briefing legislators on the details of the plan and \n     lobbying for support.\n       At a question-and-answer session attended by more than 100 \n     legislators yesterday morning, many members of Congress \n     questioned Rubin and Treasury Undersecretary Lawrence H. \n     Summers about whether the proposed rescue package would put \n     U.S. tax dollars at risk. And some demanded assurances that \n     the United States would extract broad promises of economic \n     reform from the Mexican government before the Treasury \n     extended any financial support.\n       ``I'm going to need a lot more information before I sign on \n     the dotted line,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa).\n       But at the close of the two-hour meeting, House Speaker \n     Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) told the gathering that the Republican \n     leadership in the House stood firmly behind the \n     administration's rescue plan. ``We have zero choice on \n     this.'' he said, according to those who attended the meeting. \n     The Republican leadership, he added, is committed to doing \n     ``everything we can to make it work.''\n       ``There's generally a consensus that, as the leadership \n     agreed last night, we need to do what's necessary to make \n     this work,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.) \n     said after the morning meeting. ``We don't have the luxury of \n     waiting very long,'' he added.\n       To succeed, the plan needs speedy endorsement on the Hill. \n     Delays and protracted bickering over budget issues or \n     conditions of the loan guarantees could trigger another slide \n     for the peso, Treasury officials and investors said \n     yesterday. But timing for congressional action on the plan \n     remains unclear.\n       ``I think the timetable will start to gel early next \n     week,'' said Sen. Robert F. Bennett (R-Utah), a member of a \n     task force of Senate Republicans who met in Dole's office \n     yesterday afternoon to discuss handling of the measure.\n       Without the approval of Congress, the administration will \n     not be able to translate the financial support proposal--\n     which closely resembles a similar formula devised to extend \n     loan guarantees to Israel in 1992--into action. Under budget \n     law, the government must set aside money to cover any \n     potential losses from loan guarantees, a move requiring \n     congressional consent.\n       In some ways, congressional reaction to the \n     administration's proposal yesterday mirrored the divisions \n     that arose during the 1993 battle over the North American \n     Free Trade Agreement, with pro-labor Democrats and some \n     conservation Republicans raising doubts about the plan.\n       ``What I want to know is: `How much is it going to cost us \n     really?''' said Sen. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.) one of NAFTA's \n     most strident critics, of the Mexican assistance plan.\n       Lawmakers from both parties said they would feel a lot more \n     comfortable about voting to back up the peso if other wealthy \n     nations would be persuaded to share the financial burden. \n     ``If the Mexican default is a major risk to the global \n     economy, it sure seems to me that the Japanese and the \n     Europeans should be involved,'' said Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman \n     (D-Conn). Rubin and Summers argued yesterday that there \n     simply wasn't enough time to line up international \n     cooperation.\n       ``I think something has to be done'' to shore up the \n     Mexican economy, said Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.). Without \n     prompt U.S. action, the peso's collapse threatens to ``ripple \n     through the whole world economy,'' he said. But Bradley, too, \n     insisted that the loan guarantees be conditioned on stringent \n     economic reforms in Mexico and stressed that the United \n     States should not attempt to manage the peso crisis alone.\n       Administration officials proposed to members of Congress \n     yesterday that the loan guarantees might be secured by rights \n     to profits from the sale of Mexican oil reserves--a notion \n     that is sure to elicit controversy within Mexico. And Dole \n     suggested loan guarantees to Mexico might carry a much \n     steeper risk than the assurance extended to Israel. ``I \n     assume you'd charge Mexico as high as 10 percent because they \n     are a greater risk,'' he told reporters following the \n     meeting.\n       In the eyes of financial traders, final details of the \n     package appeared to matter less than the solid signal of \n     commitment from the United States.\n       ``There was a major panic this week, and I think that was a \n     bit of a climatic sell-off, where people threw up their hands \n     and said maybe Mexico is going to disappear,'' said John \n     Ford, vice president of the T. Rowe Price Latin American Fund \n     in London.\n       The price of Mexican par bonds, which had gone from 56 \n     cents on the dollar to about 45 cents on the dollar, was back \n     to 53 cents yesterday, said John Hancock's John Daly.\n       The news of the loan guarantees also benefitted markets in \n     other Latin American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, \n     Chile and Peru, where stock markets suffered through one of \n     their worst days in years on Tuesday. Jose A. Estenssoro, \n     president of the privatized Argentine oil company YPF S.A. \n     said the United States had no choice but to support Mexico \n     through the crisis.\n       ``It's not something that will have an effect on Argentina \n     directly, but it probably will indirectly because it will \n     give Mexico a chance of solving the very, very serious \n     problems they have caused for everybody,'' he said.\n       If the Mexican government takes advantage of the guarantees \n     offered by the Treasury Department on Thursday, it would draw \n     U.S. commercial banks back into a loan market they have shied \n     away from for more than a decade--Latin American public debt.\n       Public sector loans badly burned industry giants such as \n     Citicorp and BankAmerica Corp., when the Mexican government \n     renegotiated loan terms in 1982. Several bankers said that \n     while the Treasury Department's guarantees were reassuring, \n     they hoped not to have to make the loans--even though, they \n     said, Mexico in 1995 is a fundamentally different country \n     than Mexico in 1992.\n       Then the government was much more closely involved in a \n     closed Mexican economy that depended heavily on oil exports--\n     just when oil prices plummeted, depriving the government of a \n     primary means of paying debts. Now, the Mexican government \n     sports a balanced budget, a smaller debt burden and a more \n     open economy with diverse sources of income.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n\n   STATEMENT BY PRESIDENT CLINTON, SPEAKER GINGRICH, MINORITY LEADER \n        GEPHARDT, MAJORITY LEADER DOLE, MINORITY LEADER DASCHLE\n\n       We agree that, in order to ensure orderly exchange \n     arrangements and stable system of \n     [[Page S4859]] exchange rates, the United States should \n     immediately use the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) to \n     provide appropriate financial assistance for Mexico. We \n     further agree that under Title 31 of the United States Code, \n     Section 5302, the President has full authority to provide \n     this assistance. Because the situation in Mexico raises \n     unique and emergency circumstances, the required assistance \n     to be extended will be available for a period of more than \n     six months in any 12 month period.\n       The U.S. will impose strict conditions on the assistance it \n     provides with the goal of ensuring that this package imposes \n     no cost on U.S. taxpayers. We are pleased that other nations \n     have agreed to increase their support. Specifically, the \n     International Monetary Fund today agreed to increase its \n     participation by $10 billion for a total of $17.8 billion. In \n     addition, central banks of a number of industrial countries \n     through the Bank for International Settlements have increased \n     their participation by $5 billion for a total of $10 billion.\n       We must act now in order to protect American jobs, prevent \n     an increased flow of illegal immigrants across our borders, \n     ensure stability in this hemisphere, and encourage reform in \n     emerging markets around the world.\n       This is an important undertaking, and we believe that the \n     risks of inaction vastly exceed any risks associated with \n     this action. We fully support this effort, and we will work \n     to ensure that its purposes are met.\n       We have agreed to act today.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. DODD. I wish to thank my colleague from Maryland for his \nstatement, for laying out what I think is critically important, Mr. \nPresident, the historical background that brings us to this moment in \nthe matter before the Senate, the pending amendment offered by our \ncolleague from New York.\n  I think it is important for people to point out the timeframe in \nwhich we are talking about here. We are talking about a little more \nthan 60 days now, as I look at the calendar of events, of the matter \nfirst coming to our attention, as the Senator from Maryland has pointed \nout, roughly on January 11 or thereabouts. It may have been a few days \nearlier than that that the matter actually was raised. But in terms of \nthe statements, it was January 11, and then there were a series of \nstatements made over those days, roughly 60 days ago, 70 days ago, as I \nunderstand it, Mr. President.\n  It seems to me that when you have a matter of this import, the \nimplications of which, as the Senator from Maryland has pointed out, \nare as profound as they are, then we ought to be very conscious of the \nimplications should this amendment be adopted.\n  I know the Senator from Maryland has asked unanimous consent that \nvarious statements be included in the Record at the end of his remarks. \nI would like to ask as well, Mr. President, that some additional \nremarks by Brent Scowcroft at the Treasury Department briefing on \nJanuary 30, about 60 days ago, be printed in the Record, along with a \nstatement of declaration of support for the President's actions which \nwas signed by former Presidents George Bush, Jimmy Carter, and Gerald \nFord; former Secretaries of State James Baker, Lawrence Eagleburger, \nAlexander Haig, Henry Kissinger, Ed Muskie, and Cyrus Vance; former \nSecretaries of the Treasury Joseph Barr, Lloyd Bentsen, Michael \nBlumenthal, Henry Fowler, and David Kennedy; former Secretaries of \nCommerce Frederick Dent, Juanita Kreps, Robert Mosbacher, Elliot \nRichardson, Maurice Stans, Alexander Trowbridge; former U.S. Trade \nRepresentatives William Brock, William Epert, Carla Hills, Robert \nStrauss, Clayton Yeutter, along with statements from senior \nadministration officials going back several administrations and a \nseries of distinguished scholars as well, indicating the broad-based \nnature, Mr. President, of those who are knowledgeable about these \nissues as to the action taken by the President.\n  I commended at the time Speaker Gingrich and Majority Leader Dole for \ntheir statements. It was highly responsible for them as the leadership \nnow in the Congress of the United States on a matter of this import, \nrecognizing that it would take far too much time and it was likely to \nbe very complicated here in the Congress, to make their recommendation \nthat the President go forward and do what he did 60 days ago. We are \nhardly into this at all.\n  And so I commend my colleague from Maryland for his statement on the \nmatter. I would further point out, Mr. President, I think it is \nimportant to note that just in the last day or so we have seen some \nvery positive signs, by the way, occurring within Mexico.\n  The stabilization package as adopted is a strong one, as our \ncolleague from New York has pointed out, and he is correct in stating \nthat. It is very strong.\n  We had, of course, statements--because there is an exposure here, \npotential exposure, no doubt about that, but if we had not insisted \nupon a tough economic package in Mexico, I am just as certain we would \nhave heard we were not tough enough on insisting that there be strong \neconomic conditions imposed on Mexico to try to get its economic house \nin order, and had we not done that, the exposure to U.S. taxpayers \nmight have been greater.\n  Let me just highlight, if I can, the positive news in the last few \ndays. And, again, we all hope it works. I cannot imagine anyone not \nwanting to see this work. Of course, we are not in on it alone. There \nare a number of other major financial institutions which have made \nsignificant commitments to try to resolve this issue internally. They \nhave upheld the tight money policy, and we are seeing results.\n  The nominal money supply has shrunk by 13 percent since the beginning \nof the year, and the real numbers by 23 percent through March 15. They \nhave tightened their fiscal policy. Most recently, the congress \napproved a 50-percent increase in the value-added tax. Imagine trying \nto do here any tax increase. That is their congress adopting that. \nElectric and energy prices were raised significantly in real terms.\n  These are all over the last few days. Labor and wages seem to be \nunder control. Market conditions have so far kept wage awards \nsignificantly below inflation despite the Government's decision to \ndispense with the PACTO.\n  Already economic adjustments are starting to work as seen by the \nswing in Mexico's trade balance to a surplus of $453 million in \nFebruary, the first surplus, I might point out, since November 1990.\n  The markets are also responding, which is a critical element here. \nHow is the rest of the world reacting to what Mexico is doing?\n  The bolsa in Mexico City is up 15 percent since last week, \nrepresenting a 21-percent gain in dollar terms.\n  Prices on par Brady bonds have risen 11 percent from their recent low \non March 16, and if the collateral is stripped away so that only Mexico \nrisk is measured, the increase in value has been 17 percent.\n  Signs of declining volatility in peso trading have emerged, with the \npeso closing below 7 since March 23, and now trading within a narrower \nrange.\n  The demand for Government securities rose in this week's primary \nauctions to 2.4 times the amount offered. Interest rates dropped 7.7 \npercent, to 75 percent on the benchmark issue.\n  According to March 24 diplomatic reporting, ``analysts are optimistic \nthat the buying strength today of peso was not just bargain hunters but \nrather represents the beginning of a consolidation which will lead to \nrestored growth.''\n  Wall street investment houses, while still more cautious, have also \nseen an upturn in sentiment. For example, last week Merrill Lynch \nincreased its Mexico weighting on its global equity portfolio from 17 \nto 22 percent.\n  If these are in fact early signs that financial market sentiment is \nturning, an important factor has been the much greater transparency now \nmaintained by Mexican economic and financial institutions, and the \ncentral bank in particular.\n  Of particular importance was one of the conditions of our agreements \nwith Mexico, the weekly publication of the central bank's balance \nsheet. The Bank of Mexico transmitted the first of these publications \nlast week.\n  Now, not only us, but all market participants can monitor Mexico's \nprogress in rebuilding international reserves and maintaining tight \ncontrol over the money supply.\n  Reserves are low--the Bank of Mexico announced $7.854 billion as of \nMarch 17. But with this new transparency, nobody in the market has to \nguess how low, and that has provided some reassurance.\n  One can find many pessimistic things to say about Mexico right now--\nthe shattered confidence of foreign investors, the sharp recession \nahead, and the political uncertainties. In particular, \n[[Page S4860]] concerns are focused on: the fragility of the banking \nsector and whether or not the program the Mexicans have put in place \ncan work without the need to print money to bail out the banks.\n  The banks have a serious problem of high levels of loan delinquencies \nand an increasing level of bad loans which may result in the need for \nrecapitalization for many banks;\n  Mexico recognizes this is a crucial problem and is implementing \nmeasures to shore up the banking system. Also, the World Bank and the \nIDB will make over $2 billion in resources available to assist banks \nsuffering from liquidity shortages and to restructure problem banks.\n  The point is that we are beginning to see or hear some very positive \nindications that this proposal that enjoyed such broad support only a \nfew weeks ago is beginning to produce some results.\n  Now I think all of us know here that when we use our remarks here on \nthe floor of the Congress, we can have a profound effect on markets. \nCertainly, my colleague and my friend from New York knows, in his new \ncapacity as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, that it is not \njust another Member talking, it is the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee. He knows full well the significance of his role, and he \ncares about the issue, obviously, very deeply and dearly.\n  But at the very hour that we are trying here to build some \nconfidence, because as Chairman Greenspan pointed out and Jack Kemp, to \nhis credit, testified about how important it was to be involved here--\nhe has a disagreement over what we ought to be doing but, nonetheless, \nhe feels very strongly we ought to be weighing in here--that the word \n``confidence'' is critical.\n  If there is an erosion in confidence, if those who make the decisions \nand make the investments and sit around that table believe that we do \nnot have confidence here that this plan that we have worked out with so \nmany others is about the best we can do and has a chance of succeeding, \nif that confidence erodes within Mexico and the global markets, you \nhave a self-fulfilling prophecy and you will get exactly the \npredictable result.\n  So here, within 60 days or so of having made a decision to go forward \nwith the kind of bilateral support that is critical at moments like \nthis, if we undermine and erode that, if this amendment is adopted--and \nthere will be a vote on it--if this amendment is adopted, then you will \nsee, I believe, the kind of reactions that will not serve anyone's \ninterests well.\n  So I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment. I say that with all \ndue respect to the author of the amendment. He and I have talked about \nthis. We have been in forums elsewhere on it.\n  He is not incorrect to say this is risky. Of course, it has some risk \ninvolved in it. There is no question about that. But the risk of doing \nnothing at all, Mr. President, of allowing the situation to deteriorate \nfurther, certainly, in my view, is a far riskier path to follow.\n  The President of the United States did what a leader is supposed to \ndo in these matters. He does not have the luxury of just making \nspeeches or offering amendments on the subject. Ultimately, his \ndecisions on these matters are critical. It took strength and \nindependence, but also the support of the majority leader of this body \nand the Speaker of the other body to stand with him and say, ``You are \ndoing the right thing. Mr. President, you are doing the right thing.'' \nAnd, as result, him taking that action. And now 60 days later, to come \nin and have this body undo all of that before it has even had a chance \nto prove whether or not it is going to work--and, in fact, signs are \nthat it is beginning to produce the results--I think is the wrong step \nfor us to be taking.\n  But, obviously, each and every one of us here will have to make up \ntheir mind as they come to vote on this matter shortly and decide \nwhether or not to limit the amount of exposure here to the $5 billion, \nwhich will obviously cause people to draw the conclusion we are pulling \nout of this. I cannot imagine how other markets and other places are \ngoing to react if that result occurs. But, if it does, then I think \nvery clearly--very, very clearly--it is this moment on this amendment \nthat will bear a sizable degree of the responsibility for that result, \nin my opinion.\n  We all have to make decisions around here. Some of them are tough. \nThis is not an easy one because, obviously, the potential for exposure \nis there. No question about it. But if this goes south on us, I think \nwe should also be aware of what the implications may be.\n  My colleagues should also be aware that what may happen is not \nlimited, of course, to Mexico. It limits the President's flexibility to \nhelp any country without congressional approval. We have seen Argentina \nrecently going through a very difficult situation. I think they are \ndoing pretty well now and coming out of it. But they will tell you, as \nthe Foreign Minister did to those who met with him a week or so ago, \nthat their economic problems were directly related to the situation in \nMexico. And if we move away here, we could be looking at a situation \nelsewhere in this hemisphere that I think we could come to regret.\n  So, again, I appreciate the good debating points and scoring \nparticular marks here and there. But this is one that, as the Senator \nfrom Maryland has pointed out, has monumental and profound \nsignificance. If this amendment is adopted, as I suspect it is apt to \nbe, again, given the mood here, if it is, I think clearly those who \nhave offered it and those who support it will have to answer ultimately \nif, in fact, the markets react as I think they are apt to.\n  That should have had a question mark at the end of it, Mr. President. \nI apologize to the Chair and my colleagues for that.\n  I thank the Senator from Maryland and I thank my colleague from New \nYork.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I in no way dispute the fact that there \nwere negotiations held by the administration, I think in good faith, \nwith the leadership of the Congress and indeed with the Congress. The \nfact is, they could not build a consensus. The fact is that the \ncongressional leaders, notwithstanding their readiness to help--and, \nindeed, on January 11, I did indicate that we must help Mexico \nstabilize the peso, the peso, to renegotiate their debt.\n  And I say to renegotiate their debt. I have never believed that we \nwere going to pay off everybody dollar for dollar, speculators, \ninvestors, without knowing who they were, just to turn it over to them \nand say, ``Here, come on in to renegotiate this debt.''\n  A guy has a bond that is coming due, and we come in and give him \neverything, dollar for dollar? That is not renegotiating a debt. Is \nthat the way we manage the money of the people?\n  I daresay, the impressive list of names who said yes, we have to \nhelp, all of them that were read--impressive. Is that what they would \nhave done if they were representing their interests, their economic \ninterests? Is that how they would renegotiate a debt? I do not think \nso.\n  My colleague, Senator Faircloth, has pointed out to me that not one \nof them would sign a note. Would they sign a note under these terms? I \ndo not think so.\n  It is wonderful to say we want to help our neighbors. And, yes, I did \nsend this--and I support it--January 11. And I said, because it is a \nlong-term investment in growth that will improve the quality of life of \nall Mexicans and, by extension, the quality of life here in America, \nthis Senator went into this with an open view, as did Senator Dole.\n  Let us talk about what Senator Dole did a month ago, because he was \nconcerned. He was concerned in terms of how his initial readiness to \ncome to the support of his country, in doing what was right, and his \nPresident--and it is our President.\n  In a letter dated March 10, he said: ``My good-faith effort in \nJanuary''--and I am reading parts of it; I will put the whole letter in \nthe Record.\n\n       My good-faith effort in January to cooperate with the \n     administration in no way should be interpreted as any \n     protection from legitimate and responsible congressional \n     oversight. Congress and its committees have every right, and \n     the constitutional duty, to examine it thoroughly.\n\n\n[[Page S4861]]\n\n  He said very specifically on January 31:\n\n       In an effort to avoid the complete financial collapse, I \n     participated with other leaders in a statement supporting the \n     President's use of ESF. However, this expression was not \n     intended and should not be construed, to convey my blanket \n     support for the underlying policies of the administration or \n     for the economic and legal agreements that the administration \n     will enter into. To the contrary, I reserve these judgments, \n     and I have since cautioned the administration to be careful \n     in its use of ESF. I have expressed deep reservations about \n     the shortcomings of the agreement.\n\n  That was March 10.\n  This is from February 24. I will read into the Record what Senator \nDole said from part of the Congressional Record:\n\n       The primary focus of the stabilization plan is not aimed at \n     reversing the fundamental mistakes of devaluation--not now \n     and not over time. The measures described in the agreement to \n     firm up the price of the peso seems almost an afterthought.\n\n  He is being critical of what the administration was now telling him.\n\n       It is one thing to say we want to strengthen the peso, give \n     them an opportunity, give them a term to convert their short-\n     term debt, to restructure.\n\n  And then to hear they are just paying off this debt. They are paying \nthis off.\n\n       They do not address the problems of extinguishing--\n\n  This is Dole--\n\n       The excess pesos that have been coming off the Mexican \n     printing presses even as recently as last week.\n\n  The heart of the problem is the Mexican Government was printing up \npesos. Sure, you are going to devalue it. Those printing presses are \ncontinuing today. Who is benefiting? The Mexican people are not \nbenefiting. I would not brag that we have increased the consumption tax \non working people, poor people in Mexico, by 50 percent and increased \nthe energy tax on the Mexican people. They hold us responsible.\n  I want to know how that helps us. Let us not take the fact that the \ncongressional leaders were willing to undertake and say, yes, Mr. \nPresident, go forward. Now 60 days have followed and what have we found \nout? We know that $5 billion has been spent. We were told initially \nthat this plan would not necessitate our putting out any money. And \nindeed, Alan Greenspan said, ``If you have to draw down our money, the \nplan is not working.'' I am suggesting to you now that the plan is not \nworking. They are drawing down on U.S. money.\n  Let us look at what this bill does. This bill does not say you cannot \nhelp anybody else to stabilize their dollar. I think, by the way, that \ngoes beyond what was intended. I am not going to debate that. It says \nyou can only do it to the extent of $5 billion. I hope that, later on, \nwe will reexamine that, because I think $5 billion gives far too much \nauthority to the administration, to the President, utilizing it as he \nhas as a foreign aid package or as a loan package in contravention of \nthe law.\n  Again, we have an obligation. Let me say, whether or not the leaders \nhave agreed and said, ``Yes, we support you,'' they do not bind us. \nCongress has to vote, with all due respect. Senator Dole is a colleague \nand a friend whose opinion I value. But he went on the record and said, \nlisten, you are not doing what you told us. You are not doing it. You \nare not extinguishing those pesos. The printing presses are still \nrolling on.\n  Let us not abdicate our responsibility. In the next several weeks, \nanother 30 days, there will be x number of dollars committed--another \n$3, $4, $5 billion--and we have reason to believe it is in that nature \nand it is going to be invested. I have to tell you that I did not put \nmy vote into a blind trust based upon good will. And when we examine \nthe good will, we find absent the facts that would have any prudent \nperson making this kind of investment.\n  I daresay it is pretty good for some people as respected economists, \nformer officials, to say they would advise that the United States do \nthis. But it is not their money. It is easy to be frivolous with other \npeople's moneys--taxpayers' moneys. That is what is taking place here.\n  So, the fact of the matter is, I could not care a whit if, at some \npoint in time, the leaders of the Congress said, ``We will let the \nPresident handle this; he will sink or swim on it.'' I think it is more \nimportant, and I think the Constitution of the United States is \nimportant, I think the delegation of our authority--everybody here \nknows what is happening. Do we want to delegate our authority? Are we \nsaying that, for all times, whoever is the President, he or she does \nnot have to come to the Congress with this kind of appropriation that \nwill mean $20 billion? In a rescission bill, we are looking to cut $13 \nor $14 billion. Here is $20-plus billion with no congressional \napproval. Oh, yes, the leaders came together and said, ``We think it is \na good idea, and, by the way, we do not want our people to have to vote \non it, so you go ahead and do it.''\n  Does that absolve us of our responsibilities? Is this weighty? Sure. \nI know I am going to be savaged and pilloried. The investment houses \nare going to be up there beating me up, saying, ``It is the Senator's \nfault.'' I did not create the corruption in Mexico or the devaluation \nin Mexico. I did not make the megabillionaires down there. I did not \ncreate that aristocracy that has robbed from the people for years and \nyears. I did not create the myth that Salinas was a tremendous leader. \nWe were told that for years by administration after administration. \nThey said he is terrific. What terrific? His brother is involved in a \nkilling. His Deputy Attorney General is running away with $24 million \nin the bank. Drugs are coming in here at unprecedented rates. Sixty \npercent of the narcotraffic is coming in from Mexico. The son of the \nformer Agriculture Minister, a billionaire, is dealing in drugs.\n  What is going on? They say, if it collapses, they will blame you. It \nhas collapsed. It has collapsed. When you talk about a rescue of the \nmarket that goes up 10 percent--10 percent from what? From the bottom, \nfrom the floor? It should go up. The dummies up north are sending the \nmoney in. Do we know who we are helping to restructure the debt? No. \nWhat kind of restructuring is this? Did you take Senator Dole as saying \nwe want to help and we understand the importance of Mexico \nstrategically as an ally in our political hemisphere with the borders \nwe share and the commonality of interest, our desire for freedom, and \nyou do whatever you want? Oh, no, nobody assigned that. Senator Dole or \nCongressman Gingrich did not assign that.\n  Ultimately, we have a responsibility, whether we like it or not. We \nbetter well vote on this, one way or the other. If you say that you are \nhappy with the administration, with what they are doing in committee \nand you want to delegate your authority, then, by gosh, vote against \nthis. If you say, I do not want to be responsible because they will \nblame me for the collapse, that is up to you. The fact of the matter is \nthey have collapsed.\n  The people of Mexico are angry at the United States and at their \ncorrupt government. If Zedillo is as good as people say, let us work \nwith him. Let us not give a blank check, as we have and as we are. \nThose conditions do not meet what is merely necessary. Can you imagine \nwe take pride in the fact that Mexico, as a result of the loan we made \nto them, increased their tax by 50 percent on consumption? They \nincreased their prices for energy to the poor. They brought in wage and \nprice controls in certain sectors. Terrific. That we should be happy \nfor? The people already have taken billions of dollars, in terms of \nthose notes, the tesobonos, and European notes; they have come in and \ngotten all of the taxpayers' money, plus 20 percent--in some cases, 25 \npercent--and we do not even know who they are. How did that benefit the \nMexican people? I want to know. How did that benefit the workers when \nthese foreign speculators came in, took their money, and left? How did \nthat keep Mexico and its economy from collapsing? There is some report \nthat says the congressional leadership breathed a sigh of relief.\n  Is that why we are sent here? Is that why we were sent here? To duck \nour responsibilities? When we know darn well that the carrying out of \nthis loan promise, as it is being done, violates the law, that it is \nbeing done in circumvention of what we, the Congress of the United \nStates--not the leaders of the Congress, plus the administration plus \nthe President, but the Congress of the United States has the \nresponsibility as it relates to the authorization and appropriation of \nmoney.\n  [[Page S4862]] From the Constitution, article I, section 9: ``No \nmoney shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of \nappropriations made by law.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, first of all, I think it is very \nimportant to set the record straight in view of the comments by my \ncolleague from New York that any action was taken in violation of law \nor in contravention of law. He may differ with a policy. That is what \nserving here is all about. But to charge people with illegalities is a \ndifferent matter.\n  The Department of Justice, the Assistant Attorney General, issued an \nopinion that found the use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund to \nprovide loans and credits to Mexico was legal, and that opinion \nsupported an opinion of the general counsel of the Department of the \nTreasury which reached the same conclusion.\n  In a memorandum from the Assistant Attorney General to the general \ncounsel of the Treasury Department, a cover memorandum to his opinion, \nhe said:\n\n       Prior to the execution of the agreements--these are the \n     agreements with Mexico--we orally advised your office that in \n     our view the President and the Secretary could use the ESF in \n     the manner contemplated by the President when he proposed a \n     support package. We also provided comments on drafts of a \n     legal opinion prepared by your office for the Secretary \n     regarding such use of the ESF. This memorandum confirms the \n     oral advice we provided to your office. It also confirms that \n     we have reviewed the final version of your legal opinion and \n     that we concur in your conclusion that the President and the \n     Secretary have the authority to use the ESF in connection \n     with the support package.\n\n  Now, if the Senator from New York wants to attack the policy, that is \none matter. But he ought not to accuse people of contravening the law \nunless he can lay out a case to support that. There are two strong \nlegal opinions here, one by the general counsel of the Treasury \nDepartment and one by the Assistant Attorney General, that support the \nauthority of the President and the Secretary to use the ESF in \nconnection with this support package.\n  I want to be very clear about that. There was a saying in World War \nII, ``Loose lips sink ships.'' I do not see why people who are trying \nto do the best they can to deal with a problem and to establish a \npolicy ought to come under attack as having contravened the law when, \nobviously, they had strong legal opinions both from the Department of \nJustice and from the general counsel of the Treasury Department that \nthe action they proposed to take was within the authority of the \nPresident and of the Secretary of the Treasury and when, in fact, the \ncongressional leadership agreed, as well.\n  In fact, they said in the statement of January 31 by the President \nand Speaker Gingrich and Majority Leader Dole and leaders Gephardt and \nDaschle, ``We further agree that under title 31 of the United States \nCode, section 5302, the President has full authority to provide this \nassistance.'' That is, assistance that was going to be provided under \nthe Exchange Stabilization Fund.\n  So let Members quarrel if we choose to do so about the policy, but \nlet Members not levy charges of illegal action when clearly there was \nnone.\n  Let me make one final point about the policy. When the Congress \nindicated difficulty in arriving at support for the $40 billion loan \nguarantee, which was the initial proposal--the use of the Exchange \nStabilization Fund was going to be half of that amount--but when they \nhad difficulty, the leadership then indicated to the President, ``We \nthink you should use the Exchange Stabilization Fund.''\n  Now, that is what happened. They went ahead with that package about 6 \nor 7 weeks ago. That was the plan that was put into affect in order to \ntry to address the crisis in the Mexican economy.\n  Now, if people had said, ``Do not use the Exchange Stabilization \nFund,'' I assume the administration would have pursued its efforts to \ntry to gain congressional approval, which it may or may not have \ngained. In that debate, many of the points that are being raised here \non the floor would have been relevant to reaching a judgment.\n  The use of the fund was a judgment the President made. The \ncongressional leadership supported him. There was general acquiescence \nby the Congress. Here we are, 7 weeks later, after this plan has been \nput into effect, after this package has been devised, after the \nagreements have been reached with the Mexicans, after we have tried to \nget a package working, and now we are going to pull the rug out from \nunder this package.\n  Now, make no mistake about it, that is in effect what is being done \nhere. People need to clearly understand that that is the case. The fact \nis that we had executive-legislative cooperation to try to find a \ncommon approach to resolve this problem. It was achieved. Now we have \nsome Members coming and seeking to undo it.\n  The fact is we have a program that is under way. This, in effect, \nwould negate that program. Be very clear about that. It would negate \nthe program. It does not have an alternative connected with it. It is \nnot as though someone was saying, ``Well, look, I am not so sure about \nyour program, and I have a better program. Here is my program, and it \nis part of this amendment. It is part of this amendment that I have \nbefore you now, right here.'' That is not the case. There is not an \nalternative program connected with this. This is a negation of the \nexisting program, with all the consequences that will flow from that. \nAnd there are severe and serious consequences.\n  So, if the bottom line of the supporters of this program is not that \nMexico can simply collapse--if that is the bottom line, I understand \nthis amendment. Because this amendment would negate the existing \nprogram designed to avoid that collapse.\n It does not substitute a different program to avoid the collapse. So, \nif your bottom line is: Fine, it ought to collapse, then that is \nconsistent with the amendment that is before us. That is the degree and \nthe extent of the serious ramifications and consequences of the \nproposal that is before this body.\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, first of all, I do not recall having used \nthe word ``illegality.'' I used the word ``circumvention.'' I certainly \nthink that is appropriate, and I certainly think that is exactly what \nhas taken place. I have used language in terms of the abdication of our \nresponsibility, and I believe that to be the case.\n  The fact of the matter is we are talking about spending $20 billion \nplus. The fact of the matter is this is foreign aid, and it is a loan, \nand there is a real question as to whether or not those loans can be \nrepaid. If careful reading of those memoranda of law that have been \nsubmitted justify and give to the administration its ability to go \nforward and is the basis, it really talks about that on page 6. It \nsays:\n\n       Although loans and credit are clearly permitted under ESF, \n     their purpose must be to maintain orderly exchange \n     arrangements and a stable system of exchange rates and not to \n     serve as foreign aid.\n\n  We may begin splitting hairs, but let me tell you something. When you \nare paying off the obligations of banks, when you are paying off the \nobligations of a government, you are going far beyond just maintaining \nexchange stabilization rates.\n  If anybody wants to say they know we are going to get paid back, that \nis wrong. Indeed, that is why they set up the collateral system. \nIndeed, when one begins to examine and look at the nature of that \ncollateral system, there is no lien on that oil. And if there is a \ndefault, those revenues that are in the bank at the time can be \nutilized, but let me suggest they are not going to be nearly sufficient \nto cover the kinds of defaults as we get deeper and deeper into this \nwith loan repayments not scheduled in some areas for 7 years out.\n  Look, it may very well be there is no better option. I doubt that. \nWhen the question is raised, ``Do you have a plan?'' we put forth an \nidea. The administration rejected it. We had hearings. We had hearings \nwhere Mr. Perl testified, where Bill Seidman testified. We said we will \nget involved in some workout. You just do not pay people dollar for \ndollar. You come in, here they are.\n  Let me read what Tom Friedman, New York Times, March 8, 1995, wrote. \nIt is very, very interesting:\n\n       [[Page S4863]] Mexican malfunction. Mexico City. So far all \n     that has happened is that the foreign bondholders are cashing \n     in their bonds.\n\n  That is what they are doing. They cashed them in. And where do you \nthink the money came from to guarantee the repayment, to get them the \nrepayment? Plus they got all their interest. Nothing renegotiated; \nnobody said to them, ``Listen, we will roll this over for 10 years.'' \nThat is how you do it. You want to say I am micromanaging? We brought \nthis to the attention of the administration, the Banking Committee, and \nasked them why, long before this. It is not just 7 weeks have gone by \nand there is a wonderful plan. It is 7 weeks and $5 billion of American \ntaxpayers' dollars.\n  Now Congress has an obligation to look and see what is taking place \ndown there--everybody. You are happy with what is going on? Then go \nahead and vote no. If you believe that we are engaged in a plan that \nwill achieve economic stability for Mexico, that is being administered \ncorrectly, that will bring about the desired results for the United \nStates as well, then fine.\n  I have not seen it. I know the printing presses are still turning out \npesos. I know the political stability necessary to carry out that kind \nof plan never can work.\n  Do you think people are really going to continue to sit back and \nallow interest rates at 80 percent? Cannot pay their mortgages? Banks \nbeing run out of capital? Do you think this is going to work?\n  What kind of idea is this? And the printing presses turn it out. The \npesos are still coming off the mill. But we are not supposed to raise \nanything because, you see, then you will be accused of being the person \nwho blew up the economy of Mexico.\n  I did not do it. This Congress did not do it. The American people did \nnot do it. And by sending $20 billion plus down there we are not going \nto rescue them, save them.\n  It was like the fable about the king who had no clothes, no suit. It \ntook a kid saying, ``You have no suit.'' Everybody was around saying, \n``Hurray, hurray.'' They were all afraid to say the king had no suit.\n  We are all afraid to say this program is not working. You have not \ndemonstrated it and we have an obligation to see it, to know how these \ndollars are being spent. We do. We have an obligation to see whether or \nnot this plan is going to work. I have not seen that proof to date.\n  I do not insert myself in here lightly. I waited and I waited. I \nwanted to offer legislation prior.\n  I have not seen anything, but I have learned things that are very \ndistressing. I learned that the so-called underlying collateral may not \nbe there in sufficiency to see to it that we can assure this revenue \nstream. I have seen that the people of Mexico have said, ``Over our \ndead body are you going to take our oil.'' I have seen the public \nrelations and the polls, as it relates to the people of Mexico, blaming \nus for their catastrophe.\n  Look, this is a tough problem, but I do not think we are going about \nit the right way and I do not think we have the right to delegate our \nauthority. That is what we have done. We put our votes, as it relates \nto appropriations, in a blind trust and have given it to the \nadministration. If we want to do that, let us vote to do it. That is \nreally what it comes down to.\n  I am not accusing people of illegality in the sense that we normally \nuse that word. But I am saying it is an abrogation of our authority, \nand I am saying we have an obligation to either vote for or against the \nmethodology in which we are proceeding in Mexico.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, there are a couple of points I would like to \nmake, if I could, about this.\n  First of all, I urge my colleagues--I know it is something we do not \ndo with great regularity around here--but I urge you to read the \namendment. It is only a page and a half long, but I think it is \nimportant that Members read every word of it. The word ``Mexico'' does \nnot appear in this amendment anyplace. So it is not just about Mexico. \nIf this amendment is adopted, as I suspect it is apt to be, it will be \neffective to any country, any place. So when you are talking about a \ncrisis in NATO or Israel or some other place--understand here what we \nare doing with this. By adopting this amendment here we are saying \nMexico, if it were included here--you would say because you were \nunhappy about this plan, this would prohibit, through a program that \nhas been in existence since 1934, the Exchange Rate Stabilization \nProgram, for the President to respond and react.\n  I hope my colleagues, as they assess this amendment, would appreciate \nand understand the implications of this. Talking about $5 billion in \nMexico is one thing. Talking about larger economies where the \nimplications can be far more significant is another matter indeed.\n  President Clinton did not invent the Exchange Rate Stabilization \nProgram at all. This has been around, as I said, for a long time. It \nhas been used. It is designed to be used for these kinds of situations \nto provide some stability because it is in our interests to do so.\n  This is not a Christmastime, some gift we are giving away here. This \nis directly in our interests. Those Members of this body who represent \nStates along the border areas are the ones who will feel it first and \nthe hardest.\n  So when you send a message out here that we are walking away from \nthis, after we encourage the IMF, the Inter-American Development Bank, \nand a variety of other organizations to step forward, here is our \ncommitment on the table, what we will do, would you please join us in \nthis effort? They say, fine, we will agree. And then 6 weeks later we \nsay, sorry, we are going the other way.\n  I mean that is wonderful leadership. That is wonderful leadership, \nglobal leadership in the wake of the end of the cold war, where we run \naround here and our agreements only last about 60 days.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to appreciate what this \namendment does. It goes far beyond Mexico. It goes to the very ability \nof any administration to respond to a crisis that could have \nsignificant implications on our own economy in this country.\n  Again, I think the points----\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What is an administration to do? They come to the \nCongress with a package. Then the leadership said we are having some \ndifficulty with that package, why do you not use the stabilization \nfund?\n  They get legal opinions saying they have the authority to use the \nstabilization fund. They get strong support from the leadership and a \ngeneral acquiescence from the Congress. Let us be honest about it, that \nis what it amounted to. Most Members of the Congress said, ``If the \nPresident wants to take the risk and the burden, you know, let it fall \non his shoulders and in that way we will deal with the Mexican problem \nbut I will not be directly implicated, as it were.'' So they move ahead \nwith it and there is a rescue package in place.\n  Now people come along with an amendment which will destroy that \nrescue package. Make no bones about it, that is exactly what it will \ndo. They do not have an alternative rescue package. They are negating \nthe existing one, unconnected to a replacement package. So, in effect \nthe consequences of a collapse run directly with this amendment, in my \njudgment.\n  This is serious business we are talking about here. This is not \nsimply making sort of political points. This is not simply doing \noversight, where you put them on the griddle but, you know, the policy \ncontinues. This is ending the package and taking the consequences. Is \nthat not correct?\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from Maryland is absolutely correct. It \ndeserves being reiterated. Just consider, and for most people it is not \ndifficult to connect all the dots. Everyone agrees we should do \nsomething. The administration was told by the leadership you cannot get \nsomething through Congress. They come up and say, ``Why don't you use \nthe ESF fund?'' The leadership says, ``That is a great idea. We support \nyou. We back you. Go out and get other people to support it around the \nglobe.''\n  So we have an international response. It is not just the United \nStates stepping forward. The President says, ``Thank you. All right. I \nwill try that. \n[[Page S4864]] I will assume all the responsibility.'' No one has cast \na vote on this because they were told by the new leadership that you \ncannot get the votes up here. ``We cannot produce the votes for you. We \nagree with you. We cannot produce the votes. You take a dive into the \npool.''\n  Now, 6 weeks later, to turn around and say, sorry, we want to \nabsolutely destroy the very idea at the very hour, I reiterate, when \nthere are clear indications that it is beginning to work. If the \neconomic indicators and market responses are accurate in the last 6 \ndays, this is beginning to produce the desired results that we all \nsought. And right at the very moment that we are getting those kinds of \nresults, we walk in and say, ``Sorry. We do not like it anymore up \nhere.'' What kind of leadership is that?\n  What kind of leadership is that to devastate, not just here, I tell \nyou, but as pointed out by knowledgeable people, capital is cautious. \nIt is very, very cautious. When the markets see and investors see a \nschizophrenic Congress, when it comes down to making decisions about \nwhether or not it is going to stick up and stay with something they \nrecommend, that capital does not just depart the target country that is \nthe subject of this debate; it gets skittish all over the world.\n  There is enough ample evidence to support exactly that. We have seen \njust in the last few weeks reactions in Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Hong \nKong, in Singapore, and South Africa--all of which have reacted to the \nMexican situation. That is now beginning to stabilize because it is \nbeginning to work.\n  The adoption of this amendment--and my view is that it will be \nadopted because it is the popular thing to do, I suppose, to go along. \nIf that is the case, then the implications in these other markets, I \nthink, will be felt. Who gets hurt by this? Certainly, these countries \ndo. But do you know who gets hurt most of all? We do. It is a self-\ninflicted wound on American business, on jobs in this country, if this \nis adopted.\n  So, Mr. President, I again respect people disagreeing with various \naspects of proposals. We had a good hearing a few weeks ago. The \nSenator from Maryland is absolutely correct. We had excellent testimony \nfrom Jack Kemp, who came. He would have preferred that the exchange of \nfunds be used to buy pesos. But he prefaced his remarks by saying you \nhave to stay involved here. This is the right course to be followed. He \ndisagrees with the specifics of a program.\n  We heard from Alan Greenspan. Every responsible individual who has \nlooked at this issue, regardless of ideology or politics, has said this \nis the right course to be following. It is in our interest to be \nfollowing it, and particularly when this institution's knees buckled 60 \ndays ago, and we said we cannot face up to this issue. But leadership \nsaid to go ahead and do it; we back you.\n  Then, once they go off a course recommended by the leadership, and \nthen to turn around and say we are now going to pull the rug out from \nunderneath you, that is the height of irresponsibility. The \nimplications of it which we will have to bear are those who vote for \nthis support it, when you get the kind of market reaction we may have \nseen already just as a result of the debate that goes on. There is a \nplace for raising these issues and discussing them, and trying to look \nat it differently. I do not think this is the proper way to be going \nabout it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I am glad to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think many of us believe that the issue which was \ngoing to be before the Senate was the rescission issue. I know Senator \nDaschle had an amendment which many of us were interested in that \ninvolved children, involved education, involved whether we are going to \nsee continued reduction in children's programs and support for \neducation, funds that may very well be used in terms of reducing taxes. \nThe real debate and discussion on the whole question of the Nation's \npriorities was going to take place.\n  I am just wondering about this measure here. What exactly does this \nmeasure have to do with the broader issue of rescissions and the issue \nthat I thought we were debating and which been scheduled by the leaders \nand which many of us thought we were going to have an opportunity to \nexchange views on here this afternoon?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, this has absolutely \nnothing to do with it. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely \ncorrect. The Senator from Oregon is with us, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. The matter before the body was the \nrescissions package. Frankly, like probably most of my colleagues, I \nwas prepared to come over and give a speech on the rescissions package. \nI have the speech. I will be delighted to give it at some point.\n  This matter came up. Frankly, I say to my colleague from \nMassachusetts, were this an amendment not necessarily of great import, \nI would say we move on. But I have to say to my colleague from \nMassachusetts, now that the matter has been raised, it is significant. \nThis is not an insignificant amendment.\n  So I regret that we are in the middle of it. The Senator from New \nYork is exercising his right as a Member of this body, of course, to \nraise an amendment. That is his right, and I certainly would fight to \nprotect his right to do it. He is doing exactly what he has a right to \ndo. I do not disagree with him exercising that right. I have done it \nmyself on other matters in the past. But the fact of the matter is the \nSenator from Massachusetts is correct. This has nothing to do with the \nrescission package.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the reason I raise this is because there \nhas been a good deal of at least talk about how we are going to finish \nthis particular measure, and what period of time, and that we hope we \nwill have a good debate and discuss some of these matters, but that we \nare not going to have prolonged debate and discussion on some of these \nmeasures.\n  Here we are now, well into the afternoon. The schedule is complicated \nby Members having at least made appointments in other parts of the \ncountry, and the rest. But I am just wondering, on a measure of this \nimportance--I see a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, the \nSenator from Connecticut, as well as the Senator from Maryland. This \nwas a measure which was reported out of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague from Massachusetts that this is a \nmatter which has obviously foreign policy implications. But the \njurisdiction of this particular approach comes out of the Banking \nCommittee.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Both Members are on the Banking Committee.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Senator Dodd had the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I am glad to yield to my colleague from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This amendment is not related----\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Is that for a question, Mr. President? If it is not, I \nwill object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Connecticut yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DODD. I yield for a question, certainly.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This matter that has been offered by the Senator from \nNew York is not relative to the rescission bill; is that correct?\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from Maryland is absolutely correct. It has no \nrelationship whatsoever to the rescission.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is it not true that the Senator has the right to offer \nthe amendment, since under the rules of the Senate, you may offer an \namendment to a measure that is not relevant to the measure? Generally, \nthere is a certain amount of self-restraint practiced around here, so \nthat you do not completely exercise your rights to the fullest. But the \nSenator has the right to offer it, if he chooses to do so, even though \nit is not relevant to the measure; is that correct?\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from Maryland is absolutely correct. The \nSenator from New York has the right. As I said a moment ago, I would \ncertainly defend very strongly his right to offer this amendment.\n I disagree totally, completely with the substance of it. But \nnormally----\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. One could also raise a question whether even if you \nhave the right, you ought to exercise it. You do not always exercise \nevery right to \n[[Page S4865]] the fullest, and there should be some restraint.\n  Is it not the case that this amendment, in effect, raises the whole \nbasic question about responding to the Mexican economic crisis, and \nthat a proposal of this sort, if it is to be considered, ought to have \nextensive consideration? This is not a minor matter that should simply \nbe dealt with in an hour or two in this Chamber. This is a major \nproposition that ought to be carefully examined. Does the Senator agree \nwith that?\n  Mr. DODD. I completely agree with my colleague from Maryland. You \nwould have thought--and again, the Senator from Maryland and I are in \nthe minority. The amendment is being offered by the chairman of the \ncommittee of jurisdiction. The chairman of the committee of \njurisdiction certainly has it within his power to set a markup. It \nwould be one thing--if you are the minority, you do not always have the \nrights, but when you are the chairman of the committee and in the \nmajority, certainly setting a markup, scheduling a debate, proceeding \nthrough the normal course in which we do business around here would be \nan appropriate way at least to proceed.\n  I still have a strong disagreement, but to have the majority, the \nchairman of the very committee with jurisdiction bring an amendment to \nthe floor without even going through his own committee is, I point out \nto my colleague from Maryland, a little out of the ordinary.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be delighted to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is it not reasonable to assume that if we had followed \nthe normal process and come through the committee and a measure of this \nsort had been brought to the floor, the debate and the examination of \nthat measure might well take days? That would then be a major item on \nthe calendar of the Senate, would it not, since this is a major issue? \nIt is not as though it is the kind of proposition that the Senate would \ndispose of, if it was dealing with this freestanding, in an hour or \ntwo. The Senate, in effect, would recognize it as the major item to be \nconsidered in the particular week in which it was going to be brought \nup, would it not?\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague from Maryland, not only is he correct \nin that, but there is ample evidence to support it. The Speaker of the \nother body, when asked whether or not he could bring the matter up, 60 \ndays ago said it would take at least 2 weeks, 2 weeks to even raise the \nissue and discuss it with the Members of that body, to determine \nwhether or not they could bring it forward.\n  So the Senator from Maryland is absolutely correct. This would be a \nsignificant, lengthy debate in this body that would probably go on for \na number of days, not a couple of hours, on a floor amendment offered \nto a rescission package.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield to me for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be glad to yield to my colleague from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wish to thank the Senator for coming over. We served \ntogether in the Banking Committee. I do have a question. And, of \ncourse, to my chairman, who has long been concerned about this issue, I \nwant to say that I share a lot of his concerns.\n  I think the question is, Is this the appropriate way to handle this \nmatter? I say to my colleague and friend from Connecticut, a long time \nago I used to be a stockbroker, and the one thing that just set the \nmarkets off was indecision, change, of course, instability, and the \nneed that America stick with its decisions. I just feel that doing this \nin this fashion without, as the Senator from Maryland has stated, ample \ndebate and bipartisan discussion, could set the markets off, the \nmarkets all over the world. And it is something that I fear, frankly.\n  I share my chairman's problems with this whole issue. I think that he \nis right to raise them, but I am very concerned that if we do this \ntoday, the message will go out that America's word is no good, that \nthere is a division here, and I am concerned about the financial and \neconomic impact all over in the world markets.\n  I ask my colleague if he shares that concern.\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague from California, the point she raises \nis an important one. When we had the hearing a few weeks ago--and a \ngood hearing, I would point out--on this issue with the testimony of a \nformer colleague, Jack Kemp; the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, \nAlan Greenspan; former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Paul Volcker; \nalong with Bob Rubin, the Secretary of the Treasury, and others, I \nasked the question about what was the most significant, important \nelement in all of this, regardless of the particular plans.\n  And the word they all agreed on was ``confidence,'' the point having \nbeen raised by others who understand economic issues that there is \nnothing more cautious than capital, and when there is a lack of \nconfidence, that capital lacks confidence. Whether it is domestic \ncapital in Mexico or foreign capital that Mexico is trying to attract \nor investors are trying to bring in, if there is a lack of confidence \nin those who should be acting with responsibility in a leadership \ncapacity to try to avoid the kind of crisis that could be devastating \nfor us, then it seems to me you are going to have the predictable \nresults.\n  Paul Volcker may have said it best in response to a question of my \ncolleague from California.\n\n       Surely this committee is justified in carefully reviewing \n     the approaches taken in this crisis and achieving full \n     understanding of the precipitating events and the responses \n     to them.\n\n  I do not have any disagreement with my colleague from New York \nraising those issues.\n\n       What would be inappropriate, as I see it, would be to \n     either attempt micromanagement of the use of the ESF or to so \n     constrict its future use as to render it ineffective in the \n     face of future crises which, if history tells me anything, \n     are sure to reoccur.\n\n  I point out to my colleague from California that the amendment \noffered by the distinguished Senator from New York does not mention \nMexico. It applies to all situations globally. And so here we are \nsaying, regardless of the crisis, wherever it may occur, that the \nPresident cannot react with the stabilization fund that has existed for \n60 years, since 1934, that every President has used. So even if you \nagree with the point of our colleague from New York on Mexico, which I \nhope a majority does not, but if you did, the adoption of this \namendment applies to everybody on the globe.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield then for a further question? In \nother words, what the Senator from Connecticut is saying is that the \namendment deals with each and every country in the world?\n  Mr. DODD. There is no country specific in here. In fact, the \namendment specifically says, I say to my colleague, that:\n     . . . the Secretary may not take any action under this \n     subsection with respect to a single foreign government \n     (including agencies or other entities of that government) or \n     with respect to the currency of any single foreign country \n     that would result in expenditures and obligations including \n     contingent obligations [of] $5 billion.\n\n  It is global in effect.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So, as I understand it, if a crisis were to develop, let \nus just say in Israel, as an example, or Ireland----\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Italy.\n  Mr. DODD. Italy.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We will take Italy as an example.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Greece.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think this is an important point. We are legislators \nhere. We ought to know what we are doing. If a crisis were to develop \nin a country, and the world leaders got together and said we must act \nquickly--and let us say it was when Congress was not in session, and \nthese things do occur; I have seen wars break out when Congress is \naway--then our President would really be there in form only, because in \nreality he could not act along with other world leaders if there was \nsuch a monetary crisis. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DODD. As I read the amendment, that is the case, because it is \nnot country specific. It does not address Mexico. It says a single \nforeign country. That is pretty broad, to put it mildly.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n   [[Page S4866]] Mr. DODD. I will be happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. My question is to the Senator from Connecticut as to \nthis colloquy that is being engaged. Could I get some idea about how \nmuch longer the Senator will hold the floor? I ask the question in \norder to move this bill. I would like to be able to ask for unanimous \nconsent, and receive unanimous consent when I do have that chance, to \ntemporarily set this amendment aside, that other amendments may be \ntaken up.\n  I only want to put that in the total context. The Senator from \nConnecticut was here a few years ago when I chaired this committee and \nwe had a humongous continuing resolution. We started at 10 a.m. one \nday, and I stood here until 2:30 the next afternoon, but we finished \nit. And I have now the backing of the Republican leader that we are \ngoing to stay here today and tomorrow, for however long, to finish this \nbill.\n  We have been over 3 hours on this issue, and I think we have had \naired an awful lot of the parts of this very complex issue. I would \nlike to be able to temporarily lay it aside in order to get Senator \nMurray of Washington State into the next amendment in preparation for \nan amendment of the minority leader, Mr. Daschle, that deals with more \nprecisely the details of this particular bill.\n  So I am asking for this kind of cooperation. By the same token, I \nmust add, I think if I get that opportunity for unanimous consent, I \nwill ask for 3 minutes on Senator D'Amato's behalf to respond to these \nmost recent comments made by the Senator from Connecticut and others on \nthat side, and then get this set aside, if the Senator will yield for \nthat purpose.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me say to my colleague from Oregon, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, I hold him in tremendously high regard. I \nhave enjoyed immensely my association with him.\n  I did not initiate this debate. I say to my distinguished colleague \nfrom Oregon, I was prepared to come over and address with a floor \nspeech the rescission package.\n  I have been put in this situation because our good friend from New \nYork has raised this amendment on the Senator from Oregon's bill. It is \nnot an insignificant matter. I wish it were. I would have no difficulty \nwhatsoever.\n  But I, as a Senator, have a responsibility on something that I think \nhas tremendous implications if left in the present status and adopted, \nas I am fearful it is apt to be, in terms of what happens after that.\n  Now the rescission package is important. It is critically important. \nIf we adopt this amendment, and the implications occur, it dwarfs the \nimplications of the rescission package.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I understand the Senator's position. I am not \nsuggesting we dispose of this amendment at this moment.\n  If we could set it aside temporarily, it means it comes back at a \ncertain time, too, for final disposition. I am not suggesting to the \nSenator that we have final disposition at this moment.\n  Give us a breather, is what I am asking, so that we can take up these \nother amendments. Because we are going to be here. We have probably 30, \n40 amendments. Again, I cannot be more forceful than to say we are \ngoing to stay here. And when it comes to be 1 a.m. tomorrow morning, \neverybody is going to be wondering why we are here.\n  I am just saying that, this morning I made the comment and I am \nmaking it again at 2:20, no one has to question at 1:30 tomorrow \nmorning, if we are here: Why are we here? We are here because we have \nbeen stalled on this particular amendment at this time.\n  We have had time agreements on every other amendment we have had on \nthis floor. We are going to be paying the price at 1:30 tomorrow \nmorning. I merely want to make that clear.\n  I am not asking the Senator to just to set this aside to dispose of \nit, but to set it aside temporarily. Maybe at 2 a.m. tomorrow morning \nwe will dispose of it faster, if we are here.\n  But I do say that we have to get on with the business. I am trying to \nnow chair a conference committee with the House on the first \nappropriations bill. We are trying to manipulate our chairmen, who are \nmeeting with their chairmen, back here on the floor to take care of \nthese particular amendments. It is no easy task. But, nevertheless, we \nhave to have the cooperation of all the Members of the body to dispose \nof the business.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague from Connecticut yield?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  In response to my friend from Oregon, before I would agree to \nunanimous consent to set it aside, I would like to speak for 10 \nminutes.\n  I would also suggest to my friend from Connecticut not to set it \naside until we get word from the President. I think just setting this \naside leaves it in limbo and is going to cause great problems in Mexico \nright now. I think we ought to get word from the President of the \nUnited States that if this in here, this is going to be vetoed. So that \nwe can assure the markets in around the world that we are not about to \ndestabilize the situation in Mexico through irresponsible action on the \nfloor of the United States Senate.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am glad to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think there is a great deal of force in what the \nchairman of the committee has just stated, and I obviously recognize \nthat.\n  I think it is very important to underscore a point made by my \ncolleague from Connecticut. We did not bring this amendment here. I \nmean, this amendment has enormous consequences associated with it, as \nmy good friend from Illinois has pointed out. It was not placed before \nthe body by those of us who have been speaking now for----\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Three hours and 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. No, no, no.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Since this amendment came to the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes. But we have been speaking for about an hour. We \nare very much on the down side of that time with respect to addressing \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Will the Senator agree to a time agreement?\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is the point I wanted develop further, because the \nSenator is asking to set it aside. It seems clear to me, as I said \nearlier, this is the kind of proposal which, if it were here on its own \nas a bill reported from the committee, would be debated for a number of \ndays, because its consequences are that momentous.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is absolutely right when he said the \nbill, the rescission bill, is important, but its importance is dwarfed \nby the potential consequences of this measure.\n  I think that needs to be understood. One way to make it \nunderstandable, of course, is, when we come to grips with a measure, to \nhave the kind of debate that is required with an issue of this \nimportance. Now that can happen now or it can happen later.\n  I understand the concerns of the chairman of the committee, but I do \nnot think there should be any laboring under some misapprehension that \nby setting it down the road you are somehow going to change the dynamic \nof the concern about the consequence of the amendment if it came at \nthat time.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. And the 1 o'clock in the morning can be 1 o'clock, it \ncan be 3 o'clock and so forth. This is a tremendously consequential \namendment that is before us.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Will the Senator yield a moment?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I understand the Senator's position. Perhaps we could \nwork out a matter whereby we set it aside and then let this \nminifilibuster, if that is what I hear being stated, continue on. I \nwill remain and let it happen, say, from 12:01 a.m. tonight until 5:30 \na.m., or whatever hour tomorrow afternoon, and then we will come back \nand have a vote.\n  Why keep everybody here on the floor of the Senate throughout the \nnight while a few engage in a minifilibuster? That is all I am asking, \nto be considerate of our colleagues, and then move this bill on \nthrough.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has the floor.\n   [[Page S4867]] Mr. DODD. Let me say to my colleague from Oregon, it \nis not lack of consideration on the part of the Senator from Maryland \nand myself. It a because of an amendment that has nothing do with the \nsubstance of the legislation brought to the floor by our wonderful \ncolleague from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. If the Senator will yield, I have the assurance from \nthe author of the amendment to temporarily lay it aside.\n  So one can say, sure, it takes a joining of two groups or two \nadversaries to an issue to make a filibuster. He is willing to stop \nthis matter and get on with the other business of this bill, and to \nreturn to it at whatever hour is necessary to return to it.\n  I am only getting a resistance to cooperating with getting this bill \nunderway and getting to other amendments before us from the speakers at \nthe moment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator would yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator yielding for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes, for a question.\n  I listened carefully to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. \nAs I listened to him, my concern increased, it did not decrease, I have \nto say to my good friend from Oregon. If, in effect, what you are \nsaying to me is, by setting it aside, we will then structure this thing \nso we will go back to it at 1 o'clock in the morning, or whatever time \nwhen we will not discombobulate all of our colleagues and inconvenience \nthem. And then those who are supposedly engaged in a minifilibuster, \nwhich I would not view it as such--we did not offer this amendment. I \nthink it is irresponsible that this amendment is before us. It is not \nrelated to this bill.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. But, Senator, you have now joined the issue, so you are \na part of this problem we face.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is right, we have joined the issue. But the \nirresponsibility of this situation rests upon the offerer of the \namendment, not by those that are responding to the amendment. And I am \nnot going to have that responsibility shifted in the course of this \ndiscussion.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. It is not to shift that responsibility. Will you agree \nto some kind of a time to set this matter aside when we have one side, \nthe author, willing to do so?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Why does the author not withdraw the amendment? Why \ndoes the author not withdraw the amendment and the consideration of the \nrescission bill can proceed?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Because the author has a right to bring this up, as \nother amendments have been brought up that may not be relevant.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let him withdraw it. He can offer it later, if he \nchooses to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has the floor.\n  Does the Senator wish to yield for a question? He may ask unanimous \nconsent to do that. But at the time, however, he has not yielded the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will underscore the point made by our \ncolleague from Maryland. This is a situation that the chairman finds \nhimself in, and it is not one created at all. This is significant. I \nknow that every chairman who brings every bill to the floor thinks that \nthe matter they are handling is the single most important issue facing \nmankind. I have certainly been in that situation in a subcommittee \ncapacity.\n  With all due respect, I must say that this amendment before us now is \nof far greater importance, in many ways, than the rescission package, \nas important as that is. To relegate this debate to some wee hours of \nthe morning when we may bring it up again--I appreciate the dynamic in \norder to try to move the process.\n  There is a simple way in which this can be addressed. Withdraw this \namendment and schedule time for this to be raised on the floor as a \nfreestanding proposition. We can allocate a day or so to fully explore \nwhether or not this body wants to undercut and absolutely destroy an \neconomic proposal and package that has enjoyed wide-based support--\nwhich can do significant economic damage to our country and to others. \nI do not think that is insignificant. That is the way to handle this, \nnot to insist that those of us who have been put in a position of \ndefending a proposal we think makes sense for our country and this \nhemisphere all of a sudden relegate our debate time to the wee hours of \nthe day to satisfy amendments to a rescission bill that is of marginal \nimportance by comparison.\n  I hope that our colleague will say, look, I will withdraw that \namendment now. The yeas and nays have not been asked for. It does not \ntake unanimous consent. I could have asked for the yeas and nays \nearlier. We can get back to the rescission bill and the chairman will \nnot have the problem.\n  I am not going to give up the floor on this particular amendment with \nthe idea that some time at 2, 3, or 4 o'clock in the morning we are \ngoing to have a debate around here on a critical matter that could face \nthis country. I did not put you in this situation. That can be easily \nresolved by the author of the amendment withdrawing it and scheduling \nit for another time. That is the only way I see of resolving this.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. If the Senator will yield, we are going to be \nfinalizing this bill at, perhaps, the wee hours of the morning. I am \nnot relegating this amendment to any particular time. I am saying we \nare going to finish this bill if it takes all night.\n  All I am asking now is to temporarily lay it aside, and at any time \nafter the next amendment is adopted, this is still the pending \nbusiness, so it would return. We will have to get unanimous consent to \nset it aside again. So the Senator is not losing any kind of advantage \nor parliamentary position by yielding for this purpose and to \ntemporarily lay it aside.\n  Mr. DODD. I would be happy to yield to my colleague, if he wants to \nraise the question with the author of the amendment. I would like to \nknow publicly whether or not my colleague from New York is willing to \nwithdraw the amendment at this point.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I have found that under circumstances of this kind, if \nwe can shift gears, shift the subject for a little while, an hour or \ntwo, that sometimes we cool down, in a way, in our devotion to the \nissue and we are more amenable to making some kind of an arrangement.\n  I am asking for a timeout to try to talk to the parties and see if we \ncan reach some kind of a solution. As long as we keep this rhetoric \nfrom both sides going, we dig ourselves into a deeper pit. I do not \nwant to start saying at 3 o'clock in the morning we have finally \nexhausted ourselves and we are now going to sit down and talk about it. \nI would rather see us talk about how to resolve it now and set it aside \nin order to do that, so we can get the parties together. That is all I \nam asking.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. I say again, and it deserves \nrepeating, that we are only in this situation because our colleague \nfrom New York raised this matter on a bill that has nothing to do with \nMexico. The amendment has nothing to do with the rescission package. We \ncan resolve it by withdrawing the amendment and then moving on to a \nlengthy discussion on the rescission package, given all of the \namendments that are pending.\n  The rhetoric has not been terribly heated. We disagree about this, \nbut this has not been an acrimonious debate. There is a legitimate \ndifference of opinion as to whether or not we ought to go forward with \nthe economic stabilization approach that was broadly supported, \nironically, by everybody around here. This was not done in the dark of \nnight. This is a proposal that enjoyed the endorsement of the majority \nleader of the Senate and the Speaker of the House, who urged the \nPresident to step forward and do it. Now we are turning around and \nwatching an effort to undo it 60 days later. So it is not \ninsignificant. I make that point as forcefully as I possibly can.\n  I do not desire to filibuster on this issue, but rather to have an \nimportant debate and discussion because of the implications of it. So \nit is not my desire here to take up time unnecessarily, but so that our \ncolleagues fully understand the implications that if the D'Amato \namendment is supported here and becomes the law--in fact, just the mere \nadoption of it, I think, will probably produce the kind of predictable \nresults that I think it is important we have that full debate and \ndiscussion on. Maybe I am in a minority on that particular point of \nview. I feel very strongly that any savings we may get out of \n [[Page S4868]] the rescission package could be absolutely wiped out, \nin effect, by the actions we take on this amendment. So in terms of the \nimplications of the American taxpayer, this single debate, as short as \nthis amendment is--a page and a half--it can have very profound \nimplications on this.\n  I am happy to possibly impose a quorum call here so we can have a \nminidiscussion, as my colleague has suggested, on the matter. But I \nmust tell him in advance that I think postponing and delaying this for \nanother 2, 3, 4, 5 hours--I am worried about what that itself does in \nterms of how markets are apt to react. I have such respect for my \ncolleague from Oregon that I am more than willing to listen to his \nadvice and thoughts on the matter.\n  Unless others want to talk on the amendment, I am prepared to suggest \nthe absence of a quorum. I see people standing, so I do not want to do \nthat at this juncture. But I will when the remarks are completed on \nthis matter and we can have an opportunity to talk about it.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am going to keep my remarks, as I have \nindicated to the chairman, to a minimum. I am compelled to respond.\n  No. 1, the question in terms of relevance. I think it is absolutely, \ntotally relevant. Here we are talking about--as the Senator from \nMassachusetts raised--the issue of cutting programs for women, \nchildren, and others. And I am saying, what about the American \ntaxpayers? What about the hard-working middle class? We are sending \nmoney to programs of dubious value, reclaiming tesobonos for \nspeculators, for people who made investments, which does not seem to me \nto be the right way to go.\n  As it relates to the question of $5 billion, I deliberately kept it \nthat high. Let me tell you, in the history of this fund, never once has \nit gone over $550 million for any other country other than Mexico. Not \nIsrael. Not Italy. Not Ireland. Let us bring in Greece and every ethnic \ncommunity there is, including Russia. Not once. Mexico, one time, $1 \nbillion. Only Mexico. So we went to $5 billion. Now if we want to make \nit Mexico specifically, I have no problem with doing that. The \nprinciple is whether or not this is a delegation of our constitutional \nauthority. That is what we are down to.\n  I am more than willing to put the matter over. But in terms of \nrelevance, I think it is very relevant. Here we are cutting 12, 14, 17 \nbillion dollars' worth of programs, and some of them arguably are good \nprograms. Yet, we are shipping off at the same time, watching it take \nplace--by the way, in several weeks, maybe another $5, $6, $7, $8 \nbillion will go down to Mexico. So I am saying, hey, fellows, let us \nlook at this. Members of the Congress, let us look at this and see \nwhether we want to continue the delegation of our authority in this \nmatter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment. We are dealing with economic dynamite here. And the very \ndiscussion has to be disquieting to a lot of people in the financial \nmarkets around the world. Senator Boxer made a very good point just a \nfew minutes ago when she asked about the stability of the United \nStates. People wonder, can we stay the course on things?\n  It is no accident that just a few days ago, we saw the worst trade \nfigures we have had for a long, long time. And those trade figures were \ncaused, to a great extent, by the peso crisis in Mexico.\n  Mexico has been a country where we have sold more goods than we have \nimported. The future of Mexico is tied in with the jobs.\n  Senator D'Amato talks about working men and women in the United \nStates. We want to protect those jobs and help Mexico protects those \njobs.\n  I will add a couple of other points, Mr. President. It is easy in \nthis kind of climate to find scapegoats, when people are having a tough \ntime making a living. What has happened in our society is happening in \nevery society: As the demand for unskilled labor is going down, the \ndemand for skilled labor goes up.\n  As that happens and people lose their jobs, they look around: Whom \ncan we blame? Part of it is translated, I regret to say, in terms of \nrace in our society. There are people down on affirmative action, \nsaying, ``We are losing our jobs because of African-Americans,'' or \nbecause of others. Mexico becomes an easy scapegoat for a lot of people \nwho do not understand the realities.\n  The drop in the dollar that we experienced here a few weeks ago, to \nthe extent that Mexico was involved, is because of our debt and our \ndeficit. Ordinarily, a $20 billion loan guarantee would not mean \nanything for a country with a $6 trillion economy. Mexico is not the \nprimary problem.\n  I will underscore a point that Senator Dodd made. This does not refer \nto Mexico. It says, ``We can't make loan guarantees except as \nauthorized by an act of Congress.'' Say on November 1 of this year, we \nrecess until January. Say on November 10, there is a crisis in the \nBritish pound sterling. The United States is frozen. The most powerful \neconomic Nation in the world, which will have so much at stake, could \nnot do a thing. That just does not make sense.\n  Finally, I say to my colleagues, this is not the kind of an issue \nwhere we ought to be pandering to public opinion. There are issues in \nwhich all Members in politics pander to public opinion, but with this \none we are dealing with something that really goes to the heart of the \neconomic survival of this country and other countries.\n  I urge my colleagues to look back to something that happened some \nyears ago--Senator Byrd was here; I do not think Senator Hatfield was--\nwhen General Marshall, in a Harvard commencement, announced the \nMarshall plan. Harry Truman was President of the United States. The \nfirst Gallup Poll that was taken after that showed 14 percent of the \nAmerican public supported the Marshall plan. It was extremely \nunpopular.\n  We look back on it now and boast about how we saved Western Europe \nfrom communism with the Marshall plan. It is something we can be proud \nof. But it took the U.S. Senators, who had the courage to do what was \nnot temporarily popular, to do that.\n  Particularly because Harry Truman at that point was dealing with a \nRepublican Congress, it took Senator Arthur Vandenberg from Michigan to \nstand up and say this issue is more important than temporary public \nopinion or the Republican Party or winning a Presidential race.\n  Arthur Vandenburg did the right thing. The country moved ahead. It is \none of the great acts of our country in the history of our country.\n  On an issue that is this volatile, we had better do the right thing \nand not ask ourselves what will the polls say back home. This is an \namendment that ought to be resoundingly defeated.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/30/senate-section/article/S4844-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4868-S4882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I am going to propound a unanimous-\nconsent agreement. I believe that both sides will indicate support.\n  I now ask unanimous consent to temporarily lay aside the D'Amato \namendment for the consideration of an amended amendment by Senator \nGorton and Senator Murray, raising an amendment to that; that there be \nan hour equally divided; and then we return back to the status where we \nare now, with the D'Amato amendment the pending business.\n  This would incorporate an amendment by Senator Burns to the Gorton \namendment, which is about a 90-second action; there would then be the \nhour divided equally between Senator Murray to offer an amendment, and \nSenator Gorton; then return again to the status where we are now. And, \nin the meantime, maybe we can find some way to resolve the current \nstatus.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is my \nunderstanding that the unanimous consent will include language that \nsays there will be no second-degrees to the Murray amendment?\n   [[Page S4869]] Mr. HATFIELD. I am sorry, I did not hear the Senator.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Is it my understanding that the unanimous-consent \nlanguage will agree that there will be no second-degrees?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. And there will be no second-degree amendments to the \nMurray amendment. In other words, in the regular form.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object and I do not \nintend to object, but I just want to make it as clear as I possibly can \nthat, while I am agreeing at this particular juncture to this approach \nto accommodate our colleague from Montana and a colleague from the \nState of Washington as well, I hope we could come to closure on the \nD'Amato amendment. Because I do want to make it clear that this is a \nmatter which I take very, very, very seriously. I understand the desire \nof everyone to move on to the rescission package.\n  This was not my intention to have this amendment come up. It is up \nbefore us. But I do not intend for it to be disposed of within an \nabbreviated debate. I am not suggesting a filibuster here at all. But \nit is an important matter that deserves a lot of consideration.\n  So, while I am agreeing to this particular unanimous consent at this \njuncture, no one should interpret this agreement on this particular \namendment to mean I will agree to future such requests. I say that with \nall due respect to my colleague from Oregon.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I will.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is my understanding, then, that upon completion of \nthe Murray amendment, which will take an hour--at least there is an \nhour of time for consideration of the Murray amendment--and then I take \nit there may be a vote? Or not?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I think so.\n  Mr. SARBANES. At the end of that we would be back on the D'Amato \namendment, in the exact posture in which we find ourselves?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. The circumstances of this moment will not be changed. \nThey merely will be postponed for an hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the unanimous consent is \nagreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I would like just a moment to thank \nSenator Dodd and Senator Sarbanes and others for cooperating on this, \nand Senator D'Amato on our side as the author of the amendment.\n  Once again, it will be a Burns amendment to the Gorton amendment, and \nthen Senator Murray will offer an amendment as a probable substitute. \nSo that means no second-degree amendments to the amendment of Senator \nMurray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 428 to Amendment No. 420\n\n(Purpose: To broaden areas in which salvage timber sales are not to be \n                               conducted)\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 428 to Amendment No. 420.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous-consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 69, strike lines 7 through 10 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(A) expeditiously prepare, offer, and award salvage \n     timber sale contracts on Federal lands, except in--\n       ``(i) any area on Federal lands included in the National \n     Wilderness Preservation System;\n       ``(ii) any roadless area on Federal lands designated by \n     Congress for wilderness study in Colorado or Montana;\n       ``(iii) any roadless area on Federal lands recommended by \n     the Forest Service or Bureau of Land Management for \n     wilderness designation in its most recent land management \n     plan in effect as of the date of enactment of this Act; or\n       ``(iv) any area on Federal lands on which timber harvesting \n     for any purpose is prohibited by statute; and''.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this is a perfecting amendment to the \nGorton amendment that merely accedes to the House language of the bill \nin the timber harvest. The House-passed bill contains language \nregarding lands which are exempt from the timber provision. However, \nthe language as reported out of the Senate Committee on Appropriations \nis more limited than that passed by the House. So my amendment is the \nsame language as that of the House, as it was passed through the House \nof Representatives.\n  It exempts land designated by Congress for wilderness study in \nMontana and Colorado, Federal lands recommended by the Forest Service \nor Bureau of Land Management for wilderness designation in its most \nrecent land management plan in effect; the Federal lands on which \ntimber harvesting for any purpose is prohibited by statute.\n  In other words, what this does is prevents harvesting timber inside \nof now-designated wilderness areas, those study areas, and also those \nareas that have been proposed for wilderness by any forest plan that is \nnow in effect under the forest plan. I believe this amendment addresses \nmost of the concerns that have been raised by my colleagues. I hope the \nSenate will accept my amendment.\n  I thank Senator Gorton of Washington for allowing me to perfect his \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this amendment conforms the section of the \nproposal in the bill to what the House has passed. It clearly exempts \nwilderness areas and the like from the effect of the legislative \nlanguage in the bill and I believe that, while the opponents to the \nwhole section do not like it, they do like this addition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 428) to amendment No. 420 was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                   Amendment No. 429 to amendment 420\n\n            (Purpose: To require timber sales to go forward)\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 429 to amendment No. 420.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 68, strike line 9 and all that follows through page \n     79, line 5, and insert the following:\n       (a) Definition.--In this section:\n       (1) Consulting agency.--The term ``consulting agency'' \n     means the agency with which a managing agency is required to \n     consult with respect to a proposed salvage timber sale if \n     consultation is required under the Endangered Species Act of \n     1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n       (2) Managing agency.--The term ``managing agency'' means a \n     Federal agency that offers a salvage timber sale.\n       (3) Salvage timber sale.--The term ``salvage timber sale'' \n     means a timber sale--\n       (A) in which each unit is composed of forest stands in \n     which more than 50 percent of the trees have suffered severe \n     insect infestation or have been significantly burned by \n     forest fire; and\n       (B) for which agency biologists and other agency forest \n     scientists conclude that forest health may be improved by \n     salvage operations.\n       (b) Salvage Timber Sales.--\n       (1)  Direction to complete salvage timber sales.--The \n     Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the \n     Forest Service, and the Secretary of the Interior, acting \n     through the Director of the Bureau of Land Management, \n     shall--\n       (A) expeditiously prepare, offer, and award salvage timber \n     sale contracts on Forest Service lands and Bureau of Land \n     Management lands that are located outside--\n       (i) any unit of the National Wilderness Preservation \n     System; or\n       (ii) any roadless area that--\n\n       (I) is under consideration for inclusion in the National \n     Wilderness Preservation System; or\n       (II) is administratively designated as a roadless area in \n     the managing agency's most recent land management plan in \n     effect as of the date of enactment of this Act (not including \n     land designated as a Federal wilderness area); or\n     [[Page S4870]]   (iii) any area in which such a sale would be \n     inconsistent with agency standards and guidelines applicable \n     to areas administratively withdrawn for late successional and \n     riparian reserves; or\n       (iv) any area withdrawn by Act of Congress for any \n     conservation purpose; and\n       (B) perform the appropriate revegetation and tree planting \n     operations in the area in which the salvage occurred.\n       (2) Sale documentation.--\n       (A) Preparation of documents.--In preparing a salvage \n     timber sale under paragraph (1), Federal agencies that have a \n     role in the planning, analysis, or evaluation of the sale \n     shall fulfill their respective duties expeditiously and, to \n     the extent practicable, simultaneously.\n       (B) Procedures to expedite salvage timber sales.--\n       (i) In general.--When it appears to a managing agency that \n     consultation may be required under section 7(a)(2) of the \n     Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1536(a)(2))--\n\n       (I) the managing agency shall solicit comments from the \n     consulting agency within 7 days of the date of the decision \n     of the managing agency to proceed with the required \n     environmental documents necessary to offer to sell the \n     salvage timber sale; and\n       (II) within 30 days after receipt of the solicitation, the \n     consulting agency shall respond to the managing agency's \n     solicitation concerning whether consultation will be required \n     and notify the managing agency of the determination .\n\n       (ii) Consultation Document.--In no event shall a consulting \n     agency issue a final written consultation document with \n     respect to a salvage sale later than 30 days after the \n     managing agency issues the final environmental document \n     required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1973 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n       (iii) Delay.--A consulting agency may not delay a salvage \n     timber sale solely because the consulting agency believes it \n     has inadequate information, unless--\n\n       (aa) the consulting agency has been actively involved in \n     preparation of the required environmental documents and has \n     requested in writing reasonably available additional \n     information from the managing agency that the consulting \n     agency considers necessary under part 402 of title 50, Code \n     of Federal Regulations, to complete a biological assessment; \n     and\n       (bb) the managing agency has not complied with the request.\n\n       (3) Streamlining of administrative appeals.--Administrative \n     review of a decision of a managing agency under this \n     subsection shall be conducted in accordance with section 322 \n     of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 1993 (106 Stat. 1419), except that--\n       (A) an appeal shall be filed within 30 days after the date \n     of issuance of a decision by the managing agency; and\n       (B) the managing agency shall issue a final decision within \n     30 days and may not extend the closing date for a final \n     decision by any length of time.\n       (4) Streamlining of judicial review.--\n       (A) Time for challenge.--Any challenge to a timber sale \n     under subsection (a) or (b) shall be brought as a civil \n     action in United States district court within 30 days after \n     the later of--\n       (i) the decision to proceed with a salvage timber sale is \n     announced; or\n       (ii) the date on which any administrative appeal of a \n     salvage timber sale is decided.\n       (B) Expedition.--The court shall, to the extent \n     practicable, expedite proceedings in a civil action under \n     subparagraph (A), and for the purpose of doing so may shorten \n     the times allowed for the filing of papers and taking of \n     other actions that would otherwise apply.\n       (C) Assignment to special master.--The court may assign to \n     a special master all or part of the proceedings in a civil \n     action under subparagraph (A).\n       (c) Option 9.--\n       (1) Direction to complete timber sales.--The Secretary of \n     the Interior, acting through the Director of the Bureau of \n     Land Management, and the Secretary of Agriculture, acting \n     through the Chief of the Forest Service, shall expeditiously \n     prepare, offer, and award timber sale contracts on Federal \n     lands in the forests specified in Option 9, as selected by \n     the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \n     Agriculture on April 13, 1994.\n       (2) Establishment of rebuttable presumption.--A rebuttable \n     presumption exists that any timber sale on Federal lands \n     encompassed by Option 9 that is consistent with Option 9 and \n     applicable administrative planning guidelines meets the \n     requirements of applicable environmental laws.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an alternative to \nthe timber management authorizing language in this bill. I offer my \namendment because I believe the language included in the bill by my \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Washington, will backfire. I believe \nit will hurt--not help--timber communities and workers in the \nNorthwest.\n  The authorizing language contained in this bill is designed to \naccomplish three things: respond to a timber salvage problem resulting \nfrom last year's forest fires; speed up the rate of timber sales under \nthe President's forest plan, option 9; and to release a few timber \nsales remaining from legislation passed by Congress 4 years ago.\n  These are goals with which I can agree. My problem is with the \nmethod. I believe the language proposed by my colleague will cause a \nblizzard of lawsuits, cause political turmoil within the Northwest, and \ntake us right back to where we were 4 years ago.\n  Our region has been at the center of a war over trees that has taken \nplace in the courtrooms and Congress for almost a decade. There is a \nhistory of waiving environmental laws to solve timber problems; that \nstrategy has not worked.\n  It has made the situation worse. Until 1993, the Forest Service was \nparalyzed by lawsuits, the courts were managing the forests, and \nacrimony dominated public discourse in the region.\n  Now this bill contains language that will reopen those old wounds. I \nstrongly believe that would not be in the best interest of the region.\n  Let me briefly explain my amendment, and why I think it makes more \nsense than the underlying bill. There are two distinct issues in \nquestion: salvage of dead and dying timber in the arid inland west, and \nmanagement of the old growth fir forests along the Pacific coast.\n  There is a legitimate salvage issue right now throughout the West. \nLast year's fire season was one of the worst ever. There are hundreds \nof thousands of acres with burned trees sitting there. I believe these \ntrees can and should be salvaged and put to good public use.\n  I believe there is a right way and a wrong way to conduct salvage \noperations on Federal lands. The wrong way is to short cut \nenvironmental checks and balances. The wrong way is to cut people out \nof the process. The wrong way is to invite a mountain of lawsuits.\n  The right way is to expedite compliance with the law. The right way \nis to make sure the agencies can make correct decisions quickly. The \nright way is to let people participate in the process--so they do not \nclog up the courts later.\n  I believe we can offer eastside timber communities hope, not only in \nthe short term--by delivering salvage volume--but in the long term, \ntoo. By following the law, we can immediately harvest timber--and \nsustain it in the future--because we will not be tied up in lawsuits; \nwe conserve our natural environment by not allowing poorly planned \nclearcuts to slide into salmon-bearing streams; and we protect human \n[[Page S4871]] lives by building roads that are rationally planned, not \nhastily built without planning.\n  The Chief of the Forest Service and many firefighters agree with me \non this. I ask unanimous consent to have some letters and materials to \nthat effect printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                   March 21, 1995.\n       Letter to The Editor: I would like to answer to the \n     editorial ``From timber to tinder,'' published in the March \n     15 Washington Times. It argues that Congress should pass \n     Representative Taylor's Bill that would eliminate all \n     environmental and economic rules for Forest Service timber \n     sales of 6 billion board feet, in the name of forest health \n     and firefighter safety. Linking this initiative to the 1994 \n     firefighters' deaths is an insult to those that died and a \n     shameless appeal to emotionalism. I lost my husband of 21 \n     years, and the father of our two young children, Jim Thrash, \n     in the Colorado fire last year. He was a smokejumper with 16 \n     seasons of experience.\n       He also loved the forests. Jim and I owned and operated an \n     outfitting and guide business in the beautiful pristine \n     mountains of west-central Idaho. We took many people a year \n     into the backcountry to experience the ``wilderness''. He was \n     also the President of the Idaho Outfitters and Guides Assoc., \n     which represents an industry that takes thousands of \n     Americans each year into the backcountry. Jim was very much \n     at home in the forests. He worked for responsible forest \n     management practices with a high emphasis on maintenance of \n     clean, free-flowing streams and quality wildlife habitat. He \n     knew, understood and advocated the use of fire in a more \n     natural role in the ecosystem as well as prescriptive fires \n     to aid in the restoration of natural conditions. He did not \n     support further roading of Idaho's roadless lands or the use \n     of clearcutting.\n       It is true that '94's fires were the result of the extended \n     western drought, but were also the natural fire cycles of \n     those ecosystems. There are those who are claiming that their \n     loved ones' deaths resulted from careless forest managers who \n     failed to log dead and dying timber elsewhere, resulting in a \n     shortage of firefighting resources. In reality, the Colorado \n     incident was not one of resource shortages, but one of \n     mismanagement. Firefighting managers and supervisors used \n     poor strategies (or had no strategies at all), and failed to \n     recognize and respond to the existing conditions (drought and \n     weather) and extenuating circumstances (resources shortages) \n     when making the decisions to put employees on the firelines. \n     Ultimately, this resulted in the deaths of 14 people.\n     Holly Thrash.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                   March 27, 1995.\n       Dear Madams or Sirs: I am writing to you regarding the \n     various ``Forest Health'' initiatives floating around \n     Congress these days. I am a wildland firefighter from McCall, \n     Idaho who has worked for the Forest Service as a helitacker, \n     a hotshot, and 12 years as a smokejumper. As I am sure you \n     understand, the opinions expressed herein are my own and do \n     not represent any government agency. Since I was smokejumping \n     on fires in Idaho and Montana last July, I was not on the \n     South Canyon Fire. Yet I lost good friends there, and I feel \n     a duty to them and to myself to speak out about the bills you \n     have under your consideration.\n       Given my knowledge of fire and the health of our forests, I \n     cannot support S. 391 (Federal Lands Forest Health Protection \n     and Restoration) or any incantation of Mr. Taylor's amendment \n     (The Emergency Two-Year Salvage Timber Sale Program), or Mr. \n     Gorton's Bill. I believe a reasonable amount of salvage \n     harvesting should be carried out, and I believe this can be \n     carried out successfully within the confines of current law.\n       I believe all these bills are based on the premise that the \n     salvaging cannot be done quickly enough to get the burned \n     wood before it becomes useless. But the evidence shows that \n     salvage has been occurring successfully in our forests. The \n     Boise National Forest successfully carried out the \n     historically biggest sale of any type in the Northwest as the \n     Foothills Salvage in 1992. The Forest Service anticipates \n     having all the salvage sales from the fires of 1994 on the \n     auction blocks by late this summer--with environmentally \n     sound analyses in place. I believe all of the bills mentioned \n     above call for forgoing this type of analysis. This does \n     nothing to help our forests. Given that it would be better to \n     have salvage available for harvest by the summer following a \n     burn, why not simply request that the Forest Service speed up \n     the analyses? Even in the present situation, they only need \n     to shave off three or four months to have salvage ready by \n     the summer following a burn. This could be easily done if \n     they were empowered (and given the necessary budget) to form \n     a salvage analysis team as soon as it became apparent that \n     there would be an opportunity for salvage. I believe this \n     change alone would shorten the process by three months.\n       Some of the bills mentioned above propose increasing the \n     national annual cut from four billion board feet to over five \n     billion board feet. I believe the lower cutting levels are \n     much more reasonable since they are based on an accurate \n     level of a sustained yield. If the cut is allowed to continue \n     at the higher level, at some point in the next decade or two, \n     yield levels will begin to fall, and they will fall below the \n     four billion level. This is the scientific advice given to \n     you by the Forest Service. I urge you to ask yourself, what \n     sustainable level of harvest can our forests support? Then \n     who will you listen to for advice, industry or land managers?\n       I talked to a logger friend just yesterday. He said, ``Why \n     not let the individual states and industry set the cut level \n     . . . Do you think they would cut themselves out of a job? \n     This is our land, not Congress' or some easterner's and we \n     know what is best for it.'' I told him that I had no doubt \n     that industry would cut themselves out of a job because they \n     are only concerned with short term profits.\n       A true commitment to community stability would help these \n     mill towns read the writing on the wall. Find other \n     specialties for their community that will increase jobs. The \n     real growth industries in Idaho are information technology \n     and recreation--tourism. People with jobs to offer come to \n     Idaho because of the ``quality of life.'' This includes low \n     crime, a lack of urbanization and a healthy natural \n     environment. We need to make sure that our forest and water \n     environments are maintained and not sold for short term \n     profit.\n       Let the land managers do the job they were trained to do. \n     The Forest Service will have all the salvage sales on the \n     auction blocks by this summer with environmentally sound \n     analyses in place. Mr. Taylor's bill calls for forgoing this \n     type of analysis, which does nothing to help our forests. And \n     to link any forest health bill to our fallen firefighters \n     mocks their deaths.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                   Patrick Withen.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Let me briefly discuss the salvage aspects of my \namendment. Whereas the underlying bill suspends all environmental laws \nto allow salvage operations, my amendment does not permit the agencies \nto operate above the law. Instead, it requires them to expedite \ncompliance with those laws.\n  Second, the underlying bill allows salvage on any Federal lands \noutside of designated wilderness areas where there is insect- or fire-\ndamaged timber. That allows agencies to build roads in pristine \nroadless areas and harvest trees along our wild and scenic river \ncorridors. My amendment restricts salvage operations to areas outside \nof the wilderness, roadless areas, and other congressionally designated \nareas, like wild and scenic river corridors.\n  Third, like the underlying bill, my amendment would shorten the \ntimelines allowed for appeals, but allow citizens' the right to \nchallenge bad agency decisions. Where the underlying bill prohibits \nadministrative appeals and does not allow temporary injunctions, my \nbill allows appeals, but dramatically shortens the timelines and \nprocedural requirements.\n  This is a reasonable, responsible approach. It ensures salvage \noperations will go forward. It protects workers and towns from the \ntangle of yet more lawsuits and insures that appropriate environmental \nprotections are in place.\n  We do need to work with timber communities; they have been waiting a \nlong time. We also need to protect them from the uncertainties of \nprolonged litigation. My amendment will do that.\n  Until very recently, the old growth Douglas fir forests in the \nPacific Northwest had been shut down because Judge William Dwyer had \nruled the agencies were not following the law.\n  When President Clinton held his forest conference in Portland 2 years \nago, he promised a scientifically credible, economically sustainable, \nlegally defensible plan to resolve the crisis. Option 9 is the result \nof that pledge. Let's be clear about this: Everybody dislikes option 9. \nThe timber communities felt it was inadequate. The environmental groups \nfelt it allowed too much harvesting.\n  Whatever people felt about it, option 9 was the first serious attempt \nto resolve an issue that plagued my region for years. Therefore, I \nsupported it.\n  Judge Dwyer has recently ruled that option 9 satisfies the \nrequirements of Federal law. Today, timber communities are back in the \nFederal timber harvest business. Unfortunately, they are not back to \nthe degree that they should be. I am very unhappy that the Forest \nService has not produced promised volumes.\n  I wrote the President last week to request a schedule for timber \nsales under option 9. He responded with details on both option 9 and \nthe salvage program. I ask unanimous consent these letters be printed \nin the Record.\n  [[Page S4872]] There being no objection, the material was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record, as follows:\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 21, 1995.\n     Hon. Bill Clinton,\n     President, The White House, Washington, DC.\n        Dear Mr. President: I know you are as concerned as I about \n     the seeming inability of the Forest Service to produce a \n     reasonable supply of timber for Pacific Northwest timber \n     communities under Option 9. You and the rest of your \n     Administration worked hard to find a solution to the forest \n     crises we were facing. Despite protestations from all sides, \n     you supported a compromise plan to provide both \n     scientifically sound management of our forests and a \n     sustainable supply of timber to our communities.\n       Now, almost a year after the Record of Decision and 9 \n     months after the lifting of the injunction, fewer than 300 \n     million board feet of timber have been sold in the 17 \n     National Forests managed under Option 9. I'm sure you agree \n     that this is unacceptable.\n       Legislation has passed the House and will soon be \n     considered by the Senate to suspend all federal environmental \n     laws applicable to the Forest Service in order to enable the \n     agency to sell the volume set forth in Option 9 (and to meet \n     salvage and section 318 sale targets). As a rule, I do not \n     support such ``sufficiency'' language because I strongly \n     believe agencies should not be above the law. However, I am \n     very frustrated by the Forest Service's inability to deliver \n     on the Option 9 sale targets.\n       Mr. President, I must have assurances this week that the \n     Forest service will meet its Option 9 target levels by the \n     end of this year. I need to know specific plans, timelines, \n     and changes that the Forest Service intends to take to get \n     this timber out. And I need to know what, if anything, you \n     need from Congress.\n       I believe Option 9 and existing law can produce a \n     sustainable flow of timber. Unfortunately, my belief has been \n     shaken by the facts.\n       Finally, I would appreciate knowing your plans for how the \n     Forest Service will conduct its salvage operations and any \n     problems you foresee in this area. Thank you for your \n     continued interest in finding solutions to these thorny \n     forest issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Patty Murray,\n     Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 1995.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Patty: Thank you for your letter regarding the status \n     of the Northwest Forest Plan. I appreciate your concerns and \n     want to make clear the progress that is being made.\n       As you know, from the time I took office, I made resolution \n     of the long-standing Northwest forest dispute--which had \n     produced years of conflict and litigation--a high priority \n     for my Administration. The completion of my Northwest Forest \n     Plan in April 1994 and the subsequent ruling by Judge Dwyer \n     upholding the plan in December marks the first time since \n     1991 that forest management has been pushed out of the courts \n     and back into the communities. That is clearly good news.\n       I understand that you are concerned about the sales of \n     timber to date, but, as noted, we have only been out of the \n     courts since December. In FY 1995 we will offer for sale \n     approximately 600 million board feet (mmbf). This is \n     consistent with my commitment under the Forest Plan, which \n     was to offer 60 percent of the 1997 target (1.1 billion board \n     feet) in FY 1995. Furthermore, I am assured by the U.S. \n     Forest Service (FS) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) \n     that we will meet our commitment under the Plan of 800 mmbf \n     in FY 1996, and finally 1.1 billion board feet (bbf) in FY \n     1997. In addition, the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of \n     Land Management will offer 1.664 bbf in salvage sales \n     throughout the country.\n       The agencies are working hard to expedite the \n     implementation of the Plan. The FS and BLM, for example, are \n     now working with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS) and \n     the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) early in the \n     process of timber sale preparation. By engaging early on and \n     working simultaneously on project development, sale layout \n     and contract preparations will be significantly expedited.\n       Let me also note that, in addition to getting timber sales \n     moving, we are engaging state governments and local \n     communities as never before to create new economic \n     opportunities. In FY 94 the federal government invested \n     $126.6 million in the region combined with $164.3 million in \n     SBA loan guarantees. For example, the U.S. Forest Service \n     allocated $6.3 million for over 200 Jobs-in-the-Woods \n     contracts in the Gifford Pinchot, Okanogan, Olympic, Mount \n     Baker-Snoqualmie, and Wenatchee National Forests. In FY 95, \n     we will offer $301 million to the region under the Forest \n     Plan in grants and loan guarantees.\n       Additionally, with regard to salvage sales, we will be \n     reducing the time it takes to prepare a salvage sale by about \n     30 percent.\n       Let me be clear that legislation to bypass existing \n     environmental laws and mandate a minimum level of salvage \n     sales may not increase the flow of timber. In fact, the \n     Department of Justice has advised that such mandates could \n     reduce timber, grazing, and mining activities because they \n     could result in new litigation over every land management \n     plan, including the Forest Plan.\n       I share your desire and commitment to a sustainable flow of \n     timber in Washington. As you know, the gridlock created by \n     the actions of previous administrations will take years to \n     turn fully around. But again, our significant investment in \n     this issue is now beginning to offer hope to communities in \n     Oregon, Washington, and Northern California. I look forward \n     to working with you toward productive solutions for the \n     people of Washington and the entire Pacific Northwest. \n     Enclosed you will find a schedule of timber sales and a \n     summary of agency activity to facilitate the flow of timber \n     in the region.\n       With best wishes,\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Clinton.\n

Thomas Tuchman, Director, Office of Forestry and \n                 Economic Development, March 23, 1995)\n\n\n                  increasing short-term timber supply\n\n       The Record of Decision (ROD) for the Northwest Forest Plan \n     allowed all timber sales that were sold and awarded prior to \n     the effective date of the ROD to go forward at the \n     purchasers' discretion. Those that were sold but not awarded \n     could go forward provided they met the requirements of the \n     Endangered Species Act (ESA). As of January 1, 1995, 96% of \n     the total Section 318 volume offered had been released. The \n     remaining volume is awaiting completion of surveys to comply \n     with the ESA. Agencies are working vigorously to complete the \n     required analyses and move these sales. A portion of the \n     remaining Section 318 sales, 13.9 mmbf from the Rogue River \n     Forest, will be awarded within 60 days. There will be an \n     additional 20.3 mmbf offered by mid-summer pursuant to \n     issuance of a biological opinion by the U.S. Fish and \n     Wildlife Service on unoccupied units for Marble Murrelets. \n     Please note the attached chart which contains a timber sale \n     schedule for FY 95 and includes salvage and green sales, in \n     addition to some outstanding miscellaneous sales that will be \n     offered by September 30, 1995.\n\n\n       immediate attention to actions improving forest conditions\n\n       We agree completely that we ought to move aggressively to \n     improve the health of forests in the Northwest; therefore, \n     several months ago we directed the agencies to move \n     expeditiously forward with immediate actions, such as salvage \n     sales. On March 8, the heads of four Federal agencies--Bureau \n     of Land Management (BLM), the U.S. Forest Service (FS), U.S. \n     Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Marine Fisheries \n     (NMFS)--signed an agreement detailing new consultation time \n     lines and streamlining processes for forest health projects. \n     Pursuant to this agreement, compliance with the National \n     Environmental Policy Act, the ESA, and other statutes will be \n     significantly accelerated. In fact, by ``reinventing'' the \n     consultation process, we will be able to cut the time \n     required to prepare salvage sales by about 30%. These process \n     improvements will accelerate the flow of timber in Oregon, \n     specifically on the ``east side.''\n       Additionally, a meeting is scheduled between BLM, FWS, FS, \n     and NMFS biologists and others involved in consultation to \n     work on screens to expedite consultation for salvage sales in \n     the region. Other streamlining actions will also be \n     discussed.\n       With regard to your suggestion concerning proceeds from \n     commercial thinning, the Forest Service currently has the \n     authority to fund timber stand improvements and other \n     restoration from timber receipts under the Knutson-Vandenberg \n     (K-V) Act. It is current practice for the Forest Service to \n     utilize these funds through the K-V Act from thinnings and \n     other timber sales to do timber stand improvements and to \n     conduct riparian restoration where\n      applicable. Another option is to consider the use of \n     stewardship contracts. This is a mechanism we have piloted \n     in other areas where timber sales pay for activities like \n     watershed restoration, recreation improvements, and \n     thinning and salvage sales. This is a tool we are \n     exploring in your region. If you have any questions about \n     it, please have someone contact us.\n\n\n                      simplify plan implementation\n\n       This Administration is committed to maximizing our \n     flexibility in implementing the Forest Plan. For example, the \n     U.S. Forest Service and BLM are expediting Plan \n     implementation by, for example, working with the FWS and the \n     NMFS to engage in the appropriate consultations early in the \n     process of timber sale preparation. By engaging early on and \n     working simultaneously on project development, we will \n     expedite sale layout and contract preparation. Further, by \n     involving FWS and NMFS biologists early in project \n     development, we should alleviate problems that would \n     otherwise arise in the final stages.\n       Also, we are on an accelerated track to complete half of \n     all the necessary watershed analyses under the Forest Plan by \n     the end of 1995. As you know, watershed analysis--utilized to \n     help make informed management decisions--is a new requirement \n     under the Forest Plan. As the watershed analyses are \n     completed and timber sales are awarded over the next year, \n     the timber pipeline will slowing be replenished after having \n     been fully depleted during the three and-a-half year period \n     (1991-June 1994) that timber sales were enjoined. This will \n     allow for an even and steady flow of timber under the Forest \n     Plan for Oregon and the region.\n       Overall, the agencies are pursuing better regional \n     oversight through a prioritization of consultation actions \n     and quality control of biological assessments submitted to \n     NMFS. Priorities will be coordinated regionally, rather than \n     for each Forest or BLM district. This will allow for smoother \n     implementation under the Forest Plan, as well as facilitate \n     forest salvage actions in the region.\n\n\n          expedite endangered species act consultation process\n\n       We too are concerned about the time it has taken in the \n     past to consult on management actions and are working to \n     expedite the process. As a result, land managers are \n     involving the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the \n     National Marine & Fisheries Service at the beginning of a \n     project rather than at the end. In addition, they are \n     ``batching'' projects for consultation in larger groups, \n     wherever possible, rather than consulting on a sale-by-sale \n     basis.\n       Moroever, Secretary Babbitt has asked FWS to conduct an \n     evaluation of the consultation process with the goal of \n     further streamlining consultation for forest plan and salvage \n     sale activities. Additionally, on March 6, Secretary Babbitt \n     announced a ten point plan for easing ESA restrictions on \n     harvests from private lands. These and other efforts are \n     underway to facilitate responsibility the sale of timber in \n     your region.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the administration needs to fulfill its \ncommitment to the region. If Congress can help, so much the better. But \nwe must be very careful not to go too far.\n  The Chief of the Forest Service told me last week he is well on his \nway to providing promised timber sales levels. But he lacks the human \nresources to do so. My amendment transfers money from road construction \nprograms to need personnel to get these sales out. It does not simply \nwaive the rules.\n  When Judge Dwyer approved option 9, he did so with conditions. He \nexpects full funding for implementation, and he expects monitoring and \nassessment for compliance with the standards and guidelines.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned that if we do not heed his advice, \nJudge Dwyer will rule option 9 invalid and once again forbid all \nharvesting in the Northwest. Our communities simply cannot afford that \nblow.\n  My amendment provides needed financial resources. Additionally, it \nsays that if the agencies follow the rules set forth in option 9, \nanyone challenging a timber sale will have to cross a very high legal \nhurdle to prove that a timber sale is environmentally harmful.\n  Let me say one final word about option 9. If people have a problem \nwith option 9, they have a problem with the laws: National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, and National Forest Management Act. If we are \ngoing to revisit the merits of option 9, we should instead take a broad \nlook at the laws governing it. We should not take short cuts in a \nrescissions bill without the benefit of hearings and public \ninvolvement.\n\n\n                              section 318\n\n  Finally, my amendment directs the Forest Service to find replacement \nvolume for sales old under fiscal year 1990 appropriations bill, dubbed \nsection 318, that are tied up because they may contain the threatened \nmarbled murrelet. The companies who bought these sales years ago \ndeserve what we promised them: timber. My amendment delivers that.\n  Mr. President, two of the provisions of this bill have only regional \neffects. The primary provision--salvage of damaged Federal lands--is \nnational in scope and affects the health of forests \n[[Page S4874]] throughout this Nation. We must not give the agencies \nfree rein to cut timber without regard to environmental considerations.\n  My amendment is a moderate, reasonable alternative. It expedites \nsalvage. It expedites option 9. It ensures appropriate levels of \nenvironmental protection. And most importantly, it protects communities \nand workers from burdensome, frustrating litigation. Such litigation is \nsure to result from the underlying bill.\n  Mr. President, 10 days ago I went to Gray's Harbor in my home State \nof Washington, and I talked to people who have lived through the \nnightmare of Congress and the courts deciding their lives. They are \njust starting to get back on their feet. Hope is beginning to return. \nThey do not want more empty promises. They do not need congressional \ninterference that may backfire. They do need promises kept, and they do \nneed Congress to act with common sense.\n  That is what my amendment does, and I urge my friends here in the \nSenate to support it.\n  Mr. President, I retain the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, who controls the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Washington yield time?\n  Mr. GORTON. Does the Senator from Alaska wish to speak in support of \nthe amendment?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Alaska would like to speak in support \nof the Gorton salvage amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, before I do so, I ask unanimous consent \nthat privilege of the floor be granted to Dave Robertson and Art \nGaffrey, congressional fellows attached to Senator Hatfield's staff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from \nWashington.\n  Mr. President, I rise to again commend the Gorton salvage amendment. \nI share, as Senator from the State of Alaska, a dilemma facing all of \nus; that is, a shortage of timber. We have seen our industry shrink by \nabout three-quarters by a combination of the inability of the Forest \nService to meet its proposed contractual agreements. As a consequence, \nthe industry has shrunk. As I see the issue before us, we have an \nopportunity, because of an unfortunate act of God, to bring into the \npipeline a supply of timber that otherwise would not be available. \nClearly, without the help of the Gorton salvage amendment the Forest \nService is absolutely incapable--make no mistake about it--incapable of \naddressing this in an expeditious manner.\n  So those who suggest that we simply proceed under the status quo will \nfind that the timber will be left where the bugs or the fire last left \nit when we are here next year and the year after. So, do not be misled \nby those who are of the extreme environmental bent to see this as an \nopportunity simply to stop the timber process. It is unfortunate that \nwe could not make the decision on what to do with this timber based on \nsound forest practice management--what is best for the renewability of \nthe resource.\n  The Gorton salvage amendment is an essential response to an emergency \nforest health situation in our Federal forests as evidenced by last \nyear's fire season. Our committee, the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources, has held oversight in the area, has recognized the severity \nof the problem, and I strongly recommend we do a positive step of \nforest management practice and support the Gorton amendment as an \nappropriate emergency response to the problem.\n  I have listened to the critics of the amendment both on the floor and \noff the floor. I have come to conclude that they must be discussing \nsome other provision than the one offered by the senior Senator from \nWashington.\n  First, they say the Gorton amendment mandates increased salvage \ntimber sales. The Gorton amendment does not mandate timber sales. It \nprovides the administration with the flexibility to salvage sales to \nthe extent feasible. I trust the administration to properly utilize \nthat flexibility. Opponents of the Gorton amendment apparently do not \ntrust this administration. I cannot tell whether they do not want to \nrehabilitate burned forests or whether they need individual sign off \nfrom the Forest Service Chief, Jack Ward Thomas, the Secretary of \nAgriculture, or maybe even Vice President Gore to trust the \nadministration.\n  Second, they say that the Gorton amendment suspends all environmental \nlaws. The Gorton amendment expedites existing administrative procedures \nunder the Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy \nAct, and other measures. If the agency successfully follows the \nexpedited procedure, their performance is deemed adequate to comply \nwith existing environmental and natural resource statutes. These \nexpedited procedures are essential as we must appropriately respond to \nthe forest health emergency, and it is an emergency that we face. If \nyou have an emergency, Mr. President, you respond to it and you \nexpedite a process. That is what the Gorton amendment is all about.\n  Third, they say the Gorton amendment eliminates judicial review. It \nsimply does not. The amendment provides an expedited form of judicial \nreview that has already been upheld by the Supreme Court in previous \nlitigation.\n  Fourth, they would say the Forest Service cannot meet the salvage \ntargets. The amendment does not have any targets. I wish it did. Today, \nthe Forest Service is working on its capability statement on the House \nversion of this amendment. There are strong indications that with the \nexpedited procedure the House bill will match in pertinent part the \nGorton amendment. The agencies can meet the House targets and still \ncomply with substantive requirements of existing environmental and \nnatural resources.\n  Fifth, they say the amendment will cost the Treasury. This is simply \nfalse. The Gorton amendment has received a positive score from CBO.\n  Sixth, they say the amendment may disrupt and actually reduce timber \nsales. Well, if that were true, I would expect them to strongly support \nthe Gorton amendment. But it is not true. The Gorton amendment contains \nprotective language to assure potential environmental litigants cannot \ndisrupt other agencies' functions due to this amendment.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I have been genuinely perplexed by the \nmisconceptions that accompany the attacks on this amendment, but today \nperhaps I know why this is the case. Yesterday, Senator Gorton and \nCongressman Charles Taylor along with Senator Craig, the author of S. \n391, which is a measure directed at another aspect of this problem, \noffered to meet, as I understand, with groups of activists opposed to \nboth the Gorton amendment and S. 391 together. It is my understanding \nthey cleared time on their calendars at 9 a.m., but they found that the \nactivists were evidently more interested in preparing for their 9:30 \na.m. press conference than meeting with the authors of the three \nprovisions which they proceeded to lambaste. That sort of interest \ngroup behavior I do not think can be tolerated if we are to continue to \nhave informed debates in this body.\n  So, Mr. President, I rise in support of the Gorton amendment, and \nagainst other modifying amendments. I encourage my colleagues to \nproceed with what this is, an emergency.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as recently as half a dozen years ago, \nthere was a booming, successful forest products industry in rural towns \nall up and down the north Pacific coast of the United States. In region \n6, in Washington, Oregon, and northern California, approximately 5 \nbillion board feet of timber was being harvested. Towns were prosperous \nand optimistic. Families were happy and united. Schools were full. The \ncontribution that these people made to the economy of the United States \nis difficult to underestimate. It was easier and less expensive to \nbuild homes, to publish newspapers, to engage in all of the activities \nwhich \n[[Page S4875]] arise out of the forest products industry. And even \nduring that time of maximum harvests every year in the Pacific \nNorthwest more board feet of new timber was growing than was being \nharvested.\n  Beginning with the controversy over the spotted owl in the Pacific \nNorthwest--in which incidentally, the recovery goal at the time of its \nlisting has now long since been exceeded by the discovery of additional \nspotted owls--at the time of the beginning of that controversy, that \nharvest began to drop precipitately, to the point at which in the last \nfew years the harvest on lands of the United States of America has been \nclose to zero. Communities have been devastated. Families have broken \nup. Small businesses have failed. Homes purchased by the work of many \nyears have become useless because they cannot be sold.\n  And we have constantly heard from those whose conscious policies \ndrove the litigation leading to this end that the people in these towns \nshould seek other employment in some other place or be the subject of \nvarious kinds of relief activities. So where they provided a net income \nto the United States from their income taxes, they now are a net drain \non the people of the United States for welfare programs which have \nbenefited primarily planners and contractors and advisors and not the \npeople who lost their jobs.\n  Mr. President, these people, these communities, their contributions \nto America have been largely ignored by the mainstream media of this \ncountry. Their professions have been denigrated. They who live in this \ncountry and have a greater investment in seeing to it that it remains \nbooming and prosperous have been accused of utter indifference and \nattacks on the environment.\n  Mr. President, that only has not been terribly unjust but it has been \ndestructive of balance and destructive of the economy of our country.\n  Now, into this controversy some 3 years ago came the then candidate \nfor President of the United States, Bill Clinton, promising in a well-\nattended meeting in Portland, OR, balance and relief, promising to \nlisten to the people of the Pacific Northwest, to protect the \nenvironment but at the same time to restore a significant number of the \nlost jobs and some degree of hope and prosperity to those communities.\n  The first part of later President Clinton's promise was kept in 1993 \nwhen as President he returned to Portland, OR, and held a timber \nsummit.\n  Long after the completion of that summit came what is now known as \noption 9, an option which the President stated met all of the \nenvironmental laws in the United States which he was unwilling to \nchange in any respect but also promised something more than 1 billion \nboard feet of harvest of timber to the people of the Northwest--1 \nbillion as against 5, or 20 percent of the historic level.\n  I did not then and I do not now believe that that constitutes balance \nor that it was at all necessary to protect the environment. But it was \na promise, Mr. President, of some form of relief.\n  Since then, the President has had that option validated by a U.S. \ndistrict court judge who has taken charge of this area in Seattle. But \ndo our people have 1.1 billion board feat of harvest? No, Mr. \nPresident, they do not. In spite of the time at which that promise was \nmade, they are nowhere close to that because the Forest Service in its \npersonnel cuts has cut mostly the people who work in the woods \npreparing these sales and because the Clinton administration knows that \nalmost no single action taken pursuant to this option will escape an \nappeal within the Forest Service and a lawsuit being stretched out \nforever and ever.\n  That is one element, Mr. President.\n  The second is that last summer, regrettably, was a time of major \nforest fires in almost every corner of the United States--loss of life \nin Colorado, huge fires in Idaho and Utah, large fires in my own State \nof Washington. Those fires have left billions of board feet of timber \nthat is now dead, absolutely dead, but for a relatively short period of \ntime harvestable. If it is not harvested, Mr. President, it will become \nworthless very quickly by rotting away and at the same time will be \ntinder for future forest fires.\n  And yet the opponents to harvest say that's nature's way. Forest \nfires start; let them burn. Very few of them live in communities near \nwhere these fires have taken place, whose summers have been ruined by \nthem, may I say, incidentally.\n  And so in this bill, as in the bill produced by the House, we attempt \nto enable the President of the United States to keep his own promises; \nnothing more than that, Mr. President.\n  It is true that the provisions in the House bill set a mandated \nharvest level roughly double what the administration deems to be \nappropriate. The proposal attacked by my colleague from the State of \nWashington, however, has no such requirement in it. It simply says \nthat, after all of these years, all of these promises, all of this \ndevastation, that we will liberate the administration to do what it \nwants to do.\n  And yet, this is attacked as if, somehow or another, this \nadministration had no concern for the environment whatsoever; that \nSecretary Babbitt was simply out to cut down the forests of the Bureau \nof Land Management; that President Clinton's Forest Service wanted to \ndo nothing else but that, and to ignore environmental laws from one end \nof this country to another. It is astounding, Mr. President, that the \nadministration itself does not wish help in keeping its own \ncommitments.\n  Now, both the amendment which is a part of this bill and the \nsubstitute amendment by the junior Senator from Washington cover three \ndistinct, separate but related subjects.\n  One on salvage timber is nationwide in scope. The administration \nproposes in this fiscal year to sell something over 1.5 billion board \nfeet of salvaged timber, dead or dying timber. In region 6, which is \nthe Pacific Northwest, the figure is about one-fifth of that total. \nFour-fifths of it are from other regions of the country and they \ninclude every Forest Service region in the United States.\n  My proposal, the proposal in the bill, does not require the \nadministration to double that offering. In fact, it has no number in it \nat all. But it says that the administration, having carefully \nconsidered every environmental law, is enabled to do what it tells us \nthat it wants to do.\n  Does this suspend the environmental laws? No, Mr. President. This \nadministration has certainly tried its best to abide by all of them and \nall of them remain on the books, those I agree with and those I \ndisagree with.\n  And I cannot imagine that Members of this body will accuse the \nadministration of wanting to ignore those statutes. It simply says that \nthe administration's own decisions will not further be attacked in \ncourt by the often inconsistent provisions of six or seven or eight \ndifferent statutes passed at different times with different goals.\n  The amendment that is sought to be substituted for that which is in \nthe bill does not reduce litigation in the slightest, Mr. President. It \ncalls for certain expedited procedures, but it still allows every \ntimber sale to be appealed within the Forest Service or the BLM, and \nevery one to go to court. And they all will go to court, Mr. President, \nbecause those who will attack them, those who want nothing to be done, \nwill recognize that all they have to do is to delay it for another \nseason and there will not be anything to sell, because it will be \nworthless. So that portion of the substitute amendment is simply an \ninvitation to have no salvage at all.\n  The second and third elements in both amendments have to do with \noption 9 and with so-called section 318 sales. Section 318 was a part \nof the Appropriations Act in 1990, designed to provide some interim \nhelp for the forest in the two Northwest States. But many of the sales \ndirected by this Congress pursuant to that law have been held up by \nsubsequent environmental actions.\n  The proposal that the committee has made simply says that those sales \nwould go ahead unless they involved places in which endangered species \nare actually found, in which case, substitute lands will take their \nplace.\n  Our option 9 provision, I repeat, Mr. President, simply says that the \nPresident can keep the promises he made some time ago, almost 2 years \nago, under option 9 and not be subject to constant harassing lawsuits. \nThat is all that it says. It does not require him to get to the 1.1 \nbillion board feet of harvest that he promised, and he will not. \n[[Page S4876]] It does say that he can do what he wishes to do.\n  Now, the substitute amendment, in each case, for all practical \npurposes, makes dealing with this issue at the level of Congress \npointless. All of the lawsuits will still be able to be brought, but \nperhaps we will actually find ourselves in a damaging situation.\n  The Presiding Officer is from the State of New Hampshire. I presume \nthat some small portion of this salvage timber is in his State. But if \nthis substitute amendment passes, all of the personnel of the Forest \nService from the rest of the United States will have to go to \nWashington and Oregon in order to meet the requirements of the \nsubstitute amendment, at the cost of every other region in the United \nStates.\n  Now I would like to have that kind of service in my State, but I do \nnot believe it to be fair. I do not think we can say that we are the \nonly ones who under any circumstances should get anything out of one of \nthese amendments.\n  The definition of what salvage timber is in the bill is the Forest \nService's own definition. The definition in the substitute amendment is \na different definition, one highly susceptible to further litigation.\n  The exceptions provided by the amendment of the Senator from Montana \nkeeps this kind of salvage logging out of wilderness areas and certain \nother well-defined areas. The proposal by the junior Senator from \nWashington keeps them out of any area that is under consideration for \ninclusion in the national wilderness preservation system.\n  Mr. President, under that proposal, one bill by one Member of the \nHouse of Representatives introduced to put the entire National Forest \nSystem included in a wilderness preservation system would stop any \nharvest anywhere. It would be under consideration by Congress. What it \ndoes, in effect, is to give any of the 535 Members of Congress a veto \npower over the entire proposal.\n  Mr. President, the issue in this case is clear. Do we care at all \nabout people, not just in the Pacific Northwest but all across the \nUnited States, who live in timber communities? Do we care about our \nsupply of lumber and of paper products? Or do we only care about the \nwell-being of certain environmental organizations and their lawyers?\n  That is what we are debating with respect to this amendment. Do we \nwant the President of the United States to be able to keep his \ncommitments, his promises, however inadequate they are? Or do we have \nso little trust in him that we believe that he will ignore every \nenvironmental law and decide suddenly to cut down our national forests?\n  Mr. President, that is not going to happen. The lawsuits will, under \nthis proposed substitute amendment, provide relief for people who need \nrelief. Income for the Treasury of the United States will only come \nfrom rejecting the substitute amendment and accepting the bill in its \npresent form.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Washington yield me 5 \nminutes?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to yield 5 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and distinguished \nSenator from Washington [Mrs. Murray].\n  Mr. President, this timber salvage language in H.R. 1158--so people \nunderstand the history, this represents the 12th time since 1984 this \nbody would vote to exempt timber sales from environmental laws; 12 \ntimes since 1984.\n  Frankly, I find that disturbing. It means that the American people \nare going to be asked to believe that when it comes to cutting national \nforests, somehow environmental laws do not apply. These exemptions, \nwhich should have been, if at all, in emergency situation, instead are \nbecoming routine and standard practice. It is not a short-term \nsolution. I have to wonder how long this will go on. To me the \nexemption from environmental law is an extreme position. The majority \nof the American would not accept, nor should they. The distinguished \nSenator from Idaho, Senator Craig, and I streamlined the process in \n1992. We are speaking of public lands, and in public lands, every \nAmerican has a right to express his or her public interest. H.R. 1158 \ntakes away the opportunity to participate in public land management. I \ndo not see how the U.S. Senate can accept a provision that strips \npeople of this right and takes the right out of the people's hands and \nputs it solely into the hands of bureaucrats. This would not create any \nmore open government. In fact, this seals the same government agents \noff from public interest.\n  I respect the concerns of my fellow colleagues from other timber \nStates. Even though I am a tree farmer, that is not my sole source of \nlivelihood. I have talked with people in that area. It makes sense to \naddress the problem, but with a sensible, responsible, moderate \nsolution that respects the true interests of the American people and, \nin the long term, the apolitical needs of the forest resource.\n  I believe Senator Murray has proposed a fair solution. In fact, she \ninherited this divisive timber issue when she was elected. She promised \nthe people of Washington a responsible solution. I have discussed this \nwith her since she has come here. I believe that since her election, \nshe has helped put the timber industry on a reliable path that the \ntimber industries can bank on.\n  In fact, with the work she has done, there has been an increase of \n400 jobs, not a decrease in the lumber, paper, and allied wood products \nindustry in the State of Washington since her election. She has an \nalternative that moves toward long-term sustainability, not a quick \nfix. Above everything else, what Senator Murray has done is what \ntimber-dependent communities want, especially the younger generations--\nlong-term sustainability. People go into this for the long term, not \nwith the idea that every 10 months, or year, or 14 months we are going \nto suddenly change the rules of the game.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support Senator Murray and abandon the \nextreme approaches that failed us in the past and removed any kind of \npublic input from the process. Look at her long-term solution and adopt \nher amendment.\n  I am going to yield my time back to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington controls the time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I assume the Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton, \nwill yield time to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the amendment \noffered by Senator Murray of Washington. This amendment severely \nweakens what this provision is intended to do--respond to our forest \nhealth emergency, restore our forests to health, and create jobs. This \nsubstitute amendment is only a clever way to do nothing.\n  The committee-passed provision is responsive to not only forest \nhealth, but to the people who support their families in the wood \nproducts industry. But this amendment is no more than status quo. And \nMontanans do not want status quo.\n  This substitute amendment does not streamline the process, limit the \nfrivolous appeals, or allow for salvage sales to be expedited. Instead \nthis amendment forces agencies to consult with other agencies, and does \nnothing to cut through the environmental red tape and still allows for \nendless delays.\n  It replaces the Forest Service definition of ``salvage timber sale,'' \nwhich is included in the committee's bill, with a new definition. This \ndefinition doesn't take into account overcrowded forests which need to \nbe thinned, and it forces the land managers to always consult with \nbiologists.\n  This amendment also eliminates the legal sufficiency language which \nis needed in the preparation of sale documents. If we are truly serious \nabout salvaging timber, we need to have sufficiency language included, \nand we need to retain streamlined timeframes to assure that the \nenvironmental procedure process is not abused.\n  Currently, delays in Federal land management arise primarily from two \nsources--multiple analysis requirements and administrative appeals and \njudicial review. Without this sufficiency language, we will continue to \nhave lengthy delays which will substantially lead to the more dead and \ndying timber in our forests.\n  [[Page S4877]] Congress needs to act on the salvage issue. We have \nthe authority to establish the law, rather than leaving it to the \njudicial branch to declare what the law is. Yet, this amendment moves \nthis authority toward the courts.\n  This amendment is worse than the status quo. It requires the agencies \nto jump through more holes than it already has to, and it makes some \nland currently available for harvest off limits. It wouldn't result in \nany more timber salvaging activities. And most importantly, it will \nstop the creation of jobs in Montana. I strongly oppose this amendment. \nThe wood products industry comprises almost half of western Montana's \neconomy, and this amendment is not responsive to those folks who make \ntheir living in this sector of our economy.\n  I just want to make one simple little evaluation here about this \nconversation. We have had the status quo long enough. I know what the \nstatus quo is. We do not salvage any, or we do not log any of our \nsalvage lumber. It is finite. If it goes another year, it is not worth \nanything. That is what we are talking about here. We are talking about \nareas that have been burned and areas that are infested with disease. \nThe lumber is finite.\n  Everybody can stand around and grin while people are not working and \nwe are not taking care of the forests like they should be managed. They \nthink they are doing a great thing for America, when they are not doing \nanything for America and are doing worse for the people who depend on \npublic lands for their living. You are making your check; they are not. \nYou think about that whenever you place this vote today.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Montana, Senator \nBaucus.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how best to deal with the salvage timber \nissue is a matter of judgment. We in the Pacific Northwest have seen a \nlot of dead timber, caused both by forest fires and by disease. And we \nare frustrated by the Forest Service's inability to get some of this \ntimber cut. We know it can be done responsibly, with minimal impacts to \nthe environment, yet it just isn't happening as quickly as it should.\n  The real question is: What is the best way to go about dealing with \nthis problem?\n  We have many competing values that must be accounted for when we \nmanage our national forest land. One value is timber. But there are \nmany other values that must be considered: wildlife; maintaining the \nquality of our lakes and streams; and recreation.\n  I remember not too long ago reading a statement by H.L. Mencken, a \nformer Baltimore Sun journalist. He said, ``For every complicated \nproblem, there is a simple solution--and it is usually wrong.'' And he \nis right. In many cases, where we face a complicated problem and \nsomebody comes up with a simple solution, it tends to be wrong, too \nsimplistic. It often tends to throw the baby out with the bathwater.\n  I am very respectful of the underlying concept that we are \nconsidering here. Mr. Gorton's language attempts to address some of the \nfrustration we have in the Pacific Northwest about the Forest Service's \ninability to harvest salvage timber in a timely manner.\n  I think if you look closely at the Gorton language in this bill, \nwhich is tailored after the so-called Taylor amendment in the House, \nyou will see that it goes too far. It rides roughshod over the statutes \nthat this country demands be in place to protect water, wildlife, and \nto maintain the very integrity of our national forests.\n  For example, the Gorton language says that ``if any potential salvage \nsale is in the works by the Forest Service''--not up for bid but going \nthrough the hoops--``it is OK.'' We will ignore environmental statutes \nin the interest of saving a few weeks or months. We will ignore the \npublic's right to make sure that their lands are being cared for in a \nresponsible manner.\n  I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. On the other hand, the Senator from Washington, Senator \nMurray, is also attempting to address this problem. She has a different \napproach--an approach that balances competing uses and respects the \nneed to adhere to environmental laws. And the Murray amendment does not \nignore the underlying public interest in speeding up the timber sale \nprocess. It carries a firm mandate to the Forest Service that salvage \nsales are a national priority. It eliminates many of the existing \nprocedural hoops without sacrificing environmental protection. It \nshortens the administrative review process by almost half, without \nsacrificing the rights of the public to have their voices heard. Plain \nand simple, the Murray amendment directs the Forest Service to move \nmuch more expeditiously. To get on with it.\n  We love our forests. It is a cornerstone to the way we live in \nMontana. And logging is critical for Montana. Salvage sales are \ncritical. But so are outfitters. Like the timber industry, our guides \nand outfitters stake their livelihoods on the national forests. Folks \ncome from around the world to hunt and fish in Montana. The outfitting \nindustry is economically critical to our State, and it should be given \nequal respect when management decisions are made in our national \nforests.\n  Unfortunately, the Gorton language is unbalanced. It goes way too \nfar, and does not consider other stakeholders in the national forest. \nThe Murray amendment is balanced. It recognizes that there are \ncompeting values at stake. It recognizes that we can speed up salvage \nsales and create timber jobs without jeopardizing those jobs that \ndepend on our forests having clean rivers and lakes, and abundant \nwildlife.\n  I urge Members to support the Murray amendment. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield such time as may be consumed to \nthe Senator from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWashington for yielding to me.\n  This is a very complex issue, and I understand both sides of it. I \ncome down on the side of the junior Senator from Washington, because I \nthink it is the correct side for the Nation.\n  I think to go with the language of Senator Gorton sets a very \ndangerous precedent. Nobody argues with harvesting infested, burnt, \nsalvaged timber. I am for that. Every Member of this Senate is. The \nlanguage of the Gorton amendment says that the Forest Service will \nharvest the maximum extent practical.\n  Then it goes ahead to say we are going to suspend all environmental \nlaws including the Endangered Species Act. This is called sufficiency \nlanguage saying, cut all you can possibly cut that is practicable, and \ndo not worry about the environmental laws or any other law. And do that \nin 1995 and 1996.\n  It is a dangerous precedent. If we go with that, we do not know where \nwe are headed. The pressures from the industry on the Forest Service \nwill be intense. That is the reason the fishermen in the Northwest are \nvery upset and concerned about this. They are concerned that excessive \nlogging will hurt the habitat of the salmon which is disappearing at an \nalarming rate.\n  I know the Senator from Oregon wants to provide jobs in those mills, \nand I want to help him but not by suspending all environmental laws. I \nhave a letter from the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's \nAssociation, and they adamantly oppose sufficiency language. I would \nlike to read an excerpt from their letter.\n\n       We oppose the current Congressional effort to approve \n     ``sufficiency language'' or to mandate minimum timber harvest \n     levels in the Northwest. However well meaning, these are \n     nevertheless bad ideas. Sufficiency language would simply \n     override all current protections for salmon and other aquatic \n     species. Mandatory timber harvest levels would essentially do \n     the same. . . . The result would only be additional \n     degradation of already severely damaged salmon spawning \n     habitat.\n\n  That ought to weigh heavily with somebody. It does with me. This is \nthe biggest fishing organization in the West.\n  Mr. President, finally, there is language in this bill, as I read it, \nthat allows the Forest Service to reemploy people who have received a \n$25,000 buyout.\n  Mr. President, 3,000 Forest Service employees, approximately, have \ntaken their $25,000 under the Reinventing Government proposal and \nretired.\n  Now, here is an incomplete sentence, but if I could have the \nattention of the Senator from Oregon for a moment, here is what the \nprovision in the bill says--the provisions of section 3D1 of \n[[Page S4878]] the Federal Work Force Restructuring Act of 1994: \n``Separation incentive payment authorized by such Act and accepts \nemployment pursuant to this paragraph''--now that is an incomplete \nsentence. I do not have a clue as to what this means. My impression of \nit is that the Forest Service can take these people who have just taken \ntheir $25,000 and retired and put them back to work in order to comply \nwith this maximum extent practicable.\n  Does the Senator from Washington agree with that?\n  Mr. GORTON. No.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. No, I do not agree with that at all.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. What does this sentence mean?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Let me just go back and put this in the context, if I \ncould.\n  First of all, every timber sale preparation made by Jack Ward Thomas \nor Secretary Babbitt are required to prepare those timber sales with \nexisting law in which the regulations on fish are there in place.\n  Those timber sales have to be prepared within that conformity. The \nso-called sufficiency language takes place after the fact in order to \ndeliver the timber sale that has been prepared under those \nrestrictions.\n  The Senator is absolutely wrong on this.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Here is what the first sentence of the paragraph says:\n\n       Sale preparation. The Secretary concerned shall make use of \n     all available authority, including the employment of private \n     contractors and the use of expedited fire contracting \n     procedures, to prepare and advertise salvage timber sales \n     under this section.\n\n  Following that, page 71 of the bill, Senator, following that is the \nincomplete sentence. If that is not right, I still do not quite \nunderstand what it means, because it alludes to the $25,000 buyout.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. If the Senator will yield for just a moment, let us go \nback and take the precedent of section 318. Because the same arguments, \nthe same invalid arguments are being used today that were used then.\n  Let me quote. We went through that whole process underlying laws of \nNEPA, the National Forest Management Practice Act, and then we declared \nsufficiency. The Supreme Court ruled.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Can the Senator continue this on his time?\n  Mr. GORTON. I can answer the specific question. The version has been \ncorrected. The sentence is complete in the bill that is before us, and \nit simply says that someone who has been brought out of the Forest \nService and paid, say $25,000, can be hired back temporarily for this \npurpose without losing the $25,000.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. But only temporarily?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. That is the Senator's understanding?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask I be permitted to continue for 2 \nadditional minutes without the time being charged on the 1-hour \nallocation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I will not object if I can add 2 more \nminutes to the time of Mr. Craig.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Fine. We just took up some time here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I like to think I do not have two better \nfriends than the senior Senator from Oregon and the senior Senator from \nWashington. They have helped me over the years on many issues of \nconcern to my State. However, I cannot support them on this issue.\n  I will remind my colleagues that the Senator from Idaho, who is on \nthe floor right now, has introduced a forest health bill that was the \nsubject of a hearing by the Energy and Natural Resource Committee. In \nfact the bill will probably be marked up in the next few weeks. We \nshould let the authorizing committee do its job. I can assure you that \nI will do everything I can to make sure that a responsible bill emerges \nfrom that committee. I am not going to support something with \nsufficiency language in it.\n  If a responsible forest health bill emerges from the Committee, I \nhope it will automatically supersede the Gorton amendment. What is the \nSenator from Washington's understanding of this matter?\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want to answer the question but I do not \nwish to use my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Arkansas yielding to the \nSenator from Washington?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I do not want to yield on my time.\n  Mr. President, I will close by saying one of the things I think the \ncountry is concerned about, about what is going on right now--they \nwanted change. They wanted regulatory reform. But they do not want to \nthrow the baby out with the bath water.\n  I have seen that old expression: If you think education is expensive, \ntry ignorance. If you think the environmental laws of this country are \ntoo tough--and sometimes they can be very frustrating, try living \nwithout them and see the kind of damage that will be inflicted on our \nenvironment. The Gorton amendment goes too far. I simply cannot support \nit and urge my colleagues to support the amendment by Senator Murray.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Washington controls the time.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \nSenator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 4 \nminutes and 40 seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I stand today in support of the Gorton \namendment as now amended; certainly in opposition to the amendment of \nmy colleague, the junior Senator from the State of Washington.\n  A good many things have been said this afternoon about what these \namendments do and do not do. What I really think is important for all \nof us to understand is the state of the U.S. Forest Service and why we \nare engaged in a debate this afternoon in attempting to bring about \nemergency measures to deal with a very sick problem.\n  I use the word sick because the forests of the inland West are sick. \nThey are the product of 8 years of drought and decades of mismanagement \nthat have resulted in one of the largest fuel buildups, acre by acre, \never in the history of the U.S. Forest Service.\n  When fuel becomes dry and conditions are right, and Mother Nature \ncomes along with thousands of lightning strikes, what happens is what \nhappened in Idaho last summer and what happened in Colorado and Montana \nand eastern Washington and eastern Oregon and parts of northern \nCalifornia. Millions and millions of acres burn, wildlife is \ndestroyed--in the instance of the infernos of last summer, 35 human \nbeings lost their lives in an effort to stop these. This was not \nsomething that just happened. This was not just an ordinary \ncircumstance. There are many who would like to argue this is Mother \nNature at her finest.\n  Let me suggest it was Mother Nature at her worst. But it was also \nMother Nature who had been assisted for decades by the mismanagement of \na Forest Service, by allowing the buildup of a phenomenal fuel \nstructure, of timber across these lands that had not been properly \nmanaged or thinned or allowed to be like they were before man came \nalong with the tremendous ability to put out fire.\n  In my State of Idaho before my ancestors came along there were \napproximately 25 to 30 trees per acre. Today there are hundreds of \ntrees per acre. And as a result of that, there are a million less acres \nof them and a couple of billion less board feet of them, because they \nwent up in an inferno last summer. So what we are trying to tell \nSenators here this afternoon is that we have a very sick patient. That \npatient is called the U.S. public forests of this country, especially \nin the inland West.\n  For those who counsel comity, and for those who counsel slowness and \nprocess and procedure and time and let us work this out, let me suggest \nwhen you have somebody in the emergency room and the life support \nsystems are attached and the heartbeat is very faint, you do not \ncounsel long-term \n[[Page S4879]] strategy. You counsel short-term, immediate, emergency \nrelief to resolve some of the problem while you then look at the long \nterm down the road to see if you cannot make it better.\n  The Senator from Arkansas just a few moments ago spoke to the forest \nhealth bill I introduced a couple of weeks ago in the forestry \nsubcommittee of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. That is the \nlong-term approach. That is what we ought to be doing, by allowing the \nForest Service to manage critical situations, be it fires or bug kill \nor a natural environment that has created this tremendous problem that \nexists in the West.\n  But in the short term, with billions of board feet of timber at stake \nand watersheds and wildlife habitat and trying to avoid a cataclysmic \nsituation of massive runoffs in the next couple of years that could \nresult in the loss of fisheries, in the loss of water quality and \nstream quality, we need emergency measures now that protect the \nenvironment.\n  What is the offshoot? Well, the offshoot is some timber and some \nthousands of jobs and a few hundreds of millions of dollars that might \ncome to the Treasury of this country. That is not the first goal. That \nis the latter goal. That is the fallout. That is the receipt from what \nwe are trying to do here this afternoon.\n  Here is what we faced in Idaho and across the West last summer. This \nis not normal. This is one of the hottest fires ever recorded in the \nhistory of our environment. It destroyed the soil structure. It created \nan unnatural problem.\n  Today we are taking one small step back toward a process and \nprocedure that allows Mother Nature, cooperating with human beings, to \nmake a better environment and in the long term solve a problem that now \nperplexes the intermountain West and creates a cataclysmic environment \nthat could go on for a long time.\n  Let us deal with the emergency problem now as this bill does. Let us \ndeal with the long term, with quantitative and qualitative changes of \nthe public law that allow the proper management of the U.S. Forest \nService.\n  Mr. President, a strong 2-year salvage amendment is absolutely \nnecessary to work hand-in-hand with your longer-term forest health \nbill, S. 391.\n  Salvage and restoration of the 4 million acres of 1994 fire-burned \nareas must be started immediately. Without this salvage language, it \nwill not happen. Those in opposition will employ every effort to delay, \nconfuse and derail the agencies' attempts to conduct responsible \nsalvage activities.\n  Last year's fires burned 4 billion board-feet of timber. If done \nquickly, much of this timber can be salvaged at considerable return to \nthe Federal Treasury. But, the value of standing, burned trees \ndeteriorates rapidly.\n  Let me use this display to illustrate the rapid loss of value of \ntrees burned in wildfire:\n\n                          PONDEROSA PINE VALUE                          \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    6 months after fire                2\\1/2\\ years after fire          \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n$725/MBF lumber                                       $0                \n$70/ton chips                                         $0                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Six months have now passed since the 1994 fires in Idaho. It is \nestimated that 2 billion board feet of timber burned in those fires. \nSince there are mixed species involved, let us estimate that the value \nof that timber today is $200 per thousand board feet on average. That \nmeans it is worth $400 million to the taxpayers today, maybe $200 \nmillion 1 year from now, and practically nothing a year beyond that. \nAnd let's not forget that 25 percent of this revenue will be returned \nto local counties. In my State of Idaho, Shoshone County officials have \nwatched their budget drop sharply as a result of the lack of national \nforest timber sales. They are desperate for some solutions to this \nsituation. They are among the many who have pointed out the absurd \nsituation of no timber sales being offered while dead forests abound.\n  Let me make another point. The forest fires we are witnessing are not \nnormal and they are not beneficial to the environment. They destroy \nfish and wildlife habitat and can result in hydrophobic soils. \nHydrophobic soils will not percolate water and will cause rainwater to \nrun off the surface in torrents.\n  We can no longer accept the cost of fighting these first. Cost to \nFederal agencies alone was $1 billion last year. It makes sense to \npromote revenues to Federal, State, and county coffers through timely \nsalvage rather than bear the increasing burden of wildfire suppression \ncosts.\n  I am sorry to report that yesterday was a sad day for the community \nof smokejumpers around this Nation. Instead of meeting with me as I \nrequested, a group of five smokejumpers rushed to meet with press to \nimpugn the integrity of those of us who support some measure of salvage \nlogging. Their statements about salvage logging are filled with \ninaccuracies. Until now, smokejumpers have enjoyed a good deal of \nreverence and support in the Congress. Now, the reputation of all \nsmokejumpers has been called into question by the conduct of these five \nfrom within their ranks.\n  Under the tutelage of preservation discontents, these jumpers have \nbecome self-pronounced forest policy experts. Their tactic was, first, \nmake a splash in the press, and then meet with their elected \nrepresentatives to discuss the facts. It seems they are attempting to \ncharacterize me as using the deaths of 35 firefighters in 1994 fires as \na means to promote salvage logging. I am incensed at this insinuation. \nSuch personal attacks have no place in the debate over this issue. \nThese smokejumpers have disgraced themselves.\n  However, this incident illustrates perfectly why this salvage \namendment is so necessary. As the process stands now, activists of \nevery stripe find it easy to be obstructionists using appeals, threats, \nintimidations and false accusations in the media to slow down or stop \nthe agencies' salvage efforts. It is past time for Congress to step in \nand clear a procedural path which the agencies can use to make \nresponsible salvage decisions and carry them out. That is what this \nsalvage provision will do, and that's why it must remain in this \nrescission legislation.\n  I compliment Senator Gorton and Senator Hatfield for providing \nleadership on this issue. And the Senator from Montana for his \namendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent letters to me on this subject be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Potlatch Corp.,\n\n                                     Lewiston, ID, March 28, 1995.\n     Senator Larry Craig,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Craig: I am writing to ask for your continuing \n     strong support for the Emergency Timber Salvage Amendment to \n     the Omnibus Recissions Bill.\n       As you know, more than 600,000 acres of Idaho National \n     Forests burned last summer. The fires resulted from years of \n     drought combined with years of mismanagement allowing \n     overstocked, diseased and dying timber stands to go untreated \n     until finally fire reset the ecological clock.\n       Nationwide, the federal government spent over $900 million \n     fighting forest fires on 4 million acres with lives lost, \n     private property destroyed and fragile wildlife and plant \n     species put at risk.\n       This bill is a common-sense approach for quickly salvaging \n     burned timber which will be converted to useful products for \n     American families supporting rural economies in the process.\n       Opponents claim that all environmental laws are being by-\n     passed. This is simply not true. The Amendment streamlines \n     some of the time-consuming requirements of those laws in \n     order to ensure timely action. But environmental assessments \n     and biological reviews still must be done, and the Secretary \n     of Agriculture still can veto any proposed sale.\n       You and I know this is an emergency and that salvage \n     efforts must begin immediately to minimize values lost from \n     rapidly deteriorating burned timber. The environmental \n     safeguards are sufficient and the costs of delay are too \n     great.\n       I hope you agree and will support the Salvage Amendment. \n     Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions \n     about the Amendment or its impacts.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Kevin C.

Over $1 billion was spent to control those fires, and \n     several lives were lost in the process.\n       The amendment would allow the Forest Service to recover \n     some of the fire-damaged trees, and dying timber elsewhere, \n     through emergency salvage sales. No new money is needed to do \n     this; it's already contained in the agency's salvage trust \n     fund.\n       As a bonus, the amendment would return millions of dollars \n     to the Treasury, provide jobs for forest service workers, and \n     give federal foresters the ability to convert dead, dying and \n     burned forests into healthy young forests in order to \n     stabilize soils, protect streams, reduce the risk of \n     catastrophic fire, and develop habitat for wildlife.\n       Opponents claim that all environmental laws are being by-\n     passed. This is simply not true. The amendment cases some of \n     the time-consuming requirements of those laws in order to \n     ensure timely action. But environmental assessments and \n     biological reviews still must be done, and the Secretary of \n     Agriculture still can veto any proposed sale.\n       Remember we are dealing with an emergency. Salvage work has \n     to begin immediately to gain value from already-burned timber \n     and to remove dead and dying timber before it is consumed in \n     this year's firestorms. I believe environmental safeguards \n     are sufficient, and the costs of delay are too great.\n       I hope you agree and will support the salvage amendment. \n     Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions \n     about the amendment or its impacts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry Isenberg,\n     Manager Timber & Lands.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                     Lewiston, ID.\n     Senator Larry E. Craig,\n       Dear Senator Craig: I just received a notice that said that \n     efforts were being made to weaken the language on fire killed \n     timber salvage. As you already know, we here in Idaho have \n     been plagued by punishing droughts for the last several \n     years. Most likely this drought condition has been the major \n     cause of the fires we had last year. We need to salvage and \n     use all the timber we can. Punishing us further does not make \n     any sense.\n       The salvage levels and accountability need to be the same \n     as the recently approved House version (Taylor-Dicks \n     Amendment).\n           Very truly yours,\n     Sue Knoll.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    Boise Cascade,\n\n\n                            Timber and Wood Products Division,\n\n                                       Emmett, ID, March 27, 1995.\n     Hon.

The Senator from Washington has 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLeahy be added as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent a letter submitted to the \nMembers of Congress from the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's \nAssociations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          Pacific Coast Federation\n\n\n                                  of Fishermen's Associations,\n\n                                                   March 13, 1995.\n     Re fishing industry groups oppose ``sufficient language'' and \n         mandated timber harvests.\n\n     Members of Congress,\n     Capitol Hill,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Member of Congress: The Pacific Coast Federation of \n     Fishermen's Associations (PCFFA) is the largest organization \n     of commercial fishermen on the west coast, with member \n     organizations from San Diego to Alaska. We represent working \n     men and women of the Pacific fishing fleet who generate tens \n     of thousands of jobs and are the economic mainstay of many \n     coastal communities throughout the Pacific coast region. We \n     are joined in this letter by the Northwest Sportfishing \n     Industry Association (NSIA), which represents the many \n     sportfishing businesses in the Northwest. There are more than \n     5,000 such businesses in this region, with several thousand \n     more in Alaska. Between our two organizations we represent \n     several billion dollars annually in economic productivity, \n     and more than 100,000 jobs along the Pacific coast as well as \n     far inland.\n       We oppose the current Congressional effort to approve \n     ``sufficiency language'' or to mandate minimum timber harvest \n     levels in the Northwest. However well meaning, these are \n     nevertheless bad ideas. Sufficiency language would simply \n     override all current protections for salmon and other aquatic \n     species. Mandatory timber harvest levels would essentially do \n     the same, since many levels could not be reached without \n     severe damage to other resources. The result would only be \n     additional degradation of already severely damaged salmon \n     spawning habitat, more economic dislocation within fishing \n     communities, and more lost jobs in our industry. Salmon \n     throughout the region have already been severely depressed \n     because of past timber harvests done without regard to their \n     environmental consequences. This region cannot afford to go \n     down that road once again.\n       We also are a natural resource dependent industry. We are \n     sympathetic to the plight of timber communities, and are not \n     opposed to harvesting timber through the existing Forest Plan \n     or in ways that are legal under current law. However, it \n     makes no economic sense to harvest timber on the backs of \n     fishermen and at the expense of the jobs and coastal \n     communities which salmon support. This would be a form of \n     economic suicide for the region.\n       Federal management agencies already have an aggressive fire \n     salvage program, and all the legal authority they need to \n     implement it. However, they should not be forced by law to \n     move faster than they can complete the necessary \n     environmental assessments and watershed analyses so they can \n     take the proper steps to protect fragile salmon and other \n     aquatic resources. The solution is not ``sufficiency \n     language,'' nor is it mandated levels. The real solution \n     would be to accelerate funding to the USFS and BLM to enable \n     them to more quickly complete the necessary watershed \n     analyses for their own planned salvage and harvest programs.\n       Sufficiency language and mandated harvest levels are simply \n     bad ideas. If enacted, they would further deplete salmon and \n     other aquatic resources which it is vitally important to \n     protect. They would also further devastate fishing economies \n     throughout the region. They would throw our industry further \n     into economic chaos. They would make it just that much \n     tougher, and just that much more expensive, to restore the \n     Northwest's valuable salmon runs back to full productivity.\n       We urge you to oppose every attempt to impose ``sufficiency \n     language'' to override current environmental protections as \n     well as the setting of mandatory harvest or salvage levels on \n     our nation's forests--whether by appropriations rider, \n     amendment or separate legislation. Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n     Zeke Grader,\n       Executive Director,\n         Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations.\n     Liz Hamilton,\n       Executive Director,\n         Northwest Sportfishing Industry Association (NSIA).\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield the remaining time to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I am very disturbed by the content of the \namendment of the senior Senator of the State of Washington. The \nlanguage of this amendment would allow the suspension of all \nenvironmental laws applicable to logging on certain forests managed by \nthe U.S. Forest Service and the BLM--all environmental laws.\n  This language would cover any timber offered through September 1996, \nin a salvage sale, a term that is so broadly defined as to apply \nvirtually to any kind of timber sale.\n  The language of the bill says:\n\n       A salvage timber sale means a timber sale for which an \n     important reason for entry includes removal of diseased, \n     damaged trees or trees affected by fire and imminently \n     susceptible to fire or insect attack.\n\n  Mr. President, as I read this amendment, that language means to limit \nsalvage timber sales to areas where the trees are still made of wood; \nall wood would be susceptible to insect or fire. Therefore, all would \nbe included in this amendment, and environmental laws for the logging \nof such timber would be not relevant.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that we will support the amendment of the \nSenator from Washington. I think she has taken a politically difficult \nand dangerous course, and has done so on the stand of principle and in \na way that does not savage the environmental law. I salute her for \ndoing this.\n  Sometimes in haste, in an effort to respond to what is a crisis, we \nmake big mistakes. This should not even be \n[[Page S4881]] on an appropriations bill. It should be in the \nauthorizing committee. It is not. It is the wrong piece of legislation \non the wrong bill at the wrong time, and it should be rejected because \nit sets an incredibly dangerous precedent.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, in my State, and throughout most of our \nFederal forest nationwide, we are experiencing a forest health crisis \nof epic proportions. In 1994, 80 years of fire suppression and almost a \ndecade of drought conditions culminated in one of the worst national \nfire seasons on record. Thirty-three fire fighters lost their lives and \n$900 million was spent fighting these fires. Fourteen of the fire \nfighters who died were from Prineville, OR, a small town in my home \nState. Congress must act swiftly to address this situation or face a \n1995 fire season as bad or worse than 1994.\n  Congress has known about the forest health and fire danger problem \nfor a long time. In July 1992, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee held a hearing on forest health. At this hearing, Jack Ward \nThomas, then a researcher and now Chief of the Forest Service, stated \n``we should proceed with salvage as soon as possible, and as carefully \nas possible.'' In fact, at that 1992 hearing, the Forest Service \nidentified 850 million board feet of timber in eastern Oregon and \nWashington alone that needed to be salvaged in 1992 and 1993. Only half \nof that volume, however, has been actually salvaged.\n  The forest health crisis exists nationwide, but in my State it is \nparticularly acute. Of the 5 million acres of Oregon's Blue Mountains, \n50 to 75 percent contains predominantly dead or dying trees. According \nto the Forest Service, the land management practices of the past 80 or \n100 years are the primary reasons for the poor health of Oregon's, and \nthe Nation's, forests. Fire suppression, the single largest \ncontributing factor, has prevented naturally occurring, low-intensity \nfires to clear out the understory of forest stands. This has allowed \nless-resilient, shade tolerant tree species such as white fir, and \nDouglas fir, to flourish. These trees have been prime targets for \ndisease, insect infestation, and now wildfire.\n  It is time to begin the healing process in our forests that Jack Ward \nThomas felt was so important 3 years ago. Congress can live up to its \nresponsibility to provide direction to the land management agencies by \npassing the Gorton salvage amendment.\n  As many of my colleagues know, salvage logging is not without \ncontroversy. Although it is part of regular Forest Service practice, \nsome seek now to block the salvage of diseased and bug infested timber \nas a land management option. To put their position in perspective, \nthese same voices have publicly stated that their preferred goal is to \neliminate the harvesting of any and all trees from Federal lands--even \nfor the enhancement of forest health. This dogma is so stringent that \nthe catastrophic loss of our natural resources through disease, insect \ninfestation and fire is preferable to having the health of these \nforests restored for future generations.\n  The radical doctrine of no use, which certain groups are now \nadvocating, not only threatens the future health of our forests, it \nthreatens the underlying base of political support for one of our \nNation's most important environmental laws--the Endangered Species Act.\n  I was the original sponsor of the 1972 version of the\n   bill which eventually went on to become the Endangered Species Act. \nI believe the act epitomizes the respect we, as a nation, hold for our \nenvironment and our natural surroundings. While I have made it clear \nthat I believe some fine tuning of the act needs to occur during the \nupcoming reauthorization debate, I worry that when moderate positions, \nsuch as the one put forth in the Gorton amendment, become polarized, \nfodder is given to those whose goal is to abolish or gut the act. I \nwill do my best to prevent this from happening, but the position of \nsome groups on this salvage amendment simply perpetuates the attitude \nthat all environmental laws, including the ESA, have gone too far and \nneed to be significantly altered or scrapped.\n\n  These concerns are merely symptoms of a larger problem--the breakdown \nof our Nation's land management laws. The result of this breakdown is a \nproblem of national significance with little ability in the law for \nland managers to take care of the problem in a timely manner.\n  Unfortunately, for those of us who have been around a while, this \nsituation is all too familiar.\n  Almost 6 years ago, I stood here on the floor with my colleagues from \nthe Pacific Northwest, the Senate Appropriations Committee and the \nSenate authorizing committees to announce a temporary solution to a \ncrisis in the Pacific Northwest. This compromise was sponsored by \nmyself and then-Senator Adams from Washington State, and was supported \nby every member of the Pacific Northwest delegation. It was truly an \nextraordinary measure, meant to address an extraordinary situation.\n  Recognizing the temporary nature of this solution, many Members of \nCongress believed that larger issues loomed and needed to be addressed. \nNamely, that the forest management and planning laws, originally \nenacted in 1976, were in serious need of revision. During the course of \nthe debate on the Hatfield-Adams amendment I entered into a colloquy \nwith then-chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Leahy, \nto proclaim the temporary nature of the amendment and announce our \nintentions to pursue a long-term solution through the review and \nrevision of our Nation's forest management laws in the authorizing \ncommittees.\n  Six years later, however, our forest management laws are unchanged.\n  When the Northwest timber compromise was developed in 1989, I took \nthe promises of my colleagues to address our Nation's long-term forest \nmanagement laws very seriously, and I was determined to do my part to \naddress this growing dilemma. In 1990, I introduced legislation, called \nthe National Forest Plan Implementation Act, to assist with the \nimplementation of forest plans developed as a result of the 10-year \nplanning processes enacted by Congress in 1976. Two years later, \nanother comprehensive bill was introduced by Senator Adams to address \nthe long-term issue. Both of these measures were referred to the Senate \nAgriculture Committee where no hearings were held and they died in \ncommittee.\n  The next year, in 1991, I was a primary cosponsor of Senator \nPackwood's Forest and Families Protection Act, which dealt with a \nnumber of the same issues as my 1990 bill and also addressed the issues \nof rural development and workers. This legislation was referred to the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, of which I am a member, \nwhere we were able to hold several hearings and a markup on the bill. \nUnfortunately, the bill never made it to the floor for consideration.\n  My point is, Mr. President, many of us have undertaken significant \nefforts to live up to the commitments of 1989 to address the long-term \nmanagement of our forest resources through the authorizing committees. \nUnfortunately for the entire Nation, the other Senate authorizing \ncommittees with jurisdiction over this issue have not felt compelled to \ndo the same.\n  The Gorton amendment to the rescission bill begins to address this \nproblem by doing three things to address the emergency situation that \nnow exists in many forests. The first is national in scope and provides \nour Federal land management agencies with the flexibility to conduct \nenvironmentally sensitive forest health/salvage activities. These \nactivities will be done using the agencies' own standards and \nguidelines for forest and wildlife management.\n  Second, the Gorton amendment releases 375 million board feet of \ntimber sales in western Oregon that were previously sold to timber \npurchasers. Most of these sales, originally authorized by the Northwest \ntimber compromise amendment of 1989, were determined by the record of \ndecision for President Clinton's option 9 plan not to jeopardize the \nexistence of any species. To ensure further protections, the Gorton \namendment includes provisions prohibiting activities in timber sale \nunits which contain any nesting threatened or endangered species.\n  Finally, the Gorton amendment gives the Clinton administration more \ntools with which to implement timber sales in the geographic area \ncovered by its option 9 plan. As a vocal critic of option 9 and the \nprocess that was used to develop it, I have some concerns about this \nsection of the Gorton amendment. Nevertheless, I applaud the sponsor's \n[[Page S4882]] efforts to give the administration all possible tools to \nmeet its promises to get wood to the mills of the Pacific Northwest in \nthe next 18 months.\n  While the first portion of the Gorton amendment is national in scope, \nthese last two sections will assist the President in meeting his \ncommitments to the workers, families, and environment of both western \nand eastern Oregon and Washington.\n  I came to the floor in 1989 to offer the Northwest timber compromise \nbecause we were witnessing what was then a crisis for the rural \ncommunities of my State. Since that time, 213 mills have closed in \nOregon and Washington and over 21,800 workers have lost their forestry-\nrelated jobs. In addition, the forests in the eastern half of these two \nStates are in the worst health in a hundred years.\n  These national forests and communities cannot wait through another \nfire season like 1994 for Congress to finally meet its commitments to \nrewrite the Nation's forest management laws. I have every confidence \nthat the new Republican Congress will do its best to meet that \nchallenge, but the Gorton amendment is necessary to help us bridge that \ngap. It is a much needed piece of legislation for our Nation's forests \nand timber dependent communities.\n  There are those whose agenda is to prevent people from managing our \nforests altogether. They would rather let our dead and dying forests \nburn by catastrophic fire, endangering human life and long-term forest \nhealth, than harvest them to promote stability in natural forest \necosystems and communities dependent on a supply of timber from Federal \nlands. The Gorton amendment says we can be reasonable in what we do in \nthe forests and harvest trees for many uses--forest health, community \nstabilization, ecosystem restoration, and jobs for our workers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Gorton amendment to the fiscal \nyear 1995 rescissions bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). All time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, I would like to welcome some special \nfriends to Washington today. They are Penny Copps of Butte, and Penny's \nson, Steve Bullock, late of Montana and now living here in Washington, \nDC.\n  Just about a year ago, the entire Bullock family weathered about the \nworst blow any family can take.\n  Eleven-year-old Jeremy Bullock--the grandson of Penny and her husband \nJack; Steve's nephew; the son of Bill and Robin; Joshua's twin; the \nelder brother of Sam, Max and now Kaitlyn--was shot and killed, on the \nplayground at the Margaret Leary Elementary School, by an emotionally \ntroubled fourth grader.\n  The family and the whole Butte community, has been through a terrible \ntest. The loss can never be repaired. But they are working together to \nuse this tragedy to make our State of Montana, and all of America more \nsensitive to and aware of the violence that has hurt so many of our \nyouth. They have a spent a year teaching, learning, and doing their \nbest to make sure no other family suffers such a loss.\n  It is now my great privilege to read to you a statement written by \nthe Bullock family in memory of their son, Jeremy.\n\n     There is nothing more infectious than a child's laugh.\n     Nothing more disarming than the innocence of a child's \n           question.\n     What fills the void when our children's voices can no longer \n           be heard?\n\n  On April 12, 1994, Jeremy and Joshua, eleven-year-old-identical \ntwins, woke, dressed, had breakfast and left for school that day, the \nsame as any other day. It was library day, so Jeremy's backpack was \nheavy with books he had read and was returning.\n  Weeks later, a police officer worked up the courage to give Jeremy's \nfamily that backpack. He had tried to scrub the blood from the canvas, \ntrying to ease the pain in the only way he knew how. For on April 12, \n1994, eleven-year-old Jeremy was shot and killed at his school by a \nchild whose only explanation was ``No one loves me.''\n  Jeremy Michael Seidlitz Bullock lived in a home in Montana where \nviolence was not condoned. He was not allowed to watch violence on \ntelevision or play games glamorizing violence. Instead, he was active \nin sports. Jeremy loved to sing. He listed his hobby as getting good \ngrades. School was his second home, a place where children laughed and \nlearned.\n  Jeremy wanted to become a teacher or an environmental engineer. \nJeremy and his brother Josh would spend hours on hikes, coming home \nwith their pockets overflowing with garbage they picked up along the \nway. Jeremy believed that leaving places he visited better than the way \nhe found them was a good way to live.\n  Jeremy loved and was deeply loved. Yet, he was not safe because \ncollectively we allowed Jeremy's voice to be silenced.\n  Every day in America the voices of 10 of our children are silenced by \nviolent acts. Over three million of our children ages 3 to 17 are \nexposed to parental violence every year. Our children will witness over \n200,000 acts of violence on television by the time they turn 18. A new \nhandgun is manufactured every 20 seconds in America. And many of them \nwind up in the wrong hands.\n  We passively listen and accept the statistics, but do we listen for \nthe voices lost?\n  On behalf of Jeremy's family and children everywhere, we will \ndesignate April 12 as a day of remembrance of \n[[Page S4883]] Jeremy and dedicate ourselves to creating a safe world \nfor all of our children.\n  We dedicate ourselves to taking that walk with Jeremy, and accepting \nhis simple challenge: Are we leaving this place that we visit better \nthan the way we found it?\n  Our children need not lose their voices while we stand by, \noverwhelmed by the magnitude of the problem.\n  There is much we can do. We can tell the media we will not be \nconsumers of glorified violence. We can direct our children toward \nnonviolent entertainment and help them find acceptable ways to express \nanger and resolve conflict. we can extend the boundaries of our \nfamilies to include caring about and caring for the children of our \ncommunity.\n  And when we become discouraged, we must rededicate ourselves by \nstraining our ears, to hear the empty void left behind. Listen for the \nvoice of eleven-year-old Jeremy Bullock, and listen for the voices of \nothers that have been silenced. For the pain in remembering is little \ncompared to the pain in realizing that others may soon forget.\n  Mr. President, April 12 is the first anniversary of this tragedy. And \non that day, the Bullocks will join the Margaret Leary School and the \nwhole Butte family in dedicating a soccer field to the memory of Jeremy \nBullock.\n  Every so often, people in Washington--and, I suppose, people \nanywhere--lose sight of what really counts. We get wrapped up in policy \narguments, debates over bills and so on. People like the Bullocks can \nremind us of what is truly important--our families, our communities, \nour children.\n  I hope all of us--here on the floor, up in the galleries, watching on \nC-SPAN--will listen to this courageous family.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/30/senate-section/article/S4882-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4883-S4890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am going to offer an amendment. I am \ngoing to take about 15 seconds.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Will the Senator yield for just a moment, please?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. We are in a situation where we really have the D'Amato \namendment as the pending business.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Can I ask to set that aside?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. For how long?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. For about 60 seconds.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \ntemporarily the D'Amato amendment in order for the Senator from Iowa to \noffer a 60-second amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, I have no objection. You are \nnot going to offer your amendment at this point but just to make a \nstatement?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. It has been accepted, and I want to offer it.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. It is noncontroversial.\n  Mr. DODD. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 430 to Amendment No. 420\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds by the Secretary of Agriculture \n     to delineate new agricultural wetlands, except under certain \n                             circumstances)\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Dorgan and myself, \nI send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for himself and Mr. \n     Dorgan, proposes an amendment numbered 430.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS TO DELINEATE NEW \n                   AGRICULTURAL WETLANDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), \n     during the period beginning on the date of enactment of this \n     Act and ending on December 31, 1995, none of the funds made \n     available by this or any other Act may be used by the \n     Secretary of Agriculture to delineate wetlands for the \n     purpose of certification under section 1222(a) of the Food \n     Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3822(a)).\n       (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to land if \n     the owner or operator of the land requests a determination as \n     to whether the land is considered a wetland under subtitle C \n     of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3821 \n     et seq.) or any other provision of law.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my amendment prohibits the Secretary of \nAgriculture from expending funds to continue the wetland certification \nand delineation process on agricultural land, unless requested by the \nlandowner.\n  It is my understanding that the amendment has been cleared by both \nthe Agriculture Committee and the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee and will be accepted by the managers of the bill.\n  My amendment safeguards the property rights of our Nation's farmers \nby prohibiting the Secretary of Agriculture from expending funds to \ndelineate new wetlands on agriculture land until the end of the year. \nThis rescission will allow Congress the opportunity to reform wetlands \npolicy through new legislation. It will also allow the public to have \ninput into the process. Thus far, the landowners have been shut out of \nthe process.\n  As you know, no less than four Federal agencies claim jurisdiction \nover the regulation of wetlands. Just think of how impossible it must \nbe for the family farmer to understand what four different Federal \nagencies want him to do in regard to wetlands on his private property.\n  Last year, these agencies entered into a memorandum of agreement. \nAlthough the MOA was intended to streamline the regulatory process and \nclarify the role of each agency, it has increased the level of \nconfusion and frustration among those farmers affected by it.\n  The delineation of wetlands on agricultural land has been a confusing \nproposition for some time. On the other hand, the consequences of the \ndelineations are very clear. A farmer who alters a wetland without \nauthorization from the Federal Government faces potential civil \npenalties, criminal action, and loss of farm programs benefits. Because \nthe stakes are so high, we must ensure that the delineation process is \naccurate and reasonable. And we must ensure that the voice of the \nfarmer is allowed to be heard when the process is put into place.\n  As I speak, new wetland delineations are being conducted in the State \nof Iowa pursuant to the MOA. It will soon cover every other State \naffected by agricultural wetlands. So farmers in all States will soon \nbe deprived of the right to farm their land or improve their property \nbecause a Federal bureaucrat decides that such activity interferes with \na protected wetland.\n  This process is being done in a laboratory, by people unknown to the \nfarmers, who take soil surveys and aerial photography and try to find \nevidence of wetlands, in order to get more farmers under their \nregulatory umbrella. This process disturbs me greatly.\n  The old Soil Conservation Service worked alongside farmers for the \npast 60 or 70 years. There was a close relationship between the farmer \nand SCS officials. They shared a common goal of promoting conservation \nof the land. That sort of cooperation has resulted in more benefit to \nthe environment than any other USDA program. But I am afraid that this \ncooperative spirit has been lost.\n  The current process has shut out the farmer. The bureaucrats are \nmaking decisions without consultation with farmers. We have gone \nthrough this process before--with the passage of the swampbuster and \nsodbuster provisions of the 1985\n farm bill. For the most part, farmers did not complain about the \nprocess then--because there was an open effort on the part of the \nbureaucracy to work with the farmers, to educate them on the process \nand to solicit the farmers' input. But that is not the case this time \naround.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to make it very clear that I am not opposed to \nprotecting valuable wetlands. My vote for the antisodbuster and \nantiswampbuster provisions in the 1985 farm bill is proof of that. And \nI am making no attempt \n[[Page S4884]] to roll back the provisions of that bill. However, I am \nopposed to changing the rules every few years so that farmers can never \nbe certain if their conduct is allowed under the current regulatory \nscheme. I am also opposed to the promulgation of an MOA that will \nsignificantly affect the ability of private property owners to improve \ntheir land, without the benefit of input from the people affected by \nthe agreement.\n  My amendment will allow for this input through congressional hearings \non wetlands policy. At the very least, Congress should ensure that the \nconcerns of private property owners are heard before they are deprived \nof the use of their land.\n  The amendment will also stop the bureaucracy from acting based on the \nflawed memorandum of agreement. I believe that this Congress is \ncommitted to reforming Federal wetlands policy. This policy should be \nbased on sound science, recognize the constitutionally protected rights \nof private property and, above all, institute a large dose of common \nsense into the program. This amendment stops the Government from \nfinding new wetlands on farm land until this reform can be put in \nplace.\n  Mr. President, in closing I want to make sure that my colleagues \nunderstand the scope and the intent of this amendment. The amendment \nwill in no way affect the regulation of wetlands currently listed on \nthe wetlands inventory. Furthermore, it will not interfere with a \nlandowner's ability to obtain a section 404 permit or a swampbuster \ndetermination.\n  What the amendment does, simply stated, is this: The amendment \nprohibits the Natural Resource Conservation Service from conducting its \ncertification process and adding new wetlands to the inventory until \n1996.\n  Opponents may argue that it was the agricultural interests that \nwanted the NRCS to be the lead agency in determining wetlands on \nagricultural lands. This is accurate, however, the agricultural \ncommunity believes that the MOA is a flawed document and they \noverwhelmingly support this amendment. In fact when I introduced this \nmoratorium as a free-standing bill, 14 farm groups from across the \npolitical spectrum signed a letter to President Clinton supporting the \nbill. These groups range from the conservative-leaning American Farm \nBureau Federation to the bipartisan Association of State Departments of \nAgriculture to the more-liberal National Farmers Union. I would also \nnote that the bill is cosponsored by 18 other Senators from both sides \nof the aisle. All of us involved in agriculture want to relieve the \nregulatory burden placed on farmers by Federal wetlands policy. This \namendment will allow Congress some time to do just that. I urge my \ncolleagues to accept this amendment.\n  (At the request of Mr. Grassley, the following statement was printed \nin the Record.)\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have cosponsored this amendment \nwith the Senator from Iowa and ask this body's approval. I will be \nunable to come to the floor today because I must be in North Dakota to \ntestify before the Base Realignment and Closure Commission.\n  We sought this amendment so the Federal agencies who implement the \nSwampbuster law will avoid creating unnecessary confusion for farmers \nwho are subject to the regulations and rules on management of wetlands.\n  In the 1990 farm bill, we made some improvements on wetland \nregulations, including provisions that assign the Department of \nAgriculture as lead agency for implementing swampbuster regulations on \nfarmland. To fulfill the intent of the 1990 farm bill, the Federal \nagencies have proposed some changes in rules and operating procedures \nfor mapping, or delineating, wetlands on farmland. Those new procedures \nare expected to be implemented this year.\n  Our amendment will hold up implementation of those new procedures and \nmapping conventions until Congress reviews the swampbuster law as part \nof the farm bill this year. Congress may, in fact, change its approach \nto the small, temporary wetlands, called type I wetlands, and many of \nus in Congress want to see some changes in that area. It only makes \nsense to avoid implementation of changes in wetlands rules this year if \nmore are to be made in the farm bill.\n  In consideration of farmers who must try to understand and conform to \nFederal wetlands requirements, we simply must not change the rules \nevery year.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, as I understand this amendment, it \nprohibits the Secretary of Agriculture from conducting new wetland \ndelineations or certifications on agricultural lands, except at the \nrequest of a landowner or operator, for the purposes of carrying out \nwetland conservation programs under title XII of the 1985 Food Security \nAct. The amendment does not apply to the wetlands regulatory program \nunder section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Therefore, the Grassley \namendment in no way restricts the Secretary of Agriculture, through the \nNational Resources Conservation Service, from delineating wetlands on \nagricultural lands for the purposes of carrying out section 404 of the \nClean Water Act.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator from Rhode Island is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senator from Iowa for clarifying that point. \nIt follows then that the January 1994 memorandum of agreement among the \nDepartment of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, the \nDepartment of the Interior, and the Department of the Army concerning \nthe delineation of wetlands for purposes of section 404 of the Clean \nWater Act and subtitle B of the Food Security Act is not suspended by \nthis amendment. And, in accordance with that memorandum of agreement, \nthe Natural Resources Conservation Service will make wetland \ndelineations on agricultural lands for the purposes of determining \nsection 404 jurisdiction.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is correct. My amendment does not suspend the \ngeneral terms and procedures of the interagency memorandum of agreement \non wetland delineations with the exception of the terms of that \nagreement relating to new delineations and new certifications of \nwetlands on agricultural lands under section 1222(a) of the Food \nSecurity Act of 1985.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I understand that a copy of that amendment is \navailable.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. Senator Dorgan cleared it on the Democratic side, \nand I have cleared it on our side.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I understand. The Senator is correct. But there is a \nSenator who has asked to see a copy of it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am sorry if it has not been cleared.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator Leahy \nwishes to see the amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We cleared it with him.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is the word I am receiving.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \nGrassley amendment temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Reserving the right to object, what was the request?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I was asking unanimous consent to temporarily lay aside \nthe Grassley amendment until the Senator can read it and others can \nread it who are interested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment will be set aside.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 427 to Amendment No. 420\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now recurs on amendment No. 427 \noffered by the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I understand my colleague from Arizona wants \nsome time on this amendment.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, back on my amendment, we have now been \nable to clear it with the necessary Members who had some doubt, \nalthough I was correct in my first statement that it had been cleared. \nBut there was some question about which version. We have that all \nsettled now.\n  [[Page S4885]] Mr. President, I ask that we take final action on my \namendment.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. It has now been \ncompletely cleared on both sides. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 430) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the D'Amato \namendment be laid aside temporarily.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, may I inquire \nof my friend from North Carolina?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I will say to the Senator, I think maybe we \nought to do something around here except sit around in quorum call with \nthe threat of being here all night. I have two or three amendments I \nwould like to offer. So I would go ahead with my amendment if the \nSenator from Connecticut and others on his side will permit me to do \nso.\n  Mr. DODD. May I say, Mr. President, to my good friend from North \nCarolina, I think an effort is being made here to see if we cannot come \nup with some resolution of the issue. I respect immensely the desire to \nmove along. The Senator from North Carolina is aware this has only \noccurred because an amendment was offered. Certainly I am anxious to \nsee us move along at this point.\n  With all due respect to my colleague, at this juncture I think we are \nfairly close to striking an agreement. I am going to object.\n  Mr. HELMS. Before the Senator objects, I was going to say if, as, and \nwhen an agreement is reached, the Helms amendment could be laid aside.\n  Mr. DODD. I think at this point here I just would like to see if--we \nare fairly close, I say to my colleague. I have several colleagues over \nhere who have been holding up for the last hour, sitting here at my \nrequest not to go forward until we get a resolution. The Senator from \nCalifornia, the Senator from Nebraska--there is one other one, I \nthink--had amendments pending. The Senator from Arizona. They agreed. \nWith all due respect, in fairness to them, I object to going forward.\n  Mr. HELMS. If the Senator would yield, let me suggest we do \nsomething, just not sit here----\n  Mr. DODD. We are right now, Senator.\n  Mr. HELMS. Under the quorum call rule, rolling on like Tennyson's \nbrook.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate my colleague's concerns. But I did not create \nthe situation we are in. I am just responding to the situation we are \nput in. I understand and I am sympathetic to his concerns. But with all \ndue respect to my friend from North Carolina--and he is that--I \nrespectfully object.\n  Mr. HELMS. As the saying goes, you probably will not love me in the \nmorning.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me say that I am desirous of \nattempting to accommodate my colleagues, particularly the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee and my colleagues on the Appropriations \nCommittee, and those who are interested.\n  Mr. KERREY. Is the Senate in quorum call?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Yes, the quorum call was called off. The quorum call was \ncalled off. The Senator yielded the floor and I am making a statement. \nI believe I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no quorum call.\n  The Senator from New York has the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. In an attempt, Mr. President, to move the process, I \nhave attempted to work out an agreement with my colleagues who share a \nconcern as it relates to the inadequacy of time to debate this very \nimportant legislative proposal.\n  I must say to you, I have no disagreement with providing ample time. \nYet, if we were to have more extensive debate--and we have had 3 hours \nplus--I recognize that would impede us from going forward on this \nimportant legislative initiative.\n  Therefore, it is in that spirit, that spirit with my colleagues, that \nI have indicated I am willing to withdraw this amendment at this time, \nto offer it as a freestanding resolution, to bring it up Monday at noon \nor anytime thereafter, to have extensive debate, to divide the time \nequally, and to have a time certain to vote--for a reasonable time, to \nput in 5 hours equally divided. But by no means am I suggesting that it \nshould be limited to 5 hours if 6 hours is necessary or 7 hours or 8 or \n10 hours or 12 hours or 24 hours. But at some point in time I want to \nbe assured, because of the importance of this, that we have a vote, \nthat my colleagues truly have an opportunity to vote.\n  Indeed, this may not carry. I have no illusions. I think probably it \nwill be defeated. I have a sense that there are lots of my colleagues \nwho would just as soon stay out of this situation. They will let the \nPresident do it, and if Mexico deteriorates, we did not do anything. \nThat is what is taking place.\n  I think it is a question of our constitutional responsibility. We are \ntalking about making billions--by the way, I did not have sufficient \ntime to respond as it relates to the appropriateness of this measure. \nWe are talking about rescissions of $14 billion. Here is $20 billion \ngoing to Mexico; $5 billion has already gone down. Another $5-billion-\nplus will go down in the next 2 or 3 weeks, or 4 weeks.\n  If you want to talk about aid, I want to give aid to the communities \nthat need it. Orange County, I would rather give them a loan guarantee \nwith this money. How about the District of Columbia? Let us help them. \nIn my State, we have a $4 billion deficit we inherited. Let us help \nthem out. Then, after that--that only accounts for $4 billion, $2 \nbillion, $6 billion, $7 billion--then let us give the other $13 billion \nto deficit reduction, if you want to help. Talk about relevance.\n  I mean, if the Senators come and say they are concerned about the \nchildren, if you are concerned about the children, here is the \nopportunity to give them that money instead of shipping it away. I \nthink it is very relevant why we are cutting back programs over here in \nthis country. We are supposed to say no; we should not have the \nresponsibility for voting on an appropriations which is an \nappropriation as it relates to bailing out another country--\nunprecedented.\n  By the way, this fund has never been used for any countries that some \nof my colleagues--Israel has never been a beneficiary of this. The \nUnited Kingdom has never been a beneficiary of this. Only one country \nhas ever gone up to $1 billion: Mexico. They paid that back in 12 \nmonths.\n  When I hear people telling me, ``Oh, my god. It will be the end of \nthe world if we do not have this authority,'' unprecedented \ncircumvention of the constitutional responsibilities of this Congress. \nLet me tell you, if you do not want to vote on it, but you will have to \nvote on it, do we say that this is the way to do business? By the way, \nI respect people who say, ``Alfonse, we have to do something to help \nMexico.'' Let us do it the right way. If it means we have to get a \nmajority of our colleagues to vote to appropriate, then let us do it in \nthat manner.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a brief \nquestion?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have been saying all along that this transaction with \nMexico has serious faults and may well not be in our interest. When \nthis was originally brought to us on that day, for example, when the \nSecretary of the Treasury and Alan Greenspan and others addressed \nSenators downstairs, right then I began to develop some serious \nconcerns as to whether or not I would ever support it. Indeed, the \nleadership decided at that time to not bring it before the Congress.\n  [[Page S4886]] But the question I have for the Senator is, Do we have \na base of fact that would provide an ability for the Senate to better \nunderstand how this happens, who is responsible, who profited, who \nsuffered losses, so that we can make an informed decision on the \nSenator's proposed legislation?\n  I frankly am inclined to support the Senator from New York. But I \nwould want to do so only after the most careful analysis of positive \nfacts on this issue. The Senator was to have had hearings in the \ncommittee. I just wondered what the status of the hearings were, and \nwhat is the body of fact that we have before this Senate today that we \ndid not have at the time this was originally brought up?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. We finally have a plan that has been put forth as it \nrelates to the utilization of these dollars. We know that Eurobonds, we \nknow that tesobonos have been facilitated as a result of repurchasing \nthem by the Government. We know that the loan programs, the Mexican \nGovernment has received and been the beneficiary of these dollars. And \nwe also recognize that the economy, notwithstanding the claims that it \nhas moved forward--as a matter of fact, the stock market yesterday in \nMexico dropped 1.2 percent--we understand marginal movements up and \ndown.\n  But the fact is that some of the so-called petroleum reserves that \nare going to be used as collateral--there is a very real question about \nwhether or not during the lifetime of these loans, there will be \nsufficient collateral or revenues available.\n  We have learned that there is great civil unrest as it relates to the \npeople of Mexico, and that they are angered at the United States for \nimposing these conditions in terms of raising interest rates, raising \ntax rates; a 50-percent consumer tax increase, from 10 to 15 percent. \nSo we are aware of that.\n  We are also aware that we have not received the kind of information \nthat foreign investment is returning, which is the cornerstone of this \nso-called economic recovery, if it is to take place. We have also \nlearned that it is very doubtful that in the months ahead, they are \ngoing to be able to deal with short-term as well as long-term repayment \nschedules. We are talking about $170-billion-plus which the Mexican \nGovernment owes; $70 billion short term.\n  I say to my friend and colleague, $50 billion worth of guarantees \ndoes not stop or is not sufficient as it relates to the repayment of \n$70 billion worth of short-term Mexican debt this year. That we have \nlearned.\n  We have also learned, unfortunately, in the tabloids, of the \nincredible unrest and, yes, the incredible instability of the \ninstitutions to be able to perform and to carry out any kind of \nmeaningful transformation. We know, for example, that the oil monopoly, \nPEMA, cannot and will not be producing at a rate today that it is in \nthe future. That does not portend good things. We know that capital \nwill not be made available because the Mexican people, and indeed the \nMexican Government, understands that you cannot look to the free \nenterprise system as it relates to the oil monopoly which does have \nvast value.\n  So the premise upon which these agreements were made--by the way, we \ndo know that billions of dollars' worth of investments that were made \nhave been paid. They have been paid by U.S. taxpayer dollars redeeming \nspeculative investments.\n  Mr. WARNER. The question is, To whom was it paid? The fundamental \nquestion I have is, Will the Senate, in the course of the deliberation \nof the proposal of the Senator from New York, have a better \nunderstanding as to how this crisis happened, and who is benefiting \nfrom this cash-flow that has been described by the Senator such that we \ncan act in an informed way on the proposal by the Senator from New \nYork?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. No. Unfortunately, we will not learn for at least a year \nwho the holders of these bearer bonds were, and only then maybe as it \nrelates to those citizens of the United States. Obviously, we have no \nway to know. And this is one of the things that we brought up before \nthis agreement was implemented. Who are the holders of these Eurobonds? \nWho are the holders of the tesobonos? We were told that we could not \nget that information.\n  Now, it seems to me that if we are going to make American dollars \navailable we had a right, that our Treasury people had a right to say \nwe want to see who they are and we want to negotiate with them. We want \nto see if we cannot restructure the repayment so that instead of paying \nit all plus 20 percent, we would restructure on the basis of maybe 60 \ncents on a dollar, 70 cents on a dollar, or maybe pay it over a period \nof time.\n  Now, that would have been--and that, by the way, was suggested by \nBill Seidman, former head of RTC, the former head of the FDIC, who said \nit makes sense to restructure. Do not just shovel out American money \ndollar for dollar.\n  And my friend from Virginia touched exactly on it. To date, when we \nhave asked for the records, when we have asked how this money has been \nused, we are told, ``We don't know.'' As it relates to who received it; \nthey were bearer bonds, ``We don't know.'' They knew the Congress \nwanted this information.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, when the Senator asked, to whom did he \nplace these questions? Was it the administration? And were they not \nforthcoming?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. It was the administration. It has been as high as the \nSecretary and the Deputy Secretary and others in the Treasury \nDepartment. And it is because we were told that they just went along on \nthe basis that it cannot be done, you cannot ascertain who the people \nare.\n  Well, let me tell you something. That is nonsense. They never made \nthat a priority. So you can say well, why are you complaining now? We \ncomplained before they started the repurchase of these agreements, we \ncomplained about it while they were doing it, and we are complaining \nabout it now. And now $5 billion have been expended. How much more \nbefore we say we do question the adequacy of the manner in which these \ndollars were being used?\n  I do not question for one moment the good intentions, indeed, of \ncongressional leadership, Republicans, Democrats. This Senator said \ncertainly we have a special obligation as it relates to Mexico and its \nstability. But, my gosh, we have an obligation to be realistic and to \nsee that these funds are being used appropriately, that we are getting \nthe most for our money.\n  How does repaying a Eurobond or how does the repurchasing of a \ntesobono from someone from Germany or Japan or from the United States \ndollar for dollar plus 20-percent interest in some cases, 25 percent \ninterest in other cases, how does that benefit the Mexican worker, the \nMexican economy? Do we really think that as a result of our purchasing \nthese agreements people are now going to rush to Mexico and put money \nback in there? I think you have to be rather naive to think so.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to know whether or not it has \nbeen the American taxpayer who is responsible for the very funds that \nthe Senator refers to as now being the principal cash flow? Am I not \ncorrect?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. We are. We are the principal casualty as it relates to \nthe cash flow. And let me assure the Senator where we were initially \ntold in briefings which the Senator attended that there would be no \nrisk, that we would not have to put up any money, now we are hearing, \nwell, certainly there is some risk, and now we are hearing, yes, there \nis $5 billion.\n  I remember when the head of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, \nsaid--and I respect him tremendously--if you have to start a drawdown \non these funds the program is not working. Well, we have drawn down $5 \nbillion, in addition to the money from the IMF.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Certainly. Let me complete this.\n  In addition to the money that has come from the World Bank, and I \nbelieve that we will be getting ready, from what I understand, to draw \ndown on billions more from the United States.\n  Now, this is an unprecedented use of the fund, and, yes, Senator Dole \nand Speaker Gingrich have indicated that they wanted to help and they \nwere supportive. Let me remind my colleagues in fairness to Senator \nDole--\n  [[Page S4887]] Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to withdraw from the \ncolloquy. My questions have been answered. It would seem to me, in a \nsense of fairness, indeed, the Senate would want to know what would be \nthe views of Mr. Greenspan, perhaps the Secretary of Treasury, and \nothers specifically addressing the Senator's proposal. Will those \nresponses be available or have they been solicited?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Well, they have been solicited. Indeed, the Secretary of \nthe Treasury is adamantly opposed to this legislation. But let me say I \nam adamantly distressed, deeply distressed at the manner in which \ntaxpayers' funds have been used to date. The lack of accountability--\nand I am not suggesting bad faith, but just as the process has evolved, \nthe lack of accountability, and the accountability that we do have, \nleaves me very, very distressed.\n  I would like to know how it is that we can justify, when we are here \nmaking these cuts, that we are going to send more money down while the \nMexican Government keeps printing pesos, they keep printing them and we \nthink that we are going to help the economy and we are going to help \nthe Mexican people by just shoveling money out in a manner that lacks \nbusiness prudence.\n  I will tell you, you can have all the highfalutin people in the world \nto say this is important, this is good; they are not signing the notes. \nThey are not making this their own business deal. They would never \nenter into a situation like this. There is no real collateral. There is \nno lien against that oil. As one of my colleagues said, you would have \nto send in the 82d Airborne if you wanted to try to exercise that. We \nknow that is ridiculous.\n  So while it sounds good and while it may be well-intentioned--and I \ndo not question the motivation for a minute--two things strike me.\n  No. 1, it has not been carried out in a businesslike, prudent manner. \nNo. 2, we have the constitutional obligation that we cannot and should \nnot delegate to the administration as it relates to the expenditure of \nthese sums.\n  The legalistics that have been turned around to give us this so-\ncalled jurisdiction and the opinions that came from the Assistant \nAttorney General of the Justice Department and the counsel of the \nTreasury are mind-boggling: You would really have to say that this is \nnot a foreign aid package. Of course, it is a foreign aid package; you \nwould really have to say that this loan is so collateralized that there \nis no chance that it will fail. Nobody can tell you that, even the \nadministration. They say, ``Well, we don't think it will.'' And that \nitself flies in the face of the underlying legal opinion that says you \ncan do this.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will withdraw. I will undertake myself \nto solicit the views of Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. They have been supportive of this, as I have indicated \nto you, in terms of this program, in terms of calling it essential, and \nI disagree respectfully.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  Mr. President, I associate myself with many of the concerns of the \nSenator from New York, and I will address this, as will others, in a \nvery responsible way when it is brought up. But I think it is important \nthat we do solicit the current views, the current thinking of the \nchairman of the Federal Reserve and I will undertake to do so.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Let me conclude, and I know my colleague has been \npatient--he wants to ask a question or make a statement--and I am going \nto sit down or be available to answer his question.\n  Let me conclude by saying this. I am very willing to withdraw this \namendment, if we can agree to a time certain so that we can have a full \ndebate. And if we want more than 5 hours or 10 hours or 15 or 20 hours \nor 24 hours, I have no problem with that. But I think it is fair and I \nthink it is our responsibility to the American people that we have a \ntime certain for a vote, otherwise I can assure my colleagues that \nthere will be a piece of legislation that will be moving through the \nadministration will want. If I am placed in the position that this is \nthe only way that I can get a vote, that the American people who are my \nconstituents from Rochester and Syracuse and Buffalo and Long Island, \nthe people who I represent, the people who say they are opposed to \nthis, there will be another time.\n  Now, I am willing to set up a time. I am willing to withdraw, because \nit is fact of life. We have to get this important business through. Let \nus set it aside for Monday. Let us set it aside for Tuesday. Let us \npick out an appropriate length of time and come to a vote. I have no \nillusions. My colleagues who are concerned do not want to be blamed for \nthe collapse. I understand that. And I say Mexico has collapsed \nalready. You will have an opportunity to vote for or against my bill. I \nwill do that. There are a number of Senators who have said it is \ninappropriate to bring it up here. Fine. I will be willing--and I leave \nthis to my colleagues on the other side--to work out a time when we can \nbring it up and have a vote, and I will not say anything more on that. \nI thank my colleagues for giving me the courtesy of this response.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator from Arizona yield to me for just 30 \nseconds?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator from New York asserted only a few moments \nago in the debate that the Mexicans have been printing money throughout \nthis period. That, in fact, is not the case. They have upheld a tight \nmoney policy.\n  Through March 15, the nominal money supply has shrunk by 13 percent \nsince the beginning of the year and the real money supply has shrunk by \n23 percent.\n  Now, we may differ over the policy, but at least let us get the right \nfacts out before us. To stand here and assert that they have been \nfollowing a very loose policy in printing money does not square with \nwhat the reality is. The reality is that the money supply, since the \nbeginning of the year until the 15th of March, in Mexico has shrunk--\nshrunk--by 13 percent.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank the Senator \nfrom New York for his commitment on this issue and his willingness to \nagree to a vote. I do not have any role in those negotiations.\n  But I am deeply concerned about this amendment, its impact on \nAmerican foreign policy and, very frankly, this amendment in its \nrelation to the Constitution of the United States and the inherent \npowers of the Chief Executive.\n  I have always supported the foreign policy prerogatives of the \nPresident of the United States. Frankly, I think that is what this \ndebate should be about.\n  I would refer my colleagues back to the language of the amendment, \nwhich says:\n\n       Except as authorized by an act of Congress, the Secretary \n     may not take any action under this subsection with respect to \n     a single foreign government, including agencies or other \n     entities of that government, or with respect to the current \n     of a single foreign currency that would result in \n     expenditures and obligations, including contingent \n     obligations, aggregating more than $5 billion with respect to \n     that foreign country during any 12-month period.\n\n  What we are saying, Mr. President, is that the authority of the \nPresident of the United States is substantially circumscribed by this \namendment.\n  I point out that the President's action was not taken without \nconsultation with the leaders of Congress. I think that the President \nof the United States, very appropriately, consulted with the leaders of \nCongress. In fact, on January 31, 1995, there was a statement issued by \nPresident Clinton, Speaker Gingrich, Minority Leader Gephardt, Majority \nLeader Dole, and Minority Leader Daschle. I will not quote from the \nwhole statement, Mr. President, but I think it is important to remember \nthat this was what our elected leaders here in Congress said on that \nday.\n\n       We agree that, in order to ensure orderly exchange \n     arrangements in a stable system of exchange rates, the United \n     States should immediately use the Exchange Stabilization Fund \n     to provide appropriate financial assistance for Mexico.\n\n  And they go on in the final paragraph to say:\n\n       [[Page S4888]] This is an important undertaking, and we \n     believe that the risks of inaction vastly exceed any risks \n     associated with this action. We fully support this effort, \n     and we will work to ensure that its purposes are met.\n\n  Mr. President, it is my view that that is the way the relationship \nbetween the executive and legislative branches should function on \nissues such as these.\n  I think it is also important to remember a little background before \nthis agreement was reached on January 31. The reality is that for a \nperiod of approximately 3 weeks, if I remember correctly, before this \nagreement was reached, there was no agreement, there was no agreement \nbetween the Congress of the United States and the executive branch.\n  The leaders of the Congress came out of a meeting at the White House \nand said we must act, we must act together, we must act on a package. \nThat was their view at the time.\n  Now, there were many of us, including Senators who are on this floor \nright now, that had deep concern about what fundamental changes Mexico \nwould make in the way that they conduct their financial affairs. And \nthere were deep concerns as to whether the fundamental reforms in their \nmonetary system were being taken. But there was no doubt about the \nurgency of this problem in the minds of the majority of Congress. \nMeeting after meeting was held to find a solution.\n  Now, with all due respect to all of my colleagues who participated in \nthis effort, many of our colleagues wanted to condition loan guarantees \non Mexican relations with Cuba, on labor rights, on domestic reforms, \non environmental cleanup, on demands that Mexico essentially militarize \nour borders. It became almost a vehicle for every pet cause or every \npet peeve that any Member of Congress had about our relationship with \nMexico.\n  We have had many differences with Mexico at least during this \ncentury. We have certainly had a rocky relationship, certainly from \ntheir view point; some of them feel very strongly that the State in \nwhich I reside should be part of their country.\n  But the fact is that there was an inability on the part of the \nCongress of the United States and the executive branch to agree. But, \nmore importantly than that, there was an inability for Congress to \nagree amongst themselves. Congress could not agree on a package with \nwhich to attempt to agree with the executive branch.\n  Finally, either rightly or wrongly, history will show, history will \nshow whether it was a correct action on the part of the President of \nthe United States or not, with the agreement of the leaders of \nCongress, to take the following action which called for an immediate \nuse of the Exchange Stabilization Fund to provide appropriate financial \nassistance for Mexico.\n  Mr. President, I have deep and sincere concerns about the Mexican \neconomy. It is declining. We started a slide to 7 pesos to the dollar, \ninstead of 3.5 pesos to the dollar.\n  The economy in my State is devastated along the border. Literally, \ntowns are shutting down; not just businesses, but towns are shutting \ndown. There is no tourism up from Mexico. The normal shopper that comes \nup from Mexico is not there. The Safeway in Nogales has shut down. It \nhad been in operation through all of the downturns and all of the \nproblems we have had in the past 30 years in our relations with Mexico. \nAnd it is going to be many, many years before that economy is restored.\n  I do not know what is going to happen in the Mexican economy, Mr. \nPresident. I do not know if this $20 billion is going to disappear like \nthat. I do not know. And the experts are divided dramatically on this \nissue as to what the viability of the Mexican economy is.\n  But that is not the question here, Mr. President. The question here \nis, are we going to circumscribe the authority of the President of the \nUnited States, especially in light of the fact that the Congress was \nunable to come to agreement, the President and the Congress were unable \nto make an agreement?\n  And so the President, with the total endorsement of the leaders of \nCongress, made a decision. Now, I say again, history will show whether \nthat decision was right or wrong. Obviously, it will be related to the \nsuccess or failure of the Mexican economy, which I cannot predict.\n  But I know this. If this legislation is passed, I know this right \nnow, if this legislation is passed, first, there is a serious \nconstitutional problem that I have already described, in my view. And \nit would send a signal, in my view, that if the leaders of the Congress \nand the President of the United States make an agreement, then at some \nlater date the Congress can come back, and say, ``Sorry, we didn't like \nthat agreement. We're going to have to take the following action.'' I \nam not sure that is a very good precedent to set.\n  But, also, Mr. President, I think we should look at the immediate \neffect of passage of this amendment on the Mexican economy that all of \nus, no matter where we stand on this issue, want to save. We want the \nMexican economy to survive. And I repeat for probably the fifth time, I \ndo not know whether it will or not.\n  But I know what this amendment would do. It would doom the Mexican \neconomy to failure. Because I do not believe that any degree of \nconfidence would be maintained in the Mexican economy, Mexican market, \nand the Mexican currency if this amendment were passed, because we know \nfull well what the effect would be if a review of each $5 billion in \nthis $20 billion were passed.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would also like to point out--and I do not like \nto embarrass anyone, including myself. But on the day that the \nPresident of the United States and Speaker of the House and the \nminority leader, and the majority leader and the minority leader here \nmade this announcement on January 31, I did not hear a single Member of \nCongress stand up and say, ``No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. You have \nto get the approval of Congress.''\n  In fact, the silence was deafening. The silence was deafening because \nwe could not come to an agreement in the Congress, as I mentioned, for \na whole variety of reasons.\n  So I say, with all due respect to the author of the amendment, where \nwere we the day that this agreement was announced? Where were we then? \nAre we now finding that our expectations or our hopes for the \nperformance of the Mexican economy was such that we now feel that it is \nnecessary to require additional involvement on the part of Congress on \nthis issue?\n  I say again, if this amendment had been proposed on January 31 rather \nthan today, I think that it might have had a significant degree more \nresonance.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Will my colleague yield for an observation?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, but first I observe that my colleague would not \nyield to me when I asked him to yield, but I will be glad to yield to \nhim.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank my friend and colleague. Just so that we \nunderstand, and I know every utterance that we make we like sometimes \nfor people to pick up--usually they pick up the ones we do not want \nthem to pick up--but on the 31st, I did have a hearing. And at that \nhearing, I indicated my very strong concern about this. I indicated \nthat I did not think we were doing the right thing. I indicated that I \nwould withhold saying anything further until we can get more facts, in \nterms of the implementation. That was on the 31st.\n  On the 8th, I came out about 8, 9 days thereafter raising very strong \npositions and concerns in regard to the manner in which we were moving \nforward. I just share that with my friend and colleague because this \nSenator did not want to be an obstructionist, yet I was not afraid to \nexpress my concerns. I just share that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me say to my friend from New York, I expressed my \nconcerns, too. I still have grave concerns. I still am worried whether \nthe nation of Mexico has implemented the fundamental reforms in their \nmonetary system, in fact, in their political system, that would lead to \nthe kind of confidence that would allow that economy to be restored \nbefore it sinks even further into a terrible, terrible depression \nwhich, obviously, has afflicted the poor people in Mexico in a most \nhorrible way.\n  But I also suggest to my friend from New York that many people \nexpressed those reservations. No one that I know of during the \nintervening time, nearly 2 months, brought forth an amendment like this \nfor consideration on the floor \n[[Page S4889]] when we had many pieces of legislation under \nconsideration to which this amendment would have been equally as \nrelevant.\n  I want to say again, I appreciate very much the involvement of the \nSenator from New York in this issue, the fact that he has both the \nauthority and the commitment to hold hearings and for us to ventilate \nthis entire issue. I do not underestimate, in any way, his dire concern \nand warning about what is at stake. But I question, as I said, the \nvehicle and the language which is in the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to take much longer. I will just suggest \nthat there is a great deal at stake on this issue. I urge my colleague \nfrom New York to continue the hearings that he has scheduled to seek \nthe information that sometimes has not been readily forthcoming to him \nabout the process that was utilized in coming forth with the decisions \nthat were made about Mexico.\n  But at the same time, I suggest that if this amendment is adopted by \nboth Houses of the Congress, it would have constitutional problems, \nwhich is sort of an academic argument. But I also think that it would \nprobably doom the Mexican economy to a very, very difficult period, \nwhich sooner or later has effects on this country in the form of lack \nof trade, increase in illegal immigration, et cetera, et cetera.\n  Try as we might, we cannot sever Mexico from the United States. It is \ngeographically impossible. And I have never believed that we could \nbuild sufficient walls to separate our two countries, not to mention \nthe kind of fundamental Judeo-Christian principle that is involved here \nabout helping neighbors who are very much less fortunate than we.\n  I do not mean to wax sentimental here, but when I see little children \ncrawling through a tunnel that is filled with sewage in order to get \ninto Nogales, AZ, where they are forced to engage in theft in order to \neke out a meager existence--and I see that increasing exponentially--I \nam deeply concerned about the future of our neighbors. I do not pretend \nto know that this is the right solution, but I do believe that if we \nadopt this amendment, we might see a lot more of that for a very long \nperiod of time.\n  Again, I want to thank my friend from New York for his commitment and \ninterest in this issue. I also want to thank my friend from Connecticut \nfor his deep knowledge and involvement in these affairs for many years.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority manager is recognized.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut, without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the ranking manager of \nthe underlying bill.\n  I want to commend my colleague from Arizona. We have dealt with these \nissues in the Western Hemisphere for many years together. He is very \ncomplimentary, and I appreciate it. But there are very few people who \nare as knowledgeable about Mexico as is my colleague from Arizona.\n  I think he has appropriately and properly identified the concerns \nincorporated in the amendment of the Senator from New York. All of us \nhave had concerns about this. If it were without concern, I suspect it \nwould have gone through under a unanimous-consent request in the House \nand Senate back in January.\n  Anytime there is a potential exposure, there are some issues that \nneed to be raised. No one is questioning that. The President certainly \noutlined that when he made the decision to go with the Exchange \nStabilization Fund. But the Senator from Arizona has very properly \npointed out the implications if we do not try to make a difference, not \nonly in Mexico but ourselves as well in this country, given the \nimplications of the border and elsewhere.\n  Others may have already printed this in the Record. There is a letter \nthat has been distributed, addressed to the distinguished chairman of \nthe Banking Committee dated today, signed by Robert Rubin, the \nSecretary of the Treasury. I will print the entire letter in the \nRecord, but there is one paragraph that if it has not been quoted \nalready needs to be quoted. In the letter, the Secretary of the \nTreasury says to the chairman:\n\n       I am deeply concerned that the actions you are taking will \n     have the potential to undermine market confidence in \n     international support for Mexico and thereby reduce the \n     likelihood of success. By limiting the American response to \n     the Mexican crisis, your amendment could threaten the \n     credibility of the stabilization program and undermine the \n     confidence Mexico is trying to restore among investors. These \n     consequences could, in turn, have a negative impact on jobs, \n     wages and prospects of American workers here at home.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will read this letter. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 30, 1995.\n     Hon. Alfonse D'Amato,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express my very serious \n     concerns regarding your current efforts to amend H.R. 1158 to \n     require Congressional approval of aggregate annual assistance \n     to any foreign entity using the Exchange Stabilization Fund \n     (ESF) in an amount that exceeds $5 billion. Your amendment \n     would have the immediate practical effect of curtailing any \n     further use of the ESF consistent with the Administration's \n     package of financial support for Mexico. I would strongly \n     urge that you reconsider your decision to proceed on this \n     course.\n       I am deeply concerned that the actions you are taking will \n     have the potential to undermine market confidence in \n     international support for Mexico and thereby reduce the \n     likelihood of success. By limiting the American response to \n     the Mexican crisis, your amendment could threaten the \n     credibility of the stabilization program and undermine the \n     confidence Mexico is trying to restore among investors. These \n     consequences could, in turn, have a negative impact on jobs, \n     wages and prospects of American workers here at home.\n       The Mexican government has taken courageous action in \n     directly confronting its financial imbalances and \n     implementing a disciplined economic recovery program. Seeking \n     to attract foreign capital, strengthen the peso and minimize \n     inflation, Mexico has adopted strong remedial policies \n     including fiscal measures that will result in a budget \n     surplus in 1995 reductions in government spending, strict \n     monetary policy, accelerated structural reforms and important \n     enhancements to the transparency of its economic \n     institutions.\n       Let me emphasize, however, that the process of restoring \n     market confidence is an arduous one and we need to \n     incorporate this fact into our thinking as we look for signs \n     of progress in Mexico. As such, the success of this effort \n     cannot be judged from day-to-day market movements. This \n     stabilization package that Mexico has adopted is a strong one \n     and seems to be starting to have the desired effect.\n       The Mexican government has upheld tight money policy and we \n     are seeing results--through March 15, the nominal money \n     supply has shrunk by 13% since the beginning of the year and \n     the real money supply has shrunk by 23%. The Bolsa in Mexico \n     City is up 15% since last week, representing a 21% gain in \n     dollar terms. Prices on par Brady bonds has risen by 11% from \n     their recent low on March 16.\n       Signs of declining volatility in peso trading have emerged, \n     with the peso closing below NP 7 since March 23 and now \n     trading within a narrower range. Demand for government \n     securities rose in this week's primary auctions to 2.4 times \n     the amount offered.\n       To reiterate, for its recovery program to succeed over the \n     long term, Mexico is relying upon the U.S. commitment to the \n     agreement signed on February 21. It appears that negative \n     sentiment may be bottoming out and if Mexico holds the \n     course, confidence should return. Any indication that the \n     commitment of the U.S. to those agreements is weakening could \n     threaten to jeopardize the best possible outcome in Mexico.\n       There is an additional concern regarding this amendment \n     which relates more generally to U.S. diplomacy. On January \n     31, President Clinton and four Congressional leaders from \n     both parties declared in a joint statement their support of \n     the U.S. financial package for Mexico and recognized that the \n     President has full authority to use the Exchange \n     Stabilization fund (ESF) to that end. This became U.S. \n     policy, and the executive branch negotiated appropriately \n     with foreign governments to implement that policy.\n       Now the Senate is considering a measure that could impede \n     that policy. Your amendment would effectively end the ability \n     of the United States to carry out the February 21 agreements \n     and thereby impair the confidence that other nations have in \n     the ability of the executive branch to negotiate agreements \n     with them.\n       I hope that we can continue to move forward in the spirit \n     of bi-partisan cooperation, \n     [[Page S4890]] and not invite confrontation by consideration \n     or passage of legislation that could ultimately disable the \n     implementation of American support for Mexico.\n       In closing, let me assure you that the Treasury has been \n     complying with all Congressional requests for documents. I am \n     using my full authority to ensure that the Treasury continues \n     to supply timely, appropriate information to the Congress. I \n     look forward to continuing my work with you and your \n     colleagues in our shared commitment to support Mexico's \n     recovery and thus to protect American jobs and interests.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert E. Rubin,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, last, I want to address an issue I heard \nraised repeatedly all afternoon. It has to do with the so-called \ncorruption in Mexico.\n  President Zedillo and his administration, but for the fact that they \nhave conducted significant investigations, we would not know what we \nknow already. I think it is unfair to this new administration which was \nsaddled with a lot of problems not of their own choosing that is making \nvery difficult decisions, asking his constituency to make very \ndifficult decisions in order to get out of this crisis and, in fact, \nhave pointed to a lot of the problems that existed in the past is an \noverstatement, to put it mildly.\n  Second, again, there have been a lot of criticisms raised about \nPresident Salinas. I got to know President Salinas fairly well during \nhis tenure in office. Obviously, the jury is still out on some other \nmatters unrelated to him personally, but I want to say that had he not \ntaken the steps beginning 5 or 6 years ago to inject strong market \neconomy principles and to deal with those issues, we would not be in \nthe position at least of offering real opportunity for Mexico in these \ncoming years. And so while it has become popular to indict President \nSalinas in many quarters, I happen to feel he did a great deal of good. \nI also believe that his successor is doing even better in many ways. I \nwould like to see us give him that opportunity to succeed.\n  What we are doing here is in our interest. It makes sense to be \nsupportive of it. It is not just a largess. These programs, through the \neconomic exchange stabilization fund, have been very successful. In \nyears past, Mr. President, I will submit for the Record a series of \ncountries to whom we have provided assistance under the ESF Program. \nSix times Mexico has been the recipient of ESF funds. On all occasions \nthey have paid the money back. There have been suggestions on the floor \ntoday that we are never going to get the money back. In almost every \ninstance, the money has been returned as a result of this program.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                  TABLE 1.--EXCHANGE STABILIZATION FUND FINANCING AGREEMENTS, 1980 TO JUNE 1994

I know my colleague from Oregon would like to engage in a \nunanimous-consent request to consider another amendment. I am prepared \nto yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Rather than to ask for just a half-hour, I would like \nto expand that to an hour to take care of two amendments, one on the \nDemocratic side and one on the Republican side, Mr. Kyl's amendment, \neach for a half-hour equally divided.\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to accommodate. If there are going to be \nrecorded votes, can they be done en bloc?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. It will be two one-half hours making 1 hour.\n  Mr. DODD. I am told that my colleague from California would like to \nbe included for a half-hour on an amendment. So that would make it an \nhour and a half. Can we provide that at the conclusion of the \nconsideration of the amendment offered by the Senator from California \nthat we would vote on all three amendments, so our colleagues might \nhave a window, if that is appropriate?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I know the Senator from California has a number of \nthem. What amendment would this be?\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator from California only has one amendment--the \ntransfer amendment. That is the only amendment I have. I am happy to \nagree to 30 minutes equally divided.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/30/senate-section/article/S4883-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4890-S4906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD.

Mr. President, this is a very straightforward amendment. \nI offered it in the full committee. It has been altered somewhat to add \nadditional items. For my colleagues, what I am doing with this \namendment is to rescind an additional $324.579 million from the \ncourthouse projects.\n  Mr. President, I offered this amendment on behalf of myself and the \nSenator from Maine [Mr. Cohen], who has also been very actively \ninvolved for the past several years in trying to get the GSA to do some \nreviews of the courthouses that have been both authorized and \nappropriated.\n  The GSA did what they call a ``time-out'' review and came back with \n$1.3 billion worth of savings. We have taken some but not all. To be \nclear, the distinguished chairman of our subcommittee, the Senator from \nAlabama, Senator Shelby, points out quite accurately that we use the \nGSA's recommendations as a guideline. These are not hard and fast \nrecommendations. These are not things that we always watch. Indeed, we \nhave some things on our list in the rescission package that were not \nrecommended by GSA already.\n  Nonetheless, my colleagues who are considering this amendment really \nshould ask themselves one question, and that is: What happens if this \namendment passes? Will there be damage done to the Nation? Will there \nbe children that get less food? Is day care involved? Is education \ninvolved? Is national defense involved? I mean, the argument really has \nto center on what happens if this amendment passes.\n  Well, Mr. President, I am going to respectfully say that what happens \nis a number of projects are not going to be built. The list that I have \nincludes a Phoenix, AZ, courthouse, $128.890 million; Tucson, AZ, $70 \nmillion; Southeast Federal Center in the District of Columbia, $58 \nmillion; an additional $26.272 million in Hammond, IN; in Holtsville, \nNY, an IRS Service Center for $19.183 million; in Corpus Christi, TX, \n$6.446 million; in Santa Teresa, NM, a border station, $4.004 million; \nSeattle, WA, $3.764 million; and in the spirit of fairness, $5 million \nfrom an Omaha, NE, courthouse; a Secret Service headquarters in DC. for \n$10 million. The total, Mr. President, is $324.579 million.\n  Again, the simple question really has to be: What happens if this \namendment passes? What happens is that these projects are not going to \nbe built, or they will be scaled back.\n  Mr. President, I hardly think those of us who are trying to find ways \nto cut spending, those of us who recognize \n[[Page S4892]] that we have to take tough action to get deficit \nreduction done, to get to a balanced budget, are explaining to various \ninterest groups, educators, health care people, interest groups that \ncome constantly into our offices saying, ``Why, why, why,''\n  It seems to me that this is a relatively easy step for us to take and \na relatively painless step, I must say, Mr. President. There will be no \ninterest groups that will object. There will be no people that will \nsay, gee, this is going to hurt us in some measurable or appreciable \nfashion. These are merely projects, Mr. President. I appreciate that \nthey do have value. I am not arguing that they are without value. I \nmerely argue that in this time when we are trying, in an unprecedented \nfashion, to achieve a bipartisan consensus to reduce this Nation's \ndeficit to zero, this kind of action, this little list of additional \ncuts, is not only appropriate but quite reasonable.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the House rescinded $136,593,000 from \nbuildings for which funds have been appropriated in the fund.\n  A number of projects they included were inserted by the Senate, most, \nbut not all have been authorized by the Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, but not the House Public Works Committee.\n  The committee chose to rescind $241,011,000 from new construction and \nrepair and alterations projects.\n  Some of the projects the committee included have not been authorized \nby the Senate.\n  Some are included because GSA has indicated savings as a result of \nlast year's time out and review.\n  Some have been canceled or delayed. We did not take all of the funds \nin some cases, nor did we take all of the projects GSA indicated where \nsavings might be attained as a result of time out and review.\n  We attempted to take Members concerns into account in making our \ndecision.\n  Our total cuts are significantly over the House and there will plenty \nof room to negotiate in conference.\n  We might not agree, but this is a significant adjustment.\n  I say to the Senate do not make it a political bidding war regarding \nprojects.\n  I have tried to be fair in this process as the Senator from Nebraska \nis aware. Should we follow the Senator from Nebraska and his process, \nin all fairness, should we not put all projects on the table. I have a \nlist here which includes all of the new construction projects, repair \nand alteration projects, as well as, the time out and review savings \nthe GSA has indicated can be saved.\n  The project list is inclusive of projects where no construction has \nbegun.\n  I hope we will not get into this on the Senate floor.\n  I believe a majority of my colleagues agrees with me as they did in \nthe appropriations committee, so at the appropriate time I will move to \ntable the Kerrey amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Nebraska \nfor offering this amendment. I also ask unanimous consent that I be \nadded as a cosponsor.\n  The amendment before us will make additional rescissions to a number \nof projects proposed to be funded from GSA's Federal buildings fund. \nThese rescissions represent projects that have not gone through the GSA \nreview process, are congressional Member requests, or represent savings \nidentified through the GSA timeout and review process.\n  Many of these projects are courthouse construction projects. And to \nbe truthful, the savings identified in this amendment are probably only \nthe tip of the iceberg. In fact, last year, when I chaired the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, we made substantial reductions \nin the authorizations of GSA projects. We cut $137 million from these \nprojects. Unfortunately, there are some people who believe that this \nmoney is still available. I disagree with that view. But to make \ncertain that the money cannot be spent we need this amendment. The \nKerrey amendment will formally rescind that money.\n  Mr. President, we have to get a handle on the courthouse construction \nprogram. I have talked to Federal judges in Montana about the need for \nrestraint in building new courthouses. They agree that things have \ngotten out of control. The current process is a failure. There is far \ntoo much waste in this program. There is no prioritization of \ncourthouse projects. In fact, the courts refuse to prioritize their \nprojects. So we must prioritize. We must make the tough decisions. The \namendment from the Senator from Nebraska makes such decisions.\n  I would also note that the bill before us makes drastic cuts in \nimportant programs, such as child nutrition and education. So it makes \nsense that we also look at the federal courthouse construction program. \nWe need to target projects that are unnecessary or lavish, or can be \ndelayed. This amendment will do just that and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Alabama \nquite correctly said that he has tried to be fair. He has been fair. We \nare with our subcommittee offering cuts in excess of what the House of \nRepresentatives had in their piece of legislation.\n  Again, for those Members who try to figure out how to vote on this \namendment, the question really still fails to answer what happens if \nthis amendment passes. All that happens, Mr. President, is some \nprojects that are proposed to be built will not be built, or they will \nbe scaled back.\n  I have had--as I am sure all have had to do--to justify spending in a \nvariety of ways. One of the tests that I used with various groups and \nindividuals who come forward and ask me to support one expenditure or \nanother, is to try to calculate what a median family income pays in the \nway of tax.\n  In my State, a median family income is about $35,000 a year. They \nhave to work about 3 months to pay the Federal income taxes of roughly \n$7,500. That means that 43,740 Nebraska families have to work 3 months \nto generate the money I am requesting to take out.\n  I do not offer that observation in some sort of grand fashion. I \nmerely say this is a lot of money. I do not believe the Nation is going \nto suffer.\n  Indeed, I say the Nation will not suffer at all with this additional \nrescission. I hope that my colleagues, rather than being concerned \nabout whether or not a project in their home State is going to be cut, \nI hope that they will, in fact, vote based upon the observation that \nthis Nation can afford to lay these projects aside.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I will agree to yielding back my time. I believe we will \nvote later on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I request the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n                 amendment no. 436 to amendment no. 420\n\n (Purpose: To delete the rescission of the funds appropriated for the \n    Department of Education for the Technology For Education of All \n Students Program in the amount of $5,000,000 and for the Star Schools \nProgram in the amount of $5,000,000; and to rescind $11,000,000 of the \n  funds available under the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, \n            1995, for acquisition of two executive aircraft)\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 436 to amendment No. 420.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent further reading be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 35, beginning on line 21, strike out \n     ``$15,200,000'' and all that follows through ``title III-B, \n     $5,000,000, and'', and inserting in lieu thereof ``$5,200,000 \n     are rescinded as follows: from the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965,''\n       On page 68, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n                       [[Page S4893]] CHAPTER XII\n\n              DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE--MILITARY PROCUREMENT\n\n\n                       aircraft procurement, army\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the funds available under this heading in title III of \n     Public Law 103-335, $11,000,000 are rescinded.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I were to give you $11 million to spend \nin a way to benefit the public interest, I think that you would give it \na lot of thought, and I would hope one of the areas that would be \nconsidered would be education.\n  Particularly if I said the choice is between spending that money to \nput computers in the classrooms across the country, to give 5,000 \nstudents high-technology education, I think everyone would be \ninterested, particularly if I said the only sacrifice that would have \nto be made is not to spend $11 million for executive airplanes designed \nprimarily to transport high-ranking military officials from place to \nplace. Aircraft that the military never even asked for.\n  That is the transfer amendment that I have. We are talking about pork \nversus pupils here.\n  I think that most people who had that choice would come down on the \nside of the children. That is the choice I have given to my colleagues. \nI hope that this amendment will be accepted and that we will not have a \nfight over it because I really think for anyone who listens to these \narguments, it is clear that these airplanes are not needed and are not \nwarranted. This money can be put to much better use.\n  I also want to point out this chart that I have that shows where we \nare. It shows that the rescission bills considered by the Senate have \nslashed domestic spending, and only nicked military spending.\n  We see here that, of the discretionary budget, military makes up 49 \npercent; international, or foreign aid, 4 percent; and domestic \nspending, 47 percent.\n  And look at this chart, which shows what we have cut in these \nrescissions bills. We have slashed domestic spending; 84 percent of all \nthe rescissions have come from domestic spending. The military took a \nhit of 14 percent. And international took 2 percent.\n  My amendment is not going to cure all of that. It is just a small, \nlittle, symbolic amendment, but I think it is very, very important.\n  What my amendment does is restore the rescissions from the Star \nSchools Program and the Education Technology Program--$5 million each. \nAgain, it would cut out those two aircraft--not requested by the \nmilitary, I underscore--but approved by the Congress as an unrequested \nadd-on last year.\n  I think it is important to note that if you go around to the schools \nin your States you will find in many of the classrooms a reliance on \nchalk and the blackboard. Of course we will always have that. But we \nneed to see more computers in those classrooms. We need to get those \nyoung people ready for the 21st century.\n  The ratio of students to computers in the classroom is about 13 to 1. \nAlmost two-thirds of the Nation's public schools do not have access to \nthe internet.\n  We here know. I am beginning to get a tremendous amount of \ninformation through the Internet. It is very exciting. I can have a \ndialog with my constituency. l\n  It seems to me that anyone would agree that technology is the way of \nthe future. Our children deserve those computers in the classroom. We \nhave a chance to restore that money today. Instead of propelling our \nschools into the 21st century, what we do in this rescissions bill is \nsteer them off the information superhighway. My amendment would \ncompletely restore funding for these important programs, and it does it \nin a very painless way.\n  I am going to talk a little more about the success of these two \nprograms, but before I do, I really want to talk about the aircraft in \nquestion which, again I repeat, were not requested for purchase by the \nPentagon. What do the aircraft do? According to the House \nAppropriations Committee report the purpose of these aircraft is to \n``provide efficient transportation of key command and staff \npersonnel.''\n  I want to point out that in today's Washington Post, on the Federal \npage, is an article about what a mess the military transport situation \nis in. Thankfully, Senator Cohen is on top of the situation. We can \nsave a lot of money in military transportation. We do not need to spend \nthis money on these two aircraft. The Army can do without private \nplanes for the top brass. These aircraft are not essential to any \nmilitary mission.\n  But computers are essential for the educational mission that we \nshould be supporting. Again, Washington Post, Tuesday:\n\n       Congress Protects Pork in Pentagon Spending. Budget Cutters \n     Spare '95 Defense Plan.\n\n  These aircraft are specifically listed in this article as an example \nof defense pork.\n  I ask unanimous consent the entire article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nCongress Protects Pork in Pentagon Spending--Budget Cutters Spare 1995 \n                              Defense Plan\n\n                   (By Walter Pincus and Dan Morgan)\n\n       Before Congress adjourned last year it passed a $243 \n     billion defense appropriations bill containing dozens of \n     ``pork barrel'' projects for members' home states, as well as \n     numerous non-defense programs that could not get funded in \n     other spending bills.\n       Among them were $5.4 million for Hawaii's Small Business \n     Development Center; $3.5 million for a Cook County, Ill., \n     military-style boot camp for youthful drug offenders; $10 \n     million for a National Guard outreach program to help Los \n     Angeles youth; and $1.5 million to round up wild horses \n     wandering onto the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico--a \n     job once handled by the Bureau of Land Management.\n       There was $15 million for developing an electric car, a \n     project that found a home in the defense bill in the late \n     1980s when money for energy appropriations grew tight.\n       Now Congress, in its first round of serious budget cutting, \n     is slashing billions of dollars of previously approved \n     spending, for purposes ranging from public broadcasting to \n     housing AIDS patients.\n       But the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill has left \n     untouched the projects listed above. The spending is part of \n     billions of dollars never sought by the Pentagon, but added \n     to the defense bill last fall at the behest of senators and \n     representatives from both parties.\n       ``The insertion of these items has become an incredible art \n     form,'' said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a member of the \n     Senate Armed Services Committee. He has compiled a list of \n     more than $6 billion in defense projects that he says \n     represent ``wasteful, earmarked, non-defense, or otherwise \n     low-priority programs.''\n       Despite the GOP's seizure of control of Congress in the \n     1994 midterm elections, McCain said, refusal to cut these \n     programs suggests ``business as usual'' is continuing in \n     Congress.\n       Republican leaders have given defense a comparatively \n     protected position as they go about the initial round of \n     budget cutting. A House-passed bill cuts $17.1 billion from \n     domestic programs, but nothing from the 1995 defense budget. \n     A toned-down Senate version, which trims $13.3 billion, also \n     exempts defense.\n       In separate, supplemental legislation, the House and Senate \n     did propose defense cuts of $1.4 billon and $1.9 billion, \n     respectively, in allocating emergency funds to replenish \n     Pentagon coffers. The House cut $502 million from the \n     administration's technology reinvestment program, which helps \n     defense companies convert to civilian production.\n       But almost all of the projects added by members last fall \n     to the 1995 defense budget have so far survived. A House-\n     Senate conference on the recisions bill, scheduled to begin \n     Wednesday, will be the last chance to kill these ``add-ons'' \n     for fiscal 1995.\n       Hawaii, the home state of Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D), then \n     chairman of the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee, \n     got more than the Small Business Center among the earmarked \n     projects. There was $56.4 million earmarked for the Pacific \n     Missile Range; $13 million for a high-performance computer \n     facility on Maui; $10 million to home port two transport \n     vessels in Pearl Harbor; and additional funds for Hawaii-\n     based military medical facilities.\n       A House-Senate report specifically stipulated that the Maui \n     facility be exempted from reductions that were being applied \n     to other such computer facilities.\n       The $3.5 million for a drug offender's boot camp in Cook \n     County originated with a request by the sheriff to then-House \n     Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), \n     according to a congressional source.\n       Rostenkowski arranged for language to be inserted in the \n     defense bill while it was before House-Senate conferees--\n     after the measure had already been before the House and \n     Senate for a vote.\n       The conferees directed ``that the Department of Defense \n     provide assistance to the county sheriff's office in the \n     planning of a military-style regime and curriculum at the \n     facility.''\n       In a similar, if more traditional vein, then-Senate \n     Minority Leader Robert J. Dole (R- \n     [[Page S4894]] Kan.) arranged to earmark $11 million in the \n     same defense bill for the Army to purchase additional \n     executive jet aircraft from a Kansas corporation that \n     produces Lear jets.\n       ``It's like a disease,'' said McCain. ``It's never static. \n     It gets worse or you kill it.''\n       McCain complained during a Senate floor debate March 16 \n     that the current round of budget cuts ``does not rescind \n     Defense Department support [$15.4 million] for the Olympics \n     and other sporting events * * * does not touch congressional \n     add-ons for excess [National] Guard and Reserve equipment, \n     and does not rescind any of the nearly $1 billion in \n     congressionally added military construction projects, much \n     less funding for projects on bases slated for closure.''\n       As budget rules have clamped ceilings on small, non-defense \n     appropriations bills, the annual defense appropriation bill \n     increasingly has been viewed as a bank of last resort for \n     programs and projects once handled in those smaller measures.\n       For example, the Bureau of Land Management used to handle \n     the roundup of wild horses on the White Sands proving \n     grounds. The animals would be turned over to New Mexico \n     prisoners to be broken and sold. BLM discontinued the program \n     last year because it was too expensive, according to a \n     spokesman for Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.).\n       Domenici, who chairs the Senate Budget Committee, and New \n     Mexico Rep. Joe Skeen (R), a member of the House \n     Appropriations Committee, collabroated to get the $1.5 \n     million put into last year's defense bill to pick up the \n     slack, the spokesman said.\n       Domenici arranged to have $20 million added to the same \n     defense bill for an additional neutron accelerator project at \n     the Los Alamos Laboratory in his state, after money \n     appropriated in the energy spending bill ran out last year.\n       ``There was no other place to go,'' said a congressional \n     aide.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last year I received a letter as did all \nof my colleagues, from two senior members of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator McCain and Senator Warner. In that letter these \ndistinguished Senators eloquently argued for a strong national defense \nand offered an action program for congressional action this year.\n  Predictably, I agreed with some of their arguments and disagreed with \nothers. But one of their arguments struck me as particularly poignant. \nLet me read from their letter. They wrote that Congress must:\n\n       . . . attack pork and wasteful programs. We need to \n     eliminate wasteful pork-barrel spending. This effort should \n     include legislative action to terminate the following \n     programs.\n\n  Among the programs listed are these executive transport aircraft. \nThese two Senators, my Republican friends, Senator Warner and Senator \nMcCain wrote:\n\n       Fiscal year 1995 savings of $11 million, rescind fiscal \n     year 1995 appropriation for executive jets.\n\n  If that is not enough, let me read the words of Gen. Colin Powell, \nthe highly respected former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. In his 1993 \nreport on the roles and missions of the Armed Forces, General Powell \nwrote:\n\n       The current inventory of operational aircraft built to \n     support a global war exceeds what is required for our \n     regionally oriented strategy. The current excess is \n     compounded by the fact that Congress continues to require the \n     services to purchase OSA aircraft, neither requested nor \n     needed.\n\n  General Powell concludes his report with this recommendation:\n\n       OSA aircraft are in excess of wartime needs and should be \n     reduced.\n\n  Yet, despite General Powell's recommendation, Congress voted to \nacquire two more of these aircraft. Our country does not need these \nplanes. Colin Powell says we do not need these planes. Senator Warner \nsays we do not need these plans. Senator McCain says we do not need \nthese planes.\n  We see articles where the transportation in the military is costing \ntoo much money. Yet we are taking away computers from the classroom, we \nare stopping the Star Schools Program. I cannot imagine why we would \nwant to do this.\n  I want to tell my colleagues in my time remaining about the Star \nSchools Program and the computers in the classroom. Since the Star \nSchools program began in 1988, more than 200,000 students and 30,000 \nteachers have participated in projects in 48 States. The projects are \ndesigned to improve classroom instruction through distance education \ntechnologies. The $5 million rescission proposed in this bill would \neliminate these high-technology education services from 5,000 students. \nAnd why? So that we can fly military top brass in brand new executive \njets? I hope not.\n  In my own State of California, the Los Angeles County Office of \nEducation has provided live interactive math and science instruction \nvia satellite to students in grades 4 through 7. This course is beamed \ninto 766 classrooms in large school districts throughout the State of \nCalifornia and in 18 other States. It reaches an amazing 125,000 \nstudents.\n  Why do we want to hurt this program? We do not have to. Cut the \nplanes for the military brass. They can find another way to travel and \nwe can save this program. We can save computers in the classroom. Did \nyou ever go into these classrooms where the kids have these computers? \nThey are so interested in school, suddenly. I urge my colleagues to do \nthat. Yet we are cutting computers out of the classroom, and we can \nrestore those funds.\n  In closing let me say this. This is a transfer amendment I hope \neveryone in the Senate will support. We are simply cutting two military \naircraft to provide for luxury travel for the top military brass in \nexchange for putting computers into the schools and funding the Star \nSchools Program. I hope the chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nand I can work this out. I hope we can be together on this.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, time \nto be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add as \ncosponsors to my amendment Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kerrey of Nebraska, Mr. \nWellstone, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Bumpers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I do not want to get into a long \ndissertation about a detailed problem of procedure. Once you start \nhaving to explain the process of procedure, you have one hand tied \nbehind you. But I want to say to the Senator from California that what \nshe is attempting to do certainly represents her perspective, her point \nof view and, I think, her priorities. I am not going to argue that \npoint because we probably have a set of priorities.\n  But let me tell you where we are at this moment in this, the defense \nsupplemental, that has just been passed by the House and the Senate, \nwhich we were hoping to have resolved as of today.\n  We are running into difficulties on this because we are insisting on \nthe Senate side, where we came to the floor with a supplemental and we \nhad every dollar of that supplemental increase for the defense offset \nso as not to create any additional deficit from the military accounts, \nfrom the defense accounts. We have been going through a historic \nargument about firewalls, transferring discretionary defense to \nnondefense discretionary programs, and vice versa.\n  So we are holding tough right now with the House of Representatives \nthat have offset their larger military supplemental with both military \naccounts and nondefense accounts in the discretionary programs.\n  From that standpoint we right now are at a stalemate because the \nHouse wants to offset some of the defense increases with nondefense \nprograms.\n  So, consequently, from the standpoint of where we are in that \nparticular problem, we cannot accept this amendment--I am now speaking \nas an appropriator--we cannot accept this \n[[Page S4895]] because we are, in a sense, contradicting our position \nthat we have taken in the conference process.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator be willing to yield for \njust a moment? Because I know the Senator is going to move to table, I \nwould like to make a minute's worth of comments before that motion is \nmade.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the statement I have made just now, \nwhether it is $10 million or $5 million or $20 million, is still the \nsame basic issue; that is, we are taking military accounts and we are \nmoving parts of those military accounts into nonmilitary programs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I understand. I ask, would the Senator yield? I was \nwondering if I could make a minute's worth of comments before the \nSenator moves to table my amendment.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I would be very happy to yield, and if the Senator \nneeds time, I am happy to yield time for her closing comments.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator very much. I will close in just a \nminute.\n  I understand exactly what the Senator is telling me. But I have to \nsay to my friend that the average American watching this debate is not \npursuaded by procedural arguments. The American people pay taxes and \nwork awfully hard to pay them. They will be very disappointed to learn \nthat there are two military aircraft to transport top brass that have \nbeen ordered by this Congress even though the Pentagon did not want \nthem. Aircraft that have been called pork by Senator Warner, Senator \nMcCain, the Washington Post, and others. Even Colin Powell has stated \nwe have no need for these planes. Yet because of this procurement, we \nare taking computers out of the classrooms, we are hurting our \nchildren, I just think, regardless of the procedural arguments that I \nknow my friend has made because he in his role must make that argument, \nI still believe that we should not table this amendment. I think the \nbottom line is whether you want pupils or you want pork. I hope that my \ncolleagues will stand on the substance of the issue and not vote on the \nprocess.\n  I thank my friend for being so generous with his time in helping me \nwith my amendment.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon has 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I would like to comment on another part \nof the problem. Again, we are not in a position to solve some of these \nproblems immediately, but I hope as far as the future is concerned, \nthat we could get some very careful consideration by the \nadministration. The problem is, we are dealing with a supplemental \nappropriations for the military, for the Defense Department, for \nmatters relating to Bosnia, to Haiti, to North Korea, and to other such \nareas of the world.\n Some of our colleagues are saying to us but that is not truly a \ndefense expenditure. It is being charged against the military in the \nway we budget our expenditures. But that is not truly a defense item. \nAnd why should the military bear the brunt of these more political \nforeign policy actions.\n\n  And, of course, they have been conducted oftentimes with little or no \nconsultation with the Congress. So what happens is those commitments \nare made. Those policies are executed. And all of a sudden we get the \nbill. No authorization. No action by the Congress.\n  This has not happened just in this administration. It has happened \nover the years. But I do think that at one point in time we better \nstart charging to the Defense Department those things that are \nexclusively national defense and take peacekeeping and humanitarian and \nall these other types of things that we are involved in and call them \nsomething else and charge them maybe to a broader base of accounts than \nin the Defense Department.\n  I am not saying how it should be handled, but we are really in a \nhybrid situation of trying to pay in the military appropriation for \nthose actions that are not strictly defense, a mission of our Defense \nDepartment. So I only add to the complexity of trying to separate these \nfunds between military and nonmilitary discretionary.\n  If the Senator has no further comments to make, I would now move to \ntable the Boxer amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Now, Mr. President, let me ask the parliamentary \nsituation. Unanimous consent was made on the basis of the two votes, \none relating to the Kerrey amendment and now to the Boxer amendment, to \nbe stacked and those rollcalls should occur in sequence?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question first will occur on amendment No. \n435, the amendment of the Senator from Nebraska, and then on amendment \nNo. 436, the amendment of the Senator from California.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Has the motion to table the Kerrey amendment been made?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That motion has not yet been made.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I now move to table the Kerrey \namendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  It appears that there is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment No. 435. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. \nFaircloth] is necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] and the \nSenator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams] are absent due to a death in the \nfamily.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I would like to have the attention of \nthe Senate in order to get our schedule for the next few hours.\n  Mr. President, I am going to propound a unanimous-consent agreement, \n[[Page S4897]] first of all to set aside the D'Amato amendment \ntemporarily in order to take up other amendments. I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I now propound a unanimous-consent \nagreement as follows: that the Shelby amendment in the second degree to \nthe Kerrey amendment be given a half-hour time agreement; that the Kyl \namendment which relates to low income energy assistance be given a \nhalf-hour, time to be equally divided; a Reid amendment--and may I \ninquire, again the subject I do not have?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. Chairman that is to take money from the civilian \nnuclear waste fund and put it in the community, and the second is the \nsame except to put it in rural health programs.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. The two Reid amendments each be given 40 minutes \nequally divided; and that votes on all these amendments at the time of \na rollcall, if necessary, begin at 9:30 p.m. So we would be stacking \neach of these amendments to be voted on if a rollcall is required.\n  I ask that there be no second-degree amendments in order prior to a \nmotion to table.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to add an amendment, depending on the \noutcome of the Shelby amendment on that list.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I would like to amend my request, on the contingency of \nhow the Shelby amendment turns out, the Senator from Arizona [Mr. \nMcCain] be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that time on the pending amendments prior to \nthe motion to table be equally divided in the usual form and no second-\ndegree amendments be in order prior to a motion to table.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Just to clarify, I ask, Mr. President, whether or not at \nthe expiration of this entire time we would then--the D'Amato amendment \nwould be the pending business, at the conclusion of those rollcall \nvotes beginning at 9:30? I pose that as a question, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I am sorry?\n  Mr. DODD. I was inquiring whether or not it is the Senator's \nintention at the conclusion of the rollcall votes if necessary, at \n9:30, that the pending business would then once again be the D'Amato \namendment?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. The Senator is correct.\n  Let me make an amendment. I said 9:30. If we add up these times, if \nall is used--I am hoping some of the time might be yielded back--it \nwould be about 9:40. So, may I get a little flexibility there--between \n9:30 and 9:45.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, reserving again the right to object, \nunderstanding at the end of that we would begin the D'Amato amendment?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Right back on the D'Amato amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Could I direct a question to the manager of the bill? At \nthe conclusion of the voting are we through for the evening?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. No. It depends on how many other amendments there are. \nWe will continue. We will continue to do the business of the Senate and \nbe ready for all amendments.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 437 to Amendment No. 435\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the amendment, which is the second-degree \namendment that I have offered, would basically say that all new \nconstruction projects under the General Services Administration, the \nFederal buildings fund, construction and repair projects, where no \nearth has been turned, no overt things have been done as far as repairs \non the building as yet--in other words, nothing done--this would \nbasically total 1.84 billion dollars' worth of projects in not every \nState but a lot of States in the Union, including my State of Alabama \nwhere we have a Federal courthouse ready to go with a $46 million \nprojected cost--we have the list--would be knocked out of the \nappropriations bill. They would be gone.\n  I will just list them basically.\n  Montgomery, AL, courthouse, $46 million. That is the first one. \nLittle Rock, AR, courthouse, $13 million; Bullhead City, AZ, FAA grant, \n$2,200,000; Nogales, AZ, Border Patrol headquarters, $2,998,000; \nPhoenix, AZ, courthouse, $121,890,000; Sierra Vista, AZ, magistrates \noffice, $1 million; the Tucson, AZ, courthouse, $121.8 million; \nSacramento, CA, courthouse, $142.9 million; San Francisco, CA, lease-\npurchase $9 million; San Francisco, CA, courthouse, $4 million; the \nWashington, DC, U.S. Secret Service headquarters, $113 million; and the \nlist goes on and on.\n  We have included in there Prince Georges/Montgomery County, MD, FDA \nconsolidation, $284 million.\n  It says that we are going to save this money, at least temporarily, \nuntil GSA says we are ready to go. As I said, it is $1.842 billion.\n  I think the Senator from Nebraska will join me in this amendment. But \nI will leave that up to him.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alabama.\n  Having gained majority support for an amendment that added \napproximately $300 million to the rescissions package, this at least, \nit seems to me, will now decrease that by $1.8 billion. I believe that \nthis is wise given the fact that we are going to be cutting, we are \ngoing to be taking up amendments immediately following this that have \nto do with low-income energy assistance and it will not be the last \ntime that we visit a program where real people are going to have their \nlives affected in rather serious fashion. This, it seems to me, is \nsetting our priorities straight.\n  I am pleased that the distinguished Senator from Alabama is offering \nit as a second-degree amendment, and I am pleased to urge my colleagues \nto support it strongly.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIndiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, apparently through an oversight, mistake, \nor some other reason, there are courthouses that did not meet any of \nthe criteria set out by the Senator from Nebraska but nevertheless made \nthe selected list that was the subject of the last amendment. One of \nthose was in Hammond, IN, the Hammond courthouse. Selected criteria \nindicated that those on the list were not requested by the General \nServices Administration. The Hammond courthouse was requested by GSA. I \nquote from their report:\n\n       The purpose and need determination, and the . . . building \n     project survey lead to the conclusion that a new Federal \n     building with expanded courtroom space is required to serve \n     Lake and Porter Counties, Indiana. It was also subject to the \n     timeout process another criteria projects were not supposed \n     to have met if they were on the list.\n\n  I quote again:\n\n       Judicial requirements for Hammond have actually grown since \n     the initial timeout review. Savings to be identified from \n     application of value engineering techniques during the \n     construction phase of this project will permit us to satisfy \n     these additional requirements without requesting any \n     additional funds.\n\n  That was stated in a letter from the GSA Administrator Roger Johnson.\n  The amendment purported to target projects that the agencies did not \nrequest or need. However, as I just pointed out, this particular \nproject and others, such as an Arizona project which the Senator from \nArizona pointed out to me, did not meet any of the criteria set forth \nby the Senator from Nebraska but were included on the list. I do not \nknow why they were included on the list. I do not know if it was a \nmistake. But I know there were other projects that did meet the \ncriteria but were not included on the list.\n  I am not going to speculate why they were not on the list. \nNevertheless, because the motion to table was not agreed to, which \nwould have given us an opportunity to construct an accurate list, we \nnow have an amendment before us which will rescind funding for all \nprojects in which construction has not started. That I would suggest \n[[Page S4898]] would save a considerable amount of money.\n  The Senator from Alabama has read some of those courthouses, frankly, \nmany of which met the criteria outlined by the Senator from Nebraska \nbut somehow were not on the list. It is a little bit puzzling to this \nSenator how projects that did not meet the criteria to be rescinded \noutlined by the Senator from Nebraska made the list but projects that \ndid meet the criteria were not on the list.\n  This amendment offered by Senator Shelby is about fairness. The \nSenator from Nebraska's capricious standards were not applied uniformly \nand singled out particular projects that did not even meet the \nstandards set forth. If Senator Kerrey's purpose is to save taxpayer \ndollars, which is a commendable purpose, then everything should be on \nthe table as it is in Senator Shelby's amendment. Then we are talking \nabout big money. I will just read a few of the several that would \nreally save the taxpayers money.\n  The courthouse project in Sacramento, CA, $142.9 million, Wheeling, \nWV, courthouse, $35.8 million; Brooklyn, NY, $43.7 million; Fargo, ND, \n$20.1 million; and the list goes on. In fact, there are a number of \ncourthouses included in the current amendment that have not even been \nauthorized. We are going to take them all now. We are just going to \nsweep the whole bundle as long as construction has not started.\n  We are going to take the whole bundle. I regret that those projects \nwhich GSA has approved, which GSA subjected to time out and review \nprocess, which GSA has certified are legitimate projects, are going to \nbe included in this amendment. But if we are going to include those, \nthen for sure we are going to include every project equitably. Quite \nfrankly, if the Senator from Nebraska's criteria was actually followed \nin the list he submitted then it would have been a good amendment. But \nit is not right or fair for the Senator from Nebraska to claim that all \nthe projects on the list met the criteria because they did not.\n  And again I wish to say it is a mystery as to why some courthouses in \nCalifornia, North Dakota, West Virginia, and other States were not on \nthat list when they clearly met the criteria established for rescission \noutlined by the Senator from Nebraska, and others that clearly did not \nmeet that criteria were on the list. I will leave to the speculation of \nothers why those were on the list. I regret that. But now everybody is \nin. We can save a ton of money--$1.842 billion. So let us go ahead and \ndo it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I take the point that the distinguished \nSenator from Indiana makes. To be clear on this, the GSA timeout review \nprocess was completed in 1993 and then modified after for a variety of \nreasons. It is one criterion. In my Dear Colleague letter I listed \nfour, and even there, I must say, at some point you do become \narbitrary.\n  The distinguished Senator from Alabama in offering his own arguments \nagainst the underlying amendment indicated as much is the case. It is \nabsolutely the case. At some point we do try to make good judgments \nbased upon what we think is fair. And obviously, if it hits us, it does \nnot quite sound fair. I understand that.\n  We try, I would say to my friend from Indiana, to be fair. And as I \nsaid earlier, I am quite pleased that instead of $300 million, we now \nhave before us $1.8 billion. The question must fall to all of us with \nthis second-degree amendment. What happens to the country if this $1.8 \nbillion is not spent.\n  In comparison to other things that we are going to be considering not \nonly in this rescission package but later on in the budget resolution \nwhen the distinguished Senator from New Mexico finishes his work, I \nsuspect that we are going to look back upon this as a rather small item \nin comparison and say that it was good policy the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alabama rose and put another $1.5 billion on the table.\n  So I hope my colleagues will when the time comes support the \namendment of the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I just want to remind my colleagues that \ninitially in the committee we had cut approximately $75 million perhaps \nmore than the House. We thought in the committee, as I said earlier, \nthat we were trying to be fair in the process. I thought the earlier \namendment, the Kerrey amendment was selective and aimed at selected \nprojects. So I thought only to be fair is to take everything including \nmy own courthouse in Montgomery, AL.

Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the remainder \nof my time.\n  Mr. SHELBY. We will yield our time back.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 434\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 434, \nwhich I will advise my colleagues I do not intend to call up, but in \norder to have a time agreement on this amendment which will enable us \nto discuss it for a period of a half an hour we have agreed not to call \nfor a vote at the conclusion of the discussion.\n  It is too bad, Mr. President, because to some extent it seems we are \non the horns of a dilemma when we seek to add more rescissions to the \nlist of those that have been recommended by the committee. This \namendment, No. 434, would conform the rescission of the Low-Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program, the so-called LIHEAP, to that of the House \nof Representatives.\n  Some of my colleagues, on the one hand, said we cannot afford to have \na vote on this and win it because, if we do, the President will then \nveto the bill and we will not get any rescissions; it will not be $17 \nbillion; it will not be $13 billion; it will not be anything. And other \ncolleagues say we cannot afford to have a vote on this amendment \nbecause if we do and it is defeated, then we will not be able to argue \nin the conference that we should rescind more money because the \namendment will have been defeated on the floor of the Senate.\n  I think it is important, however, that these issues be discussed \nbecause during the debate on the balanced budget amendment which \noccurred for over 5 weeks we heard over and over again from opponents \nof the balanced budget amendment that we did not need a constitutional \nrequirement to force us to balance the budget.\n  We were elected to make the hard decisions, but we are not making the \nhard decisions. This is a hard decision, but in a moment I am going to \nread some material to my colleagues which I think will demonstrate that \nit really is not that hard. We can rescind more money from this \nprogram. And in a moment I will explain the reasons why.\n  Too often the argument is made, on the one hand, that we were elected \nto make the hard decisions and then when the hard decisions are placed \nbefore us, our colleagues are not ready to make those hard decisions.\n  And so we are going to discuss this for a half an hour right now. We \nwill not have a vote on it, but we will eventually have a vote on it \nbecause we are going to have to determine whether it is the House level \nof rescission or the Senate level of rescission that will prevail. Mr. \nPresident, on this I support the House level of rescission.\n  Let us talk just a little bit about what this program is. The Low-\nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, provides utility \nassistance for poor families in America as a result of the energy \ncrisis of the late 1970's and early 1980's. It was initiated in 1981 to \ntemporarily supplement existing cash assistance programs to help low-\nincome individuals pay for what were then escalating home fuel costs \nresulting from the energy crisis.\n  An interesting thing happened. Since the program's creation, real \nenergy prices have declined to pre-1980 levels and according to the \nCBO's February 1995 report ``Reducing Deficit Spending and Revenue \nOptions,'' real prices of household fuels have declined 22 percent. So \nthose real low prices mean that it is time to reconsider this program.\n  It is also interesting that in the CBO report 26 States transferred \nup to 10 percent of their LIHEAP funds during the 1993 period to \nsupplement spending for five other social and community services block \ngrant programs and 10 percent is the maximum that they can transfer \nunder this program. So the transfers indicate that at least some States \nbelieve that spending for energy assistance does not have as high a \npriority as other spending. As I said, it is time to reconsider this \nprogram.\n  Now, is this just the position of a conservative Republican from \nArizona? No. Let me read to you from the budget of the President of the \nUnited States, William Clinton, last year.\n  The President is requesting $730 million. That is half as much as is \nrequested in this year's budget. Here is what the President said: We \nhad to eliminate or refocus many programs including LIHEAP. Why? Well, \nseveral factors influenced our decision, he says:\n\n       1. LIHEAP began as a response to the severe energy crisis \n     in the early 1970's and early 1980's which caused quantum \n     increases in energy prices. Since then, energy prices and the \n     percentage of income spent by low-income households on home \n     energy decreased substantially.\n       What began as a program--\n\n  And I continue to quote here from the President's budget. This is \nPresident Clinton's budget requesting a reduction in funds last year.\n\n       What began as a program focused on easing the energy crisis \n     has evolved into a very narrowly focused income supplement \n     program which provides average benefits of less than $200, \n     does not target well those low-income households with \n     exceptionally high energy costs in relation to income, and \n     which does little to help assisted households achieve \n     independence from the program.\n\n  I am quoting from President Clinton's budget, indicating why this \nprogram should have been cut last year.\n\n       The administration has made major improvements [he says] in \n     the Nation's basic income supplement programs, increasing the \n     earned income tax credit for the working poor, expanding the \n     Food Stamps Program and reforming the welfare system. These \n     changes reduce the need for peripheral income supplement \n     programs such as LIHEAP.\n\n  And the President concluded:\n\n       Considering these factors, we concluded that the time had \n     come to refocus LIHEAP on the energy needs of low-income \n     families and to shift away from income supplementation and \n     dependency.\n\n  Mr. President, LIHEAP is a very good example of what has happened so \noften with the Federal budget. A crisis develops at some point in our \nhistory which causes us to implement a Federal program which extracts \ntaxpayer dollars from all over the country and focuses it on a limited \nsegment of our population. We vote to do that because at the time it \nappears to us that there is a group in need and we want to assist them. \nBut over time the original need for that program, the original \nrationale for it disappears or is substantially reduced. Sometimes \npeople cannot even remember why it was put into effect.\n  We remember why this was put into effect. Because there was a severe \ncrisis at the time. That crisis is gone.\n  The authority for what I just said is no less than the President of \nthe United States, President Clinton, who, last year in his budget \nsubmission, said we can cut this program in half. Now, nothing has \nchanged between last year and this year. As a matter of fact, the area \nof the Northeast has improved its economy. So there are fewer people \nthat would require the assistance.\n  But still we have people from all over the United States and, in \nparticular, the Northeast part of the country saying that this is an \nabsolute necessity for the people who are their constituents, they \ncannot get along without it.\n  Mr. President, there is a billboard in my community. It has a nice \npicture of Uncle Sam painted on it, and it says: ``Remember, he's your \nuncle, not your dad.''\n  We have to stop relying on the Federal Government to do so many \nthings for us. Yes, there are a lot of things that would be nice if we \nhad the money for them. But as we learned during the debate on the \nbalanced budget amendment, it is time to begin setting priorities. And \nwhen the President of the United States, a previous supporter of the \nprogram, says it ought to be cut in half because the need for it has \nbeen substantially reduced because the original problem--the energy \ncrisis--is now gone, should we not in the House and in the Senate be \nwilling to follow that advice, make the tough decision, \n[[Page S4900]] set the priority and reduce the spending on the program?\n  The House of Representatives was willing to do so, but in the Senate, \napparently that is not the case.\n  So, Mr. President, it seems to me that I could not talk to the folks \nin my State about reducing Federal spending and then stand by silent as \nwe adopt this rescission package in the Senate without speaking to this \nprogram.\n  When the conference committee between the House and Senate meets, I \nam hopeful that a larger rescission will be accepted. I am willing, as \nI said, not to force this to a vote here and upset the applecart and \ncause the President to veto the entire rescission package, if he were \nto do that, because it is important that we get even $13 billion \nrescinded, although $17 billion would be a better number. But I think \nthe American people need to start focusing on this.\n  I go back to what I said originally when those who opposed the \nbalanced budget amendment said, ``You send us back here to make the \ntough choices and we will do it,'' as we find oftentimes, they are not \nwilling to, and the main reason is because they can always argue that \npoor people benefit from the program. That is always the case. But that \ndoes not justify every bit of spending, because it is hard-working \nAmericans who get up early in the morning, send their kids off to \nschool, work hard all day long, come home tired and pay plenty of taxes \nso that programs like this can continue.\n  It is not mean spirited to say enough is enough. They need to be able \nto keep more of their hard-earned money to spend as they see fit.\n  So I think it is time we do reexamine this program. I submit that the \nHouse rescission number is a better number, and I urge my colleagues in \nthe conference to support that number. I reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Kyl amendment, \nwhich would affect funding for the Low-Income Heating Assistance \nProgram [LIHEAP].\n  When the United States balances $400 billion of corporate tax \nbenefits against a cut taken exclusively from the most disadvantaged, \nit violates the average American's sense of fairness.\n  I also rise to oppose the other body's Appropriations Committee's \nvote to rescind $1.4 billion from LIHEAP's fiscal year 1996 budget as \npart of the Contract with America. That would eliminate complete \nappropriation for LIHEAP, which gives home heating grants to low-income \nAmericans. The program serves 5.6 million households nationwise, 30 \npercent of the home eligible to receive LIHEAP support.\n  Mr. President, in Massachusetts and other regional cold-weather \nStates, energy prices continue to rise along with the increase in \npoverty. Many of the people who rely on LIHEAP have jobs, but simply \ncan't make enough to get by when the temperature drops and the bills \ncome in.\n  In Massachusetts, 143,000 households receive LIHEAP funding. If the \nprogram is eliminated, Massachusetts stands to lose $54 million for \nfiscal year 1995.\n  Eliminating LIHEAP could be a death sentence for some Massachusetts \nfamilies, for the elderly, and for children who may be forced to choose \nbetween heat and food or medicine. No one should have to make that kind \nof choice.\n  That is why I and 35 senators from both parties have sent a letter to \nSenator Mark Hatfield, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nurging restoration of LIHEAP funds in the rescission package.\n  LIHEAP is a block grant administered by State and local governments, \nand is one of the most cost-effective and efficient Federal subsidy \nprograms. Seventy percent of LIHEAP recipients do not receive other \ngovernment relief, such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children or \nfood stamps, but rely on this aid to supplement their monthly income \nduring the winter months.\n  Mr. President, I would like to close by offering the following \ngraphic illustration of the importance of this issue.\n  The December before last, a fire burned down a small apartment \nbuilding in the Mount Pleasant region of DC, burning to death two \nlittle girls, Amber and Asia Spencer, ages 6 and 5. Neighbors recalled \nAmber's last words--``Please, please, help us.'' The girls were killed \nby a fire when one of the candles that was used to heat their apartment \nfell over. The electricity had been turned off two months earlier when \nthe girl's guardian--their grandmother--could not afford to pay the \nheating bill.\n  Every winter children across the country are killed or jeopardized by \nfires caused by desperate attempts to keep warm or to lighten darkened \nhomes. Mr. President, this country cannot abide this sad state of \naffairs. We can and we must do better--not worse--by the children and \nfamilies who need the bare necessities to survive.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I know there are other colleagues on \nthe floor who wish to speak on this, and we have had some prior \ndiscussion with the Senator from Arizona. I think we have an agreement \non how to proceed. I appreciate the discussions that I have had with \nthe Senator from Arizona.\n  Let me just make a couple of points. The first point is that I think \nthat sometimes the profound mistake we make on the floor of the Senate \nis that there just are no people and no faces behind the statistics. I \nmet at home with Alida Larson, and there were a number of other low-\nincome citizens from Minnesota--understand full well, Minnesota is a \ncold-weather State--and each of them told their stories.\n  In my State of Minnesota, there are around 330,000 low-income people \nwho really depend upon this small amount of support averaging about \n$330 a year which for them quite often can be the difference between \nbeing able to stay in their home or not.\n  Mr. President, 110,000 households, 30 percent of which the head of \nhousehold is elderly, 40 percent of which households have a child, over \n50 percent of which have someone working but working at low wages, 40 \npercent of whom after a year no longer receive this.\n  In the State of Minnesota, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram is not an income supplement. It is a survival supplement. For \nmany, many families without this assistance, it is the choice between \nheat or eat.\n  My colleague says, ``Well, the cost of energy has gone down.'' I say \nto my colleague, we have seen a dramatic increase in poverty in the \nUnited States of America. We are talking about elderly people, we are \ntalking about families with wage earners but low wages, we are talking \nabout children. And in the State of Minnesota, there is tremendous \nsupport for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program--tremendous \nsupport.\n  I think that my colleague will find that Senators from the Northeast \nand Midwest, whether they are Democrats or Republicans, feel very \nstrongly about this.\n  Mr. President, finally, because I am going to stay within 5 minutes \nor less, as to the choices that we need to make, yes, let us move \nforward on deficit reduction and, yes, let us move forward to balancing \nthe budget.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I actually would be willing to except that I only have \nabout 2 minutes before I have to literally leave the Chamber, but I \nwill go ahead real quick.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The question is how much time he will take. There are \nquite a few speakers on this side.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Before my colleague came in, I made it clear I was \ngoing to stay within 5 minutes or so because I know there are other \ncolleagues who wish to speak.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Absolutely.\n  Mr. President, by way of conclusion, if we are going to be talking \nabout cuts, look to subsidies for oil companies, look to subsidies for \npharmaceutical companies, look to all sorts of deductions and loopholes \nand dodges that affect large corporations and large financial \ninstitutions in America.\n  For God's sake, Mr. President, let us not cut a program that for \nmany, many Americans in the cold-weather States is not an income \nsupplement but a survival supplement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  [[Page S4901]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, will the Senator from Arizona yield me 1 \nminute?\n  Mr. KYL. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment my colleague from \nArizona for his amendment. If we were to eliminate this program for the \nyears 1996 through 2000, we would save $10 billion in budget authority \nand $7 billion in outlays. If we adopted the Senator's amendment, we \nwould save $1.3 billion. I think that would be a step in the right \ndirection.\n  This program was not created to be a welfare program, and I think our \ncolleague from Arizona is exactly right, if we want to cut spending, \nthis would be an excellent example.\n  I compliment him for his amendment. I urge it be adopted. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have a time agreement. How much time \ndoes the Senator wish?\n  Mr. KOHL. Three minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Can he settle for 2?\n  Mr. KOHL. All right.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment which \ncompletely eliminates the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. \nThis program helps low-income elderly, the disabled, and working poor \nto cover a portion of the heating of their homes.\n  Mr. President, the bill we are considering today is a disaster relief \nbill. It is about helping people fight back against the wrath of \nnature, whether it be floods, earthquakes or other natural emergencies. \nWhen disaster strikes, Americans band together to help those who are \ndown on their luck and to afford everyday necessities.\n  Heat, food and shelter are everyday necessities, Mr. President. Low-\nincome families and the elderly who must confront bitter cold weather \nyear in and year out are no less deserving of compassion than victims \nof a flood or earthquake.\n  The House made the unfortunate decision to eliminate or kill LIHEAP. \nThe Senate Appropriations Committee, under the direction of the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon and the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania, wisely rejected this cut. Home energy costs consume an \nunreasonably high portion of resources for those with limited incomes, \nparticularly during harsh winters.\n  My colleague from Arizona is fortunate to come from a warm-weather \nState. In fact, many people from my own State of Wisconsin retired to \nhis fine State because of the very appealing weather. Unfortunately, \nnot everyone can afford to leave their homes to avoid the cold. Often, \nlow-income families and the elderly are forced to choose between food, \nmedicine or heat.\n  Mr. President, this is a choice that no one should have to make in \nour country. Although we must cut Federal spending and we must control \nour deficit, it should not be done at the expense of people's health \nand safety.\n  We must preserve LIHEAP and reject the House cut.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Kyl amendment.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask my colleague from Vermont how much time he needs.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Two minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes remain.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of \nthe Senator from Arizona. It may well be that we should take another \nlook at this program, but this is no place to do it. There may be \nStates like Arizona and Oklahoma and others that may be willing to give \nup whatever they get under LIHEAP because they do not have the needs of \nsome of the other areas of the country.\n  In my State of Vermont, this is a critical program. Over the last 3 \nyears, energy prices have gone up in Vermont by 21 percent. At the same \ntime, LIHEAP funding has gone down by $300 million.\n  The average family who receives LIHEAP assistance spends over 18 \npercent of its income on energy. This is three times the energy burden \nfor median-income families. I would expect a lot less for those in \nArizona and Oklahoma. Fifty-five percent of all LIHEAP homes include at \nleast one child under the age of 18 and 43 percent include a senior \ncitizen. Both figures are far above the national average. Without \nLIHEAP assistance, many recipients could not afford to pay their \nheating bills in the winter and many would be forced to choose between \nheat and food.\n  Rescinding LIHEAP will also force energy providers in Vermont, and \nmany other areas, many of whom are small unregulated businesses, to \nchoose between not getting paid for the energy they provide and cutting \noff their neediest customers.\n  LIHEAP is well run and administered by State and local governments \nwho keep administrative costs at about 8 percent, far below the \naverage, so the money is getting to those who need it. It has strong \nbipartisan support from Senators in my region and all around the \ncountry.\n  I urge defeat of the amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time does the Senator from Connecticut desire?\n  Mr. DODD. I would like 1\\1/2\\ or 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes remain.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me commend our colleague from Pennsylvania who, I \ngather, led the charge in the Appropriations Committee for the \nrestoration of these funds. I commend him, Senator Jeffords, Senator \nWellstone, and others, who have spoken out on this issue.\n  Mr. President, in the committee report, House Appropriations \nconcludes that this program is no longer needed. There are 60,000 in my \nState each winter who depend upon this source of assistance, not just \nas a casual need, but a serious one.\n  In fact, in anticipation of the study that the energy prices have \ndropped and it is no longer needed, I asked the Congressional Research \nService to complete a study on energy prices and LIHEAP appropriations. \nThey found that actually there would need to be an increase if you \ntracked energy price fluctuations over the last few years. This year, \nwe budgeted $1.130 billion, which is far below what they tell us you \nwould actually need. Dr. Deborah Frank, a pediatrician at Boston \nUniversity, tracked over many years malnutrition among children \nfollowing significant periods of cold in the Northeast and discovered \nthat after those periods of very low temperatures, actually \nmalnutrition in children went up because of parents making the tough \nchoice of heat over food.\n  So this issue has been critically important to major parts of the \ncountry. I sincerely hope the amendment is rejected. This goes far \nbeyond what most of us recognize as a valuable safety net for many in \nthe country.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Maine, how much \ntime does he wish?\n  Mr. COHEN. Could I have a minute and a half and then yield 30 seconds \nto my colleague from Maine?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four and a half minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The senior Senator from Maine has 90 seconds.\n  Mr. COHEN. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, we hear a lot of talk about a beltway mentality, but \nit seems to me that this amendment reflects a Sunbelt mentality. I do \nnot know how many people have spent any time in the Northeast during \nthe winter months, but we have at least 5 months of the year during \nwhich the average temperature is below freezing. In many months it is \nnot just subfreezing, it is subzero. When you get to northern Maine, we \nare talking about 20 or 30 below zero many days.\n  We have a lot of poor people in our State. There are some 62,000 \npeople who are beneficiaries of this particular program. Many of them \nare elderly. Forty or 45 percent of those that receive LIHEAP benefits \naround the country are elderly. So we are putting people who have an \nincome of approximately \n[[Page S4902]] $8,000, whose energy bills consume almost 18 percent of \ntheir income, and we are now saying cut the program out, prices are low \nenough that they can afford it.\n  But they cannot afford it. This is a small program compared to some \nothers that are provided to the citizens of this country. I know it may \nbe nice to live in a warm climate. It has been mild here in Washington, \nas I am sure it is in the West. In the Northeast, and throughout the \nindustrial belt, it is very cold.\n  I submit to my colleagues that it would be a terrible tragedy to cut \nthis program.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield a minute and a half to the Senator from Maine, \n[Ms. Snowe].\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator. I certainly want to be on record in \nsupport of this most important program to so many people in my State, \nand certainly in the Northeast.\n  I was part of an effort back in 1980 in the House of Representatives \nto create this program. Yes, it was in response, originally, to a \ncrisis. That is not unusual for the number of programs that are created \nin the U.S. Congress. But Congress intended it to be a long-term \nprogram, because it was serving the poorest of the poor. It is a means-\ntested program. It serves a number of people. Yet, it only serves 25 \npercent of those individuals who are actually eligible to receive \nbenefits under this program.\n  This program, in real terms, has been reduced by 50 percent since \n1985--50 percent. I know the Senator from Arizona was referring to the \nPresident's budget last year of $700 million, and that even the \nPresident was recommending a 50 percent reduction. He recommended that \nreduction because he wanted to remove the Southern States from that \nprogram. In fact, in 1994, the President recommended a supplemental \nincrease for the low-income fuel assistance program of more than $300 \nmillion, which I think demonstrates the President's commitment to this \nprogram. But who does this program serve? Of the roughly 5.6 million \nhouseholds that receive low-income fuel assistance, more than two-\nthirds have annual incomes of less than $8,000. More than one-half have \nhad incomes below $6,000. Thirty percent of these recipients are poor, \nelderly people, and 20 percent are disabled.\n  In my home State, 74 percent of these recipients are elderly people \non fixed incomes. We are supporting people who need to have the \nbenefits of this very valuable program.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes remain.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, those who may be watching on C-SPAN 2 may \nbe wondering why so little time is allocated here. This has been an \neffort by the Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, to air the subject, \nbut it is not going to be brought to a vote. Were it to be brought to a \nvote, there would be substantially more time allocated for this very \nimportant debate.\n  The Senators who have come to the floor have spoken for very limited \nperiods of time and have done so to register their passionate concern \nabout this issue. As chairman of the subcommittee which had \njurisdiction over this issue and brought it to the floor, we have very \ncarefully considered the totality of the package, and the Senate has \nmet the House figure--the House figure totaling $17.3 billion, and the \nSenate figure is in excess of $13 billion. But the difference is \naccommodated by deferring the expenditures on FEMA, the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency.\n  Our subcommittee and the full committee determined that this funding \nshould remain in LIHEAP because of its importance. The statistics have \nalready been cited and I shall not repeat them. But the overwhelming \nmajority of people have annual incomes of less than $8,000, or even \n$6,000. And regarding the choice of many elderly for either heating or \neating, when there are emergency measures taken on alternative \nmakeshift heating and lighting devices, an enormous number of deaths \nresult--11 people, mostly children, in Philadelphia in a 5-month \nperiod, from August 1992 to January 1993. While we do not have \nnationwide figures, they would be enormous.\n  This is one of the most urgent programs in the Federal budget. It \nexemplifies what I have said. While I am committed and I think the \nCongress is committed on consensus to balancing the budget by the year \n2002, it has to be done with a scalpel and not a meat ax.\n  This is a very, very, important program. Were there a longer period \nof time, I think we would have heard many Senators coming to the floor. \nSome 35 have signed a letter.\n  Mr. President, I note my colleague from Pennsylvania on the floor. I \nwould ask how much time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. May I ask unanimous consent that my colleague be \npermitted to speak for up to 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator for yielding time to me. I wanted \nto echo his remarks. This is a very important program for a lot of \npeople in my area of the country, and in Pennsylvania particularly.\n  This is a program that, frankly, has not been funded to the levels \nthat really are going to meet the needs of the people in the \ncommunities who are low income, who are not able to keep the houses \nwarm at night.\n  I can say from having visited homes that have enjoyed the energy \nassistance program, enjoyed the benefits, that it provides that degree \nof safety and comfort that the houses will be warm on these cold winter \nnights that we have had up in our area of the country.\n  I congratulate the Senator for his great work on defending this \nprogram, because it is a regional program in a sense. It is a program \nthat disproportionately benefits one area, the area that has colder \ntemperatures. As a result, it is always on the chopping block, but is a \nprogram that meets very vital needs in providing people basic shelter \nand warm comfort during the very cold winter days.\n  I congratulate the Senator for his great work on this project. I look \nforward to continuing support of this program.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that certain documents be included in the Record which lend \nsome factual support--certainly not an exhaustive statement--but some \nfactual support that should be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material is ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Arguments To Maintain LIHEAP Funding\n\n       A cut to LIHEAP funding will have a significant impact on \n     current recipients who already have difficulty in meeting \n     their energy bills, many having to choose between fuel and \n     food.\n       Elimination of the program could be devastating, since it \n     brings potentially life-saving heat to nearly 6 million poor \n     families, or roughly 15 million individuals; about 30 percent \n     of the recipients are elderly, and 20 percent are disabled.\n       Over 70% of LIHEAP recipients have annual incomes of less \n     than $8000; more than half have annual incomes of less than \n     $6000. Energy costs consume nearly 20% of these meager \n     incomes.\n       25% of LIHEAP recipients receive no other federal \n     assistance.\n       LIHEAP was able to serve less than 25% of eligible \n     households in fiscal year 1994.\n       The average LIHEAP benefit is only about $200.\n       Each winter, there are cases of children dying from the use \n     of dangerous alternative heating sources, like candles.\n       Contrary to some claims, low income households do not face \n     appreciably reduced energy costs compared to the 1970's and \n     early 1980's.\n       Energy prices for natural gas and electricity are just as \n     high today as they were in the 1970's, even in constant \n     dollars.\n       50% of LIHEAP recipients heat with natural gas.\n       Increased competition among utilities has intensified cost-\n     cutting, making it unlikely they would absorb LIHEAP costs \n     that could put them at a competitive disadvantage. If LIHEAP \n     were abolished, we could expect a major increase in \n     households losing utility services, and increased \n     homelessness.\n       This program has already suffered large cuts; current \n     funding is $781 million, or 37 percent, below its 1985 level.\n\n\n                            funding history\n\n       1985--$2,100,000,000.\n       1986--$2,010,000,000.\n       1987--$1,825,000,000.\n       1988--$1,532,000,000.\n       1989--$1,383,000,000.\n       [[Page S4903]] 1990--$1,443,000,000.\n       1991--$1,610,000,000.\n       1992--$1,500,000,000.\n       1993--$1,346,000,000.\n       1994--$1,437,000,000.\n       1995--$1,319,204,000.\n       1996--$1,319,204,000.\n\n  Mr. KYL. In my 48 remaining seconds, let me say, ``I told you so.''\n  I said at the beginning that Members would come running out of their \noffices to come to the floor and pronounce themselves four square in \nfront of this program, because this is critical. We can cut others but \nwe cannot cut this one. That is exactly what is wrong with this \nprocess. Every one of them is critical. We have got to start somewhere.\n  Mr. President, I started where President Clinton started last year \nwhen he said we can cut it in half, that it was time to shift away from \nthis program.\n  By the way, it is not just Sunbelt mentality. Even in my State people \nreceive funds for weather-stripping and air conditioning support, just \nto show how ridiculous the program has gotten.\n  We could all use the help, of course, but we have to start somewhere. \nI just ask this question, Mr. President, if we are not ready to start \nwith this one, we are not ready to start with the other ones we voted \ndown today, where are we willing to start to cut this $1 trillion \nbudget deficit? We have to start somewhere.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Let me respond briefly to the Senator from Arizona.\n  We have made very substantial cuts in this program. And when he says \nthat this is an illustration of, if we do not cut here, where are we \ngoing to cut, our job is to establish priorities. That is our \nresponsibility.\n  The Appropriations Committee met its responsibility and we cut other \nless-important programs. So we agree with the Senator from Arizona that \nthe budget has to be cut, the budget has to be balanced, the deficit \nhas to be cut, that it is a matter of priorities.\n  I think when all of the Senators came running to the floor here to \nspeak for the enormous amount of 90 seconds, they did so because of \ntheir very deep concern for the program and this is a priority item \nwhich ought to stay. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the Kyl amendment, which would \neliminate the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.\n  Over 6 million people received aid with heating costs under the Low-\nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program last year.\n  In Massachusetts, LIHEAP served 143,000 households in 1994. It \nprovided especially needed relief in the winter of 1993-94, which was \nextremely harsh.\n  Seventy-two percent of the families receiving LIHEAP have incomes \nbelow $8,000. These families spend an extremely burdensome 18 percent \nof their incomes on energy costs, compared to the average middle-class \nfamily, which spends only 4 percent.\n  Nearly half of the households receiving heating assistance are \ncomprised of elderly or handicapped individuals.\n  Researchers at Boston City Hospital have documented the ``heat or eat \neffect''--higher utility bills during the coldest months force low-\nincome families to spend less money on food. The result is increased \nmalnutrition among children.\n  The study found that almost twice as many low-weight and \nundernourished children were admitted to the Boston City Hospital \nemergency room immediately following the coldest month of the winter. \nLow-income families should not have to choose between heating and \neating.\n  But the poor elderly will be at the greatest risk if LIHEAP is \nterminated, because they are the most vulnerable to hypothermia. In \nfact, older Americans accounted for more than half of all hypothermia \ndeaths in 1991.\n  In addition, elderly households are 28 percent more likely than all \nhouseholds to live in homes built before 1940. These homes tend to be \nless energy efficient than newer homes, placing the elderly at greater \nrisk.\n  Many low-income elderly who have trouble paying their energy bills \nsubstitute alternative heating devices--such as room heaters, \nfireplaces, and wood burning stoves--for central heating. Between 1986 \nand 1990, heating equipment was the second leading cause of fire deaths \namong the elderly. In fact, the elderly were 2 to 12 times more likely \nto die in a heating related fire than adults under 65.\n  LIHEAP is not only vital for low-income Americans, it also benefits \ncommunities as well. As Robert Coard, president of Action for Boston \nCommunity Development, wrote in a Boston Globe editorial last month, \nthat LIHEAP--\n\n       * * * employs large numbers of community people who may \n     have trouble finding work in industries requiring \n     sophisticated high-technology skills. Many are multilingual--\n     a major asset for this program. The oil vendors who work with \n     the program include many mom-and-pop businesses that depend \n     on fuel assistance to survive. The dollars spent go right \n     back into the economy.\n\n  The winter of 1993-94 was especially harsh. In January, the \ntemperature in Boston averaged 20.6 degrees. At the same time, the \nprice of oil rose to meet the increased demand for heating assistance.\n  If Senate Republicans are serious about helping the elderly, they \nwill preserve funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program \nand stop raiding the wallets--or in this case the furnaces--of those \nwho need help the most.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the Kyl amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate \nfor 30 seconds.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object. We could go \nback and forth, and we have Senators standing here who have been \nstanding here the whole time to bring up their amendments. I will not \nobject to 1 minute, but after that----\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, 30 seconds. I just wanted to close the debate \nthat I began, if I could.\n  Reasonable people will differ. The House of Representatives trimmed \nus by $1.3 billion. It seems to me that they represent all regions of \nthe country just as much as Senators do.\n  I do not doubt the sincerity of anyone who speaks in here. But I do \ndoubt the Congress' commitment if we cannot start with a program like \nthis. And I hope that when the conference meets, we will rescind more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. Under the previous \norder, the Senator from Nevada is recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 438 to Amendment No. 420\n\n(Purpose: To restore $14,700,000 of the amount available for substance \n                          abuse block grants)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Bryan and myself and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself and Mr. \n     Bryan, proposes an amendment numbered 438 to amendment No. \n     420.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent further reading be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 14, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n\n\n                      nuclear waste disposal fund\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 103-316, $14,700,000 are rescinded.\n       On page 28, strike lines 18 through 23.\n\n  Mr. REID. I further ask, Mr. President, there is about 3 minutes \nextra on this time block. I ask unanimous consent that the time equally \ndivided for the first amendment I will offer, instead of 40 minutes be \nabout 43 minutes, 44 minutes, whatever is left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The time will be 43 minutes equally divided between the two sides.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this amendment is very direct and to the \npoint. This year, the money for developing a permanent repository for \nthe disposal of civilian nuclear waste has increased by $130 million, \nto where it is now almost $400 million to dig a hole in the \n[[Page S4904]] ground in Nevada. $400 million for 1 year. They have not \nspent all that money, of course. They cannot spend all the money, of \ncourse.\n  What this amendment says is, ``Let's take part of that money and put \nit in a program that I think is extremely important.'' This, Mr. \nPresident, would take the money from the nuclear waste, $14.7 million, \nand replenish the money that was deleted from a program that benefits \nevery person in this body--every Senator in this body and every Member \nof the House of Representatives.\n  It is a substance abuse block grant. Let me, Mr. President, talk a \nlittle bit about what the substance abuse block grant does, and then I \nask my colleagues whether the money should be spent for these purposes \nor whether the money should be spent for digging a hole in the ground \nand spending $400 million in the State of Nevada.\n  Mr. President, I am not saying they should not spend money. They will \nspend hundreds of millions of dollars. I am taking only $14.7 million \nfrom almost $400 million. That is what I am doing, replenishing a \nprogram that is tremendous.\n  I am going to talk about some of the benefits of the substance abuse \nblock grant money in the little State of Nevada. Little in the sense \nthat there are not many people there.\n  However, Mr. President, the program in the State of Nevada funds 26 \ncommunity-based nonprofit agencies. In 1994, approximately 7,000 \nindividuals received treatment ranging from detoxification to long-term \nresidential care.\n  An additional 9,000-plus individuals were served in civil protective \ncustody programs. An estimated 2,000 individuals will be placed on \ntreatment waiting lists because they simply do not have rooms for them \nduring the year. Those waiting at any point, 37 percent of them will \nhave been waiting for far over a month.\n  What we need to keep in mind is that substance abuse treatment money \nthat I am going to talk about, Mr. President, is money that is spent. \nWe will save untold millions of dollars in spending these moneys.\n  It saves lives, restores hope. In Nevada, substance abuse is a \nprimary factor in 55 percent of child abuse investigations. Over half \nof the child abuse investigations, when they are investigated, we find \nare a result of some kind of substance abuse.\n  Mr. President, I am talking about Nevada. There are programs like \nthis all over the country. The Family Preservation Program funded by \nthe Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Abuse accepts 42 families.\n  Mr. President, 100 percent of these families would lose their \nchildren due to abuse or neglect, unless a parent is willing to \nparticipate in the intensive day program.\n  The reason I mention this is that we know that it costs about $40,000 \na year on an average to keep a kid in a reformatory--$40,000 a year. \nThis whole program in the State of Nevada costs $85,000. If we keep two \nkids out of prison, out of a reformatory, we have made the nut, so to \nspeak. And then it is gravy for the remaining 42 families. And some of \nthese families, of course, have more than one child. Thus foster \nplacement is not necessary.\n  First, let me say this. I have said the parents have to be willing to \nparticipate. If they do not participate in the program the kids are \ntaken from them. This program has a 90 percent success rate 1 year \nafter treatment. That is tremendous. In other words, foster placement \nis not necessary in 90 percent of the families who go through intensive \ntreatment. Those of us who know about foster care, we know it is a lot \nbetter than nothing but it is not as good as a parent. That is what \nthis program does, is allow parents to maintain contact with their \nchildren. This $85,000 investment of treatment averts $2 million in \nfoster care money alone--foster care costs.\n  Mr. President, I ask if the Chair would advise the Senator from \nNevada when he has 5 minutes remaining on this amendment.\n  Mr. President, another successful initiative is something we have in \nReno, NV, called Ridge House, a program for ex-felons. Ridge House \ntracked reincarceration for individuals in the program they serve, and \nfound the program has a recidivism rate of 22 percent--not in a 1-year \nperiod. We usually hit our good statistics the first year. After 3 \nyears, a 22 percent return rate, so to speak. The average is about 80 \npercent. This program is 400 percent better than if we did nothing.\n  This is significant because again we are talking about a 3-year \nprogram. It is not the first year--things are usually pretty good the \nfirst year. It is a 3-year program with a little over 20 percent \nrecidivism rate when nationally it is almost 80 percent. The success of \nthis program means that 78 percent of the ex-felons served have not re-\noffended, have jobs, and are contributing members of society 3 years \nafter treatment.\n  In 1993 the Ridge House served 32 individuals at a cost--listen to \nthis--of $945 an ex-felon served. The annual budget of these 32 \nindividuals would not keep a person in prison for a year.\n  A study at Saint Mary's, which is a Catholic hospital, a wonderful \nfacility in Reno--they did a chemical dependency program study. They \nevaluated their health care situation for the year before and the year \nafter treatment. These statistics are staggering. And we have to \ndetermine tonight whether we are better spending the money digging a \nhole or putting it in programs that save lives and protect families. \nThe study showed that emergency room visits were reduced by 62 percent \nfor people who were in the program, and health care costs were reduced \nby 73 percent. This demonstrates that other health care costs are \nreduced when treatment is available and accessible.\n  Moreover, results of a pilot outcome study conducted by the \nUniversity of Nevada Institute For Applied Research found a significant \nreduction for those presently awaiting charges, trial, or sentencing 3 \nmonths after discharge from treatment compared to before treatment. So \nwhat we are saying is that those people who are part of the program do \na lot better by a significant number. The study also found that the \naverage net income doubled when comparing pretreatment to 3 months \nafter discharge.\n  These programs and these studies show one of the most important \nelements of substance abuse is treatment, especially within the context \nof this debate. Mr. President, I voted happily last year to spend $11 \nbillion for new police officers; $11 billion for new prisons, prison \nfacilities. I am talking here about restoring some of the money that is \nbeing rescinded for programs that will not keep people in jail. We will \nnot have to hire new police officers. All we are talking about is not \ndigging a hole in the ground quite as deep, maybe--in fact if they \nspend the money, although it has been proven it is one of the most \nwasteful programs in the history of America. We are taking $14.5 \nmillion approximately out of a $400 million program to restore these \nmoneys.\n  Another important function of the substance abuse block grant is the \nprevention program it funds. The Nevada Bureau of Alcohol and Drug \nAbuse funds 100 sites around the State, including programs that would \nnot exist any other way in rural Nevada. These programs serve in excess \nof 10,000 people. Nevada has adopted a risk and resiliency framework \nwhich emphasizes funding programs which reduce the risk factors \nassociated with alcohol and other drugs, and programs which strengthen \nthe resiliency or protective factors.\n  One of the most successful preventive programs is something called \nHACES, which stands for Hispanics Assisting the Community with \nExcellence for Students. Mr. President, listen to this. This program \nworks only with high-risk Hispanic students and includes Saturday \nworkshops along with community work. Students can only participate on \nSaturdays if they have missed no school during the week. Parental \ninvolvement is required.\n  What were the results? Staggering. Compared to a control group, \nschool absenteeism was reduced by 73 percent and the dropout rate was \n75 percent lower. One of the largest dropout rates of any ethnic group \nin America is that of Hispanics. All over the country, it is a fact. In \nthis program we have a 75 percent lower dropout rate. How can anybody \nnot vote for this?\n  Satisfactory academic progress occurred in 94 percent of the \nstudents, and student interest in higher education increased by 300 \npercent.\n  Perhaps one of the best side effects of the program for these young \npeople, \n[[Page S4905]] though, is something we could not measure in statistics. \nI cannot tell you what we know it does to self-confidence, what it does \nto self-esteem. The total program cost is equal to half of what it \ncosts on average in our country to keep an inmate in prison, about \n$15,000.\n  So how can we afford to cut funding to these successful and what I \nbelieve are essential programs? The impact of drug interdiction efforts \non the rate of substance abuse in our country can be debated at great \nlength. I believe in interdiction. I believe in prison. I believe in \nmore judges. I believe in more police officers. And I voted \naccordingly. But let us do something about some of these preventive \nprograms.\n  I have given statistics from the State of Nevada. Multiply these with \nthe State of Kentucky, the State of Delaware, the State of \nPennsylvania. They are staggering. I invite attention to those.\n  The program we are taking money from is a program we can afford to \ncut down by a fraction of a percent. From approximately $400 million \nthat we have in that fund for this year, 1995, we want to take $14 \nmillion from it. That does not sound out of line to me, especially when \nwe keep in mind the budget from which I want to restore these $14.5 \nmillion was increased by $130 million.\n  So, this is not going to cripple the Yucca Mountain Project. It will \nnot delay a solution to interim waste storage. This is prudent \nmanagement of the taxpayers' money.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, in that it does not \nappear at this stage that anyone is here to debate this--and I am sure \nthey will show up--but I ask in fairness to me that I reserve my time \nand that the time toll against the other side on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me make this suggestion, if I may. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum and it be charged to the opposition.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is absolutely right. I should have done that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the time of the quorum call \nwill be counted against the Republican time.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I see no Senators seeking recognition.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could say, through you, to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, the order now is that the time running under the \nquorum has been charged to the other side. I ask that continue during \nthe remarks.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, may I make inquiry?\n  Mr. BYRD. Either that or I could ask unanimous consent that it not be \ncharged against anyone.\n  Mr. REID. We have a time certain on a vote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the time is \nrunning and being charged against our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen minutes 6 seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. We would like to reserve some time to speak against \nthe Reid amendment. I would like to accommodate the senior Senator from \nWest Virginia as well. I wonder how much time he would intend to take. \nI have no objection to splitting the time. But if it going to come off \nour side, then I would ask for some consideration.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not want to discommode either side. I \ncould delay until another day to do the speech. I wanted to speak with \nreference to Mr. Heflin's retirement. I thought in view of the fact \nthat nothing was transpiring I might be able to use that time. But it \nreally is all right with me if Senators prefer that I not do that.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may respond, I, too, would enjoy hearing a little \nreference to Senator Heflin very much. Perhaps, if I may inquire again. \nThere is no time on the other side on this amendment. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 7 minutes 39 \nseconds.\n  Mr. REID. I had 9 minutes a little while ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has been running.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if the senior Senator from West Virginia will \nallow me to speak against the amendment. As chairman of the Energy \nCommittee I take the opportunity to do so, and I would be happy to \nyield the remaining time to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am very sensitive to the concerns of the Senator \nfrom Nevada about the issue of nuclear waste policy. However, I must \nrise in opposition to the amendment because I honestly feel a trust is \nabout to be broken if indeed funds that have been collected by \nAmerica's nuclear utility system for the benefit of a specific purpose \nof establishing a repository for this Nation's nuclear waste are used \nfor a purpose other than intended.\n  It is my understanding that the amendment offered by the Senator from \nNevada does just that, that $14,700,000 of funds that were collected by \nthe utilities from the ratepayers are to be used for a purpose other \nthan that which is intended. In 1982 when Congress adopted the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act, it required the Department of Energy to build a \nrepository that could accept spent fuel from commercial nuclear \nreactors at a repository by the year 1998. Unfortunately, that \ncommitment has not been made nor directed by Congress. However, the DOE \nentered into contracts with the Nation's nuclear utilities under which \nthe Department collected a fee of one-tenth of 1 percent per kilowatt-\nhour on electricity generated by nuclear energy in return for a \ncommitment to accept waste beginning in 1998.\n  If the Reid amendment passes today, that commitment will be broken. \nThe fee is collected by utilities from their ratepayers in their \nmonthly bills and it is placed in a special Nuclear Waste Fund in the \nTreasury. The fund receives over $\\1/2\\ billion per year from \ncollections and $300 million per year in interest on the unobligated \nbalance. At this time the fund has a balance of $4.9 billion.\n  The Department of Energy has acknowledged that they will be unable to \nmeet their obligations to begin accepting waste in 1998. For this \nreason, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources is considering \nlegislation to restructure the nuclear waste program so that the \nGovernment will not have to default on its contractual obligations to \nthe American people.\n  I cannot now tell you exactly what that form of nuclear waste \ndisposal program will take and what it will consist of. However, I know \nfor a fact that it will be very expensive. The Nuclear Waste Fund was \ncollected from the Nation's ratepayers for the specific purpose of \ndisposing of spent nuclear fuel. It cannot be allowed to be used for \nany other purpose, and that specifically is what the Reid amendment \nwill do.\n  So I must stand in opposition to the amendment.\n  I see no further Senator wishing to speak. I would accommodate the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia, and yield the remaining time that we \nhave on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator yielding the remaining time to \nthe Senator from West Virginia?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I have been advised that there is a Senator from this \nside who wants to be heard on this issue, the senior Senator from New \nMexico. So I must advise my friend from West Virginia that I must \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well. I understand.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak on another \nmatter and that the time not be charged to anybody; that I speak out of \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  [[Page S4906]] Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object--and, of \ncourse, I will not object, I am wondering how long the Senator intends \nto speak, approximately?\n  Mr. BYRD. I do not think I will go beyond 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/30/senate-section/article/S4890-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SENATOR HOWELL HEFLIN\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on October 28, 1919, the National \nProhibition Act, also known as the Volstead Act, was passed by Congress \nover President Wilson's veto of the previous day. The act defined as \nintoxicating, any liquor containing at least one-half of one percent \nalcohol, and provided for enforcement of the provisions of the \nEighteenth Amendment.\n  This singular event was to usher in the colorful era of the 1920's, \nwith its flapper girls, its bathtub gin, and its legendary mobster \nfigures. In 1920, the U.S. Census recorded a population of 105,710,620. \nThe center of the population was judged to be 8 miles south, south-east \nof Spencer, in Owen County, Indiana. In 1920, for the first time, the \ntotal number of farm residents dwindled to less than 50 percent. It was \na very different world.\n  This was the age into which, on June 19, 1921, Howell Heflin was \nborn. The son of a Methodist minister, Senator Heflin is then, the \nchild of a slower, more rural America--the kind of America into which I \nwas born 4 years earlier--an era when there was always time to \nappreciate charm and wit in individuals and careful, considered, \njudgment in leaders.\n  Will Rogers came to prominence in the 1920's. Radio flourished as an \nentertainment medium in the late 1920's and early 1930's. It was an era \nwhen events and ideas were savored, talked about, discussed on the \nfront porch and over the Sunday supper table. The humor was more wry \nthan malicious, and taking a day or two to think about something was \nconsidered the norm. Howell Heflin is a product of those times, and a \nproduct of the South and his beautiful home state of Alabama.\n  His temperament is uniquely suited to the judiciary. He thinks about \nthings carefully. Howell turns things over in his mind to see how they \nlook from all sides. He speaks slowly. He measures his words, and he \nspices his statements with rich Southern tales and the folksy lore of \nAlabama.\n  And Howell Heflin's life has been nearly as rich and varied as his \nmannerisms and his speech. He graduated from Birmingham-Southern \nCollege and the University of Alabama Law School in 1948. This was the \nbeginning of Howell's fabulous legal career\n in Alabama. Howell Heflin went on to become President of the Alabama \nState Bar in 1966. He took the oath of Chief Justice of the Supreme \nCourt of Alabama in 1971, and, in 1975, Judge Heflin was selected the \nmost outstanding appellate judge in the United States. When Howell left \nthe bench in 1977, there was no congestion and no backlog of cases in \nany of Alabama's courts, either trial or appellate. In 1978, Howell \nHeflin went on to cap an already notable career with election to the \nUnited States Senate.\n\n  Now serving his third and final term in the Senate, Senator Heflin is \nsurely one of the most beloved Members of this body. He is a man to be \ntrusted. He will take on a difficult task and bring it to conclusion \nwith honor. Howell Heflin will not rush to judgment. I have tried to \nget him to on a few occasions, but I could not get him to rush to \njudgment. He does not leap to conclusions, or bow to pressures. It was \nfor those reasons that I, as majority leader, appointed him chairman of \nthe Senate Ethics Committee, a job that is anything but coveted in this \nbody, but which demands unusual qualities of character and honor. And \nHowell Heflin is an honorable man. I am sure he did not enjoy the task, \nbut he was perfect for the job because he is impeccably honorable as \nfew men are.\n  Yet Howell Heflin is never pompous, never self-important, never \nponderous or heavy with his viewpoints or pronouncements. He colors it \nall with his legendary humor, putting a light and artful touch on \nnearly everything with which he is involved. I have so wondered at the \ngenesis of this delightful quality in Senator Heflin that I recently \ndid a little background research on an uncle of Howell's, Senator \nThomas J. Heflin, who served the State of Alabama in the U.S. Senate in \nthe 1920's. I find that the delightful sense of humor appears to have \ngenetic roots.\n  I now read from volume II of my own history of the United States \nSenate. And I read from page 137. I read from the chapter on \nfilibusters. There was a filibuster going on in 1922. It had to do with \na bill which was being filibustered by certain Senators in late \nFebruary.\n\n       By late February, there was no longer any doubt that the \n     obstructionists could and would keep the filibuster going \n     until sine die adjournment at noon on March 4, throttling \n     other legislation in the process. In the face of this threat, \n     Senator Jones and the administration forces capitulated on \n     February 28 by moving to take up a so-called filled milk \n     bill, thus displacing the ship subsidy bill. In the words of \n     Alabama Senator J. Thomas Heflin, the ``miserable measure'' \n     had ``gone to its long, last sleep.'' It was ``already \n     dead.''\n\n  That sounds very much like Howell Heflin.\n  And on page 138, we read of another filibuster that was occurring in \nthe spring of 1926. This was\n\n       . . . a filibuster was conducted against legislation for \n     migratory bird refuges, but the bill died after an effort to \n     invoke cloture failed. Legislation for development of the \n     Lower Colorado River Basin suffered a similar fate when, on \n     February 26, 1927, cloture was rejected by a vote of 32 to \n     59. Two days later, however, the Senate did invoke cloture on \n     a Prohibition reorganization bill, although a final vote on \n     the bill was delayed for almost two days by the opponents of \n     a resolution extending the life of a committee that was \n     investigating charges of corrupt senatorial elections in \n     Illinois and Pennsylvania. As Franklin Burdette, author of \n     the study of filibusters, observed, ``filibusterers against \n     one measure had been able to make cloture against another \n     serve their purposes for nearly two days!'' At one point, \n     Senator J. Thomas Heflin of Alabama--who, incidentally, was--\n\n  As I say, in my book\n\n       --an uncle of our own colleague and friend from Alabama, \n     Senator Howell Heflin--ridiculed ``obstreperous Republican \n     filibusterers''--\n\n  This is Senator J. Thomas Heflin talking\n\n       --ridiculed ``obstreperous Republican filibusterers'' for \n     obstructing action on the resolution for campaign \n     investigations. ``You are saying in your hearts,'' he \n     declared with fine sarcasm:\n       Committee, spare that campaign boodle tree,\n       Touch not a single bow;\n       In election times it shelters me,\n       You must not harm it now.\n\n  Well, I can just hear Howell Heflin saying that. That is just about \nthe way he would say it, except he would say it better than I said it.\n  I can hear Senator Howell Heflin saying something very much like that \nright today, should the proper kind of vexation come along.\n  I salute my friend and colleague, and I regret his decision to leave \nthis body. I salute him for his character, for his wit, for his \nsteadfast determination to follow his own star, to refuse to be \nhurried, to study and to deliberate until he is satisfied and at peace \nwith his conclusion. I salute him for taking his time in a world which \ndemands that everyone hurry. I salute him for his courage. This is a \nman who will be himself, and there is certainly no one else he would \nrather be. He is an Alabama original, and I regret that, in not too \nmany months, Alabama will reclaim him.\n  But we here in the Senate will have enjoyed his wit, benefited by his \nwisdom, and been inspired by his integrity when that time is come. And \njust as we are certain in our knowledge that all excellent things must \ncome to a close, we will not begrudge him his time to go home, to be \nwith his lovely wife, Mike, and to contemplate with peace and pleasure \nthe seasons' change in the rolling hills of Alabama.\n  My wife, Erma, and I join in these warm felicitations for Howell and \nhis wife, Mike.\n\n     Nature's first green is gold.\n     Her hardest hue to hold.\n     Her early leaf's a flower;\n     But only so an hour.\n     Then leaf subsides to leaf.\n     So Eden sank to grief,\n     So dawn goes down to day.\n     Nothing gold can stay.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/30/senate-section/article/S4906-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4907-S4919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S4907]]\n\n               EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 12 minutes 5 \nseconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I think the Senator from New Mexico wants to speak and \nthe Senator from Idaho wants to speak. May I ask how much time he would \nlike? There are 12 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Craig wants 2 minutes. I will take the other \n10. I may not use it all.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to make that accommodation. The Senator \nfrom New Mexico has 10 minutes, and there are 2 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n10 minutes and the Senator from Idaho has 1 minute 31 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes of that time, \nso the Chair might advise me, if you would.\n  I was not here when my friend from Nevada argued this matter, but let \nme suggest to the U.S. Senate that this is not an issue tonight of \nwhether we ought to spend money on programs to which the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada wants to add money.\n  What we are talking about tonight is a very basic principle of \nfairness and equity to a large number of ratepayers, utility ratepayers \nacross America, many in the State of the present occupant of the chair, \nPennsylvania, some in almost every State in the East, because wherever \nthere is nuclear power, there is a small percentage attached to their \nbills that goes into a nuclear waste fund.\n  Mr. President, by law, that money is supposed to be used by the U.S. \nGovernment to make sure that we prepare and implement and open a \nnuclear waste repository as the final destination of the end of the \nnuclear fuel cycle, wherein waste will be put forever.\n  Whether that was prudent or not is irrelevant. The truth of the \nmatter is that millions of ratepayers have been putting the money in \nthat account.\n  The Congress of the United States decided that we needed to make sure \nthat that money was spent properly. So we did not just set the trust \nfund out there and say, ``Have at it, Department of Energy, use it for \nnuclear waste disposal implementation program or plan.'' We said, \n``Let's appropriate what they need annually from that fund.''\n  Frankly, the utilities are clamoring, they are coming to see me as \nchairman of this subcommittee saying, ``Don't appropriate the money \nanymore.'' They are saying, ``Make it an entitlement and let us and the \nDepartment of Energy spend it as we may.''\n  We have refused as a Congress, and I can tell the Senate, I have \nstood there saying I will refuse to do that, I will raise a point of \norder under the Budget Act. We must control that money.\n  Now plain and simple, we have appropriated money for the nuclear \nwaste disposal activities in the State of Nevada. Senator Reid, a dear \nfriend of mine, has resisted the nuclear waste disposal activities in \nhis State. And if I were he, I would do that.\n  But the point of it is, we do not even have enough money appropriated \nnow to carry on the research and site characterization for which that \nfund was allocated and set up in trust. But because we have \nappropriated some of the money and it is appropriated for the year \n1995, along comes Senator Reid who would like very much, I assume, to \ntell the people in his State, and if I were he, I would do the same, I \nhave taken some money away from that nasty activity that we do not want \nin our State anyway, but the Congress has said, that is the State, that \nis the site.\n  Tonight, just a little bit, he would like to take $13 million of that \nappropriated money, and it is really kind of a unique appropriation \nbecause it could just as well have been left in trust and spent only \nfor that purpose, but we decided to control it through appropriations.\n  Now, why should the Senate of the United States, in a rescission \nbill, take money out of that trust fund that has been appropriated for \nthat purpose and spend it on any program? I am not even going to debate \nwhether the programs he wants to fund are good programs. I am not even \ngoing to debate whether they are good programs that he would like to \nadd money to. Knowing the distinguished Senator, they are probably good \nprograms that, somehow or another, he ought to find money for, if he \nthinks that money should be added to them. Maybe if he finds it \nsomeplace else, the Senate will vote for it.\n  But I hope tonight we will not send a signal to the millions of \nutility users in America who paid a surtax, a little piece of their \nutility bill, and put it in a trust for nuclear waste disposal and all \nof a sudden find themselves tonight, in the U.S. Senate at 10 minutes \nof 9, and we are going to take $13 million of that fund and pay for \nsome social programs that may be needed.\n  It is the wrong thing to do, the wrong way to legislate. I regret to \nsay that as much as I respect the senior Senator from Nevada, this \nreally should not be something that we should ask the U.S. Senate to \ndo. There ought to be a resounding ``no.'' That money is not for this. \nIt was never intended for this. If you do not use it for nuclear waste \ndisposal, set it there until you find a nuclear waste activity that you \ncan use it for. We are spending billions of dollars to try to make the \nsite the right one and use it properly, and we still do not know how \nmuch it is going to cost. Would we not look foolish if, in hindsight, \nwe said all of that is true, but we tonight plucked $13 million out of \nit and put it into some social programs that somebody thinks we need?\n  I yield the floor. Senator Craig wants to speak on the issue, and I \nwelcome his remarks.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I, too, stand in opposition to Senator \nReid's amendment this evening. I think the Senator from New Mexico and \nthe Senator from Alaska, who is chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, has outlined very clearly what this money is \nintended for, where it comes from, and the commitment of the U.S. \nCongress to the ratepayers of a variety of utilities around the \ncountry, that we would use this money in a responsible fashion to \nattempt to site and develop a permanent repository for high-level \nnuclear waste.\n  I do not blame the Senator from Nevada for being concerned that the \nCongress of the United States chose Nevada--Federal land in the State \nof Nevada for that waste to be located on. This money is now going for \nthe purpose of siting. But to pull it off into substance abuse would \nnot only be an embarrassment for this Congress to all of the \nratepayers, it would just flat be wrong.\n  The citizens of my State have something at stake here. We have \nnuclear materials that would be destined for Yucca Mountain in Nevada \nif it were to become a permanent repository. But I tell you now, Mr. \nPresident, when we have the kind of money that the ratepayers of this \ncountry are now paying, in the billions of dollars, for the purpose of \nestablishing a permanent repository for high-level nuclear waste, and \nto play games with it on the floor of the U.S. Senate is to break a \ncommitment and to break a resolve that this country has to have to deal \nwith nuclear waste in a responsible fashion for all of our people, not \njust for the States that have nuclear reactors generating nuclear \nelectricity, and the repositories and the waste materials that are \nbuilding up there. This is a national commitment. It ought to be \ndirected to where it was dedicated, to the pledge of this Congress, and \nnot sapped away, pulled away for the purpose of substance abuse. It \nmakes no sense.\n  I hope the Senate will oppose the Reid amendment.\n  Mr. REID. How much time does the Senator from Nevada have, Mr. \nPresident?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 7 minutes 20 \nseconds. The Senator from New Mexico has 2 minutes 47 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am glad he has 2 minutes, but how does \nthat work?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico did not use his \nentire 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we would look foolish tonight if we in fact \ndid not do this. All the money, the $393 million, is not all \nratepayers' money. \n[[Page S4908]] Even if it were, it is appropriated dollars. We have the \nright as a Congress to do with those moneys what we want, or it would \nnot be appropriated. The only games being played, I say, Mr. President, \nare with the utilities and these dollars. I have gone over very clearly \nand closely what this money would be used for. I think the fact that I \nwent over the one program called HACES, where the Hispanic students' \nrate of dropout was lowered by 75 percent; their absenteeism, 73 \npercent; their interest in higher education increased by 300 percent; \nsatisfactory academic progress reported in 94 percent of the students.\n  The fact of the matter is, these programs work. We should give this \nmoney to people who need it. We are talking about cutting nuclear waste \nmoney for the year 1995. They cannot spend all that money anyway. They \nincreased it $130 million this year, a total of $393 million, almost a \nhalf a billion dollars. We are asking to take less than 3 percent of \nthat money and put it into programs that save people's lives, save the \nfamily structure, help neighbors and friends, keep people out of \nprisons, out of welfare programs, help our educational system. This \nmoney will come back to us a thousandfold, if not more.\n  These programs work. We talk about an investment of $85,000 in foster \ncare costs. The family preservation program. These programs serve, as I \nindicated, families--42 families in Nevada--and 100 percent of these \nfamilies lose their children if they do not comply with the program. We \nfound that the program had a 90 percent success rate.\n  So I say, Mr. President, I think if we should talk about the merits \nof what we are doing here tonight, not some abstract thing about the \nratepayers and nuclear waste. They need the money. One of the biggest, \nmost wasteful programs in the history of America is a program that \nstarted out to cost us $200 million and is now up to an estimated $7.4 \nbillion. We are talking about taking $14.7 million and giving it to a \nprogram that saves lives, lives of real human beings.\n  These are not programs that some bureaucrat in Washington said, ``Let \nus see if they will work.'' I have given statistics to the U.S. Senate \ntonight to indicate why the programs have worked and how it is a \nterrible thing that this Congress is going to say these programs are \ngone. We are going to wipe out these programs.\n  So I say, for this small amount of money, we would look foolish if we \ndid not do it. And we would be playing games if we did not give needy \npeople programs that save money. This is a taxpayers' relief amendment, \nMr. President.\n  I hope this will receive bipartisan support. This is not a partisan \nmatter. This is a matter that relates to the welfare of people \nthroughout the United States.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time does Senator Reid have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 28 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much does the Senator from New Mexico have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 47 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will use a minute and a half of my \ntime and ask that the remainder be reserved.\n  There are 109 nuclear reactors in the United States--67 sites in 32 \nStates. By the year 2030, all these reactors will have completed their \ninitial 40-year licenses. The total cumulative discharge from these 109 \nreactors, some of which are shut down, will total 85,000 metric tons of \nradioactive waste. The trust fund that is set aside by the ratepayers \nwho use that energy, that nuclear energy, is not taxpayers' money. Let \nme repeat. It is not taxpayers' money. It is trust funded to see if we \ncan find a way to, in a safe manner, get rid of this nuclear waste, \neither for long periods of time, or permanently.\n  It does not matter very much whether there is a social program that \nworks well. I will attest that the programs he is alluding to are \nworking better than the nuclear waste disposal programs. Anybody will \nsay that. We are in the midst of trying to find out how to do it.\n To take $13 million out and say we have a good program going and take \nit from the ratepayers of Missouri, Pennsylvania, and New York, who \nhave nuclear activities, is just not right.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 109 new nuclear reactors do not make up the \nimportance of one human life. We are dealing with real people, \nfamilies, children, friends, neighbors, aunts, uncles, children, \ntragedies like the loss to Carol O'Connor we read about in the \nnewspaper today.\n  Rehabilitation programs, some of them work. We have programs that \nreally work. Nuclear waste disposal is not going to be affected as a \nresult of this. We are taking a pittance into real programs. We should \ncontinue to do that, Mr. President. We are talking about equity and \nfairness for ratepayers.\n  We live in a world of polls. I bet we could take a poll of the money \nthat is in this fund, and most of it is in from ratepayers, and that \nmoney, if we ask the ratepayers whether they would have the money \ndigging a hole in Nevada or saving one kid, I guarantee how the poll \nwould turn out.\n  I submit to this body that this is a vote for equity and fairness. We \nare rescinding $14.7 million that goes into saving lives, making \nstreets safer, and in the long run and short run saving this country \n1,000 times what we invest with $14.7 million in lower cost for \neducation, lower cost for welfare, lower cost for law enforcement.\n  We should pass this amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President I yield myself 30 seconds. I would like \nto remind my colleagues that the U.S. Government has made a solemn \ncompact with customers of these utilities.\n  As the Senator from New Mexico said, and he was absolutely correct, \nit is not the taxpayers, it is the recipients who participated through \ntheir utility bills, and they pay into this nuclear waste fund.\n  The Federal Government must use these moneys only for the purpose of \ntaking care of nuclear waste. That is a trust that was entered into. It \nis up to the Government and this body to honor that trust.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, a vote for the Reid amendment is a vote \nto say that the 32 States which have accumulated high-level nuclear \nwaste are not concerned about how we will take care of that. We are \njust going to take $13 million that ought to be used ultimately for \nthem, those 32 States, and spend it on two social programs that may or \nmay not be working, but seem to not be the issue before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Reid has 1 minute 54 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we will talk about the equity. I hope this \ndoes not become a partisan issue. The people being served by the \nsubstance abuse programs are not Democrats and Republicans. They are \npeople who are, many times, causing significant problems throughout \ntheir neighborhoods, throughout the States. If these programs are cut, \nit will be more crime, more welfare dependence, and more problems with \nour educational system.\n  The Ridge House Program, as I indicated, tracked reincarceration for \nindividuals and found the program had a recidivism rate of 22 percent \nafter 3 years. That is as much as 400 percent lower than people not in \nthis program.\n  This is a program where we should not rescind the money. We should \nrestore the money that was appropriated last year because it is good \nfor people. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to table the Reid amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  Under the previous order, the voting sequence will occur at a later \ntime.\n  Under the previous order the Senator from Nevada is recognized to \noffer an amendment.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 439 to Amendment No. 420\n\n   (Purpose: To restore $3,750,000 of the amount available for rural \nhealth research and $1,875,000 of the amount available for rural health \n                            outreach grants)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from New Mexico, he \nshould be aware I have another amendment where I am going to go after \nthe same money, and the Senator should be aware we might be able to cut \ndown the time because the argument is basically the same as to a \ndifferent subject.\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  [[Page S4909]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], proposes an amendment \n     numbered 439 to amendment No. 420.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent further reading be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 14, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n\n\n                      nuclear waste disposal fund\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 103-316, $5,625,000 are rescinded.\n       On page 28, line 7, strike ``, $42,071,000 are rescinded'' \n     and insert ``for programs other than the rural health \n     research program and the rural health outreach grant program, \n     $36,446,000 are rescinded''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, again, this calls for removing money from \nthe Civilian Nuclear Waste Fund and placing it in rural health outreach \nprograms. This, Mr. President, is $5.6 million.\n  Now, Mr. President, rural health outreach grants, what are they? Let \nme give an example of three we have in Nevada. Mount Grant General \nHospital, Hawthorne, NV, Mr. President, is located in one of the most \nremote areas of the United States. Hawthorne, NV, was selected in the \nlate 1920's after there was a huge explosion in a military ammunition \ndepot in the eastern part of the United States. Hawthorne, NV, was \nselected because it was such a remote area.\n  Hawthorne, NV, to say the least, is remote. From the late 1920's \nuntil today there has been ammunition stored there. To fly over \nHawthorne, NV, today, you would see hundreds and hundreds of these \nmounds and in each of them is explosives, ammunition.\n  It was the largest naval ammunition depot in the world. There was a \ndecision made by the military to join all ammunition storage to the \nArmy, and as a result of that it was no longer the largest ammunition \ndepot in the military, but it is still real big, in a very sparsely \npopulated part of the State of Nevada.\n  Part of these rural health outreach grants went to a consortium made \nup of a county hospital, a local Indian tribe, the Walker River \nIndians, and a senior citizens center to provide health promotion \ninformation to a county where there are about 6,000 Nevadans.\n  Though funded for less than a year, Mr. President, this program has \nprovided seven programs throughout Mineral County on topics including \nsexually transmitted diseases, nutrition, pharmaceutical inquiry and \nhealth screening for senior citizens. Native Americans and other rural \nNevadans have benefited from this program. This program will ultimately \nprovide transportation services and adult day care where none now is \ncurrently available. Really an important program.\n  Why? Because it is a program, again, Mr. President, in part of the \nrural America that will save money. If we can, through education, teach \npeople about disease and what happens with disease, and keep people--\nespecially senior citizens--out of long-term care, we save lots of \nmoney. That is what this program is about.\n  Owyhee Emergency Medical Service. Mr. President, Owyhee, NV, the name \ncame as a result of a group of trappers that went up in that area in \nthe early part of the last century. They never came back. They were \ntrappers from Hawaii. And Owyhee is a derivation from Hawaii. We have \nOwyhee River, Owyhee Indians. It is a very remote area.\n  It is so remote, Mr. President, that I was the first U.S. Senator to \ngo to Owyhee. They remembered a couple of Nevada U.S. Senators getting \nwithin 25 miles, near of a reservoir, but I was the first to go there \nlast September. It is a wonderful place, right off the Idaho border.\n  What we have in this very remote part of Nevada is a consortium of \nnative American Indians and an Air Force base in the neighboring State \nof Idaho and a sheriff's department. It was designed to improve \nemergency medical services to a regional community which crosses State \nlines.\n  Emergency services are vital to this area, as you have about 100 \nmiles of very mountainous roads from the nearest frontier care center \nand over 400 miles to the nearest tertiary level trauma center.\n  These are programs that really help. These are what the rural health \noutreach programs are. In Nevada, we have three programs.\n  The State of Nevada is an unusual State in the sense that about 70 \npercent of the people live in the Las Vegas area. It is a huge State, \nthe seventh-largest State in the Union, but we have the most sparsely \npopulated part of the United States but for Alaska in the northwestern \npart of the State. It is the most sparsely populated part of the United \nStates except for Alaska.\n  In Las Vegas and Reno we have very up-to-date modern medical \nfacilities, including ambulance service. But in these rural areas it is \nmuch like other parts of America. We have volunteer crews that serve in \nthese rural areas. Mostly they are trained at the basic emergency \nmedical technician level, and they ride most of the time outdated and \nmarginally equipped ambulances and are typically hundreds of miles from \neven a rural or frontier basic level hospital. Remember, frontier is \neven more remote than rural, by definition.\n  Mr. President, 13 of Nevada's 17 counties are identified as health \nprofession shortage areas.\n  Most people do not realize that Pennsylvania is a very rural State. A \nlot of places in Pennsylvania are remote. Most people, when they think \nof Pennsylvania, they think of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. But \nPennsylvania is a very rural State, much like Nevada in many instances. \nAnd rural Pennsylvania needs these Rural Health Outreach Grants that I \nguarantee are serving people very well and saving money for the people \nof the State of Pennsylvania, saving money for the taxpayers in \nPennsylvania, and certainly taxpayers all over the country. Our miles \nmay be a little longer in Nevada than Pennsylvania, but the problems \nare the same.\n  Mr. President, 25 percent of the people in America live in rural \nareas. They live in these areas and they need a mechanism to access \nprimary health care, emergency care, and hospital systems. And the \nreason I think it is so vital we understand that these programs save \nlives is let us take, for example, one of the matters that would be \ncovered in this nonrescission that I hope would occur that deals with \nrural health research funds, including rural telemedicine grants.\n  Rural telemedicine is not something that is abstract. What it means \nis someone in Battle Mountain, NV, could, through a television hookup \nat a health center in this rural community, be in contact with the \nWashoe County Medical Center, a first-rate medical center in Reno, NV. \nAnd a physician in Reno could be talking to a patient in Battle \nMountain and watching that patient on television with a rural doctor \npresent, and describing where they hurt, what the symptoms are. And \nthat expert in Reno very likely could help that rural physician \nidentify the problem. Or, if, after having gone through this procedure, \nseparated by hundreds of miles, the physician in the major medical \ncenter says, I think you better bring him in, bring her in.\n  The fact is, this is going on in Pennsylvania. It is going on in New \nMexico. It is going on in places all over America. If we do not put \nthese moneys back that have been rescinded, these programs are going to \nbe terminated. It will suspend or terminate the completion of \ntelemedicine projects underway all across the Nation.\n  These are relatively new programs and these programs are not fluff. \nThese are not programs, again, that some bureaucrat in Washington \ndreamed up. These are programs where there have been pilot projects in \neffect prior to our appropriating these moneys. We know they work and \nwe know they save money. Again, if we can keep someone out of the \nhospital or long-term care settings we save money--Medicare, Medicaid, \nand private dollars. So we need to reestablish the Rural Health \nOutreach Grants that have been rescinded. Taking these moneys from the \nCivilian Nuclear Waste Fund is not going to affect the ratepayers. It \nis not going to affect the progress at Yucca Mountain at all. The other \nprogram was about 3 percent; this is about 1 percent of nuclear waste \nmoneys for this year.\n  [[Page S4910]] So I hope my colleagues would understand, again, that \nthe program I wish to have the money restored to is a program that \ndeals with people, with flesh and bones. The only thing, they do not \nlive in the big cities. And we need in this modern era to allow them to \nbe part of what is happening throughout urban America. They can do that \nwith telemedicine and some of these other outreach programs.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 20 minutes, \nthe Senator from Nevada has 9 minutes and 20 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The chairman of the Energy Committee, Senator \nMurkowski, wants 2 minutes. I will not use all of my time, I say to the \nSenator. If he could consider using less than all of his time, I will \nyield back some of mine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, again I must rise in opposition to the \nReid amendment for the same reason prevailing on the previous Reid \namendment. While the Senator from Nevada makes a very appealing case \nfor the utilization of these funds, I must remind him again that there \nis a principle here, an underlying principle of trust, and that trust \nmust be honored.\n  Mr. President, what we are talking about here again is a solemn \ncompact, with the customers of these nuclear utilities who have paid \namounts into the waste fund, that the Federal Government will use these \nmoneys only for the purpose of taking care of nuclear waste.\n  We cannot meet other obligations, regardless of how worthy they might \nbe. Diverting those funds is simply not fair to the customers of those \nutilities nor is diverting those funds fair to Americans everywhere.\n  This nuclear waste must be disposed of. It will not just go away. \nWithout these moneys, the nuclear waste simply will not be cleaned up. \nIt is an obligation we all have.\n  Mr. President, what the Senator from Nevada is proposing is making \neveryone else in America pay for the cleanup of nuclear waste that is \nbasically already paid for one time by the ratepayers.\n  Further, there have been no hearings on this matter. We really do not \nunderstand the impact of the Senator's amendment other than it would \nvoid a portion of the funds that have been paid in by well-meaning \nratepayers, based on the trust and confidence they have in the Federal \nGovernment to keep its word.\n  I am very concerned the Senator's amendment will do grave harm to the \ncleanup and the disposal of nuclear waste.\n  I yield back my time remaining to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the ratepayers of the United States have \npaid over $8 billion into a trust fund. The money is supposed to be \nused to take care of nuclear waste. We have already spent substantial \namounts, much of it in the State of Nevada, trying to prove up a site \nfor permanent storage, that is the forever storage. There is now $5.5 \nbillion in the trust fund.\n  Let me draw a couple of analogies for Senators. We appropriate for \nthe administrative costs of Social Security from the Social Security \ntrust fund. So now we have an appropriation bill for the 1995 year, and \nit has $542 million for the administrative costs of Social Security \nfrom the trust fund, paid in by workers and employers in America. \nSomebody comes to the floor and says, ``I have an amendment. There is a \nwhole bunch of social programs we would like to take care of, so let us \ntake part of this $542 million trust fund that we allocated to \nadminister and manage Social Security and let us spend it for one of \nthese two good programs that the Senator has in mind.''\n  What would happen? First of all, I do not think anyone would do it \nbecause it is Social Security trust funds.\n  Mr. President, this trust fund is owned by millions, just like Social \nSecurity, of ratepayers who are paying higher utility bills because \nthey expect the money to be used to dispose of nuclear waste.\n  Mr. President, we appropriate highway user funds. So people pay \ngasoline taxes into a trust fund for highways. Then we have to \nappropriate to take care of the contract obligations. Would anyone come \nto the floor, and, as part of a rescissions package say, ``There is a \nlot of money in this trust fund for highways collected from the \ngasoline tax; there is a little more than we know how to use for the \nhighways, so let us spend it for one of these two programs that the \nSenator has in mind?'' Actually, this trust fund that I am speaking of \nis a better case on spending trust funds improperly than either of the \ntwo that I have given you.\n  The Senator in combination would ask us tonight to take $20.325 \nmillion heretofore appropriated from this trust fund being used to \nproceed in as orderly a manner as we can put together for nuclear waste \nactivities and spend it on two or three programs that the Senator can \nrightfully stand up and say, if you took the money out of there, it \nwould do some good.\n  My final observation is this is about $5.5 billion left in this trust \nfund. Friends, we could just all figure out each year when we put this \nmoney into an appropriations mode, some social or welfare or citizen \nneed, and we could come to the floor and say, I want to move it from \nthat appropriation to this appropriation, and then give us a nice \ninteresting litany and discourse on how well the program money would be \nused for these programs.\n  I choose tonight not to discuss the programs. Rural health care, no. \nWe ought to try things. Perhaps that is what the Senator wants to do. \nAnd a few other programs. There are a lot of things we ought to spend \nmoney on. But we do not have the money, and certainly we do not have \nthe money in the Nuclear Waste Fund to spend for this when it is \nalready committed. We may not even have enough money in that trust \nfund.\n  Incidentally, Mr. President, we may have to go back to these \nratepayers and say we have used your money, and we need some more. Will \nit not be nice to say, by the way, one evening in the Senate, we took \n$20 million away and spent it for something else?\n  I do not need any more time. I am prepared to yield back, and I do \nyield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may respond, I recognize the time is \narriving to 9:30. I would like to meet that deadline.\n  Mr. President, Senators tonight are acting as a court of fairness. \nWhat is the fair thing to do? We have talked about ratepayers. Let us \ntalk about taxpayers. This $5.5 billion that is in this fund, we are \ntalking about with this amendment taking $5.5 million and giving it to \nprograms that benefit America, 25 percent of the people who live in \nplaces all over the country similar to the chairman of this committee--\nAlaska, Nevada. We think of those States as rural. But other States all \nover America --New York--have rural areas. We need to help rural \nAmericans regarding their health care.\n  Mr. President, the chairman of the subcommittee raises a good point. \nWhat if people come here and want to spend $5.5 billion in some other \nprogram? I was very careful in selecting the programs where I am asking \nthat the rescissions not take place. I could have picked WIC, Head \nStart, Safe and Drug-Free Schools, AmeriCorps, very large amounts. But \nI chose these very small extremely beneficial programs.\n  We tonight should be concerned about taxpayers, not ratepayers. We \nshould be concerned about doing something that is going to save this \ncountry large amounts of money. And all the money that is wasted with \nthe DOE, they will not even know this is gone, $130 million additional \nmoneys the year, 1995, a total of almost $400 million. This is money \nthat we should not have rescinded.\n  I ask my colleagues to understand the importance of these programs--\nagain, I repeat--to real persons, men and women and children who have \ndone nothing wrong. They live in rural America. They need to be made \nmodern. That is what we are doing with these rural health outreach \nprograms.\n\n[[Page S4911]]\n\n                           amendment no. 429\n\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity today to \nspeak in support of the Gorton emergency salvage amendment and in \nopposition to the substitute amendment proposed by the junior Senator \nfrom Washington.\n  We have heard a lot of talk today about how these are the people's \nforests. These forests are a national treasure. We must maintain these \nforests for our future generations.We must not be allowed to destroy \nthem. Mr. President, I could not agree more. But by maintaining the \nstatus quo--and by that I mean the continued lack of any management \nactivity--we are doing just that. We are now destroying our forests as \nwe sit idly by and do nothing.\n  I do not believe the average citizen would approve of the state of \ndeterioration of our forests. For example, the eastside forests of \nOregon and Washington alone have lost 135,000 acres of forest to \ninsects or disease. Another 543,000 acres are imperiled by insects and \ndisease if not treated aggressively. These are Forest Service figures. \nAnd these figures do not include the threat of loss due to wildfire, \nwhich is an ever-increasing reality.\n  Mr. President, in the first 3 months of 1995, four more Oregon mills \nhave closed and two more have given their 60-day notice to employees. \nThese are mills that rely on timber from Federal lands, and without \nthat supply, they just can't make it. I could quote statistic after \nstatistic about how many people are directly and indirectly affected by \nthese closures. But these people are more than statistics. They are \nreal people. They have families to feed and clothe. Kids to send to \ncollege. Car payments. House payments. Braces and medical bills. They \nare people like you and me who are being displaced from good jobs for \nno good or rational reason.\n  In many cases the mill is the backbone of the community--if the mill \ncloses, the entire town is affected. In many cases the Federal forest \nland that once provided raw material for these mills is literally \nwithin walking distance of the mill. These people have personally \nwatched these forests get sick and die because of misguided Federal \npolicy. They have urged Federal land management agencies, in vain, to \ndo something about the deteriorating conditions. These are people who \nhave fought the rampaging forest fires that creep ever closer to their \nhomes and towns. These are frustrated people who don't understand why \ntheir government will not let them salvage dead and dying timber to \nkeep their mills and the forests alive. And I share their frustration.\n  The forest health problem in Oregon has reached a crisis state. There \nare hundreds of thousands of acres of dead and dying trees, surrounded \nby huge fuel loads on the forest floor, just waiting to be ignited. \nCongress can no longer stand idly by, fiddling while our forests burn. \nWe are one errant match--or one random lightning strike--away from a \ncatastrophic conflagration that would blacken hillsides in parts of my \nState for as far as the eye can see. We can remove this dead material, \nprovide some small measure of hope to our timber families, and start \nreturning or forests to their green and healthy state.\n  Too many family-wage jobs have been clearcut and replanted with \nminimum-wage jobs. The time has come for an aggressive salvage program \nthat will give our forests--and our people--hope. I believe the people \nof this country want vital, healthy forests. I strongly urge a vote to \ntable this amendment.\n                           amendment no. 429\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to Senator \nGorton's timber salvage provision to this rescission bill, and in \nsupport of Senator Murray's alternative language.\n  The language currently in the bill mandates the expeditious sale of \nsalvage timber without concern for the cost to the Federal Treasury, \nwithout concern for market demand, without concern for sound \nenvironmental practices, and without concern for citizen and judicial \ninvolvement.\n  This is old fashioned politics. It is a giveaway which will enrich \none industry and impoverish a Nation of its natural resources.\n  Mr. President, at a time when we are trying to reinvent government, \nthis is not the way to do business. Senator Gorton's provision would \nresult in a dramatic change in the Federal Government's approach to \ntimber management and sale--without appropriate review by the Senate \nand the public.\n  The language approved by the committee is an assault on our Nation's \nnatural resources, an assault on sound science, an assault on existing \nlaws, and an assault on the Senate's legislative process.\n  The existing provision assumes that there is a forest health crisis \ndue to insects, disease, and fires. The timber industry feels that \nsalvaging the diseased and dying trees is crucial to forest health. \nOthers feel that much of what salvage logging would remove is actually \ncrucial to the forest ecosystem. Obviously, this is a scientific matter \nthat should best be left to the experts, or to comprehensive, fair \nhearings in committees--certainly not fast-track fixes on a rescission \nbill.\n  The language in Senator Gorton's provision suspends virtually every \nmajor environmental law, including, but not limited to, the Forest and \nRangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act; the Federal Land Policy \nManagement Act; the National Environmental Policy Act; the National \nForest Management Act; the Endangered Species Act, and the Multiple-Use \nSustained Yield Act.\n  This is not sound policy and could be disastrous to our Nation's \nforests.\n  That is why I support Senator Murray's amendment to the bill. Senator \nMurray's proposal is a balanced approach to this contentious issue. It \nexpedites sales of timber salvage, which should satisfy the timber \ninterests. But at the same time it respects existing law, excludes \nFederal lands that should not be touched, limits the definition of \nsalvage sale, and allows for citizen and judicial involvement.\n  In all honesty, I would prefer a bill with no provision addressing \ntimber salvage. This bill is not the place for such a provision, \nparticularly one that will result in a steep cost to the Federal \nTreasury.\n  I commend the junior Member from Washington for stepping into a \nleadership role, and developing a sound compromise to this very \ndifficult issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would like to commend my colleague \nSenator Gorton's efforts to expedite timber salvage in the amendment to \nH.R. 1158, the bill now before us. I would also like to comment on the \nprovisions of the amendment referring to the Endangered Species Act.\n  The timely and efficient salvage of burned timber is of great concern \nto me and to my home State of Idaho. The catastrophic forest fires that \nswept across the West last summer cost our Nation much in terms of \nlives, property, habitat, and economic resources.\n  Idaho suffered the greatest timber loss of any State--over 1.5 \nbillion board feet--enough timber to build over 137,000 homes, and to \nprovide jobs for up to 35,000 people.\n  The timber damaged in those fires has a limited 2 year window of \nopportunity for harvest, before the value of that wood is lost, and \nthose economic resources are lost as well.\n  Yet some groups are already announcing their intent to appeal, even \nbefore most of the salvage sales have been proposed. This is despite \nthe need for quick action, and despite the fact that the Forest Service \nhas already determined that the majority of the fire-damaged areas will \nnot be harvested. This has been done to address habitat, water quality \nand other important environmental concerns.\n  Two National Forests in Idaho were hardest hit by the fires--the \nPayette and the Boise National Forest. On the Payette, less than 10 \npercent of the burned timber is being considered for salvage. And on \nthe Boise, they are considering less than half.\n  As I noted, most of these sales are still in the proposal stages. But \none, the Boise River fire recovery effort, has been available for \nappeal for a week. Already, the Forest Service has received one appeal. \nKeep in mind that the window for appeals will run until May 1 for the \nBoise River recovery sale, and most appeals will not be submitted until \ncloser to the deadline.\n  [[Page S4912]] We're running into delays from all sides, and I am \nglad to support my colleagues' efforts to expedite the process.\n  As part of those efforts, the salvage sales amendment requires \npreparation of a single document that combines an environmental \nassessment under the National Environmental Protection Act with a \nbiological evaluation under the Endangered Species Act.\n  At another point in the timber salvage amendment there is language \nthat states production of a biological evaluation shall be deemed to \nsatisfy all applicable Federal laws, including the requirements of the \nESA.\n  Mr. President, I have seen a number of bills have been introduced in \nthis Congress that attempt to modify the ESA in particular ways. I am \nnot convinced that in every case they fully address the complex \nproblems of the ESA.\n  Further, I am concerned that they may have other, unintended \nconsequences than just the consequences they seem to affect on the \nsurface.\n  I hope that this amendment will have the intended effect of allowing \nthe salvage timber to be cut in a timely manner, and that the forests \nof Idaho will be protected from fuel load buildup. I certainly hope \nthat we can accomplish the very necessary salvage timber harvest, and \nthat we can then proceed to the very important matter of reforming the \nESA.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise against the amendment to strike \nthe Gorton salvage amendment. This amendment is an essential response \nto an emergency forest health situation on our Federal forests as \nevidenced by last year's fire season. Our committee has held oversight \nin this area, and has recognized the severity of the problem. I \nrecommend we support the Gorton amendment as an appropriate emergency \nresponse to the problem.\n  As I listen to critics of this amendment, I have come to conclude \nthat they must be discussing some other provision than the one offered \nby Senator Gorton.\n  First, they say that the Gorton amendment mandates increased salvage \ntimber sales. The Gorton amendment does not mandate timber sales, it \nprovides the administration with additional flexibility to sell salvage \nsales to the extent feasible. I trust the administration to properly \nutilize the flexibility. Opponents of the Gorton amendment apparently \ndon't trust this administration. I can't tell whether they don't want \nto rehabilitate burned forests, or whether they need individual sale \nsign-off from Forest Service Chief Jack Ward Thomas, the Secretary of \nAgriculture, and--maybe even--Vice President Gore to trust the \nadministration.\n  Second, they say that the Gorton amendment suspends all environmental \nlaws. The Gorton amendment expedites existing administrative procedures \nunder the Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy \nAct, and other measures. If the agencies successfully follow the \nexpedited procedures, their performance is deemed adequate to comply \nwith existing environmental and natural resources statues. These \nexpedited procedures are essential if we are to appropriately respond \nto the forest health emergency we face.\n  Third, they say that the Gorton amendment eliminates judicial review. \nWell it does not. The amendment provides an expedited form of judicial \nreview that has already been upheld by the Supreme Court in previous \nlitigation.\n  Fourth, they say that the Forest Service cannot meet the salvage \ntargets. Well the amendment does not have any targets. I wish it did. \nToday, the Forest Service is working on its capability statement on the \nHouse version of this amendment. There are strong indications that, \nwith the expedited procedures of the House bill--matched in pertinent \npart in the Gorton amendment--the Agency can meet the House targets and \nstill comply with the substantive requirements of existing \nenvironmental and natural resources law.\n  Fifth, they say that this amendment will cost the Treasury. This is \nfalse. The Gorton amendment has received a positive score from the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  Sixth, they say that the amendment may disrupt and actually reduce \ntimber sales. If that were true, I would expect them to strongly \nsupport the Gorton amendment. But it is not. The Gorton amendment \ncontains protective language to assure that potential environmental \nlitigants cannot disrupt other agency functions due to this amendment.\n  I have been generally perplexed by the misconceptions that accompany \nthe attacks on this amendment. But today I know why this may be the \ncase. Yesterday Senator Gorton and Congressman Charles Taylor, along \nwith Senator Craig--the author of S. 391, a measure directed at another \naspect of this problem--offered to meet with a group of activists \nopposed to both the Gorton amendment and S. 391. Together, they cleared \ntime on their calendars at 9 a.m. But they found the activists were \nmore interested in preparing for their 9:30 a.m. press conference than \nmeeting with the authors of the three provisions that they proceeded to \nlambast. That sort of interest group behavior cannot be tolerated if we \nare to continue to have informed debates in this body.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the Gorton amendment, against the \namendment to strike, and against any other modifying amendments.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from South Dakota which will allow ranchers and \ntheir livestock to stay on U.S. Forest Service land until the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act [NEPA] process is complete.\n  On December 31, 1995, roughly 4,500 grazing permits in the western \nUnited States will expire. Approximately 140 of those permits are in my \nhome State of Arizona. As part of the renewal process the Forest \nService has embarked upon a new policy of requiring NEPA compliance for \nindividual permits.\n  While we all agree that grazing should be done in an environmentally \nsensitive manner that protects the resources of our national forests, I \nam troubled by the very real possibility that the Forest Service will \nnot complete the individual NEPA analyses in time to reissue the \ngrazing permits.\n  If the permits are allowed to expire, ranchers and their cattle will \nbe forced off of Forest Service land. This would be economically \ndevastating to ranchers in many Western States where the only available \ngrazing lands are those held by the Forest Service.\n  As currently proposed, this new policy will have a serious economic \nimpact on permit holders, and will yield very little, if any, positive \nbenefits for the environment. It serves no purpose to arbitrarily \nremove a rancher only to find out that their activities were not having \nan adverse impact on the environment.\n  This type of draconian action serves neither the interest of the \nenvironment, the rancher, nor the communities which rely on ranching \nrevenues for their tax base. The amendment offered by Senator Pressler \nwill ensure that the Forest Service cannot evict ranchers and their \nlivestock from grazing allotments merely because the agency has not \ncompleted all the NEPA documentation.\n  It is my understanding that compliance with NEPA is required only for \nmajor Federal actions and, until recently, the Forest Service did not \nconsider the renewal of single grazing permits to be a major Federal \naction. Additionally, the Forest Service already conducts an \nenvironmental analysis of ranching activities during consideration of \nforest management plans.\n  Mr. President, serious questions have been raised about the Forest \nService's legal requirement to proceed with this additional \nenvironmental analysis. There are no Federal court cases requiring the \nForest Service to complete either an environmental impact statement \n[EIS] or an environmental assessment [EA] prior to the issuance of a \ngrazing authorization or term permit. Courts have held, however, that \ngrazing should continue during the period of time that the NEPA process \nis being completed.\n  Along with my colleagues from Arizona, Senator Kyl, I wrote to the \nDepartment of Agriculture asking the Department to review its new \nreissuance policy and determine if the permits could be extended until \nthe NEPA process is complete. While we have not received a response to \nthis letter, it is my understanding that the Forest \n[[Page S4913]] Service has made it clear they are unable to extend the \npermits under current law.\n  It appears that this new process for addressing the reissuance of \ngrazing permits is unnecessarily disruptive to those involved and does \nnothing to further the Forest Service obligation to promote fairness \nand proper management of public lands. For these reasons, I believe \nthat the Forest Service should extend the expiring permits pending \ncompletion of the NEPA studies.\n  Mr. President, I support the Senator's amendment and I hope the \nSenate conferees will work to retain it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today we have an opportunity to \narticulate in this rescission bill policy relating to timber salvage \nsales. It is my hope that the Senate will send a clear message to the \nForest Service that considerably more timber salvage needs to be \nharvested in the forthcoming year.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the timber harvest on national forests \nhas declined considerably during the last few years. In some cases, \nthis has been due to problems encountered in the Pacific Northwest, as \nthe logging practices of the 1980's led to inevitable clashes between \nthe timber industry and environmental organizations, and the conflict \nwas thrown into the Federal court system, which halted much of the \ntimber activity in that region. Ultimately, through the development by \nthe Clinton administration of a legally defensible compromise, some \nlight is now evident at the end of the tunnel.\n  Nonetheless, progress has not been as rapid as the timber industry \nwould have liked. And that is understandable. The pipeline of timber \nsales in the Pacific Northwest largely dried up during this period of \nlitigation, and it has been slow to recover. Simultaneously, drought, \ninsects and disease have taken a toll on other forests, resulting in \nconsiderable dead and dying timber and the associated fire danger \nthroughout the west. The frequency and intensity of forest fires \nexperienced last year were grim testament to the unacceptable situation \nthat now exists.\n  And, at the same time, the Forest Service's timber program budget has \nshrunk, reducing its ability to harvest this timber in a timely \nfashion. On many national forests, the actual harvest levels are well \nbelow the levels that have been determined by the Forest Service to be \nsustainable.\n  We now are faced with developing and instituting an appropriate \nremedy. Serious steps should be taken to identify salvage timber and \nharvest it in an expedited fashion. By doing so, we can at least \nattempt to mitigate fire damage and begin to provide needed relief to \ntimber-dependent communities.\n  Without question, the Gorton amendment to the rescission bill would \nmove more timber and expedite the salvage program. My concern is that \nthe Gorton amendment, in its understandable preoccupation with \nencouraging greater timber sales, would waive environmental laws. Given \nthe large amount of timber that could be harvested under this \namendment, and the possible affects of this harvesting on fish and \nwildlife habitat, I am uncomfortable with the wholesale waiver of \nenvironmental statutes.\n  In some cases, these laws have hindered the ability of the Forest \nService to implement a responsible timber program. Congress is actively \ntaking steps through the committees of jurisdiction to address these \ncircumstances.\n  Senator Craig has introduced legislation to establish a more \ndeliberate and timely process for dealing with forest health problems. \nI am working with him to move this bill through the appropriate \ncommittees and to the floor this year, so that we can begin to address \nforest health in a systematic, deliberate, thorough and effective \nmanner. In addition, Senator Kempthorne intends to produce legislation \nto reform the Endangered Species Act.\n  I would not be surprised if both of these bills are enacted during \nthis session of Congress.\n  I believe that enactment of authorizing legislation is the \nappropriate way to change the scope or applicability of environmental \nlaws--not ad hoc amendment of this rescission bill. Therefore, I \nsupport the amendment offered by Senator Murray which, among other \nthings, will expedite timber sales by streamlining the appeals process \nand by limiting consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service and the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service to 30 days.\n  Under the Murray amendment, salvage sales cannot be held up solely \nbecause the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries \nService claims that they do not have adequate information. Also, a \npresumption is established that timber sales offered under Option Nine \nin the Pacific Northwest meet all environmental requirements.\n  These measures should significantly improve the availability of \ntimber in that region and throughout the country. I urge my colleagues \nto vote for this amendment and hope that, if we adopt it today, it will \nbe included in the final bill that is sent to the President for \nenactment into law.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Senate-reported \nversion of the Emergency Disaster Supplemental Appropriations and \nrescission bill for fiscal year 1995.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nfor his efforts to move this bill expeditiously for Senate \nconsideration.\n  The Senate substitute provides emergency disaster assistance totaling \n$6.7 billion as requested by the President to assist the victims of the \nNorthridge earthquake in California and natural disasters in 40 other \nStates.\n  The bill provides $1.9 billion to be available for the remainder of \nfiscal year 1995, and $4.8 billion as a ``contingency'' appropriation, \nwhich can be obligated by the President beginning in fiscal year 1996 \nwith specific notification of the Congress.\n  The bill provides $27 million in non-emergency program supplementals \nrequested by the President, which can be accommodated within the \noverall cap on discretionary spending.\n  Finally, the bill includes rescissions totaling $13.1 billion in \nbudget authority and $1.2 billion in outlay savings for fiscal year \n1995 to offset the costs of the disaster aid and provide further \ndeficit reduction as the Congress seeks to move toward a balanced \nFederal budget.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill and put a ``mini \ndownpayment'' on the significant deficit reduction that will be \nrequired to balance the budget and begin to alleviate the burden of \ndebt we are leaving to our children and our children's children.\n  The fact that the Senate and House are paying for the supplemental \nspending for defense programs and disaster assistance is to be \ncommended. It will prevent some $15 billion from being added to the \nFederal deficit, and puts the Congress on the right path toward a \nbalanced budget.\n  The administration has indicated in its communications on this bill \nthat it remains committed to deficit reduction. However, the \nadministration then proceeds to object to most of the savings included \nin these bills.\n  In many cases, the rescissions are from programs proposed for \nreduction or termination by the President, are from unobligated \nbalances that will not realistically be spent, or reduce significant \nincreases provided for programs at a time when the overall budget is \nconstrained.\n  The administration also focused on its commitment to deficit \nreduction in the President's fiscal year 1996 budget submission, but \nmade no proposals whatsoever to deal with escalating spending on \nentitlement programs, and claimed phony savings in discretionary \nprograms under the methodology OMB used to calculate the spending caps.\n  Now is the time for Congress to embark on a serious journey to get \nits fiscal house in order. This bill is but a first step on what will \nbe a long and difficult, but necessary, journey.\n  I urge the passage of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be printed in the \nRecord at this point two tables showing the relationship of this bill \nto the section 602 allocations to the Appropriations Committee and to \nthe current level which displays congressional action to date for \nfiscal year 1995.\n  There being no objection, the tables were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n

Mr. President, earlier this month, while considering the \nDepartment of Defense supplemental appropriations bill, the Senate \nadopted an amendment that was offered by the Senator from Texas. \nSenator Hutchison's amendment will rescind $1.5 million from the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service's account for Endangered Species Act listings \nand critical habitat designations. That bill is currently before a \nHouse-Senate conference committee. At the moment, I have not heard \nwhether the conferees have agreed to accept the Senate position and \ninclude the Hutchison amendment in the final DOD supplemental bill.\n  The bill we are considering today includes a provision to rescind \nfunds from the same account as the original amendment by Senator \nHutchison. It is my understanding that the intention of the managers of \nthe bill is to rescind these funds in either the DOD bill or in this \none, but not to rescind the funds in both bills. In fact, on page 32 of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee Report it states: ``The issue of a \nrevised funding level for Endangered Species Act programs will be \nconsidered by the Committee in the context of conference actions on \nboth this bill and the Department of Defense supplemental.'' Would the \nSenator from Washington confirm my understanding and would he please \nexplain the meaning of this report language?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to set the \nrecord straight on this. It is not my intention to include a rescission \nfrom the endangered species listing program in two separate rescission \nbills. When it becomes clear that the Hutchison amendment will be \naccepted by the DOD conference committee, I plan to offer an amendment \nto eliminate the rescission from the listing account that is included \nin this bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I am pleased to hear the Senator's response and I thank \nhim for his cooperation.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back on the \nRepublican side.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to send, along \nwith Senator D'Amato, a second-degree amendment to amendment No. 427, \nand ask that it be taken up at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I, before that activity, move to \ntable the Reid amendment that is immediately pending and ask for the \nyeas and nays?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, could the \nSenator from Alaska repeat what the unanimous consent request is?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Simply to submit a second-degree amendment to \namendment No. 427 and ask that it be taken up at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I do not serve on the Banking Committee. \nThere are two, three, four Republicans on the floor, five, all my \nfriends. I know that they are not going to take advantage of anyone. \nBut I just cannot do that because I do not understand the banking issue \nbefore this body.\n  I will object.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. This is simply a second degree to the D'Amato \namendment which is the pending business.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator D'Amato is not here. I object, if the Senator \nis not here. Did Senator D'Amato approve?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Senator D'Amato is joining me.\n  Mr. REID. I join my friend from New Mexico in objecting.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I get the yeas and nays on the Reid amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 437\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question now \noccurs on agreeing to amendment No. 437 offered by the Senator from \nAlabama [Mr. Shelby].\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. \nFaircloth] is necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams] and the \nSenator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] are absent due to a death in the \nfamily.\n  Mr. FORD.

The Senate will be in order.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Vote On Motion To Table Amendment No. 439\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question then occurs on the motion to lay \non the table amendment 439, offered by the Senator from Nevada [Mr. \nReid].\n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 439) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished \nDemocratic leader--as I understand it, he would prefer to have no more \nvotes this evening. Is there any way we could reach some agreement on \nbringing this matter to conclusion? Otherwise, I am tempted to take the \nbill down.\n  But I can say we are not going to send any other supplemental to the \nPresident until we deal with this one. So if they are waiting for the \ndefense supplemental, it is not going to happen. I think what we have \nhere is just a lot of amendments coming by the bucketsful from that \nside. Certainly it is everybody's right. But we thought we could finish \nthis bill in 2 days. Apparently we cannot.\n  I have asked the distinguished Democratic leader if it would serve \nany purpose to stay here any further tonight?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I guess I would remind our colleagues the \nreason we are here at 10:15 is we spent the entire day working on an \namendment offered by the Senator from New York, on an amendment that \nhad nothing to do with the supplemental. I am sure the bulk of the \namendments thus far have been offered in good faith by Members on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  I would be prepared to lay down the amendment that we have been \ntalking about now for a couple of days tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock. \nWe could have a good debate on it. I think we could narrow the list, as \nwe have been able to do in the past, to try to come up with a list that \nwe could dispose of in due course. But certainly I would be prepared to \nwork out a time agreement on the amendment tomorrow and continue our \nwork.\n  Mr. DOLE. As I understand it, the Democratic leader would like to \nstart, what, 10 o'clock? Is that what he indicated?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct, start at 10 o'clock. We could get a \ntime agreement. I know people are going to want to make travel \nschedules tomorrow, but we could finish perhaps at 2 o'clock in the \nafternoon.\n  Mr. DOLE. I also understand the managers of the bill would like to \nstay tonight if any amendments can be accepted. Are there amendments \nthat could be accepted tonight, I might ask the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Not to my knowledge. Mr. Leader, I do not have a list \nof the amendments that are floating around. We have a number, a few \namendments here that we can accept, to move ahead and do that. But I do \nnot have a list from the minority side, nor from the majority side, on \nwhat amendments are intended to be offered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Is there anyone willing to debate an amendment tonight and \nhave the vote tomorrow at, say, 9:45, before we start on the major \namendment by the Democratic leader?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I will be delighted.\n  Mr. DOLE. Your effort has been noted.\n  Are there any volunteers? We might be able to do that. I think the \nmanagers--I think Senator Hatfield had hoped we would stay all night \nand finish the bill, but I do not believe that is possible after \nvisiting with the Democrat leader. But it may be possible for someone \nto lay down an amendment--on either side of the aisle? Are there any \namendments on either side of the aisle we can lay down and have a vote \non, say tomorrow at 9:45 in the morning?\n  [[Page S4916]] Mr. HATFIELD. Would the majority leader and minority \nleader at least let us try to stay in all night and finish it?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. No, we could not do that.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I feel fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Would the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOLE. Sure.\n  Mr. KERRY. If someone were to stay tonight and offer an amendment for \na vote in the morning, would that obviate a vote subsequent to that? Or \nwould there still be a vote later in the afternoon?\n  Mr. DOLE. There would be a vote hopefully not too late in the \nafternoon, hopefully 1:30 or 2.\n  I do not like getting everybody over to vote with the Sergeant at \nArms. I think that is a waste of time and punishes people who may not \nbe here for some good reason. I know on our side there are a couple of \npeople here who had deaths in the family.\n  But if there was some amendment we could lay down tonight and vote on \nin the morning? If not, we will just wait and take up the leader's \namendment at 10 a.m.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. Leader, could you yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOLE. I will.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is there any way between the minority leader and the \nchairman of the committee that we could find out how many amendments \nthere really are?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Sure. We can work on that. We have been.\n  Mr. DOLE. We will work on that overnight and bring it up in the \nmorning.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOLE. There will be no more votes then this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the amendment of the \nSenator from New York.\n  Mr. SIMON. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Would it be in order on the floor of the Senate to mention \nthat our colleague, Senator Bob Graham, became a grandfather of \ntriplets this evening?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois may speak on any \nsubject he wishes. The Senator has done just that.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the D'Amato \namendment be temporarily laid aside in order to take up the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 440\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk proposed \nby Senator Hollings for himself and Senator Biden, and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] for Mr. Hollings, \n     for himself and Mr. Biden, proposes an amendment numbered \n     440.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 8 of the substitute amendment strike line 1 through \n     line 6 and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n\n                         general administration\n\n                          working capital fund\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the unobligated balances available under this heading in \n     Public Law 103-317, $5,000,000 are rescinded.\n\n\n                            legal activities\n\n                         asset forfeiture fund\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 103-317, $5,000,000 are rescinded.\n\n\n                       office of justice programs\n\n                              drug courts\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in title \n     VIII of Public Law 103-317, $17,100,000 are rescinded.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, This amendment, on behalf of myself and \nSenator Biden, would restore some of the funding in the Department of \nJustice's Drug Court Program. The House-passed bill and the committee-\nreported bill both rescind $27.1 million from drug courts. My amendment \nreduces the rescission to $17.1 million, and allows $10.0 million for \nthe program this year.\n  Last week Attorney General Janet Reno sent me a letter expressing her \nstrong support for the Drug Court Program and her desire to have this \nfunding restored. I ask unanimous consent that her letter, in its \nentirety, appear in the Record.\n  This Drug Court Program is funded through the violent crime trust \nfund. We already cut all discretionary programs last year to make \noffsets for this program and other crime bill programs. But, now here \nwe are considering a bill that eliminates funding for a crime \nreduction, antidrug program--and here I am proposing yet additional \noffsets to pay for the program a second time.\n  Mr. President, Members might wonder why the House is trying to \neliminate this program. Why? Because drug courts always was a Senate-\nsponsored program. It was included in the Senate version of the crime \nbill and was supported on a bipartisan basis. And, frankly, I don't \nunderstand why the Appropriations Committee would want to concur in \ntheir rescission.\n  Mr. President, we have a crime problem in this country caused by \ndrugs. Just 2 weeks ago, DEA Administrator Constantine testified before \nthe Commerce, Justice and State Subcommittee about the rise in drug-\nrelated crime. More than half of those arrested who enter the criminal \njustice system have some level of substance abuse problems. Our \ncriminal justice system functions like a revolving door in which drug \noffenders continue to pass through.\n  Drug courts are designed to specifically deal with this inherent \nproblem in our criminal justice system. Drug courts employ the coercive \npower of the court to subject nonviolent offenders to the kind of \nintensive supervision that can break the cycle of substance abuse and \ncrime that infects too many communities in this country.\n  These drug courts require mandatory periodic drug testing, mandated \nsubstance abuse treatment for each program participant, and graduated \nsanctions for participants who fail to show satisfactory progress in \ntheir assigned treatment regimens.\n  All this is under the direct supervision of drug court judges. I \nbelieve many Members met with these judges in the last few weeks, two \ndrug court judges were in my office recently to speak on behalf of this \nprogram. Both Judge Jeffrey Tauber of Oakland, CA, and Judge Steven \nRyan of Las Cruces, NM, stressed that drug courts are not a \n``Washington knows best program.'' It is a locally determined program, \nevery drug court is different and unique.\n  Mr. President, I think we now have one of the best Attorney Generals \nwe've ever had, and I have known a lot of them. She's tough and \nunderstands law enforcement. Janet Reno came up through the ranks. She \nreally believes in this Drug Court Program and knows from her \nexperience in Dade County, FL, that it works. My amendment lets her \nprove the program's worth and get it off the ground.\n  The amendment's offsets are simple.\n  The amendment proposes rescinding $5 million of the unobligated \nbalances in the Justice Department's working capital fund. This account \nfunds ADP equipment, accounting systems, administrative support, and \nlaw enforcement related equipment. I know justice has various things \nthey want to reprogram dollars for; saving the drug court program is a \nhigh priority. The only reason these balances are in the fund is \nbecause of language the Congress put in the bill 3 years ago that \nenabled Justice to recapture expiring balances.\n  Second, the amendment proposes a rescission of $5 million\n   from unobligated balances in the Justice assets forfeiture fund. \nThese funds are excess to annual requirements and were not expected to \nbe spent in the current year. It will not impact any State or local law \nenforcement participation in the assets forfeiture program.\n\n  So, what we are trying to do in this amendment is to strike a \nbalance--to make minor reductions in two Justice accounts--to save at \nleast $10 million for drug courts. We should give Attorney General Reno \na chance to prove this program's worth instead of simply \n[[Page S4917]] concurring with the House-proposed rescission. Our \namendment is fully offset. I urge its adoption. I ask unanimous consent \na letter from Attorney General Reno be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 1995.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on the Departments of \n         Commerce, Justice, and State, The Judiciary and Related \n         Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: As you know today the Full Committee \n     will consider H.R. 1158, a bill that among other things would \n     rescind funding for certain programs established in the \n     Violent Crime Control and law Enforcement Act of 1994 (VCCA). \n     Included in this bill is a rescission of $27,170,000 for the \n     Drug Court Grant Program.\n       I am writing to register my strong objection to this \n     rescission, which would eliminate funding to help implement a \n     proven cost-effective approach of integrated services and \n     sanctions which I have witnessed first hand to be successful \n     in combatting drug-related crime. The Drug Court Grant \n     Program can help ensure certainty and immediacy of punishment \n     for non-violent arrestees with drug problems who might \n     otherwise go both unpunished and unsupervised. They are an \n     essential element of a comprehensive and fiscally responsible \n     approach to improve the criminal justice system.\n       The House action--the rescission of more than 95 percent of \n     the appropriation for the current fiscal year--is devastating \n     to this Administration's drug-fighting efforts. It also \n     represents a serious setback for communities around this \n     country working to improve public safety by breaking the \n     powerful connection between substance abuse and crime.\n\n\n                               trust fund\n\n       At the outset, I would like to comment on how this \n     rescission affects the integrity of the Violent Crime \n     Reduction Trust Fund.\n       Both the Drug Court program and the Trust Fund were \n     included in S. 1607, the Senate crime bill from last \n     Congress, which passed the Senate on November 19, 1993 by the \n     overwhelming vote of 95 to 4.\n       The concept of the Trust Fund was to offset the cost of \n     crime-fighting initiatives--such as Drug Courts--with the \n     savings accumulated from reducing the Federal workforce. The \n     Trust Fund was the result of a true bipartisan effort because \n     the Senate had concluded--as a body--that crime-fighting \n     programs should be paid for and protected from other spending \n     programs.\n       Rescinding the funding for the Drug Court Program will set \n     a precedent that the Trust Fund can be raided at any time for \n     any other spending program.\n\n\n            drug courts are an important crime-fighting tool\n\n       We know that more than half of those arrested enter the \n     criminal justice system with some substance abuse problem. We \n     also know that too frequently, the current criminal justice \n     system functions like a revolving door through which \n     substance-abusing offenders pass without being required to \n     deal with the drug abuse that is inextricably tied to their \n     criminal behavior. Seeking to capitalize on that knowledge, \n     the VCCA established the Drug Court Grant Program.\n       Drug courts employ a court's coercive power to subject non-\n     violent offenders to the kind of intensive supervision that \n     can break the cycle of substance abuse and crime that \n     inflicts suffering in too many communities in this country.\n       Title V of the Violent Crime Control & Law Enforcement Act \n     of 1994 authorizes the Department of Justice to make \n     discretionary grants to support drug court programs that \n     involve continuing judicial supervision over offenders. \n     Violent offenders are excluded from this program.\n       States, state courts, local courts, units of local \n     government and tribal governments are eligible to apply for \n     drug court program funding. Programs that receive Crime Act \n     funding will subject substance abusing, non-violent offenders \n     to intensive court supervised intervention that provides the \n     mix of services and sanctions necessary to coerce abstinence \n     and force criminals to alter their behavior.\n       To achieve those goals, funded programs must include the \n     research identified key elements of success: mandatory \n     periodic drug testing; mandated substance abuse treatment for \n     each program participant; and graduated sanctions for \n     participants who fail to show satisfactory progress in their \n     assigned treatment regimens.\n       This initiative will support locally tailored approaches--\n     it is not a ``Washington knows best'' program. No single drug \n     court model can effectively break the cycle of substance \n     abuse and crime in every community. Thus, this program will \n     support local determinations about how to structure funded\n      drug court programs, while ensuring that statutorily-\n     required bedrock principles are in place.\n\n\n                        the facts on drug courts\n\n       The facts are clear that drug courts work. According to a \n     National Institute of Justice-sponsored evaluation, \n     participants in the Dade County, Florida drug court program--\n     one that I witnessed first-hand--showed substantially lower \n     rates for rearrest than non-participating defendants. Even \n     those drug court participants who did re-offend, did so after \n     significantly longer periods than non-participating \n     offenders.\n       Studies of the drug court programs in Portland, Oregon, \n     Washington, D.C., and Chicago, Illinois, have also shown \n     lower rates of recidivism for program participants. The \n     California Drug and Alcohol Treatment Assessment (CALDATA) \n     showed that substance abuse treatment reduced participants' \n     involvement in criminal activity by 43.3 percent.\n       Encouraged by these positive law enforcement results, \n     prosecutors, judges, public defenders, law enforcement \n     officials, and treatment professionals in jurisdictions \n     around the country are embracing this concept and moving \n     forward to implement treatment drug court.\n       Twenty-nine drug courts have been fully operational for at \n     least 6 months. Another 31 drug courts have been either \n     recently launched or are under development.\n\n\n                     moving in the right direction\n\n       Since the Crime Bill became law, the Office of Justice \n     Programs (OJP) in the Department of Justice has moved forward \n     aggressively to implement this initiative. OJP had created a \n     Drug Court Program Office to administer the program. OJP has \n     published proposed Drug Court Regulations and is currently \n     responding to comments submitted in response to that \n     publication. In addition, OJP has disseminated Program \n     Guidelines and Application Information regarding the Drug \n     Court Program.\n       Jurisdictions around the country are poised to move forward \n     with planning for drug courts. That more than 600 people \n     attended the January conference of the National Association \n     of Drug Court Professionals demonstrates the burgeoning \n     support for this program nationwide. In light of that \n     widespread support and interest, the Office of Justice \n     Programs intends to make up to 100 small ($35,000 each) \n     planning grants to eligible jurisdictions. This small sum, \n     dedicated as it is to planning, will help jurisdictions lay \n     the ground work for effective drug courts that work to break \n     the cycle of substance abuse and crime.\n       Many jurisdictions, inspired by the common sense appeal of \n     the treatment drug court concept, have already engaged in \n     significant drug court planning. For those locales, OJP will \n     make available up to 13 grant awards (no more than 10 for up \n     to $1 million and no more than 3 of up to $2 million) for \n     those jurisdictions to complete their planning processes and \n     move into full implementation.\n       In addition, there are some 35 treatment drug courts \n     currently in operation around the country. These \n     jurisdictions are pleased with the results they have achieved \n     thus far, but would seek Federal support to improve, enhance, \n     or expand their efforts. OJP will make available up to 20 \n     grants, of no more than $1 million, to existing drug courts \n     so that they can more effectively work to attack the linkage \n     between substance abuse and criminal behavior in their \n     communities.\n       OJP also intends to develop the capacity to provide a broad \n     range of training and technical assistance nationwide. While \n     this assistance will focus on jurisdictions that receive OJP \n     Drug Court grants, the intention is to develop the capacity \n     to provide assistance beyond those jurisdictions which \n     receive grant awards.\n       The House-passed rescission action eviscerates the \n     Department's ability to move forward to help make drug \n     courts--an important crime fighting tool--available to our \n     nation's states and localities.\n\n\n                       House Action on H.R. 1158\n\n       Finally, the House Appropriations Committee Report \n     accompanying H.R. 1158 stated that the Drug Court rescission \n     ``simply conforms the appropriation to the most recent House \n     action.'' The reference to the last House action is the \n     passage of H.R. 728 last month, which eliminated the \n     authorization for the Drug Court Program.\n       As you know, since the Senate has yet to act upon any \n     revisions to the Crime Law, the House's rationale for \n     eliminating Fiscal Year 1995 funding for the Drug Court \n     Program is inapplicable to the Senate.\n       During consideration of any revisions to the Crime Law in \n     the Senate this Congress, the Administration will be working \n     very hard to preserve the authorization for the Drug Court \n     program and we expect bipartisan support in this effort.\n       Since the Senate is yet to act upon any authorization \n     revisions to the Crime Law, I believe that a rescission of \n     the Drug Court Fiscal Year 1995 funding should not be \n     included in any Senate action on H.R. 1158.\n       This Administration is strongly committed to streamlining \n     government and reducing the deficit. However, it is also \n     committed to an issue that is so important to each and every \n     American--the fight against crime. The proposed rescission of \n     the Drug Court Program from the VCCA Trust Fund will greatly \n     thwart our efforts to fight crime. It sends the wrong message \n     to the American public. We should be moving forward not \n     backward from the gains we made last year.\n       I appreciate your consideration of my views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                 ______\n\n                                                       Janet Reno.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an amendment that has \nbeen accepted by both sides. The \n[[Page S4918]] amendment restores $10 million in crime law trust fund \ndollars that would be rescinded by the legislation now before the \nSenate.\n  My amendment restores $10 million of the $27 million rescinded from \nthe Drug Courts Program. And, let me be clear, all of this $10 million \nis offset by cuts of $10 million in Justice Department funds that will \nnot diminish law enforcement. They are funds that both the subcommittee \nchairman and ranking member have agreed to rescind because they will \nnot adversely impact Justice Department operations.\n  This amendment is necessary for two key reasons:\n  First, we must stick to the promise we made in the violent crime \nreduction trust fund--we have already cut Federal bureaucrats to pay \nfor the crime law, so the $30.2 billion crime law does not increase the \ndeficit.\n  Second, unless we restore this $10 million more than 5,000 drug \noffenders who are today released on probation will not be tested for \ndrugs, will not be supervised, and will not be punished until many more \nAmerican citizens have been the victim of a crime, because without drug \ntesting, about the only way any offender is kicked off probation and \ninto jail is to get caught committing another crime--in other words, \nafter there is yet another victim.\n  And as I mentioned, my amendment identifies $10 million in offsetting \ncuts so my amendment does not change the overall deficit cutting of \nthis bill. This amendment simply takes a step to help preserve the \nintegrity of the Drug Court Program.\n  Let me review just some of the facts that point out just how great \nthe need is to add real teeth to our probation system.\n  Nationwide, about 3 million offenders are released on probation. Of \nthese 3 million, about half, 1.4 million, of these offenders are drug \nabusers. And, of these 1.4 million offenders, only about 800,000 \nreceive some drug testing and/or drug treatment.\n  That all means that nationwide we have about 600,000 offenders, out \non probation who are drug-abusers and who are not tested for drugs, not \ntreated for their addiction, and barely supervised by our overwhelmed \nprobation officers.\n  In fact, in the Nation's largest States, probation officers' \ncaseloads range from 90 to 100 offenders per officer; to 240 offenders \nper officer. Even at the 100-offender level, that means that in an \naverage 40 hour week, a probation officer could spend about 20 minutes \non each offender under his or her authority. At the higher levels, \nprobation officers have less than 10 minutes every week to make sure \nthat each offender is staying on the straight and narrow.\n  Plainly, few of these offenders are being supervised the way they \nshould.\n  Unless these offenders face certain punishment, with the chance of \ntreatment to beat their addiction, they will be the violent offenders \nof tomorrow.\n  Unless we monitor these offenders on probation, they are probably \ncontinuing to take drugs, as well as committing crimes for which they \nhave not yet been arrested. Drug testing means that these offenders \nwill no longer get a free ride on probation.\n  And that is the only choice these intensive drug testing and \ntreatment, and certain punishment programs ask us to make. Instead of \nthese offenders walking around the streets, unmonitored, they will have \nto check in every day or so and confirm that they have not been using \ndrugs through a drug test or suffer the consequences.\n  While all of us might wish that these offenders were all behind bars, \nI do not believe we have that choice. We all know that we can't build \ncells fast enough--even if we could afford to build 3 million new \nprison cells at a cost of at least $150 billion and that is based on a \nconservative construction cost estimate of $50,000 per cell.\n  Let me also point out that these are not programs for violent \noffenders. These are cost-effective programs that combine the concepts \nof prevention plus responsibility to reach those offenders whose minor \ncrimes have just brought them into the criminal justice system.\n  The language in the Senate-passed bill specifically exempted violent \noffenders from participation in these intensive drug testing programs. \nAnd, the language in the crime law goes even further--adding language \nthat prevents any offender who has ever been convicted of a violent \noffense from participating in the drug courts.\n  The results of the Drug Court Program in Attorney General Reno's \nhometown are impressive:\n  From June 1989 to December 1991, 1,740 offenders successfully \ngraduated from the program--and only 3 percent have been rearrested.\n  In addition, about 1,500 offenders failed out of the Drug Court \nProgram--however, the strength of the drug testing program means that \nthese offenders who should not be released on probation were identified \nearly and sent to jail--where they belong.\n  Before the Drug Court Program, was instituted, the re-arrest rate for \nthese offenders was 33 percent.\n  And the program is saving money--money that can be redirected to \nincarcerating and treating violent, career criminals. In Miami, it \ncosts $17,000 a year to keep an offender in the county jail. That same \noffender can get the benefits of the drug court at a price of about \n$2,000 a year.\n  The results from many other jurisdictions are similarly impressive:\n  In my home State of Delaware, Judge Richard Gebelein wrote to tell me \nthat in just the first 8 months of operation the Delaware drug court \nhad put:\n\n       Over 250 people who would have been placed on probation \n     with little or no supervision have been placed in a [drug \n     court] program where they are tightly controlled and \n     monitored. We have increased public safety through this \n     program.\n\n  In Coos County, OR, the rate of positive drug tests dropped from more \nthan 40 percent to less than 10 percent after the probation department \nsubjected offenders to a tough program of drug treatment and drug \ntesting.\n  In Michigan, some judges have instituted a drug testing program which \nimposes progressively harsher sanctions with each failure. Most \noffenders--no matter how serious their addiction--seem to learn \nquickly: Of 200 offenders in the program, only 28 have failed.\n  An Oakland, CA, Drug Court Program with regular drug testing found \nthat the re-arrest rate was reduced by 45 percent when the program went \ninto effect. And, based on this figure, the program estimated that \nparticipants spent--in total--35,000 fewer days in custody because they \nwere not re-arrested. The bottom line: Alemeda County generated more \nthan $2 million in savings from the unused prison space.\n  I would like to thank Commerce/State/Justice Appropriations \nSubcommittee Chairman Gramm for his assistance on this important \nmatter. I am happy that we could reach agreement and I am sure that \nSenator Gramm will continue to work on this important program when this \nbill reaches--as I believe it will--a conference with the House of \nRepresentatives. Senator Gramm was a key player when the Senate \ndeveloped the crime law trust fund, so I know that he shares my support \nfor this key funding mechanism.\n  I would also thank the subcommittee's ranking member, Senator \nHollings, for his efforts and assistance to preserve at least a portion \nof the drug court funding, and uphold the integrity of the trust fund.\n  Appropriations Chairman Senator Hatfield also has my appreciation for \nhis support of the Drug Court Program.\n  Finally, I would express my personal gratitude to ranking member \nSenator Byrd  for agreeing to this amendment. As my colleagues in the \nSenate know, the violent crime reduction trust fund that fully funded \nthe $30.2 billion crime law without adding to the deficit was the \nproduct of the hard work and incredible creativity of Senator Byrd. I \nwill do everything I can to maintain the integrity of the trust fund, \nbut I would just acknowledge that there would be no trust fund for \nwhich to fight were it not for Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, again, I note that the ranking member of \nthis committee is on the floor, Senator Hollings. It has been cleared \non both sides.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 440) was agreed to.\n  [[Page S4919]] Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the \nvote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n                           Amendment No. 427\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, may I make an inquiry? What is the \npending business? Are we on D'Amato?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question occurs on the D'Amato \namendment number 427.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 441 to Amendment No. 427\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If there is no objection, I would like to send a \nsecond-degree amendment in behalf of myself, Senator D'Amato, to amend \namendment No. 427 and ask it be taken up at the appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] for himself and Mr. \n     D'Amato proposes an amendment numbered 441 to amendment \n     numbered 427.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of line 10 of page 2, prior to the period insert \n     the following:\n       ``, Provided, That as the bearer bonds issued by the \n     Government of Mexico are redeemed with monies provided by the \n     Government of the United States, the Government of the United \n     States first be provided with the names and addresses of \n     those redeeming such bonds''.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/30/senate-section/article/S4907-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n\n   IN HONOR OF ROBERT J. PFEIFFER, RETIRING CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF \n                       ALEXANDER & BALDWIN, INC.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, it is a privilege for me to rise today to \nhonor, congratulate, and extend my very best wishes and aloha to a \ndear, and very close friend to me and my family, Mr. Robert J. \n``Bobby'' Pfeiffer, on his retirement as Chairman of the Board of \nAlexander & Baldwin, Inc.\n  His life represents a true American success story, a self-made man \nwho started as a deck hand, rose to president of Hawaii's largest \nnavigation company, and later made it to the board room of one of \nHawaii's largest corporations. Bobby Pfeiffer will conclude 57 years of \nexemplary service on March 31, when he resigns as chairman of Alexander \n& Baldwin, Inc. (A), a Fortune 500 company. Mr. Pfeiffer has a long \nand distinguished record of contributions to his company, and because \nof the leadership he has provided, he has been unanimously elected to \nthe post of chairman emeritus. Mr. Pfeiffer has enjoyed a 37-and-a-half \nyear career with A, including longer service as CEO than any other \nindividual in the company's 124 year history except John Waterhouse, \nson-in-law of A founder Samuel T. Alexander.\n  Mr. Pfeiffer, who stepped down as A's chief executive officer on \nMarch 31, 1992, indicated that because he wanted his retirement to be \ncomplete, he also wished to leave his current positions as director and \nchairman of the board of both of A's principal subsidiaries, A\nHawaii, Inc. and Matson Navigation Company, Inc. the A and \nMatson directors, at their January meetings, unanimously elected him \nchairman emeritus of those boards as well. Mr. Pfeiffer was Matson CEO \nlonger than anyone except Captain William Matson, who founded the \ncompany 112 years ago.\n  Born in Fiji in 1920, Pfeiffer came to Hawaii the following year. He \ngraduated from McKinley High School in 1937 and went to work as a \ndeckhand for the Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company, Ltd., of which \nhe later became president. He served as an officer in the U.S. navy \nduring World War II.\n  Mr. Pfeiffer's career with Alexander and Baldwin began in 1956. He \nworked for Matcinal Corporation, a Matson subsidiary and a stevedoring \nand terminal company in the San Francisco Bay area, as vice president \nand general manager. In 1962 he was promoted to president of Matson \nTerminals, Inc., another Matson subsidiary. He was appointed Matson \npresident and CEO in 1973; he has served as Matson's chairman \ncontinuously since 1979. At Matson, he guided the company through a \nperiod of tremendous growth and success and in the process transformed \nit into one of the world's most efficient, modern ocean transportation \ncompanies.\n  Mr. Pfeiffer was named to A's board of directors in 1978; he was \nappointed president of A the next year. He assumed the posts of chief \nexecutive officer and chairman of the board in 1980. Under his \nleadership, A has grown, modernized, and diversified. Mr. Pfeiffer \nalso earned the company a solid reputation for involvement in \nphilanthropic activities and community affairs, both in Hawaii and \nCalifornia, its two principal places of business. Today, the Alexander \nand Baldwin Foundation, which he created, has established a level of \ngiving in excess of $1 million a year.\n  Mr. Pfeiffer has served on many corporate, professional and non-\nprofit boards and organizations, often in leadership positions. These \ninclude First Hawaiian, Inc.; First Hawaiian Bank; the Conference \nBoard; the Hawaii Business Roundtable; the Chamber of Commerce of \nHawaii; the American Bureau of Shipping; the Maritime Transportation \nResearch Board of the National Academy of Sciences (as chairman); the \nContainerization & Intermodal Institute; the International Cargo \nHandling Coordination Association (as chairman); the Propeller Club of \nthe United States, Port of Honolulu (as president) and Port of San \nFrancisco; the National Association of Stevedores (as president); the \nNational Cargo Bureau, Inc.; the Hawaii Maritime Center; the McKinley \nHigh School Foundation; the University of Hawaii Foundation (as \nchairman); the Aloha Council, Boy Scouts of America; the Girl Scout \nCouncil of the Pacific; the Pacific Aerospace Museum; and the Research \nRound Table of the American Heart Association, Alameda County Chapter.\n  Mr. Pfeiffer's community and professional leadership earned him \nnumerous honors.

A bill to amend section 6 of the Forest and Rangeland \nRenewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 to require phasing-in of \ncertain amendments of or revisions to land and resource management \nplans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                 timber resource management legislation\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is time to require the U.S. Forest \nService to act in a responsible manner when amending it's forest \nmanagement plans and prior to revising its land and resource management \nplans.\n  It is unfortunate that it is necessary to legislate this requirement, \nbut past performance such as red cockaded woodpecker in the South and \nthe spotted owl in the Northwest has made this necessary.\n  Today is a special day. Six years ago is when the U.S. Forest Service \nunilaterally implemented arbitrary changes to forest management plans \nin the southern region and ignored one of its missions by reducing \ntimber harvesting. And for 6 years elected officials have worked to \nreestablish responsible management.\n  I am reintroducing my resolution which was adopted in the last \nCongress. However, this time my legislation will formally amend the \nNational Forest Management Act of 1976.\n  In 10 words or less my bill will: ``require the Forest Service to \nphase-in forest management plan changes.'' That is all.\n  This legislation will not prevent the Forest Service, or any other \nFederal agency, from taking actions to protect endangered species.\n  This legislation will not change one environmental statute.\n  This legislation will not gut any environmental policies.\n  This legislation will not jeopardize any efforts to protect \nendangered species.\n  In fact, I would argue it will cause a greater public acceptance, \nawareness, and respect for environmental policies.\n  This legislation merely dictates common sense to ensure a balanced \nand economically responsible plan is established.\n  Let me be very clear, if my colleagues have a national forest in \ntheir State, then they have a potential problem.\n  Previous forest management policy changes have failed to anticipate \nsocietal consequences on communities and families. Severe economic \ndevastation occurred.\n  I am not talking about hypothetical situations. Talk to the people in \ntimber communities in Oregon, Washington, and Liberty County, FL. This \nis real and this is not smart.\n  In the last Congress, I saw a number of legislative provisions \nadopted to help communities already destroyed by changes in how forests \nare managed. These legislative solutions were expensive and necessary. \nIt is an unfortunate thing that they were required, but let members not \nperpetuate this reactive legislative mode.\n  This legislative goal is to avoid having to enact expensive remedies \nafter the fact. Congress needs to get in front of the problems caused \nby the Forest Service.\n  The legislation I am introducing here today has a goal of avoiding \nhaving to enact expensive remedies after the fact. Congress needs to \nget in front of the problems caused by the Forest Service.\n  This legislation involves an uncomplicated inexpensive four criteria \nphase-in process. In fact, it was examined by the Department of \nAgriculture when it was a resolution last year. All of its concerns \nwere incorporated in the language that was accepted in the last day of \nthe session.\n  This legislation is straightforward.\n  This legislation ensures that common sense and economic issues are \nfactored into policies which change forest management plans.\n  This legislation will preclude devastating economic impacts from \npublic policies by suddenly reducing annual timber harvests. This \nproduces significant job losses and financial ruin. It damages schools. \nIn small communities it has unbelievable consequences quite often when \nit is just put into effect without proper consideration.\n  [[Page S4925]] It makes sense to create a cost effective and smooth \nglidepath for timber-dependent communities as forest management plans \nare changed. It makes double sense to do this upfront, not after \nfamilies and communities have been disrupted, devastated, and damaged \nin many ways.\n  The bill will restore the essential balance which the Forest Service \nmust maintain. The Forest Service must not emphasize a single mission \nat the expense of other resources.\n  The bill will not challenge or prohibit the policies which protect \nour public forests. Rather it recognizes and explicitly acknowledges \nthat our national forests have a multiple use mission which cannot be \nignored. I think we have been slipping away from that in recent years.\n  The legislative approach in a word is ``cash-flow.'' It means that \nthe forest to be set aside will provide for just the habitat of the \nexisting colony of the endangered species.\n  We have had a recent proposal that 100,000 acres in the district of a \nnational forest be set aside for a colony of red cockaded woodpeckers. \nI thought a colony was maybe 1,000 birds or something for 100,000 \nacres. It was five--five birds. Common sense is what we are asking for \nhere in our forest management policy.\n  The set-aside would then increase, based on the growth of the \npopulation of the protected species. This means that the original set-\naside will not be based on the size of the final colony, a goal which \nmay not be reached for generations.\n  However, the Forest Service, under current policies, will immediately \nset aside the full habitat area--100,000 acres perhaps--for foraging, \neven though the species population will not require this area for well \ninto the next century, maybe never. This is neither environmentally nor \neconomically sound.\n  The Forest Service approach is an arrogant abuse of public assets \nentrusted to them. I believe current Forest Service practices are \ncounterproductive to public acceptance of environmental policies.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a close look at this legislation. I will \nbe looking for a way to move it. We had broad bipartisan support last \nyear when it was just a resolution. I hope that we can find a bill that \nwe can attach it to. If not, I will be looking for a vehicle to offer \nit as an amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 647\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to clarify treatment of certain claims and defenses \nagainst an insured depository institution under receivership by the \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                      the d'oench duhme reform act\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the D'Oench Duhme \nReform Act. I think it is safe to say that very few Members of this \nbody have ever heard of the D'Oench Duhme doctrine, or understand why \nthe Senate should spend its time reforming this arcane area of Federal \nbanking law. But I submit that the problems that have arisen with \nrespect to D'Oench Duhme are symptomatic of the more general problem \nthat we see today of government acting without regard to the impact of \nits actions on the citizenry. Governmental arrogance of this sort \ncorrodes public confidence in its political institutions and hinders \nthe ability of government to act in the public interest. So the bill I \nintroduce today has two purposes: It aims to fix a legal doctrine that \nhas victimized hundreds of innocent people. But it also is designed to \nhelp restore confidence in government in general by reforming a law \nthat is fundamentally unfair.\n  I am very pleased to announce that Senators D'Amato, Bennett, and \nFaircloth are joining me as original cosponsors of the D'Oench Duhme \nReform Act. I look forward to working with them as the bill is \nconsidered in the Banking Committee.\n  The D'Oench Duhme doctrine is based on a 1942 Supreme Court case and \na Federal statute enacted in 1950. The original purpose of the doctrine \nwas to protect the interests of Federal bank regulatory agencies by \nmaking secret side agreements that do not appear in the records of an \ninsured bank unenforceable when a bank fails and banking agency is \nappointed receiver.\n  Over the years, however, this salutary purpose has been perverted \ninto a national policy allowing the FDIC and RTC to slam the courthouse \ndoor in the face of litigants asserting claims and defenses that have \nnothing to do with secret side agreements. In many cases, the claimants \nhave been victims of fraud by bank officials. Nonetheless, if the \nlitigants' claims or defenses were based in any way on oral, unrecorded \nrepresentations, the FDIC and RTC have successfully used D'Oench Duhme \nto lower the boom and get the claims dismissed. Individuals are abused \ntwice--once by the bank and then again by the Government. The sad fact \nis that these individuals often think that they have been treated worse \nby the FDIC or RTC than they were by the bank that defrauded them.\n  In January, the Subcommittee on the Oversight of Government \nManagement, which I chair, held a hearing on the FDIC and RTC's \nmisapplication of this powerful legal doctrine. The subcommittee heard \ntestimony from individuals who have been victimized by the FDIC and \nRTC's use of D'Oench Duhme, an attorney who has represented dozens of \nclients against these agencies, and a panel of legal scholars. All of \nthese witnesses documented that the Federal courts, at the urging of \nthe FDIC and RTC, have expanded the doctrine in a way that has led to \nfundamentally unfair, and unjustifiable, results.\n  I was especially struck by the testimony a professor who had \nrepresented the FDIC in a case where an elderly couple had obviously \nbeen victimized by officers of a savings and loan. In fact, the \nofficers of the S were eventually convicted on 30 counts of bank \nfraud. Nonetheless, the professor succeeded in getting the elderly \ncouple's civil case against the FDIC dismissed pursuant to the D'Oench\n Duhme doctrine. The patent unfairness of this result led the professor \nto write a law review article criticizing the unjustified expansion of \nthe D'Oench doctrine.\n\n  I also want to remind the Senate of an extraordinary case from Boston \ninvolving Rhetta and John Sweeney that I brought to the Senate's \nattention last summer. After a lengthy trial in State court, in which a \njury decided the Sweeney's were liable on a mortgage, the trial court \nin a separate decision ruled that they had been defrauded by ComFed \nbank and won a $3 million verdict. But when ComFed failed and the RTC \ntook over as receiver, the case \n[[Page S4926]] was removed to Federal court days before the court's \ndecision was written, and then dismissed based under D'Oench Duhme. Now \nthe Sweeneys are now facing the loss of their family home. For the \nSweeneys, D'Oench Duhme has meant just that--doom.\n  These examples are just the tip of the iceberg. D'Oench Duhme has \nbeen invoked by the FDIC to bar claims in approximately 5,145 cases \nsince 1989. Countless other claimants probably have not even bothered \nto file claims based on their knowledge of the sweeping power of the \nD'Oench doctrine. These claimants may not have valid claims, but at \nleast they should have the chance to have their cases heard on the \nmerits.\n  The current law is unfair and arbitrary. Bank customers are permitted \nto assert claims and defenses based on oral representations against \nsolvent banks, but a different law--D'Oench Duhme--applies once a bank \nbecomes insolvent.\n  The FDIC and RTC have arrogated to themselves power that has not been \ngranted to them by Congress. They have done so based on the belief that \nCongress wants them to resolve failed institutions as inexpensively as \npossible. But Congress did not authorize the FDIC and RTC to trample \nover individual rights for the purpose of reducing the cost of bank and \nthrift failures. The whole purpose of the bank insurance system has \nbeen secure public confidence in the banking system and spread the cost \nof bank failures to the public as a whole. D'Oench Duhme undermines \nboth purposes. It degrades public confidence in the banking system by \npermeating the resolution process with fundamental unfairness. It also \nplaces a disproportionate share of the burden of bank failure on \nindividuals who have done nothing wrong but to have had the misfortune \nof choosing to do business with a bank that eventually failed.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will correct this inequity. \nIts purpose is to restore D'Oench Duhme to its original, narrow \npurpose. Consequently, the bill continues to bar claims and defenses \nbased on secret side agreements entered into by bank insiders. But the \nbill provides relief victims of bank fraud by opening the courthouse \ndoors and allowing them to have their day in court.\n  Reform of the D'Oench Duhme doctrine is necessary to restore \nfundamental fairness to our banking law. Mr. President, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section \nanalysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows.\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n                         section 1--short title\n\n                    section 2--findings and purposes\n\n       This section explains that under current law, federal \n     banking agencies can use two separate lines of authority to \n     bar claims brought against them, a federal common law \n     doctrine developed pursuant to the Supreme Court case D'Oench \n     Duhme & Co. v. FDIC (1942), and a federal statute, section \n     13(e) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (``FDIA''). This \n     section represents a congressional finding that the use of \n     these authorities by federal banking agencies have led to \n     fundamentally unfair results because individuals with \n     potentially valid claims and defenses against depository \n     institutions have been barred from bringing such claims when \n     the institutions fail and are taken over by federal banking \n     agencies.\n       This section also states that the purposes of the bill are \n     to unify the two doctrines so that all cases are handled \n     according to the federal statute and modify the statute so \n     that certain intentional tort and other claims and defenses \n     may be adjudicated on the merits.\n\n\n                        section 3--clarification\n\n       This section amends section 13(e) of the FDIA as follows:\n       Section (e)(1) provides that agreements relating to assets \n     acquired by federal banking agencies during a receivership, \n     conservatorship, or by purchase and assumption, are not \n     enforceable against the agency unless they are in writing and \n     were executed in the normal course of business. This section \n     changes current laws by streamlining the recordation \n     requirements that must be met for an agreement to be \n     enforceable against the federal banking agencies.\n       Section (e)(2) clarifies that certain claims and defenses \n     may be raised against the federal banking agencies, despite \n     the fact that unwritten agreements are made unenforceable \n     under section (e)(1). These claims and defenses include \n     claims that do not relate to an asset acquired by the \n     Corporation, claims that relate to transactions that would \n     not normally be recorded in the official records of a \n     depository institution, and claims commenced before the \n     appointment of a receiver or conservator. In addition, \n     intentional tort claims and claims based on state or federal \n     statutory law may be filed against the federal banking \n     agencies after their appointment as receiver or conservator \n     so long as the parties asserting the claims did not \n     participate in a scheme to defraud bank officials or federal \n     bank examiners.\n       Section (e)(3) overrules a number of federal cases which \n     hold that the federal banking agencies should be treated as \n     if they were ``holders in due course'' and therefore \n     immunized from certain categories of claims and defenses. \n     This section clarifies that a federal banking agency may only \n     be considered a ``holder in due course'' if it meets all the \n     requirements for such status under the applicable state law.\n       Section (e)(4) provides that agreements for the sale or \n     purchase of goods and services are enforceable against the \n     federal banking agencies.\n\n\n                           section 4--repeal\n\n       This section repeals section 11(d)(9) of the FDIA because \n     it would be rendered redundant by other sections of the bill.\n\n\n                    section 5--conforming amendments\n\n                        section 6--applicability\n\n       This section provides that the bill will apply \n     retroactively to all claims and litigation in progress on or \n     after October 19, 1993.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nlegislation sponsored by my esteemed colleague from Maine, Senator \nCohen, to reform the legal doctrine known as D'Oench, Duhme. This \ndoctrine has been expanded by banking agencies and courts far beyond it \noriginal intent. D'Oench, Duhme robs citizens of legal defenses after \nthey have been defrauded by their lending institutions, and those \ninstitutions have, in turn, been taken over by the FDIC and RTC.\n  In 1942, the Supreme Court decided D'Oench, Duhme & Co. versus FDIC. \nD'Oench, Duhme & Co.--``D'Oench''--executed unconditional promissory \nnotes to the Bellville Bank & Trust Co. O'Oench entered into a secret \nagreement with the bank that the notes would not be called for payment. \nIn 1938, the bank failed and the FDIC acquired the notes. The FDIC \ndemanded payment and learned of the secret agreement. The Court held \nthat the notes were enforceable and dismissed the agreement between \nD'Oench and the bank.\n  In 1950, Congress attempted to codify the D'Oench, Duhme doctrine in \nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Act [FDIA]. The statute set forth \nrequirements for agreements which would defeat the interest of the FDIC \nin an asset of an acquired institution. Such agreements are \nunenforceable unless they are in writing, have been formally recorded \nin bank records, and have been approved by the bank's board of \ndirectors.\n  The statute expanded the D'Oench decision by allowing the FDIC to use \nthe doctrine against borrowers who did not commit fraud or enter into a \nsecret agreement. However, the statute limited the doctrine by applying \nit only to the FDIC's interest in an acquired asset.\n  The D'Oench, Duhme doctrine was originally adopted to protect \ntaxpayers from secret agreements between banks and borrowers. Narrowly \nconstrued, D'Oench, Duhme allows the FDIC and RTC to collect on an \ninstitution's loans and save taxpayer dollars. Unfortunately, the \ndoctrine has been distorted into a weapon against innocent fraud \nvictims.\n  Under the D'Oench, Duhme doctrine, courts have routinely ignored the \nasset requirement for consideration. Courts have also regularly applied \nthe doctrine to innocent borrowers who did not commit fraud or enter \ninto secret agreements. Some courts have granted the FDIC and RTC the \nstatus of holder in due course. A party who gains this status takes an \ninstrument free from virtually any defenses. Therefore, a holder in due \ncourse is immune to a defense of fraud in the inducement, as well as \nany of the other personal defenses. It makes no sense to punish fraud \nvictims for the misconduct of their lending institution, but that is \nexactly what the doctrine does.\n  The Federal banking agencies have zealously applied the D'Oench, \nDuhme doctrine. Cleaning services and other private vendors have not \nbeen paid because the agencies have used the doctrine to avoid making \npayments to them. Innocent small businesses should not be left bankrupt \nbecause the institution which hired them was taken over by the FDIC and \nRTC.\n  [[Page S4927]] The D'Oench, Duhme Reform Act would amend the FDIA to \nensure that fraud victims can assert valid legal defenses. Claims \ncommenced before the appointment of an agency as receiver would not be \ncut short by D'Oench, Duhme. Fraud claims could be asserted after the \nappointment of an agency only if the party asserting the claim did not \nparticipate in any part of the fraud.\n  Under this bill, the Federal banking agencies could not gain the \nstatus of a holder is due course unless they meet the requirements for \nsuch status under the applicable state law. Agreements made by a \nlending institution for the purchase of goods and services would be \nenforceable against the FDIC and RTC.\n  The D'Oench, Duhme Reform Act would not automatically grant relief to \npeople who claim they were defrauded. Secret agreements would remain \nunenforceable. This bill would simply give fraud victims their day in \ncourt.\n  Mr. President, innocent people are losing their homes and businesses. \nHardworking, honest people are defrauded, and then they are victimized \nagain by the banking agencies. The FDIC and RTC are railroading these \npeople into foreclosure. This practice is grossly unfair and must be \nstopped. Mr. President, the D'Oench, Duhme Reform Act will do just \nthat.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMON (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Mack, Ms. Moseley-\n        Braun, Mr. Warner, Mr. Pell, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. \n        Dodd, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Graham, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Robb, Mr. \n        Akaka, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 649. A bill to authorize the establishment of the National African \nAmerican Museum within the Smithsonian Institution, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n                 the national african american museum act\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I reintroduced a bill that would authorize \nthe establishment of an African-American Museum within the Smithsonian \nInstitution. My colleague, Congressman John Lewis, offered the \ncompanion measure in the House on February 1, 1995.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to inspire and educate our Nation \nand the world about the cultural legacy of African-Americans and the \ncontributions made by African-Americans.\n  Throughout American history, two racial groups--African-Americans and \nnative Americans--have been consistently mistreated and \nunderrepresented. To help make up for this mistreatment, a memorial to \nthe native American experience has already been authorized. This \nlegislation would commemorate the African-American community and \nexperience.\n  There are many wonderful private museums that are dedicated to the \npreservation and presentation of the African-American art, culture and \nhistory. These museums contribute greatly to their communities, and \nshould continue. On a different scale, however, there should be a \nnational African-American Museum. We need an institution that can serve \nas a national and international center.\n  A national museum dedicated to education and research would provide a \nbroader and better understanding of the contributions made by African-\nAmericans. The inadequate presentation and preservation of African-\nAmerican life, art, history and culture undermines the ability of \nAmericans to understand themselves and their past.\n  With a better understanding of our collective past, we will be a \nstronger Nation. There are many issues abroad and at home that clamor \nfor our immediate attention. To face these issues, we need a \ncomprehensive understanding of our history.\n  Of the 30 million visitors to the Smithsonian every year, many are \nfrom other countries. After visiting the African-American museum, these \ntravelers will have a more complete understanding of our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that these are times of fiscal constraint. \nThis legislation does not require any additional appropriation.\n  Currently, one corner of the Smithsonian's Arts and Industries \nBuilding has been set aside for the African-American Museum project. \nClaudine Brown, the project's current director, and her staff have \nworked hard on this temporary exhibit. Ms. Brown will soon be leaving \nthe project to return to New York. Her contribution has helped to lay \nthe foundation upon which we can now build.\n  I was disappointed last Congress when this legislation did not pass \nthe Senate prior to adjournment last Congress. That unfortunate \noutcome, however, makes our renewed initiative all the more pressing. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in support of the National African \nAmerican Museum Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 649\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to increase the amount of credit available to fuel \nlocal, regional, and national economic growth by reducing the \nregulatory burden imposed upon financial institutions, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n   the economic growth and regulatory paperwork reduction act of 1995\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, credit availability is vital to the \nlivelihood of every American. It is the fuel that drives personal \nfinancial, business, and economic growth in this country.\n  Promoting greater credit availability should, therefore, be an \nimportant economic policy goal. I know that it is to me. For this \nreason, for the third Congress in a row, I am introducing comprehensive \nregulatory relief legislation aimed at reducing the burdens that drive \nup the cost of credit and hamper credit availability.\n  Three years ago, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination \nCouncil released a study that found that the regulatory cost of \ncompliance was as high as $17.5 billion a year. Mr. President, that was \n3 years ago. While Senator Mack and I were successful in gaining some \nrelief last year in the Community Development Financial Institutions \nand Regulatory Relief Act, regulatory initiatives continue to flood the \npages of the Federal Register, inflating it to all-time highs.\n  Mr. President, fighting Government regulation and regulatory burdens \nis not a one time battle; it is a constant battle. It is a war that \nnever ends, but only ebbs.\n  After months of comments and input from bankers and regulators, \nSenator Mack and I have returned once again to forge an ambitious \ncomprehensive reform bill that promises long-overdue relief to an \noverburdened financial services industry.\n  Like last year's bill, this year's bill targets laws and regulations \nthat impose regulatory burdens which are extraneous to safety and \nsoundness concerns and act to restrict rather than promote credit \navailability.\n  The bill strikes out at the giants that hold down lending with \nexcessive costs, like Truth-in-Lending and RESPA, Truth-in-Savings, the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act, and other overly burdensome laws whose \nlegitimate central purpose has been lost in a sea of regulation.\n  The bill streamlines or cuts duplicative and unnecessary reporting \nrequirements, eliminates excessive compliance costs, and reforms laws \nthat no longer make sense and cost the industry millions without any \ncorresponding benefit to either the consumer or the health and \nstability of the banking system.\n  Mr. President, an example of a law that may have had good intentions \nbut does not make sense and has cost the banking industry about $400 \nmillion is the Truth-in-Savings Act. A law intended to prevent \ninstitutions from calculating interest on investible balances has \nbecome a leviathon of Broad, highly complex disclosure requirements \nthat extend far beyond the original intent of the law.\n  Consumer protection laws should do just that, Mr. President. Laws \nlike Truth-in-Lending and Truth-in-Savings have become so complex that \nthe actual benefits these laws confer on consumers are highly \nquestionable.\n  Another law consistently identified as one of the most burdensome and \nin need of review is the Community Reinvestment Act. CRA is seen as all \nstick \n[[Page S4929]] and no carrot. Even though banks expend significant \nresources to adequately comply with the law, they are susceptible to \nprotests that promote meritless delay and result in extortive \npractices.\n  Large banks with billions in assets have less difficulty diverting \nassets to achieve compliance under the law than does the small, \ncommunity bank. The livelihood of small banks--under $250 million in \nassets--is by their very nature dependent upon reinvesting in their \ncommunity.\n  Mr. President, the costs on community banks are tangible and \nquantifiable, wile the benefits of imposing CRA compliance on community \nbanks are illusive and questionable.\n  If not properly reformed, CRA threatens to be an albatross of redtape \nand complexity with little or no way of gauging its benefits or \nsuccess.\n  Reducing regulatory burden and compliance costs on our financial \ninstitutions promotes credit availability, facilitates capital \ncreation, and fuels our business, our communities, and our economy.\n  Mr. President, our bill today represents a starting point. The \nprocess is open and I expect a great deal of dialogue on the core of \nour bill as introduced, as well as many other relief provisions that \nmay be raised for inclusion in the process.\n  Congressman Bereuter is introducing similar regulatory relief \nlegislation in the House today. Mr. President, with the support of the \nHouse and Senate leadership and Banking Committee Chairmen D'Amato and \nLeach, I am confident that our regulatory relief legislation will gain \nthe same broad bipartisan support it enjoyed last year, and I would \nurge my colleagues to support this bill.\n Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nwith Senator Shelby, Senator Mack, and Senator D'Amato to reduce the \npaperwork burden for our Nation's financial services companies. I \nbelieve we can streamline paperwork burdens and at the same time \nimprove the usefulness of disclosures to consumers. Anyone who has \nrecently gone through financing or refinancing a mortgage knows that \ntoo much paperwork can overwhelm consumers and defeat the purpose of \nthese consumer disclosures.\n  I applaud the Clinton administration's efforts at regulatory relief \nand believe this bill will complement their efforts. For instance, the \nadministration is expected to shortly release their revision of the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act [CRA], that should address many of the \nconcerns we have over the application of the act. Once we have the \nopportunity to review the proposed revision, I expect we will make \nchanges to the CRA provisions in this legislation.\n  We all support the goals of CRA but feel its implementation can be \nimproved. I have heard from smalltown Nevada bankers who have to take \npersonnel away from providing loans in order to meet paperwork \nrequirements. I believe there are better ways to achieve the goals of \nCRA that don't entail the diversion of valuable resources. I look \nforward to working with the administration in crafting an effective CRA \nmechanism.\n  I believe this bill builds on the success of efforts last year to \nreduce unnecessary regulatory burdens. In the Community Development \nBanking and Financial Institutions Act, Public Law 103-325, a number of \npaperwork burdens were streamlined. I was particularly proud of the \nreforms we accomplished in the area of currency transaction reports \n[CTR's]. The law requires a 30-percent reduction in the number of CTR's \nfinancial institutions must file while, at the same time, improving law \nenforcement's ability to track down money launderers. These kinds of \nreforms are critical if we are to keep American industry competitive.\n  While I do not believe this legislation is perfect, I do believe it \nraises a number of areas which must be worked on and improved. The \nadministration is aware of this need and will be working with us every \nstep of the way. I am confident that we can craft legislation that both \nreduces unnecessary paperwork and improves consumer protection at the \nsame time. That is my goal and will be my guiding principle throughout \nthis process.\n  The thrust of this legislation is in the right direction. I do not \nsupport all of its provisions and, in fact, have difficulty with the \nmagnitude of some of these changes. However, I believe this legislation \nstarts us down the path of coming up with a compromise bill which \nPresident Clinton can sign.\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I am pleased to cosponsor the \nEconomic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This \nbill opens the door for a meaningful deliberation on the regulatory \nburdens choking our Nation. As cochairman of the Senate Regulatory \nRelief Task Force with Senator Hutchison, we have examined our Nation's \nregulatory framework and identified those rules which impede economic \ngrowth without providing offsetting social benefits.\n  In particular, regulation is choking our Nation's banks. This \nlegislation seeks to end the cycle of mounting regulation in that \nindustry. I applaud the bill's efforts to eliminate burdensome rules \nand to streamline reporting and compliance procedures. My colleagues \nSenators Shelby and Mack have provided a great starting point for the \ndebate on banking regulation reform. I will continue to work with them \nin refining this legislation so that it upholds the safety and \nsoundness of the banking system while satisfying the investment needs \nof our communities.\n  Mr. President, the cost of regulatory compliance is astounding. The \nFederal Financial Institutions Examination Council estimates that the \nindustry's annual compliance costs exceed $17.5 billion. This burden is \nthe result of decades of largely unintegrated legislative and \nregulatory initiatives.\n  Since 1968 our Nation's banks have faced a major new law almost every \n11 months. In the past 5 years, Congress has passed more than 40 laws \naffecting bank operations. While most of these laws begin as well-\nintentioned ideas, they usually mushroom into administrative complexity \nunintended by Congress.\n  This layering of regulation--bill after bill, year after year--has \ncreated great inefficiency, redundancy, overlap, and common \ncontradiction in the laws that govern the banking industry. We must end \nthis cycle.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 651. A bill to establish the Office of the Inspector General \nwithin the General Accounting Office, modify the procedure for \ncongressional work requests for the General Accounting Office, \nestablish a Peer Review Committee, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n  the general accounting office oversight and improvement act of 1995\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the General \nAccounting Office Oversight and Reform Act. The GAO is Congress' \nwatchdog, auditor, and analyst, and in carrying out its important \nmission the GAO has a significant influence on our Nation's legislative \nagenda.\n  Due to the importance of the GAO's mission, the Congress has an \nobligation to ensure that the agency meets the highest standards of \nexcellence and maintains a reputation beyond reproach. Unfortunately, \nin recent years, numerous complaints about bias, partisanship, and \ninferior work quality have dogged the agency. The legislation I am \nintroducing today will take the necessary remedial steps. It would \ninstitute independent oversight of the agency and bolster the GAO's \ninternal quality control procedures.\n  Mr. President, the legislation seeks to create an independent office \nof the inspector general within the GAO. With a budget of over $400 \nmillion and over 4,000 employees, the GAO should have an independent \nofficer to monitor its activities and improve the efficiency and \neffectiveness of its programs.\n  This proposal also seeks to institute a number of changes in GAO's \noperating procedures to enhance fairness, professionalism, and \nnonpartisanship. First, the bill would require the Comptroller General \nto notify the ranking member of a committee when the GAO is received \nfrom the chairman of a committee. It would also require notification in \nthe Congressional Record when the GAO approves any work request. These \nmeasures will improve communication between GAO and Congress in a \nnonpartisan manner and address the concern that the GAO can be used for \npartisan sneak attacks.\n  [[Page S4930]] Second, the bill would codify a GAO policy that gives \nequal status to requests from committee chairman and ranking members. \nAs an objective investigator and fact finder, the GAO should be \nstatutorily required to treat these requests equally. Third, the bill \nwould also require the GAO to provide affected agencies with an \nopportunity to comment on GAO's findings and to include relevant \ncomments in its investigative reports.\n  Only two-thirds of GAO's reports include such written input, and \nMembers can ask the GAO to forgo contacting the agency. This practice \nis unfair and unwarranted.\n  Fourth, the bill would require the GAO to reference its sources of \nfactual information and list all organizations contacted in the conduct \nof an investigation. This will reassure the Congress and the public \nthat all reports are researched fairly and thoroughly.\n  Fifth, the bill will prohibit the release of any report until GAO's \ninternal quality control procedures have been complied with. The \npremature release of unconfirmed reports should not be permitted.\n  In addition to these specific statutory changes, Mr. President, this \nlegislation would establish a special GAO peer review committee to help \ncraft appropriate and responsible measures.\n  Among the directives that this bill vests the panel with are: The \nformation of a formal GAO product review process which will enable \nagencies to appeal to the GAO to correct factual errors, and reconsider \ncertain findings; the implementation of guidelines to eliminate \ninappropriate advocacy of policy; developing a policy that would enable \ncongressional requesters to remain anonymous to the actual GAO auditors \nor investigators; ending duplicative or superfluous auditing and \ninvestigative activities; and reporting to the Congress on the number \nof man hours expended and the cost incurred by respondents to GAO \naudits.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the bill calls on the Comptroller General to \nimplement the recommendations of the peer review committee to the \ngreatest extent practicable. The Comptroller General will be required \nto notify the congressional leadership in writing regarding any peer \nreview panel recommendations he rejects.\n  Let me say that I believe the GAO does an excellent job in many \nareas, and that most GAO employees are well trained, highly motivated, \nand honorable public servants. The Comptroller General should be \ncongratulated on his many successes and his continued commitment to \ncorrect problems--real and perceived--at the GAO.\n  Nevertheless, the GAO has been the subject of disturbing criticism in \nrecent years. Most disturbing is the perception that the GAO has become \narbitrary and ineffective, and suffers from insufficient oversight of \nits own. The GAO cannot afford to have its credibility eroded by \ncontinuing questions about whether the GAO is subservient to major \nrequesters, or that there has been a decline in knowledge of Federal \nprograms.\n  Clearly, the GAO can only be as effective as its reputation for \nobjectivity, fairness, and accuracy. I believe this legislation will \nhelp improve the reality and perception of all of these key factors. \nThe enactment of this legislation would be good for the GAO, the \nCongress, and the people we have been elected to serve.\n  It is time for checks and balances at the GAO. The creation of an \nindependent inspector general and improved quality control procedures \nat the GAO will ensure that the Congress and the American people have a \nwatchdog of the highest integrity and excellence. We deserve that much \nand can afford no less.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 653.

This boat has a relatively small passenger capacity, \ncarrying up to 49 passengers on a charter business based out of Hull, \nMA. The purpose of this bill is to waive those sections of the Jones \nAct which prohibit foreign-made vessels from operating in coastwise \ntrade. The waiver is necessary because, under the law, a vessel is \nconsidered foreign-made unless all major components of its hull and \nsuperstructure are fabricated in the United States and the vessel is \nassembled entirely in the United States. This vessel was originally \nbuilt in a foreign shipyard in 1957, but since then has been owned and \noperated by American citizens. The owners of Aura have invested \nsubstantially more than the cost of building the boat in making repairs \nto it and maintaining it--in American shipyards with American products. \nThey wish to start a small business, a charter boat operation, \nseasonally taking people out of Hull.\n  After reviewing the facts in the case of the Aura, I find that this \nwaiver does not compromise our national readiness in times of national \nemergency, which is the fundamental purpose of the Jones Act \nrequirement. While I generally support the provisions of the Jones Act, \nI believe the specific facts in this case warrant a waiver to permit \nthe Aura to engage in coastwise trade.

In addition, Sunrise is a catamaran, a type of \nvessel which was not built in the United States prior to 1992. The \nowners of Sunrise have invested substantially in the outfitting of the \nvessel and wish to start a small business, a charter boat operation, \nseasonally taking people out of Boston. At the present time they will \nnot be in competition with any other similar vessels.\n  After reviewing the facts in the case of the Sunrise, I find that \nthis waiver does not compromise our national readiness in times of \nnational emergency, which is the fundamental purpose of the Jones Act \nrequirement.

Mr. President, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee \non East Asian and Pacific Affairs, I would like to take this \nopportunity to call my colleagues' attention to an issue that, while \nsomewhat obscure, has the potential to escalate into a dangerous \nregional conflict with serious repercussions for the United States: \ncompeting jurisdictional claims to the Spratly Islands.\n  The Spratlys comprise 21 islands and atolls, 50 submerged land spits, \nand 28 partly submerged rock groups and reefs. Totaling less than 5 \nsquare kilometers in area, these islets are spread out over 340,000 \nsquare miles in the southern third of the South China Sea, one of the \nworld's largest marginal seas. The largest island, Itu Aba, is only \nfour-tenths of a square mile in area; Spratly Island, after which the \ngroup is named, measures only 0.15 square miles. Portions of the area \nare claimed by most of the sea's littoral states; the People's Republic \nof China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Brunei. All, \nwith the exception of Brunei, maintain a military presence on the \nislands.\n  Their interest is based on more than mere fishing rights or \nterritorial aggrandizement. It is thought--although not yet known \nconclusively--that the islands overlie vast reserves of oil and natural \ngas. The South China Sea in general is one of the most productive \noffshore petroleum areas in the world; since 1950, 29 oil fields and 4 \ngas fields have been developed there. This makes possession of the \nSpratlys quite attractive to the area's developing economies.\n  What many view as China's increasingly hegemonistic interest in the \narea seems to be the principal cause of tension among the claimants. As \nwe all well know, China is clearly the emerging power in Asia. As the \nPRC has initiated limited free-market reforms and its economy expands, \nit has been able to devote more resources away from purely domestic \nconcerns and to assert itself--flex its muscle--more often in regional \naffairs. The PRC's growing visibility is unnerving to many of its \nneighbors. This is due in large measure to the fact that because the \nPRC's greater presence is increasingly exhibited in a buildup of its \nmilitary forces, it has increased the opportunity for armed conflicts \nwith those neighbors.\n  The PRC--and consequently the Republic of China on Taiwan--and \nVietnam both assert the oldest claims to the area. The PRC contends \nthat it has a long history of presence in the area, including: a \npurported naval discovery in the Western Han Dynasty around the year \n111 B.C., a 1292 Yuan Dynasty visitation by the Java-bound fleet of \nKublai Khan, and a Ming Dynasty survey of the islands by Cheng He, who \nis said to have visited the islands seven times between the years 1405 \nand 1433. While there is some evidence of intermittent visitation of \nsome of the Spratlys and surrounding waters by Chinese fishermen, \nrecords are sparse, incomplete, conflicting, and in the opinion of many \nscholars do not necessarily demonstrate a pattern of routine \noccupation, administration, or assertion of sovereign control \nsufficient to establish on airtight claim. For example, an official \nreport by the Chinese Government issued in 1928 set forth that \ncountry's southernmost delineation of its territory as the Parcel \nIslands and makes no mention of the Spratlys.\n  Vietnam's claim is based on historical arguments premised on events \nfrom before, during, and after occupation by its former colonial \noverlord, France. Recent Vietnamese pronouncements claim that its \ninvolvement with the Spratlys can be traced back to 1650-53, although I \nhave not yet seen a credible substantiation of that assertion. A \nfurther contact is claimed during the reign of Emperor Gialong in 1816, \nand an inaccurate Vietnamese map dated 1838 identifies the Spratlys \nunder the name Van Ly Truong Sa as a part of Vietnamese territory. \nInterest in the islands appears to have lapsed over the early- and mid-\nFrench occupation period, although the French Government sent a naval \nexpedition to the islands in 1933 and laid claim to seven groups of \nislets.\n  These conflicting Chinese and Vietnamese claims have in the not-\ndistant past resulted in verbal, and sometimes military, clashes. In \n1974, for example, the PRC occupied the South Vietnamese-claimed Parcel \nIslands--the Xisha Qundao--about 350 miles north of the Spratlys. The \nVietnamese forces lost and withdrew from the islands. A few days later, \nthough, 120 South Vietnamese soldiers landed on one of the Spratlys; \nthe PRC responded with a protest and a warning against any such future \naction. In March 1988, the PLA-N sank three Vietnamese naval transports \nin the Spratlys, killing 72 Vietnamese soldiers.\n  Beginning in the late 1970's, a growing economic dimension began to \nappear in the Sino-Vietnamese dynamic. When the PRC began open-door \neconomic reforms in 1978, the development of an offshore petroleum \nindustry was at the forefront. The PRC opened its continental shelf \nfrom the Bohai to Beibu Gulfs in 1979, and announced a series of Sino-\nforeign seismic survey agreements. Vietnam, in response, protested the \nsurveys as brazen violations ``of the territorial integrity of Vietnam \n[[Page S4933]] and its sovereignty over its natural resources.''\n  This verbal sparring over the competing claims continued until the \nearly 1990's, when the two countries began to swipe at each other using \noil concessions as their weapon. On May 8, 1992, the PRC's China \nNational Offshore Oil Co. granted an oil concession to Crestone Energy \nCo., a small American firm, for a 25,155 km\\2\\ area near the Vanguard \nBank (the Wanan Tan) which crossed over into Vietnamese-claimed areas. \nConsequently, Vietnam granted a concession to Mobil Corp. which \nencroached on Chinese claims, and in September 1992, Petrovietnam \nsigned a contract with Nopec, a Norwegian company, to do seismic \nsurveys. These competing claims threatened to precipitate another armed \nconflict last year when Vietnam began drilling in a concession that \nChina had previously granted to a United States company. Chinese ships \nblocked the drilling rig, but the matter was defused short of a martial \nclash and has become an ongoing topic of negotiation between the two.\n  The PRC did not help calm matters when, in February 1992, the \nNational People's Congress passed legislation--the Law of the People's \nRepublic of China on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone--\nlaying sole claim to the entire South China Sea and mentioning the \nSpratlys by name in article 2. The move to turn the South China Sea \ninto a Chinese lake is especially worrisome to many countries--even \nthose outside the region. The reason: the islands sit astride shipping \nlanes through which passes approximately 25 percent of the worlds trade \ngoods, including almost 70 percent of Japan's oil supplies.\n  The Sino-Vietnamese imbroglios are not the only point of bilateral \nfriction in the Spratlys; the most recent flare-ups involved the \nPhilippines. The Filipino claim is based on geographic contiguity, \nhistorical rights, and an assertion that the other countries involved \nin the area have previously abandoned their rights to the islands. In \n1947, a Filipino businessman named Tomas Cloma discovered a group of \nunoccupied islands in the Spratly chain which he named Kalayaan. The \nPhilippines' Government remained somewhat noncommittal about the claim; \nin 1955, the government set baselines around the Philippine archipelago \nand made no mention of Kalayaan. However, when in 1971 an ROK artillery \nbattery on Itu Aba fired on a Filipino fishing boat, in its official \nprotest the Philippines stated that it had legal title to the island \ngroup as a result of Cloma's occupation and because the islands were \nwithin the archipelagic territory of the Philippines. In 1974, Cloma \ntransferred Kalayaan to his Government, and in 1978 President Marcos \nofficially declared the islands to be part of the Philippines. Also in \nthat year, the Philippines' claims became more choate when it \ndiscovered oil and gas resources beneath the seabed.\n  Since then, Sino-Filipino competition for the islands has increased. \nRecently, China asserted claims to Jackson Atoll and Half Moon Reef--\nwhich are claimed by the Philippines--contending that ``they are part \nof China's Nanasha [Spratly] Islands and have always have been Chinese \nterritory.'' Intelligence reports indicate that the PRC has placed \nperimeter markers on both. Similarly, China has laid claim to the \nappropriately named Mischief (Panganiban) Reef. It was recently \nrevealed that the PRC has built a series of structures on the reef. The \nreef submerges at high tide, and the four concrete buildings are build \non pilings. I have seen pictures of them supplied by the Philippine \nGovernment.\n  The problem with this Chinese move is that the reef lies well within \nthe Philippines' 200-mile exclusive economic zone; it is only 135 \nnautical miles from Palawan, one of the Philippines' principal islands. \nBy contrast, it is more than 620 miles from the Chinese coast. In \naddition, the PRC has dispatched several naval vessels to the immediate \narea of the reef--two Yukan-class supply vessels and a Dazhi-class \nsubmarine-support ship. The presence of the latter begs the question as \nto whether there are not also Chinese submarines operating nearby. The \nPRC claims that the outpost in only meant to serve as a shelter for \nChinese fishermen. However, the addition of several parabolic antennae \nto the structures, the presence of the navy ships, and the PRC's \ndemonstrated keen interest in the islands, seem to militate against the \nveracity of such a statement. Moreover, in a move tinged with \njurisdictional overtones, the Chinese arrested several Filipino \nfishermen in the vicinity of the reef and held them for several days.\n  The Government of the Philippines has indicated that as a result of \nthe PRC's actions, it has felt pressured into increasing its military \npresence in the islands. Just this last weekend, in apparent \nretaliation for the Chinese arrests, the Philippine navy seized four \nChinese fishing vessels in the region of Alicia Annie which is in the \nFilipino Claim area.\n  Similarly, the Vietnamese are reported by Japan's Kyodo News Agency \nto have increased their military presence in the area by 50 percent as \na counter to the Chinese buildup. Clearly, the growing militarization \nof the region can only increase the probability that another skirmish \nwill break out.\n  The region's countries have not sat idly by while this problem has \nescalated. In July 1992, the members of ASEAN, the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nation's issued what has been called the Manila \nDeclaration on the south China Sea. The document--also acknowledged by\n Vietnam and the PRC--called on the parties to the dispute to exercise \nrestraint and settle the issue without resort to military force. \nASEAN's nonclaimants--Singapore, Indonesia, and Thailand--were urged to \nappoint an ``eminent persons group'' to build support for a complete \nfreeze on economic and military activity in disputed areas. The \ndeclaration also called on the United States to actively back the \ninitiative, and to support Indonesia's efforts to transform its \ninformal South China Sea workshops into an official negotiating forum \nunder the auspices of either the ASEAN regional forum or the U.N. \nSecurity Council. Talks would be based on accepting the Chinese \nposition of deferring claims to sovereignty and jointly developing any \navailable resources.\n\n  The response of the United States to this entire issue has been, in \nmy view, less than adequate. The strongest statements that I have seen \nfrom the administration so far are a lukewarm statement on February 14 \nof this year from a State Department spokeswoman, and a series of \nstatements by Adm. Richard Macke, head of the U.S. Pacific Command. \nMost recently the admiral stated, ``It is well known that we do not \nsupport any territorial claims with regard to [the] Spratlys. We \ncertainly encourage dialogue between the nations involved to solve the \ndifferences that exist over the Spratlys. Again, we support no \nindividual claim * * *.''\n  I generally agree with Admiral Macke. As long as the claimants do \nnothing to interfere with the rights of the world community to free \npassage through the South China Sea, it is my position that the United \nStates should not presently take sides among the claimants. Rather, we \nshould support the Manila Declaration and a rational, negotiated \nsettlement to the problem. In addition, while we should make clear to \nthe claimants that we are willing to make ourselves available to them \nto facilitate the provisions of the declaration, we should avoid \nunnecessary intrusion into what is a regional affair best settled by \nthe parties involved. In addition, pending any talks or resolution of \nthe conflict, I believe we need to make clear to the parties that any \nmove seeking to disturb the present status quo is unacceptable. It \nmakes no sense to try to get the parties to sit down and negotiate an \nend to the problem if, at the same time, they continue their jockeying \nfor military and territorial advantage.\n  Although I find myself generally in agreement with the U.S. position, \nI am not sure that the administration has been as forceful and \nunequivocal as it should be in getting our viewpoint across to the \nclaimants. While I understand from certain sources that our position is \nbeing made clear to each of the claimant states through our respective \nembassies, I would like to see a more public vociferous pronouncement \nof our stand. Mr. President, I have seen some indications from the \nState Department that it is presently \n[[Page S4934]] considering following this course. I applaud that move.\n  In the interim, however, I rise today--on behalf of myself and the \ndistinguished ranking minority member of the subcommittee, Senator \nRobb--to submit Senate Resolution 97, expressing the sense of the \nSenate with respect to peace and stability in the South China Sea. This \nresolution reaffirms the Senate's support of the view that the United \nStates takes no sides in the dispute. Moreover, it calls for a \ncessation of hostilities in the region, as well as a strict adherence \nto the provisions of the Manila declaration. Finally, it calls on the \nclaimants to observe the January 1995 status quo ante pending any \nnegotiations or resolution of the dispute. Mr. President, I hope that \nthis resolution will prod the administration into action, and will make \nthe views of the Senate clear to the claimant nations. I look forward \nto its swift adoption.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/30/senate-section/article/S4932-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4934-S4937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n           EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT OF 1995\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                BINGAMAN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 426\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Simon) proposed an \namendment to amendment No. 420 proposed by Mr. Hatfield to the bill \n(H.R. 1158) making emergency supplemental appropriations for additional \ndisaster assistance and making rescissions for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 1995, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 14, line 19, strike ``$100,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$113,000,000''.\n       On page 31, line 9, strike ``$26,988,000'' and insert \n     ``$13,988,000''.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                D'AMATO (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENTS NO. 427\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Helms, Mr. \nBrown, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Grams, Mr. \nPressler, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Craig, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Nickles) proposed \nan amendment to amendment No. 420 proposed by Mr. Hatfield to the bill \nH.R. 1158, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee favorably reported the nomination of Vice Adm. Joseph R. \nPrueher for promotion to the grade of admiral and assignment as Vice \nChief of Naval Operations.\n  [[Page S4938]] I ask that a joint statement from Senator Nunn and me \nconcerning this nomination be printed in the Record.\n  The joint statement follows:\n\nJoint Statement of Senator Strom Thurmond, Chairman of the Senate Armed \n    Services Committee and Senator Sam Nunn, Ranking Minority Member\n\n       The Committee on Armed Services has reported favorably the \n     nomination of Vice Admiral Joseph R. Prueher for promotion to \n     the 4-star grade of Admiral, to serve as the Vice Chief of \n     Naval Operations.\n       Admiral Prueher has had a distinguished career. He is a \n     graduate of the Naval Academy (with distinction). As a naval \n     aviator, he served in Southeast Asia aboard U.S.S. Kitty \n     Hawk, as a naval flight instructor at the Naval Air Test \n     Center in Patuxent River, Maryland, and as Executive \n     Assistant to the Secretary of the Navy. More recently, he \n     served as Commander, Carrier Group One in San Diego, CA, \n     where he was responsible for training battle groups preparing \n     to deploy to the Western Pacific and the Arabian Gulf. In \n     this capacity, he led the development of Maritime Joint \n     Forces Air Component Commander capabilities for the Pacific \n     theater. Today, he serves as the Commander, U.S. Sixth Fleet \n     in the Mediterranean Sea and as the Commander of NATO's \n     Striking and Support Forces Southern Europe. As Commander \n     Sixth Fleet, he has directed the execution of the Navy and \n     Marine Corps multi-mission role in the Adriatic Sea and \n     former Yugoslavia in United States and allied operations in \n     support of the United Nations. His awards include the Legion \n     of Merit (three Gold Stars in lieu of subsequent awards), the \n     Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with two Gold \n     Stars in lieu of subsequent awards.\n       From 1989 to 1991, he served as Commandant of Midshipman at \n     the United States Naval Academy. During his period as \n     Commandant, there was a well-publicized incident in which a \n     female midshipman, Gwen Dreyer, was mistreated by her male \n     colleagues. A number of the midshipmen involved in the \n     incident were disciplined, though none were dismissed from \n     the Academy. The responsibility for the investigation and \n     action on the investigation was vested in the Superintendent \n     of the Academy, Vice Admiral Virgil Hill. Admiral Prueher, as \n     Commandant of Midshipmen, was in the chain of command, under \n     which he exercised certain responsibilities with respect to \n     the investigation and subsequent action.\n       On April 28, 1992, he was nominated for promotion. The \n     Committee began its normal review process when matters of \n     this nature are involved in a nomination. While the \n     nomination was under review, the President withdrew a number \n     of nominations on September 9, 1992, including the nomination \n     of Admiral Prueher. The Committee understood this was as a \n     result of changes in Navy personnel requirements, and to \n     provide an opportunity for further review in the Executive \n     Branch of the Prueher nomination with respect to the issues \n     that had been identified.\n       On March 15, 1993, the President resubmitted the Prueher \n     nomination for promotion to Rear Admiral. Over the next five \n     months, the Committee reviewed the materials related to the \n     manner in which the incident was handled at the Naval \n     Academy, including the views of the Secretary of the Navy \n     endorsing the nomination. A copy of the Secretary's letter is \n     included at the end of this statement. On August 6, 1993, the \n     Committee considered and favorably reported the nomination. \n     The promotion to Rear Admiral was confirmed by the Senate on \n     August 3, 1993. Rear Admiral Prueher was subsequently \n     nominated for promotion to Vice Admiral on November 5, 1993. \n     His nomination was favorably reported to the Senate on \n     November 18, 1993, and was confirmed by the Senate on \n     November 19, 1993. The material concerning the Committee's \n     previous consideration of the Prueher nomination is retained \n     in the executive files of the Committee. It is available for \n     review by any Senator upon request.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/30/senate-section/article/S4937-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       THE SUCCESS OF FOREIGN AID\n Mr. SIMON.

Mr. President, I rise today to salute a prominent figure in \nWisconsin sports journalism, Mr. Bud Lea. Much to my dismay and the \ndismay of his many fans, Bud recently announced his decision to retire. \nFor his entire career, which has lasted 42 years, Bud Lea has followed \nsports for the Milwaukee Sentinel. During his many years with the \nSentinel, which by the way is the longest tenure of any Sentinel \nemployee, Bud has witnessed and written about some of the greatest \nmoments in Wisconsin sports history. From the Milwaukee Braves 1957 \nWorld Series victory to the legendary Green Bay Packers World \nChampionships of the late 1960's, Bud was there. From the Milwaukee \nBucks NBA Championship in 1971 to Marquette University's NIT and NCAA \nchampionships in 1970 and 1977 respectively, Bud was there. Whether it \nwas an Olympic Gold Medal for Bonnie Blair or Dan Jansen, or the \nUniversity of Wisconsin, Bud's alma mater, winning the 1994 Rose Bowl, \nBud was there.\n  The past 42 years have been good to Bud Lea, but they have been even \nbetter to those who have had the privilege to read his column. His \nstraightforward and often humorous column greeted all Wisconsin sports \nfans with an early morning recap of the day's sports news. With his \nretirement, Bud Lea, a native of Green Bay, has more than etched his \nname into the annals of Wisconsin sports history, he has become part of \nthat history. Bud's retirement is well deserved, and I wish him, his \nlovely wife Filomena and his sons, Perry and Dean, well. \nCongratulations Bud Lea--dean of Milwaukee sports columnists and sports \nwriters.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/30/senate-section/article/S4938-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               THE DOLLAR'S DECLINE AS DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, we are receiving regular reminders \nobliquely of the need for a balanced budget amendment.\n  In Sunday's Washington Post Jane Bryant Quinn's column ends with the \nwords: ``Big cuts in the federal deficit would improve confidence \nabroad. But Congress and the voters aren't there yet.''\n  And in a column by Stan Hinden there is reference to Donald P. Gould, \na California money manager of a mutual fund.\n  In the Hinden column, among other things, he says: ``Gould noted that \nthe global strength of the dollar has been slipping for 25 years--\nexcept for an upward blip in the early 1980's.''\n  It is not sheer coincidence that for 26 years in a row we have been \noperating with a budget deficit.\n  Hinden also notes in his column:\n\n       Since 1970, the dollar has lost more than 60 percent of its \n     value in relation to the German mark and has dropped almost \n     75 percent in relation to the Japanese yen. In 1970, it took \n     3.65 German marks to buy one U.S. dollar. As of last week, \n     you could buy a dollar with only 1.40 marks.\n\n  I served in Germany in the Army after World War II, and I remember it \ntook a little more than 4 marks to buy a dollar.\n  The Washington Post writer also notes:\n\n       Gould, who is president and founder of the Franklin \n     Templeton Global Trust--which used to be called the \n     Huntington Funds--is not optimistic about the dollar's \n     future. He sees little chance that the United States will be \n     able to solve the fiscal and economic problems that have \n     helped the dollar depreciate.\n\n  We are getting that message from people all over the world.\n  I cannot understand why we do not listen.\n  Finally, Donald Gould is quoted as saying:\n\n       For the first time I am aware of, during a global flight to \n     quality, that quality has been defined as marks and yen and \n     not dollars.\n\n  I hope we start paying attention to this kind of information.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/30/senate-section/article/S4938-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S4939]]\n\n                    IN MEMORY OF MATTHEW ELI PUCCIO\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, with much sorrow, I would like to \ntell the Members of the Senate of a horrible loss. On Sunday, February \n26, 1995, Matthew Eli Puccio, a young gentleman from New York City, was \ninvolved in a terrible accident that took his life.\n  Matthew shall be remembered fondly by his parents, teachers, and \nfriends as a young man of exceptional character and kindness. His \ndeparture is felt by us all.\n  Matthew's mother, Carol L. Ziegler, recently sent to me a short paper \nthat Matthew had written for a school journalism assignment. In this \npaper, he discusses term limits and his personal opposition to the \nissue. I believe that many of my colleagues in both Houses of Congress \nwill find Matthew Puccio's paper of interest, and I ask that the text \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The text follows:\n\n       Over the past few years, some politicians, primarily \n     Republicans, have proposed term limits be set for Members of \n     Congress. Term limit means that a Member of Congress can be \n     elected only a certain number of times. To be exact, since \n     1990, 23 million people in 16 States have voted for this law \n     to be passed. Most of these people in 16 States have voted \n     for this law to be passed. Most of these people want term \n     limits to increase electoral competition. They want change \n     every now and then. If this law were actually passed, it \n     would be a mistake. What if a Member of Congress is doing a \n     good job? Take New York Senator, Patrick Moynihan, for \n     example. He has just been elected to his third term and is \n     doing a great job in office. Why should they be pulled from \n     office at risk of being replaced by someone who would do less \n     of a job? In this case, what is the need for change? On the \n     other hand, if a Member of Congress is doing a bad job and \n     wants to run again, he could always be voted out.\n       Setting term limits also takes away a politician's \n     constitutional rights. Why shouldn't he or she be allowed to \n     run for office as much as they want, with the intention of \n     helping their country? If they are not elected, they are not \n     elected, but they should have the chance. On the flip side, \n     this also takes away the people's constitutional rights. Why \n     shouldn't the people be allowed to have who they want in \n     Congress, regardless of how long he has been in office? More \n     specifically, term limits violate the Bill of Rights which \n     list the freedoms of the people. Term limits may seem like an \n     easy answer but it is just unfair. Elections are the people's \n     choice. Anyone should be allowed to be in Congress for as \n     long as they want, as long as they are doing a good job, and \n     the people want to vote them in.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/30/senate-section/article/S4939-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             EVERYBODY WINS\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, this month on Capitol Hill an \nexciting literacy program began with the help of Senators and Senate \nstaff. The children of the Brent Elementary School are now being read \nto once a week during their lunch hour by volunteers in the Everybody \nWins Program. Everybody Wins is a successful literacy program started \nin New York City, which matches up professionals with at-risk, inner-\ncity school children as reading partners.\n  During each power lunch session, the reading partners select a book \nand read aloud together--an activity that the Commission on Reading \ncalls the single most important activity for building a child's \neventual success in reading.\n  Everybody Wins, started by businessman Arthur Tannenbaum in New York \nCity, is for the first time branching out to Washington, DC, and \nenlisted the help of the Senate to reach out to their neighbors on \nCapitol Hill. The bipartisan support in the Senate began when I joined \nSenator Jeffords' efforts to implement the program. All of the Senators \non the Labor and Human Resources Subcommittee on Education, Arts, and \nHumanities have since become involved.\n  Already 7 Senators and over 100 Senate staff members are reading to \nchildren during their lunch hours. Many of the Senators who are working \nwith the program are so impressed that they are moving to implement \nEverybody Wins in cities in their own States. Mr. Tannenbaum's ultimate \ngoal is to have every child in the country read to either by a parent \nor relative or a volunteer.\n  I want to commend Mr. Arthur Tannenbaum on his hard work, his \nleadership in this area, and his strong commitment to improving the \nlives of children.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/30/senate-section/article/S4939-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              THE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD.

Mr. President, as we review all options for reducing \nFederal expenditures, I am very much of the mind that we should not \nreduce Federal education assistance. In my opinion, education is an \ninvestment in our people and in the future strength and health of our \nNation. This is particularly true for programs that are targeted to \nenhance the educational opportunities of those citizens who need our \nhelp the most.\n  It is without doubt that every aspect of our lives depends upon a \nwell-educated citizenry. I fear that cutbacks in Federal education aid \ndiminish achieving that goal, and weaken our ability to retain our \nleadership in the world marketplace.\n  As we debate this rescission bill, however, it is also important that \nwe keep things in perspective. While I regret some of the cutbacks that \nare part of the package under consideration, it is only fair that we \nacknowledge that the legislation before us is far better than that so \nrecently approved by the House. In education, for example, the cutbacks \nare a full $1 billion less than those in the House bill.\n  In many areas, there is very good news. There are, for example, no \ncuts in student aid, no reduction in Pell grants, no cutbacks in \ncampus-based aid, and no curtailment of funding for the SSIG Program.\n  Aid for the vitally important Dropout Prevention Program is \ncontinued. Cutbacks in safe and drug-free schools are a full 80 percent \nless than those in the House-passed bill. There are few, if any, \ncutbacks in literacy programs that reach out to help those in need of \nthese services. Cuts in library services and construction are very \nsmall. And, funds are provided for a new and very important program of \naid in civics and economic education exchanges with the emerging \ndemocracies of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.\n  Thus, while I may have differences on some of the cutbacks contained \nin this legislation, I find I can support a majority of the provisions \nwith considerable enthusiasm. I believe we must look carefully at the \ndetails of this bill. While some provisions could be improved, most are \nquite encouraging. I want, therefore, to commend Chairman Hatfield, the \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee, and especially their staff for \nthe very long, hard, and thoughtful work they have put into this \nlegislation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/30/senate-section/article/S4940-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             CHANGE OF VOTE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about a subject \nthat has taken a lot of time and attention, particularly in these days, \nwhich goes I think to the heart of the American dream and the future \nthat we face as a nation.

Mr. President, thank you for your patience and \nindulgence.\n  Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak about affirmative action. \nThere has been a great deal of discussion about affirmative action \nlately. Unfortunately, too little of that discussion has focused on the \nfacts. Affirmative action is about working people, about middle-class \nfamilies, and about jobs.\n  It is about the basic right of all Americans to have access to \neducation, to have the opportunity to get a good job, to have the \nopportunity to be promoted when they work hard--to do better than their \nparents did. It is, quite simply, about ensuring fundamental economic \nfairness for all our citizens.\n  We have come a long way in ensuring that economic opportunity exists \nfor all Americans; yet much work remains to be done. That is why it \nwould be extremely shortsighted at this point in time for the Senate to \nretreat on affirmative action. Before we act, we must consider all of \nthe facts.\n  We cannot allow cynical political games to be played with an issue of \nthis much importance. And we cannot allow ourselves to fall prey to \nattempts to make affirmative action a debate about race. It is not. \nWhat affirmative action is really about is fundamental fairness. It is \nabout whether each of us will be allowed to fully participate in \nsociety, regardless of our gender or race, or will instead be held back \nby conditions that have nothing to do with merit, or talents and \nabilities. It is a debate that lies at the core of our national \neconomic competitiveness.\n\n\n                   the truth about affirmative action\n\n  Mr. President, if we consider all the facts, it is abundantly clear \nthat affirmative action is about equal economic opportunity, not just \nfor minorities, but for women as well. It is about providing a chance \nto compete for those who may still be limited by a glass ceiling or \nartificial barriers to participation in our economy. In addition, \naffirmative action is now a business imperative for our country. In \nspite of the rhetoric and myths surrounding this concept, the truth is \nthat every American stands to benefit when each citizen is given a \nchance to contribute to the maximum extent of his or her ability.\n  Our work force is changed. Our country has moved in the direction of \nmaking the American dream of opportunity a dream that is open to all \nAmericans. Affirmative action has played a major role in opening up \ndoors and providing opportunity for the millions of people who did not \nhave a chance to participate in the full range of economic activities \nthis country has to offer. And our society has benefitted as a result.\n  In 1964, when the first Executive order on affirmative action was \nissued, there were approximately 74 million working Americans. By last \nyear, that number had grown to just over 123 million. In other words, \nsince 1964, our economy has created 50 million new jobs. Although women \nand minorities entered the work force in unprecedented numbers, these \nnew jobs were not created by taking away jobs held by men. Rather, they \nwere created by making use of the talents that a diverse work force \nbrings to our economy, and using those talents to help create new \neconomic growth and more, new jobs. Affirmative action is not about \ntaking away opportunity but about creating it.\n  I would like to take a moment to review the experience working women \nhave had with affirmative action. Because many employers made a \ncommitment to fostering diversity, women made significant inroads into \nprofessions that had previously been off limits to them. In 1972, women \ncomprised a mere 3 percent of architects. By 1993, that number had \nclimbed to 18.6 percent. In 1972, women were 10 percent of all \nphysicians, but by 1993, that number had grown to 22 percent. In 1972, \nwomen made only 4 percent of all lawyers, a number that grew to 23 \npercent by 1993. And, I might add, this is despite the fact that the \nSupreme Court, in Bradwell versus Illinois, once upheld a decision by \nmy home State to deny an eminently qualified woman, Myra \n[[Page S4941]] Bradwell, the right to practice law, solely on the basis \nof her gender.\n  Women have made equally significant gains in the science fields. In \n1972, women comprised a dismal 0.8 percent\n of all engineers--less than 1 percent! But by 1993, that number had \ngrown to 8.6 percent. In chemistry, women's share of the jobs grew from \n10 percent in 1972 to almost 30 percent in 1993.\n\n  In 1972, there were so few female airline pilots that the Department \nof Labor did not even bother to keep track. By 1993, women were 4 \npercent of airline pilots--a gain worth celebrating, although there is \nclearly still a long way to go. In the advertising profession, women \nwent from 22 percent of the work force in 1972, to 50 percent in 1993--\nalmost equal their percentage of the population. And the good news does \nnot stop there. Women hold 42 percent of college teaching positions, \ncompared to 28 percent in 1972.\n  Even more importantly, a rapidly growing number of women now own \ntheir own businesses--they are the bosses! During a recent 5-year \nperiod, the number of women-owned businesses increased by 58 percent, \nfour times the rate of growth for all businesses. And during that same \nperiod, the revenues for women-owned businesses nearly tripled to over \n$275 billion. The number of women-owned manufacturing businesses more \nthan doubled in that 5-year period, and the revenues of those \nbusinesses increased almost six-fold over those 5 years.\n  I could go on--and in the coming weeks and months, I will. But today, \nI simply want to underscore that the achievements working women have \nmade, would not have occurred without a commitment by employers' to \nseek out, and to foster, diversity. Affirmative action is at the heart \nof that commitment.\n\n\n                african-american men still most in need\n\n  Mr. President, it is also worth pointing out--when we discuss the \nprogress that women have made--that African-Americans in general, and \nAfrican-American men in particular, have benefitted the least of any \ngroup from affirmative action. When you say the words, ``affirmative \naction,'' many people automatically think of a black man as the \nbeneficiary.\n  Consider this: Median annual earnings for African-American men have \nactually shown little or no improvement over the past two decades \ncompared to white men. In 1975, black men earned 74.3 percent of what \nwhite males did. In 1985, that figure was 69.7 percent, a drop of \nalmost 5 percent points. In 1993, that figure was back up to 74 \npercent--but still lower than the 1975 level.\n  In 1979, 99.1 percent of senior level male employees were white, \nwhile 0.2 percent were black. In 1989, the figure for white males had \ndeclined slightly to 96.9 percent, while blacks has risen to 0.6 \npercent--still less than 1 percent.\n  Unfortunately, the lack of progress by black men applies across the \nboard, regardless of qualifications or education level. And the fact \nremains that, for black men, professional degrees do not necessarily \nclose the earnings gap: African-American men with professional degrees \nearn 79 percent of the amount earned by white males who hold the same \ndegree, and who are in the same job category.\n  And finally, a Wall Street Journal study showed that in the 1990-91 \nrecession, black men were the only\n group that suffered a net employment loss. They suffered job losses in \n36 States, and in 6 of the 9 major industries. They held 59,479 fewer \njobs at the end of the recession than they had held at the beginning. I \ncould go on citing statistics. But what these numbers tell us is that, \ndespite the claims of affirmative action opponents, black men are not \ntaking all of the jobs that were formerly held by white men.\n\n  This group--black men--is the segment of the population that has \nfaced the most persistent discrimination, that has encountered the \ntoughest problems, and has had the longest road to travel. Without our \npast efforts to create equal opportunity, black men might be much worse \noff; at the very least, this is not the time to compound the problem.\n  The fact remains that, while white men are approximately one-third of \nthe population, they comprise 80 percent of the Congress, hold four-\nfifths of tenured positions at colleges and universities, constitute 95 \npercent of Fortune 500 companies' senior managers and 99.9 percent of \nprofessional athletic team owners, and have been 100 percent of U.S. \nPresidents. I addition, an examination of historical unemployment \ntables debunks the myth that jobs are going to black men at the expense \nof white males. The fact is that unemployment rates for white males \nhave remained relatively steady, while unemployment rates for black \nmales have increased. In 1972, unemployment among white males was 5.1 \npercent, compared to 10.4 percent for black males. In 1994, the \nunemployment level for white males was 5.3 percent, a slight increase \nof +0.2 percentage points from 1972. In contrast, the 1994 unemployment \nrate for black males was 11.5 percent, an increase of +1.1 percentage \npoints. Again, in spite of affirmative action, the facts show that \nwhite men are not losing jobs to black men.\n  I cite the numbers because it is important, I think, to debunk the \nnotion that affirmative action is a zero sum game that pits one group \nof Americans against another, and may be seen as a basis for dividing \nus to whatever degree is necessary. This is why this debate is so \nimportant and why we have to communicate the truth about affirmative \naction to the people. As my mother used to say, we may be as different \nas the five fingers are, but we are all parts of one hand. We need each \nother and the benefits that our diversity provides. To allow \naffirmative action to be reduced to a them versus us conflict\n allows a short-sighted political game to obscure our common long term \ninterests.\n\n  The fact is, as Americans, we are all in this together, and we all \nhave a tremendous challenge to face together in this time of change in \nthe world, and in our country. Affirmative action ought to be the focus \nof our collective efforts to make things better for everyone--it ought \nto be part of a great debate about the direction we must take--\ntogether--to address the critical economic and social issues of our \ntime.\n  We have a significant economic agenda to tackle. We need to continue \nour work toward balancing the budget, toward restoring fiscal \nresponsibility to the Federal Government, and toward ensuring that our \nchildren--and their children--will not be saddled with a legacy of \ndebt. We need to create jobs. We need to ensure that every American who \nis able to work, can work. We need to ensure that our children are sent \nto learn in schools that are not hazardous to their health, and that \nwill prepare them to compete in today's global marketplace.\n  If there is any objective that should command complete American \nconsensus, it is ensuring that every American has the chance to \nsucceed--and that, in the final analysis, is what affirmative action is \nall about. No issue is more critical to our country, and no issue is \nmore critical to Me. Nothing makes a bigger difference in a person's \nlife than opening up opportunities. Certainly, nothing has made a \nbigger difference in my life--and nothing has had a more positive \nimpact on the economic well-being of our Nation.\n\n\n            no quotas or preferences--and merit does matter\n\n  The fact is that the successes in the economy that women and minority \nmen have achieved over these past three decades since the first \naffirmative action executive order by President Johnson have not been \ndue to quotas.\n  The quota debate is a fake. It is a fraud. It is an attempt to reduce \naffirmative action to an absurdity that serves only to pander to \nnegative emotions. It is a myth that only those who either do not know \nor do not care about the truth would even discuss in the context of \naffirmative action. Quota is often the buzz-word of choice used by \nthose who prefer myth to truth, and who want to create fear from \ninsecurity and confusion. When we speak of affirmative action, we are \ntalking\n about a range of activities calculated to support opportunity and \ndiversity in the workplace and in our economy. We are talking about \ngoals and timetables, not quotas. What goals do is encourage employers \nto look at their workforce, to consider if women and minorities are \nunderrepresented and--if they are--to try and correct the situation. \nGoals are flexible, temporary, and are instruments of inclusion. There \nare no legal penalties if \n[[Page S4942]] employers make good faith efforts, but are unable to \ncomply with their goals or timetables.\n  The perspective of affirmative action is actually the opposite--the \nreverse--of the quota perspective. The quota argument suggests that one \nlook at numbers before the fact to limit opportunity for some. \nAffirmative action, on the other hand, looks at numbers after the fact, \nto observe the effects of diversity in the workplace. The two concepts \nare simply incompatible. Affirmative action does not tell employers \nthey have to hire 12.5 women, or 2.5 native Americans--or that they \nhave to follow any inflexible numeric formula. Instead it provides a \nbenchmark for diversity, a progress report, if you will, to help \ndecisionmakers, employees, identify whether impairments to opportunity \nhave been adequately addressed and removed. In fact, arguably since the \n1978 case of Regents of the University of California versus Bakke, and \ndefinitively since the case of City of Richmond versus J.A. Croson Co., \nthe use of quotas by State and local governments, or educational \ninstitutions, have been held by the Supreme Court to violate the equal \nprotection clause of the constitution. There are exceptions, of course, \nfor cases involving prior, positive and systemic discrimination, and \nthe court has applied slightly different standards to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  In addition, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's guidelines \ngoverning voluntary affirmative action provide that in order to be \nvalid, voluntary affirmative action programs must comply with a number \nof guidelines. First, they must be adopted to break down patterns of \nracial segregation, and to expand employment opportunities to those who \nhave traditionally been barred from certain occupations or positions. \nIn addition, the plans cannot unnecessarily trample the rights of those \nwho were not targeted, usually non-minorities or men. Finally, plans \ncan only seek to hire qualified individuals, and they must be flexible. \nSo clearly, if any individual feels they were not hired due to an \nexplicit quota provided for a minority or a woman, they can bring suit \nfor a violation of equal protection.\n  As a benchmark for diversity, affirmative action must always be fair \naction. The concept of fairness in education and employment \nparticularly rests on fundamentals relating to merit, to competence, to \nqualifications. No on benefits, not the community in general, the \ncompany, nor the individuals involved, if unqualified people displace \nqualified ones. But that is not what affirmative action is supposed to \ndo.\n  It is never fair to promote an unqualified individual at the expense \nof a qualified individual, which is why affirmative action does not \nrequire that employers do so. To require that a person be hired or \npromoted, solely on the basis of their gender or race, not their \ncompetence, is exactly the type of discrimination affirmative action \nseeks to end.\n  Instead, affirmative action encourages employers or educators to seek \nout all qualified applicants, regardless of their gender or race. There \nare a number of workplace practices--word of mouth recruiting, job \nrequirements unrelated to actual\n duties, et cetera--that can have the effect of limiting a hiring or \npromotion pool, whether intentional or not. Affirmative action works to \nensure this does not occur, by reaching out to qualified minorities and \nwomen.\n\n  In addition, affirmative action helps ensure that job requirements \nfit the job. Under affirmative action, employers are no longer allowed \nto establish irrelevant criteria that applicants must fulfill before \nbeing considered for hiring or promotion--requirements that may work to \nexclude otherwise qualified individuals.\n\n\n            not to say that programs should not be reviewed\n  There have been suggestions that our existing affirmative action \nprograms must be reviewed, and I agree; no program should ever be \nimmune to review. However, a review cannot mean a retreat from the \nproposition of equal opportunity for all. I am confident that any \nreview of affirmative action will show what the Nation's major \nemployers already know: Affirmative action is good for the community, \ngood for companies, good for working people, and good for the country.\n     this is important, because affirmative action is good business\n  Mr. President, I do not think that our current debate over \naffirmative action could have come at a more ironic time. The \nDepartment of Labor just recently issued its fact finding report on the \nexistence of the ``glass ceiling''--those invisible, yet very real \nbarriers that continue to confront women and minorities as they attempt \nto participate in the work force. The Glass Ceiling Report reviews in \ngreat detail the barriers to participation that fall short of overt \nexclusion but which still operate to limit the full participation of \nwomen and minorities in our economy. It clearly identifies the \nrelevance of diversity in the\n workplace. Most important, it is a compelling endorsement of the value \nof affirmative action.\n  The foundation for the report was a document prepared by the \nDepartment of Labor--which helped publicize the glass ceiling \nphenomenon. As our distinguished majority leader, Senator Robert Dole, \nstated at that time, the report has confirmed what many of us have \nsuspected all along--the existence of invisible, artificial barriers \nblocking women and minorities from advancing up the corporate ladder to \nmanagement and executive level positions * * * the issue boils down to \nensuring equal access and equal opportunity * * * these principles are \nfundamental to the establishment of this great Nation, and the \ncornerstone of what other nations and other people consider unique to \nthe United States--namely, the possibility for everyone to go as far as \ntheir talents and hard work will take them.\n  Congress created the Glass Ceiling Commission as part of the Civil \nRights Act of 1991. The commission, comprised of 21 members, was \ncharged with conducting a study and preparing recommendations on \n``eliminating artificial barriers to the advancement of women and \nminorities.''\n  The current attack on affirmative action coincides, almost exactly, \nwith the release of the commission's fact-finding report, entitled \n``Good for Business: Making Full Use of the Nation's Human Capital.'' \nIt is also, however, fortuitous, for the commission's report provides \nthose of us in Congress, who will soon be debating the future of \naffirmative action, with two fundamental truths: the first of these \ntruths is that, though we have come far since Lyndon Johnson issued \nExecutive Order No. 11246, there is still much progress yet to be make. \nThe United States still fails to utilize the talents and resources of \nfar too\n great a percentage of its population in far too many industries.\n\n  The second truth is that, if progress is not made, it will not be \njust minorities and women who suffer, but the community as a whole. \nAffirmative action is about far more than just equal opportunity--it is \nabout our economic prosperity. It is about access to education and jobs \nfor working people, for middle class families, and for our children. \nIndeed, a recent Washington Post article entitled ``Affirmative \nAction's Corporate Converts,'' documented this fact. In the article, \nthe chairman of Mobil Corporation, Mr. Lucio A. Noto, summed up the \nview of many employers: ``I have never felt a burden from affirmative \naction, because it is a business imperative for us.''\n                         how far we have to go\n  The overview of the Glass Ceiling Commission's fact finding report \nbegins: corporate leaders surveyed, women and minorities who \nparticipated in focus groups, researchers, and government officials all \nagree that a glass ceiling exists, and that it operates substantially \nto exclude minorities and women from the top levels of management. This \nstatement is underscored by a wealth of detailed factual information, \nwhich illustrates this conclusion in no uncertain terms. Take, for \nexample, a survey of senior level managers of Fortune 1000 industrial \ncompanies and Fortune 500 service industries, which established that 95 \nto 97 percent of senior managers--vice-president and above--are white \nmen.\n  Or, the report's finding that--\n\n       Despite identical education attainment, ambition, and \n     commitment to career, men still progress faster than women. A \n     1990 Business Week study of 3,664 business school graduates \n     found that a woman with an MBA from one of the top 20 \n     business schools earned an average of $54,749 in her first \n     year after graduation, while a comparable man earned \n     $61,400--12 percent more.\n\n  And the problems are not limited to the business world. While women \nhold over 4 in every 10 college teaching jobs--more than 40 percent--\nthey only hold 11 percent of tenured positions.\n  The Glass Ceiling Commission's report makes it clear what the problem \nis. It is not a ``women's problem.'' It is not a problem related to any \nlack of ability on the part of women or minorities. It is a problem \ngoing to the heart \n[[Page S4943]] of the American dream--whether the workforce is for some \nAmericans, or for all Americans.\n  The report concluded, after years of research, that there are two \nmajor impediments to full participation by women and minorities:\n  First, the prejudices and stereotypes of many white male middle \nmanagers, and;\n  Second, the need for greater efforts by many corporate CEO's--who \nhave made an initial commitment to diversity and expanded economic \nopportunity--to fully translate those words into realities.\n  The sub-heading on a recent New York Times article by reporter Peter \nT. Kilborn, which detailed the commission's findings, highlights the \nproblems presented by stereotyping. The heading reads: ``Report Finds \nPrejudices Block Progress of Women and Minorities.'' And the story goes \non to depict the barriers that, unfortunately, still must be overcome \nby women and minorities seeking to climb the corporate ladder. Kilborn \nwrites:\n\n       In exploring the demography of American upper management, a \n     Government commission Wednesday put its official stamp on \n     what many people have suspected all along: important barriers \n     to the progress of women and minorities are the entrenched \n     stereotypes and prejudices of white men. Women, the report of \n     the Federal Glass Ceiling Commission said, are perceived by \n     white males as not tough enough and unable or unwilling to \n     relocate. Black men? Undisciplined, always late. Hispanic men \n     are deemed heavy drinkers and drug users who don't want to \n     work--except for Cubans, who are brave exiles from communism. \n     Asians? More equipped for technical than people-oriented \n     work. And, the report said, white males believe that none of \n     these folks play golf.\n       Never mind that women's attendance records are better than \n     mens', discounting maternity leaves; that Hispanic Americans \n     work longer than the non-hispanic white men putting them \n     down, or that American management is impressed enough by \n     Asian management that it often apes it.\n\n  The Glass Ceiling report speaks to\n   some of the reasons for this persistent bias. Too many white male \nmiddle managers still allow false myths obscure their vision. They are \nstill unable to see the benefits of making full use of the talents of \nwomen and minorities.\n\n  The problem we face now--the problem of persistent bias--is different \nthan the blatant, officially sponsored discrimination faced in the \n1950's and 1960's, but it is no less real. It is certainly no less \nharmful to those who are not considered for a job, or a loan, or a \nGovernment contract. And it is most definitely no less worthy of \ncongressional action than the official discrimination that Congress \naddressed in the 1960's.\n  Most of us can remember the time in our country when women who worked \noutside the home had to face official barriers to their participation \nin the labor force. Or when black and other minorities were denied \nemployment or other economic opportunity solely because of their color. \nLegislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was designed to \nprovide equality of employment and educational opportunities, or the \nCivil Rights Act of 1968, which sought to provide fair housing laws, \nhas gone a long way toward striking down those official barriers.\n  But the unofficial ones still remain. It is as though the hurdles \nhave been taken off the track, but the ruts have not yet been removed \nfor women and minorities who seeks to participate in the economy of our \ncountry. President Johnson made the point eloquently when he issued \nExecutive Order 11246, which requires that all employers with Federal \ncontracts in excess of $50,000 file affirmative action plans with the \nGovernment. Under that order, which is the foundation of affirmative \naction, the plans must include goals and timetables--not quotas--for \nthe hiring of minorities and women, and employers are required to make \ngood faith efforts to comply with\n the plans. President Johnson stated when signing the order:\n\n       Freedom is not enough. You do not wipe away the scars of \n     centuries by saying: Now, you are free to go where you want, \n     do as you desire, and choose the leaders you please. You do \n     not take a man who, for years has been hobbled by chains, \n     liberate him, bring him to the starting line of a race, \n     saying ``you are free to compete with all the others,'' and \n     still justly believe you have been completely fair. thus it \n     is not enough to open the gates of opportunity . . . we seek \n     not just equality as a right . . . but equality as a fact and \n     as a result.\n\n  The progress we have made in opening up opportunity is no cause for \nresting on our laurels--the end of discrimination did not mean the \nbeginning of inclusion.\n  We still have a long way to go to eliminate the persistent bias which \ncreates barriers to the full participation--and the complete \ncontributions--all of our people have to give. It stands to reason \nthat, if we create conditions that allow our Nation to tap the talents \nof 100 percent of our people, we will be better off than if we can only \ntap the talents of half.\n  And that is the conclusion of the report just issued by the Glass \nCeiling Commission, a conclusion which is expressed in the report's \ntitle: ``good for gusiness--making full use of the Nation's human \ncapital.'' Simply stated, the conclusion reached was that:\n\n       Increasing numbers of corporate leaders recognize that \n     Glass Ceilings and exclusion of members of groups other than \n     white non-Hispanic males are bad for business because of \n     recent dramatic shifts in three areas that are fundamental to \n     business survival: changes in the demographics of the labor \n     force, changes in the demographics of the national consumer \n     markets, and the rapid globalization of the marketplace.\n\n  These shifts--changes in the demographics of the labor force, changes \nin the demographics of the national consumer markets, and rapid \nglobalization of the marketplace--\n highlight why a retreat from affirmative action will hurt us all.\n\n  The Washington Post article, previously quoted, underscores that \npoint. The article points out that the opinion that affirmative action \nis a business imperative is:\n\n       Not a maverick view. At many of the Nation's large \n     corporations, affirmative action is woven into the fabric of \n     the companies. And the diversity that affirmative action \n     regulations has encouraged has become a valuable marketing \n     and recruiting tool, an important edge in fierce global \n     competition.\n\n  A 1993 study of Standard and Poor 500 companies showed that firms \nthat succeed in shattering their own glass ceilings racked up stock-\nmarket records that were nearly two and one-half times better than \notherwise comparable companies. Companies have benefitted by opening \ntheir doors to all American workers--and we will all continue to \nbenefit, so long as those of us in Congress do not retreat from our \ncommitment to opportunity for all.\n  It is often the case that those of us in Congress are called upon to \nvote on issues with which we have had no personal experience. But the \nissue of creating the opportunity for women and minorities to become \nfull economic partners in our society is dear to my heart, because as a \nwoman,\n and a minority, I have seen first-hand the benefits that accrue from \ncreating a climate of opinion that sets the stage for hope and for real \nopportunity in the areas where potential and talent matter most.\n\n  I would ask my colleagues to consider the experience of those of us \nwho have had to overcome artificial barriers to achievement. What our \nexperiences illustrate are the basic principles that Congress must \nconsider--and must preserve--as it debates affirmative action.\n  The first of these principles is that every American must have access \nto education. The opportunity to attend the University of Illinois, and \nthe University of Chicago Law School, gave me the tools I needed to \nenter the work force. The climate created by congressional support for \naffirmative action encouraged my law school to seek out and embrace \ndiversity. They were persuaded not just to look beyond the stereotypes, \nbut to reach outside the traditional pool of applicants, and to \nactively seek out qualified students who could bring a different point \nof view to the educational environment. This, of course, benefited more \nthan the individual students--it benefited the entire university as \nwell.\n  The second basic principle is that every American must have access to \ngood jobs. My first job out of law school was working as an assistant \nUnited States attorney--a job that would have been virtually impossible \nfor a woman to hold just 20 years earlier. Because of affirmative \naction, I was given a choice and a chance in the career path.\n  And the third basic principle, from which there can be no retreat, is \nthat every American must have the opportunity to advance as far in \ntheir field as their hard work will take them. As \n[[Page S4944]] the glass ceiling report has shown, getting a job is \nonly half the battle. Just as bias must not be allowed in hiring, it \nmust also not be allowed in promotion, or in access to capital, or \npolicy making, or in any other endeavor that affects the community as a \nwhole.\n  The ``glass ceiling'' is bad for women, bad for minorities, and bad \nfor our Nation's businesses. It is not enough that women and minorities \nare able to enter the work force; we also have to have the opportunity \nto succeed based on their ability.\n  It has been argued by some that this debate we are focused too much \non the past. They say that they were not there when the constitution \nwas drafted, leaving women and African-Americans out of its promise of \nequal opportunity for all. They did not take any past actions, they did \nnot carry out any past ``wrongs,'' and they should not have to work to \ncorrect those wrongs in the present.\n  But this debate is not about the past, Mr. President, or even the \npresent. The need for continued action is not just about righting past \nwrongs--although past wrongs warrant strong actions; nor is it about \nrepaying old debts--although substantial debts are owed to those people \nand their descendants who were harmed by their past exclusion from full \nparticipation in our economy. This debate is about the future, and the \nexpanded economic opportunity that will come if all Americans are \nallowed to participate\n in the economy.\n\n  If you think about it, what we are debating is whether the majority \nof America's people--and that's what you get if you count our Nation's \n51 percent women and 10 percent non-white males--will have a shot, a \nchance to participate on an equal footing in America's economic \naffairs.\n  Last month, I met with a group of young schoolchildren. I talked to \nthem about the historic nature of the 104th Congress, and how we had \ncome so far in the 75 years since the women's suffrage amendment became \npart of our Constitution. I pointed out to them that there are now \neight women in the U.S. Senate. I spoke of this as if it were a great \naccomplishment. The children looked at me in confusion--one little girl \nlooked at me and said: ``Is that all?''\n  What that young girl was telling us, is that we need to look at the \nwhole picture. And when we do, we know without a doubt that much work \nremains to be done.\n  Majority leader Dole stated, when he authored the legislation \ncreating the Glass Ceiling Commission, ``Whatever the reasons behind \nthe glass ceiling, it is time we stopped throwing rhetorical rocks and \nhit the glass ceiling with enough force that it is shattered.'' That \nrecipe for action made sense then, and, with the issuance of the \nCommission's report, it makes even more sense now.\n  International competition is becoming tougher and tougher. We cannot \nsucceed by bailing out of the competition, or by wasting the talents of \nhalf our citizenry. But that is what will happen--our country will fall \nbehind--if we do not act aggressively to shatter the glass ceiling. If \nwe do not make full use of the education and the skills of women and \nminorities, they are hurt as individuals, but we are hurt as a Nation \nas well.\n  In 1992, approximately 590,000 women, and 163,000 minority students \ngraduated from college. Are we really prepared to say to them, ``Sorry, \nyou're not allowed to compete.'' As parents, we all have hopes and \ndreams for our children. Are we really prepared to say to our \ndaughters, ``Sorry, but you're not allowed to compete. Work hard, but \nyou will still get paid less than the men working next to you, and you \nshould not expect to be promoted.'' Are we really prepared, as a matter \nof national policy, to diminish their expectations that way? Are we \nreally prepared to permit restrictions on their potential and their \nopportunities to continue for even 1 more day if there is anything we \ncan do about it?\n  The answer should be obvious. There can be no retreat from the \nfundamental goals of affirmative action. There can be no compromise \nwith the objective of ensuring full economic opportunity for every \nAmerican.\n  Affirmative action has helped every American, not just women and \nminorities. Although opponents suggest that affirmative action is about \ncreating race and gender preference, in fact, the opposite is true. It \nis about ending preferences based on prejudice and stereotype. It is \nabout opening up our economy so that it works for all, and not just \nsome.\n  I hope that my remarks here today will sound the alarm bell not just \nfor minorities, but also for women across the Nation. In the 1940's, \nwhen the men of America went off to Europe and Asia to fight World War \nII, women entered the workforce in record numbers. ``Rosie the \nRiveter'' provided the essential support needed back home to keep \nAmerica's factories running--both to fuel the war effort, and to \nsustain the domestic economy. During the war, women were hailed as \nheroes. But when the war was over, women were told that their services \nwere no longer needed.\n  Well, I have news for those who would seek to roll back the gains \nwomen have made under affirmative action. This is not 1945. We will not \ngo back--nor can the country afford for us to go back.\n  Instead of a retreat, we have to return to the fundamental truths. We \nhave come a long way, we have made progress--but we have a long way yet \nto go. And if we have the wisdom, and the foresight to renew our \ncommitment to equal opportunity, we will realize the other fundamental \ntruth--that affirmative action is really all about justice. There are \nthose who fear the loss of preferences created over time--the 100-\npercent set-asides of the past--which limited competition from the vast \npool of talent women and minorities constitute. To them I say, it is \ncounterproductive to handicap the competition, you lose, they lose, we \nas a nation all lose. Instead of being seduced by fear, be inspired by \nthe hope of our Founders that in equality of opportunity lay the key to \nprosperity, the quality of life for all Americans would be lifted up.\n  There can be no retreat from our purpose, no compromise from our \nobjectives--expanding economic opportunity, taking advantage of our \ndiversity, moving the United States ever closer to the day when the \neloquent vision set out in our Declaration of Independence becomes a \nreality for every American.\n  Abraham Lincoln, in his 1862 message to Congress, spoke words that \nresonate and reflect the seriousness of this debate:\n\n       Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this \n     Congress and this administration will be remembered in spite \n     of ourselves. No personal significance or insignificance can \n     spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we \n     pass will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the latest \n     generation * * * We--even we here--hold the power and bear \n     the responsibility. In giving freedom to the slave, we assure \n     freedom to the free--honorable alike in what we give and what \n     we preserve. We shall nobly save or meanly lose the last, \n     best hope of Earth. Other means may succeed; this could not \n     fail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just--a way \n     which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and God \n     must forever bless.\n\n  Affirmative action is a quintessential American challenge. I hope \nthis Congress will prove worthy of it.\n  Mr. President, I have here a list of a number of companies, and a \ndescription of programs they have implemented to promote diversity in \ntheir organization. This list provides an overview of the variety of \napproaches that employers across America have taken to promote \ndiversity. I ask unanimous consent that a list of these programs be \nplaced in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Case Studies of Successful Programs\n\n       The Federal Glass Ceiling Commission has found that \n     businesses vary in their awareness of glass ceiling issues \n     and in efforts to overcome glass ceiling barriers. Some \n     businesses pioneer initiatives to remove the barriers and \n     continue to do so. The work and family programs offered by \n     these employers, have great impact on the lifelong career \n     paths of women and people of color who share responsibility \n     for their families daily care, and their ability to take on \n     promotions and opportunities if offered. This section briefly \n     describes the efforts of three companies--Xerox Corporation, \n     Procter & Gamble, and IBM--that are successfully eliminating \n     glass ceiling barriers while remaining competitive and \n     profitable.\n\n\n                           xerox corporation\n\n       CEO Commitment and Leadership--Almost 40 years ago, Joseph \n     C. Wilson, the founder of Xerox, made diversity a core value \n     of the \n     [[Page S4945]] corporation. He called it ``valuing and \n     respecting people.'' Current CEO Paul Allaire believes that a \n     diverse workforce gives Xerox a competitive edge.\n       Accountability--Allaire expects senior managers to develop \n     and maintain a balanced workforce and holds them accountable \n     for achieving those goals. In turn, senior managers hold \n     their managers to the same standards. An annual memo entitled \n     Balanced Workforce Performance, reports the workforce \n     participation of minorities and women and summarizes progress \n     in meeting the goals.\n       Under its Minority/Female Supplier Program, the company \n     also holds its vendors to high standards of workforce \n     diversity while expanding their business opportunities. In \n     1992, Xerox spent $196 million with minority- and women-owned \n     businesses.\n       Outreach and Recruitment--Xerox has a longstanding and \n     successful employee referral system in which all employees \n     are encouraged to refer friends and relative to apply for \n     employment. In the 1960s, Xerox initiated special efforts to \n     recruit women and minority men, beginning with Booster, a \n     collaborative program with Urban League affiliates, and Step-\n     Up, a minority outreach program in Rochester, New York. Today \n     the company has one team of African American managers who \n     serve as liaisons with historically Black colleges and \n     universities and another team of Hispanic managers who \n     coordinate efforts to recruit Hispanic men and women.\n       Training--All employees are kept aware of company policies \n     on issues sexual, racial, and ethnic harassment. A brochure \n     highlighting the company policy is given to every employee. \n     Xerox instituted workshops in sexual harassment prevention in \n     1982.\n       Development--High potential employees are counseled on the \n     steps necessary to advance their careers. Their job \n     assignments support their advancement--for example, of the 80 \n     Xerox managers currently on international assignments, 13 are \n     women and 23 are minorities. A key element of the succession-\n     planning process is to improve the representation of \n     minorities and women in upper management--currently 20 \n     percent of Xerox vice presidents are members of minority \n     groups and 12 percent are women. Twenty-four percent of the \n     corporate officers are women and minorities.\\1\\\n     \\1\\The category ``minorities'' includes both men and women, \n     so that a female employee is counted here both under the \n     category ``women'' and as a minority.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Mentoring--Caucus groups are fundamental to the company's \n     mentoring activities. All groups are employee-initiated and \n     employee-funded. They conduct workshops, conferences, and \n     individual mentoring activities on management processes, \n     career planning activities, and work/family issues. The \n     company also has support groups based on sexual orientation, \n     disability, and functional expertise.\n       Work and Family--Xerox's Life Cycle Assistance combines a \n     variety of work/family programs that include income-based \n     subsidies for child care, customized medical benefits, an \n     employee assistance program, and tuition aid for employees.\n                           procter and gamble\n\n       CEO Commitment and Leadership--More than 30 years ago, \n     Procter & Gamble's President Howard Morgan sent a letter to \n     his senior managers, stressing that the company simply had to \n     do better at providing employment for African Americans. \n     Today, Chairman Edwin Artz sends an annual letter to P's \n     more than 100,000 employees, outlining the company's \n     diversity policies and emphasizing its conviction that, in \n     his words--``Developing and managing a strong, diverse \n     organization is essential to achieving our business purpose \n     and objectives.''\n       Accountability--Each P business unit has specific goals \n     for the development and advancement of minorities and women, \n     as well as plans for achieving those goals. Data on hiring, \n     promotions, job rotation, and training are entered into a \n     computerized Diversity Measurement System, giving senior \n     management the ability to track progress in meeting goals. \n     The number of women at the department director level has \n     doubled in the last five years and the number of minorities \n     at the associate director level has tripled.\n       Outreach and Recruitment--P provides internships through \n     the Graduate Engineering for Minorities Consortium, the \n     National Urban League's Black Executive Program, and the \n     National Alliance of Business Colleges' Cluster Program. In \n     1993, 47 percent of the interns were women and 46 percent \n     were minorities. P provides leadership and support for \n     several programs designed to attract minority students to \n     engineering and science and the company provides support to \n     numerous women's and minority organizations.\n       During the past 10 years the company's record of hiring and \n     promoting minorities and women into management has been \n     strong, with women averaging approximately 40 percent and \n     minority men approximately 25 percent of new hires.\n       Training--All employees participate in diversity training. \n     The company's goal is to create a business environment in \n     which individual differences are not only valued but \n     celebrated and prized.\n       Development--Development programs are customized to give \n     each employee opportunities, tools, and skills needed to \n     realize his or her full potential. P College, designed to \n     reach all employees, is staffed by senior managers who teach \n     basic business courses fundamental to business success.\n       Mentoring--Dozens of networking and support groups exist \n     throughout the company--for example, Women Supporting Women \n     (WSW) and the Asian American Self Directed Learning \n     Conference. WSW's annual workshop brings together mid-level \n     women managers to discuss job growth and development issues. \n     The Learning Conference helps Asian and Pacific Islander \n     Americans understand cultural differences and perceptions \n     that affect business operations. Experienced P managers \n     serve as counselors, coaches, guides, and advisors to less \n     experienced employees and are available to all employees upon \n     request.\n       Work and Family--P considers family-friendly policies as \n     an investment that pays off in attracting and retaining \n     employees. Family-friendly programs include child care leave, \n     adoption assistance, on-site medical screening, employee \n     assistance programs, tuition reimbursement for college \n     courses, flexible schedules, and financial support of nearby \n     child-care facilities.\n                                  IBM\n\n       CEO Commitment and Leadership--In 1935, when IBM first \n     hired professional women in marketing, Chairman T.J. Watson \n     declared, ``Men and women will do the same kind of work for \n     equal pay.'' Current CEO Louis V. Gertsner, Jr., terms \n     diversity ``an issue of strategic and tactical importance,'' \n     made workforce diversity the subject of one of his first \n     policy letters. He wrote,\n       ``I believe workforce diversity to be of real importance to \n     IBM's success. As the marketplace becomes increasingly \n     diverse, IBM's competitiveness will be enhanced through a \n     workforce which reflects the growing diversity of the \n     external labor force, and the growing diversity of our \n     customers.''\n       Accountability--IBM sets goals for minorities and women in \n     job groups where they are underutilized, with the intention \n     of achieving representation according to availability at all \n     levels in the company. Each manager's annual appraisal \n     includes an evaluation of his or her efforts in improving \n     IBM's workforce diversity profile.\n       A salary analysis is conducted for each minority and female \n     employee. These analyses compared minorities and women \n     employees with their similarly ensuring situated white and \n     male peers.\n       Outreach and Recruitment--IBM was the first company in the \n     U.S. to support the United Negro College Fund in 1944, its \n     initial year. The Company began active college recruiting at \n     historically Black colleges in the 1950s. In 1972 IBM \n     initiated the Faculty Loan Program which allows employees to \n     take up to a year off to work for a college, at full IBM \n     salary, in projects addressing the needs of disadvantaged, \n     female, or disabled students. More than 1000 employees have \n     participated. In 1991 IBM established the Minority Campus \n     Executive Program. African American, American Indian, Asian \n     and Pacific Islander, and Hispanic American executives serve \n     as liaisons with the presidents of 24 colleges that have \n     large/predominantly African America, Hispanic American, Asian \n     and Pacific Islander American, and American Indian \n     populations.\n       IBM recruits from colleges and universities that have \n     significant numbers of women and minority students. Critical \n     to recruitment are these three principles:\n       Equal employment and affirmative action are treated as \n     business objectives.\n       Line managers at all levels are accountable for progress in \n     meeting diversity objectives.\n       Investing time and effort in recruiting and sustaining a \n     supply of diverse employees long-term, continuing success in \n     meeting diversity objectives.\n       Training--All company diversity training programs use an \n     IBM video, ``Valuing Diversity: A Competitive Advantage.'' \n     Diversity councils indentify, recommend, and implement plans \n     and programs to enhance workforce diversity management. The \n     councils meet regularly and coordinate roundtable exchanges \n     and focus groups to discuss opportunities, challenges, and \n     concerns of the workforce. Training in sexual harassment \n     prevention is an integral part of all employee training.\n       Development--Attendance at IBM's executive seminars is an \n     important training experience in the company--in 1993, 22 \n     percent of those attending were women and 7.7 percent were \n     minorities. In the same year, 25 percent of those who \n     attended IBM's advanced management school were women and 15.7 \n     percent were minorities.\n       A key developmental experience is an international job \n     assignment--an experience outside of the U.S. in a different \n     culture and work environment. From 1991 to the end of 1993, \n     more than 500 employees participated--15 percent were women \n     and 9.6 percent were minorities.\\1\\\n     \\1\\The category ``minorities'' includes both men and women, \n     so that a female employee is counted here both under the \n     category ``women'' and as a minority.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       It is a requirement that the opportunity to use the \n     Employee Development Plan process be offered to each woman, \n     minority, Vietnam-era veteran, and person with a disability. \n     The Employee Development Plan is a document used in \n     partnership between the employee and the manager to \n     understand and maximize strengths, and to identify and \n     address weakness. It also provides a vehicle to discuss \n     career aspirations and to establish \n     [[Page S4946]] a plan to help achieve reasonable career \n     objectives.\n       Mentoring--The goal of IBM's Mentoring Program is two-fold. \n     First, it provides a place where women and minorities, and \n     people with disabilities can go for ``penalty-free advice''; \n     and second, to provide senior employees and managers the \n     opportunity to have a variety of coaching, developing, and \n     managerial experiences with people who are different from \n     them. Mentoring begins as soon as an employee joins IBM. The \n     program supports employees at three levels:\n       Officer Level--Mentors guide selected women and minorities \n     who have been identified as potential corporate officers.\n       Corporate Level--Mentors guide selected women and \n     minorities who have been identified as potential executives.\n       Noncorporate Level--Mentors guide new employees to provide \n     early career assistance and maximize their career growth.\n       Work and Family--IBM's ongoing goal in this area is to \n     demonstrate that these programs are practical, effective, and \n     efficient tools to achieve business results. IBM's Work/Life \n     Programs are designed to help all employees be productive \n     while meeting personal and family needs. Programs include \n     flexible work hours and flexible work locations, a personal \n     leave program, and child and elder care support. Work/Life \n     Employee Surveys in 1986 and 1991 provided valuable data on \n     existing programs, and led to recommendations for new \n     projects/programs. IBM has made a special commitment to the \n     subject of Dependent Care support. In 1989, IBM announced the \n     IBM Funds for Dependent Care Initiatives, a $25 million \n     investment made over the years 1990-1994. During that period \n     more than 500 child care/elder care projects were funded in \n     communities where IBM employees live and work. In addition, \n     in 1992, IBM was one of the 11 ``Champion'' companies that \n     funded The American Business Collaboration for Quality \n     Dependent Care. It was the largest collaboration in U.S. \n     history that included 156 organizations and invested 27 \n     million dollars in 355 projects in 45 communities.\n                        100 Corporate Practices\n\n       In its examination of corporate glass ceiling initiatives, \n     the Federal Glass Ceiling Commission found that \n     comprehensive, systemic approaches are more likely to have \n     lasting positive impact than isolate, one-shot or ad hoc \n     approaches. Because they are designed to overcome the \n     structural barriers specific to the business, different glass \n     ceiling initiatives emphasize different components. However, \n     research suggests that effective initiatives include \n     components of the seven elements listed below.

The Executive Education Program provides \n     internal and external education experiences for AT \n     executives and those middle managers identified as having \n     high potential. Executive Education Program candidates, most \n     of whom are in the LCP, are selected on the basis of their \n     on-the-job learning experiences, career histories, career \n     plans, and the business strategies of the organization. \n     Executive Education Programs are offered internally and at 40 \n     universities worldwide. Programs last from one week to two-\n     and-a-half months.\n       Barnett Bank; Leadership and Career Development: Women are \n     chief executives of four Barnett units and make up 44 percent \n     of the highest paid employees. Women make up 21 percent of \n     Barnett's senior and executive vice presidents.\n       Connecticut Mutual; Management Excellence Selection; \n     Components for Leadership Development: 1. The Management \n     Excellence process involves ``selecting individuals who will \n     make successful managers in our environment.'' The process \n     was developed through the McBurr model of competencies: a \n     group of average and outstanding managers was selected and \n     studied in order to identify the traits that led to success \n     in management and traits that the company wanted to emphasize \n     in management selection and development.\n       2. Components of leadership development efforts:\n       Career path process: identifies the objective performance, \n     skill and knowledge criteria for moving from one pay level in \n     a job to the next, thus empowering the individual \n     [[Page S4947]] to plan his/her own growth and advancement.\n       Success factors for management: competencies demonstrated \n     by the best managers in the company are described to enable \n     individuals to plan their own growth and development as \n     managers.\n       High potential list: developed through interviews conducted \n     by personnel from human resources with the head of each of \n     the business units and support units. This process identifies \n     individuals at all levels of the organization with potential \n     for higher level positions.\n       Continental Insurance; Advanced Development Program (ADP): \n     The Advanced Development Program identifies the company's \n     high-potential employees and, through rigorous training and \n     accelerated career plan helps them attain key leadership \n     positions in the company. The program takes select employees \n     through a three-month training session during which each \n     employee develops a career plan for next three to seven \n     years. Assigned advisors serve as mentors, and along with \n     position supervisors, they communicate successes and \n     difficulties to ADP managers. The goal of the ADP is to \n     develop talented, committed employees into skillful managers \n     and proficient leaders.\n       Corning Glass Works, Inc.; Total Quality Program & Women's \n     Advancement: The Quality Improvement Team is a task force \n     designed to upgrade efforts in the recruitment, retention, \n     and upward mobility of women in management. With a \n     demonstration of commitment from the top down and input from \n     both line and staff managers, implementation strategies are \n     being planned. They include the development of action steps \n     to hold managers accountable, succession planning for high-\n     performing women, career development strategies to improve \n     the current upward mobility rate for women, new recruitment \n     efforts, implementation of a managing diversity education \n     program, communicating policies and practices regarding \n     women, and the development of community initiatives to \n     encourage women to work at Corning.\n       Fannie Mae; Recruitment: Newly appointed as CEO in the \n     early 1980s, David O. Maxwell challenged the traditional \n     hiring patterns of the financial industry by deliberately \n     recruiting a management team that included minorities and \n     women. To continue increasing the number of minorities and \n     women in mid- and senior-level positions, CEO Maxwell works \n     aggressively with top management to identify and promote the \n     company's most promising minorities and women.\n       Gannett Co., Inc., Partners in Progress: Instituted in 1979 \n     by Chairman Allen Neuharth, the program encompasses \n     strategies for recruiting, hiring, developing, and promoting \n     minorities and women. The program features a system to \n     measure performance of managers in developing minorities and \n     women. It is aimed at high potential individuals for \n     participation in management development programs. College \n     recruitment and internship programs aimed at minorities and \n     women ensure a diverse pool of talent from which future \n     company leaders will emerge. The program, which has been \n     tracked since 1981, has produced high percentages of minority \n     and female employees and managers.\n       Hewlett-Packard Co.; Technical Women's Conference: The \n     conference began as a grassroots effort by company women to \n     showcase the achievements of HP's female engineers and \n     scientists, promote their leadership development, and help \n     them to network in a highly decentralized organization. After \n     a successful first Technical Women's Conference in October \n     1988, the company sponsored a worldwide conference in May \n     1991, drawing 800 attendees.\n       JC Penney Co., Inc.; Management Development Program \n     Leadership Forums: JC Penney Co., Inc. has created the \n     Women's Advisory Team and the Minority Advisory Team to \n     develop programs which increase the representation of women \n     and minorities at the senior management level and to find \n     ways to make the company's affirmative action plan more \n     effective. Each team is composed of 16-18 management \n     associates appointed directly by the company chairman. Focus \n     groups with employees help develop team agendas. The teams \n     have created a formal mentor program, an internal newsletter \n     that focuses on workforce diversity, leadership forums that \n     allow employees to hear from outside experts, and a direct \n     broadcast system that electronically puts together managers \n     to discuss diversity issues. They have developed a \n     nontraditional staffing program which permits managers to \n     better balance work and family responsibilities.\n       Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company; Professional \n     Development Boards: The company refined its 15-year-old \n     Management Issues Board to emphasize the professional \n     development of employees. The single board was expanded to \n     four 15-member boards (3 product line and 1 corporate), and \n     was renamed the Professional Development Boards. The new \n     system provides professional staff with opportunities for \n     career growth through their participation in challenging \n     business projects. Participants develop critical skills, \n     enhance their visibility with top management, and broaden \n     their responsibilities, while assuring Mass. Mutual of a \n     growing reservoir of professional and managerial talent.\n       Morrison & Foerster; Work and Family Diversity: For over a \n     decade, this law firm has had in place an array of liberal \n     work and family programs that help women in the demanding \n     legal profession achieve their fullest potential. A flextime \n     policy for partners and associates with caregiving \n     responsibilities, a three-month paid maternity leave \n     (followed by a three-month unpaid leave), a family sick leave \n     and a firm-wide dependent care resource and referral program \n     are viewed as basic levels of support. The firm has \n     established ongoing training programs to teach lawyers, \n     managers, and staff how to work with one another in an \n     environment of diversity and how to manage in a\n      workplace made more complex by the firm's commitment to \n     flexible work arrangements for women. Lawyers and firm \n     managers are also trained in preventing sexual harassment \n     and delivering effective feedback.\n       New England Telephone--NYNEX; Women in Technology: The \n     program was implemented to increase the number of women in \n     technical positions, create support system for technical \n     women, alleviate gender bias, and help women acquire the \n     skills and opportunities they need to advance. A cornerstone \n     of the initiative is education. In conjunction with a local \n     university, employees with no technical background can enroll \n     in a two-year certificate program to prepare themselves for \n     technical careers. To help women who have technical \n     experience move into higher levels of management, the company \n     has a ``Corporate Leaders'' management succession plan. The \n     program is open to both men and women.\n       Pacific Gas and Electric; Accelerated Development Program: \n     Set up in 1988 to increase the number of minorities and women \n     at senior management levels, the program allows PG to break \n     away from traditional lines of progression that require an \n     employee to remain in a specific job for a set number of \n     years before being considered for a leadership position. Each \n     business of the company can recommend employees for 10 slots \n     available in the two-year program. Program outline and \n     training are tailored to the career aspirations of each \n     candidate. Of the 21 employees who participate in the program \n     through 1993, 16 were successful, including one woman who now \n     manages a power plant.\n       SC Johnson Wax, Management Succession and Development \n     Committee: The Management Succession and Development \n     Committee challenges managers to consider minorities and \n     women for new openings, and pay and benefits structures are \n     reviewed regularly to make certain that they are equitable \n     and attractive to minorities and women. An effective job-\n     posting system ensures that knowledge of available \n     opportunities and of the hiring process is clear and that the \n     hiring process is fair to all employees. Ongoing training and \n     development is critical. SC Johnson Wax has also paid full \n     tuition for employees' undergraduate and graduate studies.\n       Tom's of Maine; Leadership and Career Development: Women \n     make up more than 45 percent of the employees and 33 percent \n     of the board. One of three vice presidents is a woman, as are \n     50 percent of the managers.\n       University of North Carolina at Greensboro; Career/\n     Leadership Advancement Program for Women Administrators: This \n     pilot program was developed to address, at the state level, \n     the scarcity of women in administrative positions, especially \n     higher-level positions in higher education. It was a locally \n     developed program that was funded by a local foundation, a \n     local university, the participant enrollment fees, and the \n     state American Council on Education/National Identification \n     Project, which aims to identify talented women who are ready \n     to move into senior administrative positions. The program \n     provided the following: (1) high accessibility to women \n     administrators and faculty in the state; (2) appraisal of \n     career advancement as well as development of leadership \n     skills; (3) individual career counseling for participants; \n     and (4) training for participants in fiscal matters.\n       US WEST; Women of Color Project: In 1988, US WEST \n     implemented its Women of Color Project to remedy inequities \n     in the career opportunities for non-Caucasian women. The \n     program was a response to the recommendation of three \n     employee Resources Groups. The objective of the program, \n     which has just recently completed its five-year lifespan, was \n     to provide developmental and promotional opportunities for \n     the women on the basis of their leadership, communication, \n     and decisionmaking skills and the needs of the business. Of \n     the 36 participants that completed the program, all \n     experienced developmental opportunities and 83% were offered \n     one or more promotional opportunities.\n                   Rotation/Nontraditional Employment\n\n       American Airlines; Nontraditional employment: See American \n     Airlines: Succession Planning.\n       Avon Products, Inc.; Slating: High potential selection \n     process: The slating process was instituted to expand the \n     pool of internal candidates for open positions and to ensure \n     that minorities and women are better represented in line \n     positions. When a position for manager, director, or vice \n     president becomes available, human resources personnel work \n     with department heads to identify candidates. To better \n     prepare for staffing changes, a slate of candidates is \n     sometimes developed before the position becomes open. \n     Candidates are selected on the basis of their job-specific \n     skills and credentials.\n       The high potential selection process for high potential \n     employees identifies those who have developed exceptional \n     leadership and management skills, and who support the \n     [[Page S4948]] company's valuing diversity efforts. These \n     individuals work with their managers and human resources \n     staff to identify the experiences they need to advance. With \n     slating, the pool of high potentials is screened to ensure \n     adequate representation of minorities and women.\n       Chubb & Son, Inc.; Job rotation: High potential women in \n     staff and administrative positions are given the opportunity \n     to rotate into line functions. To prepare for a new position, \n     each candidate currently in a staff position receives \n     training and, in some cases, gains hands-on experience by \n     working for several months in a lower-level line job without \n     taking a pay cut.\n       Con Edison; Management Intern Program: The Management \n     Intern Program is a comprehensive strategy to recruit, \n     develop, and promote qualified women. Begun in 1981, the \n     program currently recruits approximately 30 college graduates \n     annually on the basis of technical competence, leadership \n     potential, communication skills, and part-time work \n     experience. Interns spend one year in four three-month \n     assignments designed to expose them to a variety of company \n     functions. Visibility is an added program benefit: interns \n     gain exposure to officers and upper management through \n     required presentations and informal forums. At the outset of \n     the program, each intern is assigned a mid-level manager who \n     serves as a mentor. 75% of the 89 female engineers hired \n     since 1981 are still at Con Ed. Women have the highest rate \n     of retention.\n       Blue Collar Prep Program: The ``Blue Collar Prep'' program \n     aims to prepare women educationally, psychologically, and \n     physically for nontraditional jobs.\n       E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company; Job rotation: At Du \n     Pont, most executives move through at least two or three \n     functions before they reach top positions. For example, an \n     employee with technical experience may move from \n     manufacturing to marketing to general management to corporate \n     staff before attaining executive line status. The job \n     rotation process begins with the identification of high-\n     potential employees. Of Du Pont's 20,000 exempt employees \n     with college degrees (15% of whom are women), approximately \n     2,000 are considered capable of advancing into upper \n     management positions. Asked why job rotation is particularly \n     important for women, a Du Pont representative said, ``Women \n     don't have role models in upper management positions. Job \n     rotation helps them learn firsthand about the skills and \n     knowledge they need for a new position.''\n                               Mentoring\n\n       AT Early Career Advisory Program (ECAP): ECAP began in \n     1976 at the company's Bell Laboratory location in Naperville, \n     Illinois. Originally intended as a mentoring program for all \n     newly hired or promoted minorities and women at the \n     professional engineer level in Bell Laboratories (AT's \n     Research and Development division), the program was recently \n     broadened to include associate technical positions. Mentors \n     are managers at either the supervisor, department head, or \n     director level, and must work outside the mentee's \n     department.\n       Chubb & Son Inc.; Senior Management Sponsorship Program: \n     Implemented in 1990, the program aims to improve the \n     preparation of talented individuals for senior management \n     positions. The program selects employees at the assistant \n     vice president level and above who are excellent performers \n     and demonstrate potential for advancement. While the 30 \n     employees participating in the pilot program in 1990 included \n     women, minorities, and white non-Hispanic men, the majority \n     of those participating were female.\n       CIGNA: Mentoring Guide: CIGNA developed a guide and let \n     each of its ten operating divisions decide how they wanted to \n     approach the mentoring process. The guide profiles successful \n     mentor relationships, including key behaviors of coaches, \n     mentors, and mentees; on-the-job opportunities for coaching \n     and mentoring; methods to improve coaching and skills; and \n     tips for mentees. The model was also developed to provide a \n     benchmark for best practices and approaches to mentoring and \n     coaching in CIGNA's divisions.\n       Dow Jones & Company; Mentoring Quads: To promote cultural \n     diversity and enhance developmental and promotional \n     opportunities for minorities and women, the company developed \n     mentoring quads. Each quad is made up of four members who are \n     diverse in terms of position, level, race, gender, and \n     functional area. Program developers felt another advantage of \n     the group approach would be to offer greater learning \n     opportunities to larger numbers of people. The approach also \n     assumes that group dynamics will minimize personality \n     conflicts.\n       E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company; Imaging Systems: Du \n     Pont's mentoring program is tied to other initiatives to \n     develop and advance high potential minorities and women. \n     While the company allows mentors and mentees to structure \n     their own relationship, every mentor receives two days of \n     training in which ground rules are set and guidelines are \n     given.\n       Exxon Research & Engineering; Internship and Mentoring \n     Program: This program for female and minority high school \n     students was implemented to increase the pool of minority and \n     women recruits. By providing students with professional-level \n     mentors, who serve as role models and career counselors, as \n     well as offering ``real'' engineering work experience, Exxon \n     aims to build positive, long-term relationships with students \n     and to foster their interest in becoming permanent employees.\n       First Interstate Bank of California; Individual Mentoring \n     Program: The Individual Mentoring Program is part of an \n     overall initiative, begun in early 1992, to create and \n     implement programs for the advancement of minorities and \n     women. The overall initiative, The Career Opportunities and \n     Development Program, includes all phases of career \n     development and planning, diversity training, multi-cultural \n     networks, a group mentoring program, and an individual \n     mentoring program. The purpose of the Individual Mentoring \n     Program is to provide high potential selected minorities and \n     women with an opportunity to focus on examining personal \n     expectations, work habits, communications goals and \n     objectives, constructive feedback, and understanding \n     expectations under the guidance of experienced and skilled \n     professionals. Recognition that the bank could strengthen its \n     business by developing employees was the motivation for \n     establishing the initiative. Throughout the next three to \n     five years all of the participants will be tracked as to \n     their career development.\n       JC Penney Co., Inc.; Mentoring Skills Development Workshop: \n     JC Penney Co., Inc. created its own two-day workshop on \n     managing a diverse workforce. All profit-sharing managers in \n     the company have attended the program. The workshop \n     objectives are to create an awareness of cultural \n     differences, to develop an understanding of how these diverse \n     cultures benefit the workplace\n      environment, and improve communications among an \n     increasingly diverse workforce. Additionally, 120 key \n     senior managers attended a week-long multi-cultural \n     workshop that uses relationships and team-building to \n     reinforce the value of diversity.\n       New England Telephone--NYNEX; Mentoring circles: Designed \n     to help prevent some of the problems associated with \n     structured mentoring relationships, NYNEX has implemented \n     ``mentoring circles.'' Because mentors and mentees meet in \n     groups of up to 12 people, the sexual tension and rumors that \n     can accompany one-on-one male/female and interracial \n     mentoring are eliminated. Moreover, the circles maximize the \n     use of mentors' time, as the number of individuals qualified \n     to serve as mentors is usually far fewer than the number of \n     employees seeking mentors.\n       Pitney-Bowes, Inc.; Pairing System: The objectives of the \n     1989 pilot program were to augment the development process by \n     helping to increase the number of candidates ready to fill \n     managerial positions and to improve the retention of valued \n     employees. The program was also designed to further the \n     company's goal of creating an environment that values \n     diversity by helping to increase the representation of \n     minorities and women management. The current program strives \n     to match mentors and mentees in as many levels as possible by \n     looking at the development needs of associates, the \n     experience of mentors, geographic proximity and/or functional \n     commonality.\n                        Accountability Programs\n\n       Procter & Gamble; Corporate Mentoring Program: The \n     objective of the program is to ensure that there is an \n     experienced manager to act as ``a trusted counselor, coach, \n     role model, advisor and voice of experience'' to managers \n     with less experience who are expected to advance within the \n     organization. The first priority of the company was to ensure \n     that minorities and women who had been identified as having \n     advancement potential have mentors because of the higher \n     turnover rates among these managers.\n       Baxter Healthcare Corporation; Affirmative Action Strategy; \n     Balanced Work Force Initiative: The program holds managers \n     individually accountable for recruiting, retaining and \n     promoting minorities and women. Managers are provided with \n     guidelines for developing professional skills and, at year \n     end, are required to complete detailed summaries of their \n     efforts. Managers then submit the forms to corporate \n     headquarters for an in-depth review of their achievements. \n     Baxter then reinforces support for managers' initiatives by \n     tying 20 percent of their discretionary bonus to their ``good \n     faith'' efforts and pursuit of corporate goals. Both the \n     number of female vice presidents and the number of female \n     division presidents have increased substantially since 1988.\n       Corning Glass Works, Inc.; Quality Improvement Teams: To \n     counteract a trend in attrition, the company assigned senior \n     managers to separate quality improvement teams, one for \n     women's advancement and one for the advancement of African \n     Americans. After an intensive six-month effort, involving \n     surveys and focus groups, the teams made recommendations for \n     improving the workplace. Some of the outcomes include \n     mandatory gender and racial awareness training for managers \n     and professionals, the introduction of career planning \n     systems, and improved communication.\n       Square D Co.; Diversity Goal Setting: Goals for preparing \n     high potential female employees for management positions (at \n     salaries of $60,000 and above) were developed and presented \n     to senior executive staff. In 1991, it was decided that a \n     minimum of 20 percent of manager's bonuses would be based on \n     their effectiveness in meeting corporate goals to recruit, \n     develop, and promote women.\n\n[[Page S4949]]\n\n                          Suggestion Planning\n\n       Tenneco, Inc.; Executive Incentive Compensation Program: \n     This program links a significant percentage of each \n     executive's bonus to the attainment of defined divisional \n     goals to promote minorities and women. Three-quarters of this \n     percentage relates to these pre-established goals, which are \n     separate for minorities and women and are set by each company \n     according to its individual workforce and location; the \n     remaining one-quarter is for implementing programs directed \n     at developing and advancing targeted groups.\n       American Airlines; Supertrack: The company is taking a \n     multifaceted approach to retaining, developing, and promoting \n     minorities and women. Supertrack requires officers to submit \n     detailed, cross-functional development plans for all high-\n     potential minorities and women in middle management and \n     above.\n       Career Development Program (CDP): American's Career \n     Development Program (CDP), a sophisticated, computerized job-\n     posting system, allows employees to signal their interest in \n     positions before vacancies occur. Company-wide posting also \n     helps reduce potential for discrimination or favoritism by \n     providing all employees with instant job information.\n       Women in Operations Management Advisory Council: To boost \n     women's representation in nontraditional positions, a task \n     force was established: Women in Operations Management \n     Advisory Council. The goals of the group are to identify the \n     barriers for women in nontraditional areas, to educate female \n     employees on the growing opportunities in technical fields \n     and to serve as mentors to female employees.\n       Hershey Foods; Senior Management Review: The advancement of \n     minorities and women is one of the many goals of the \n     succession planning process. During the company's Senior \n     Management Review, high-growth individuals and potential \n     high-growth individuals are identified as part of the annual \n     meeting of top-level executives. Managers compile profiles of \n     the high-growth individuals. The profiles include performance \n     strengths, weaknesses, and areas that need development, the \n     next planned or anticipated\n      position, and the anticipated position or level in five \n     years. A five-year development plan charts the path from \n     the employee's present position to anticipated position.\n       Cross Entity Review: Lateral movement or promotions from \n     one division to another are identified to help develop an \n     individual through new experiences. It also serves a business \n     purpose by placing key employees where their expertise is \n     needed.\n       McCormack & Dodge; Succession Management Resources Review \n     (SMRR): A component of a larger initiative to foster career \n     advancement, SMRR is the process by which all senior managers \n     evaluate those managers who report to them directly and \n     determine their readiness for progression into even more \n     senior positions. Senior managers must also identify the \n     critical skills, training and job experiences that each \n     middle manager must have in order to be promoted to more \n     senior positions. A detailed, individualized development plan \n     is prepared for these individuals and is reviewed by \n     executives on an annual basis. These plans are reinforced \n     through performance evaluation and other goal-setting \n     processes.\n       Motorola, Inc.; Succession Planning with Clout: To \n     accelerate women's advancement, the company implemented this \n     program in 1986. The program features an ambitious, \n     corporate-wide ``Parity Initiative,'' which requires, by year \n     end 1996, that the representation of minorities and women at \n     every management level mirrors the representation of these \n     groups in the general population. The ``Parity Initiative'' \n     has already produced results: In September 1989 Motorola had \n     two female vice presidents; today it has fourteen. To achieve \n     these goals, the company uses a succession planning process, \n     the ``Organization and Management Development Review,'' which \n     is unique in that it reaches down to the entry and mid-levels \n     of management and holds managers accountable for developing \n     and retaining minorities and women.\n                    Workforce Diversity Initiatives\n\n       Public Service Electric & Gas Company; Multi-level, \n     company-wide succession planning: Once a year each \n     departmental head completes several succession planning \n     forms: One is an organizational chart on which succession \n     candidates, their readiness dates and their development needs \n     are identified. Another form asks department heads to \n     indicate any human resources issues they're confronting. \n     Finally, department heads rate the performance of each \n     employee on a scale of one to five--one indicating a high \n     potential fast tracker; five indicating unsatisfactory \n     performance. Focus is on the number of minorities and women \n     designated as promotable and on the development opportunities \n     outlined for them.\n       Avon Products, Inc.; Communication System: This grassroots \n     communication system monitors problems and opportunities \n     related to diversity. Minority network groups exist as forums \n     at which people of color can identify and discuss career-\n     related issues. Officer sponsors provide guidance and \n     mentoring. These networks communicate their concerns to a \n     multi-cultural committee which, in turn, makes \n     recommendations to senior management to effect positive \n     change. On a monthly basis, the Corporate Women and \n     Minorities Committee, founded by a former CEO, checks the \n     company's progress in meetings to ensure access to management \n     for minorities and women.\n       Managing Diversity: Avon defines managing diversity as \n     ``creating a culture that provides opportunity for all \n     associates to reach their full potential in pursuit of \n     corporate objectives.'' Their conceptualization of diversity \n     encompasses the more obvious differences such as age, gender, \n     race, and culture, as well as the more subtle dimensions such \n     as work style, life style, and physical capacity and \n     characteristics. Managers at every level are responsible for \n     Avon's progress in diversity. In addition, Avon encourages \n     the comprehension and support of diversity by all employees.\n       General Electric, NY Silicone Manufacturing Division; \n     Grassroots Diversity Initiative: The Silicon Manufacturing \n     Division has increased the number of minorities and women \n     entries to 30 percent. In 1989, an informal network created a \n     grass-roots diversity initiative at the company in response \n     to problems experienced by women and people of color. \n     Specialized characteristics of the initiative include\n      teamwork and diversity training. A review board examined \n     such issues as family leave, flexible hours, personal and \n     professional development, and other programs. Since the \n     implementation of the program, there has been an increase \n     in the number of women in managerial positions including \n     women of color. Mentoring, an important component of the \n     program, was established to provide minorities and women \n     with role models who would give the participants insight \n     into the corporate culture and management systems.\n       General Foods; Diversity Management Steering Committee: \n     General Foods began its diversity effort by forming a \n     Diversity Management Steering Committee, chaired by the \n     president and including 10 senior executives, to monitor all \n     company activities relating to affirmative action and \n     diversity management. A full-time human resources position \n     dedicated solely to diversity management was established, \n     along with a Workforce 2000 Council to address the issues of \n     the upward mobility of minorities and women, networking, and \n     career/family balance. A huge training effort was then \n     launched for the entire salaried employee population. The \n     goal of the training is to increase awareness of changing \n     workforce demographics, the diversity efforts of competing \n     companies, and the internal cultural barriers that inhibit \n     the productivity of minorities and women.\n       McDonald's; changing Workforce Programs: Formalized more \n     than a decade ago, the programs are based on a premise of \n     respect for all contributors to the business. Comprising six \n     progressive management development modules, the program has \n     helped ensure that employees of both genders and all cultures \n     can reach their full professional potential. Through the \n     modules, class participants are encouraged to explore \n     personal attitudes and assumptions that can become barriers \n     to their professional growth, or the growth of employees they \n     manage. Training courses offered include: Managing the \n     Changing Workforce (MCW); Women's Career Development (WCD), \n     Black Career Development (BCD); Hispanic Career Development \n     (HCD); Managing Cultural Differences (MCD) and Managing \n     Diversity (MD).\n       PDQ Personnel Services; Workforce Diversity Initiatives: \n     PDQ has developed ongoing relationships with diverse business \n     groups to generate continuous referrals and to promote the \n     advancement of minorities and women. It has developed \n     outreach to organizations representing minorities and women \n     such as the Latin Business Association, Black Business \n     Association, and the Urban League. These organizations assist \n     PDQ with recruitment outside the company. PDQ has developed \n     non-gender and non-racial interview questions which are \n     uniformly administered to all candidates being considered for \n     management positions.\n       Procter & Gamble; Corporate Diversity Strategy Task Force: \n     In 1988, the president commissioned this task force, \n     intentionally including line vice presidents, to redefine the \n     importance of a multicultural work force and to identify \n     strategies for managing diversity. In terms of diversity \n     training, the company offers awareness training, symposiums \n     on women and minority issues, and ``onboarding'' programs \n     that help orient new hires with special attention to gender \n     and minority concerns. To foster development and retention, \n     all managers receive regular career assessments in which they \n     and their supervisors identify the skills they need to \n     advance.\n       Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; Beyond Diversity Effort: \n     The Institute views itself as a microcosm of the broad \n     society: they have developed initiatives that cut across the \n     entire university community in order to adequately prepare \n     students for the work force. The program was established as \n     part of the Institute's recent strategic planning progress. \n     It offers both students and faculty opportunities to learn \n     and participate in different cultures and lifestyles through \n     lectures, concerts, travel, workshops, and task forces.\n       US WEST; Pluralism Performance Menu (PPM): Pluralism \n     Performance Menu, initiated in October 1990, is a measurement \n     device for tracking the performance of the company's officers \n     on their quantitative and qualitative efforts to develop and \n     advance minorities and women. The PPM lists criteria for \n     measuring officers' efforts. Every \n     [[Page S4950]] six months, officers submit a completed menu \n     to corporate headquarters where the data are analyzed. Each \n     officer is provided with feedback and suggestions for \n     improvement. The short-term\n      goal of the PPM was to boost the company's recruitment, \n     development, and advancement of minorities and women. The \n     PPM is designed to raise the company's commitment to \n     diversity to a new plane so that, in the long run, \n     promoting diversity will become second nature to all \n     employees.\n       US WEST; Women of Color Project: See US West: Leadership \n     and Career Development.\n       Workshop: White Maleism and the Corporate Culture: The goal \n     of this workshop is to improve the communication between men \n     and women and to help men avoid seeing women in the workplace \n     as a threat, and instead as ``an opportunity for greater \n     economic prosperity and increased personal enrichment.''\n       Xerox Corporation; Asset Management Program: This program \n     was started in 1983 to foster mobility of women of color \n     within the company's Development and Manufacturing \n     Organization. The program combines formal training and on-\n     the-job experience. It is intended to provide exposure to and \n     understanding of the manufacturing operation through \n     intensive on-the-job experiences under the direction of the \n     plant manager. The plant manager also serves as mentor to the \n     candidate to ensure that the program's objectives are \n     fulfilled through each developmental phase.\n   Workforce Diversity Initiatives Corporate Women's Groups/Networks\n\n       Avon Products, Inc.; Avon Multicultural Committee: Avon has \n     three strong groups: the Avon Asian Network, the Avon \n     Hispanic Network, and the Black Professional Association \n     (BPA). These groups originated in the 1970's as the Concerned \n     Women of Avon, which then became the Women and Minorities \n     Committee. In the mid-1980s committee members branched out \n     and began networks and to address their specific needs. \n     Management developed an organized system through which \n     networks and committees feed into each other to ensure a \n     consistent flow of information and communication. In order to \n     be credible, the group has made sure that its objectives are \n     consistent with the company's goals. The committee is \n     structured to help Avon implement its business strategy of \n     becoming a multicultural workplace. The group has developed \n     an operational structure with officers and regular meetings \n     that follow the accepted business protocol at Avon. In \n     addition, the committee tries to be open about its intentions \n     and to communicate clearly and consistently.\n       Case Western Reserve University; Salary Equity Committee: \n     Established in 1992, this committee reviewed the salary \n     distribution of all university faculty and its findings have \n     been shared with the entire University community. This kind \n     of open review will be done annually. An external consultant \n     annually reviews the staff salary plan to ensure equity. \n     Every performance appraisal carries two levels of review \n     within its division and a review by a compensation section of \n     the Human Resources Office for equity, appropriateness, and \n     consistency.\n       Hoffmann-LaRoche; Concerned Women of Roche (CWR): Founded \n     in 1972, CWR is one of the older corporate women's groups in \n     the country. The 400-member group seeks to encourage women to \n     develop their abilities to the fullest potential; it actively \n     supports the company's Equal Employment Opportunity/\n     Affirmative Action program and champions Hoffmann-LaRoche's \n     policies on behalf of women's advancement and work/family \n     balance. The group is recognized as a viable corporate entity \n     with full support of management. Recognizing the growing need \n     for child care, CWR championed the concept of an on-site \n     center. After conducting a feasibility study\n      and assessing employee child care needs, the Hoffmann-La \n     Roche Child Care Center sponsored a child care center in \n     1979. It was established in New Jersey and was one of the \n     first in the country. Also, at the request of management, \n     CWR had input into the company's maternity leave and \n     sexual harassment policies. CWR also spearheads the \n     company's mentoring program (which was recently expanded \n     to include bilingual mentors), offers career counseling \n     and skills workshops four times a year, and provides a \n     wide range of programs for employees and their families. \n     Hoffmann-La Roche funds these programs and other CWR \n     activities.\n       Honeywell, Inc.; Women's Council: Formed in 1978, the group \n     has approximately 35 members who represent a wide range of \n     job functions, levels, and organizational units. They \n     exemplify the diverse workforce in terms of age, race, and \n     family status. Initially, the group was chartered to \n     contribute to a working environment that would attract and \n     retain quality female employees and encourage personal growth \n     of all employees. Its goals were to identify, study, and make \n     recommendations on issues of concern to Honeywell women and \n     support women who sought career mobility.\n       After gaining management support, the Council moved beyond \n     its original emphasis on programming to providing recognized \n     policy input. Without abandoning its original broad agenda, \n     the group now focuses on identifying and studying issues of \n     concern to Honeywell women and barriers to their upward \n     mobility, and makes recommendations about how both management \n     and employees can work to remove these barriers. The Council \n     comprises employees from both the professional and \n     administrative ranks.\n    Workforce Diversity Initiatives Gender/Racial Awareness Training\n\n       Arthur Andersen & Co.; Men and Women as Colleagues: This \n     gender awareness training program was introduced in May 1990 \n     at the accounting firm's Dallas office. It aims to enhance \n     interpersonal communication between male and female \n     employees, legitimize discussion of workplace gender issues, \n     increase understanding of the business benefits of creating a \n     supportive environment for women, and help Andersen attract \n     and retain female employees. Based on the success of the \n     Dallas office pilot, the program has been endorsed by \n     Andersen's national human resources office and is now being \n     conducted at multiple locations throughout the country.\n       E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company; Personal Safety: The \n     company has chosen to address in a business context the \n     growing social problem of personal violence, including rape, \n     wife/spouse battering, and child and elder abuse. Senior \n     management recognizes that employees'concerns about safety, \n     both on and off the job, can prevent them from fully reaching \n     their potential. Du Pont's program contributes to a \n     supportive work environment and improved productivity by \n     helping employees address previously ignored areas of mental \n     stress and by opening the lines of communication between men \n     and women.\n       Core Groups: These specialized workshops were implemented \n     in 1988 to sensitize white, upper-level managers to gender \n     and racial issues. Comprising 12 to 18 employees (five of \n     whom are white male managers, and the remaining minorities \n     and women), core groups meet with an outside facilitator for \n     eight hours a month, on company time if they choose. Senior \n     vice presidents are encouraged to form core groups within \n     their own departments, and members either self-select or are \n     invited to participate. While the groups have a life of their \n     own, they typically last about a year. Occasionally members \n     of the group will continue to meet on an ad hoc basis once \n     the group has disbanded.\n       Hughes Aircraft; Gender/Racial Awareness Training: Hughes \n     has implemented a series of ``Managing a Diverse Workforce'' \n     training programs for management/supervisors, as well as \n     career development seminars for minorities and women. Hughes \n     also has a variety of management and professional development \n     programs, including the Chairman's Executive Leadership \n     Program, Line Managers Development Course, Contract Managers \n     Course, and the Management Action Workshop for new \n     supervisors and middle managers. All of these programs are \n     monitored on a regular basis to determine the enrollment \n     patterns of minorities and women.\n       JC Penney Co., Inc.; Diversity Awareness Workshops Skills \n     Development Workshops: JC Penney Co., Inc. created its own \n     two-day workshop on managing a diverse workforce. All profit-\n     sharing managers in the company have attended the program. \n     The workshop objectives are to create an awareness of \n     cultural differences, to develop an understanding of how \n     these diverse cultures benefit the workplace environment, and \n     improve communications between an increasingly diverse \n     workforce. Additionally, 120 key senior managers attended a \n     week-long multi-cultural workshop that uses relationship and \n     team-building to reinforce the value of diversity.\n       3M; The Women's Advisory Committee: The 3M Women's Advisory \n     Committee's mission is ``to influence and effect change in 3M \n     to assure that all employees can participate and contribute \n     equally.'' The statement emphasizes change and focuses \n     attention on promoting women's career and leadership \n     development through identification of issues, communication \n     to 3M about women's concerns, and recommendation of specific \n     action plans. The committee provides direct advice to senior \n     management committees regarding policies that impact 3M \n     women. The committee has contributed to the implementation of \n     a number of significant programs including: supervisory and \n     management development programs, internal communications on \n     diversity in the workforce, an improved performance appraisal \n     system, employee initiated part-time employment, and internal \n     personnel search required for all job openings.\n       MCA, Inc.; Gender/racial Awareness Training: A Diversity \n     Awareness Program, first targeting senior executives and then \n     all management staff, enhances and sustains a work \n     environment that is responsive to the changing demographics \n     of MCA's workforce, eliminates any attitudinal barriers that \n     hinder the hiring and promotion of people of diverse \n     backgrounds, and reaffirms the company's commitment to \n     considering candidates from diverse backgrounds for all jobs. \n     More than 300 management personnel have attended. A Diversity \n     Forum has been established to address diversity issues that \n     emerge on a day-to-day basis.\n       North Broward Hospital District; Bridges: This voluntary \n     management training program helps develop the skills needed \n     to manage a diverse workforce through a 32-hour series of \n     workshops involving role playing and interactive \n     conversations. The eight training modules focus on \n     intercultural perceptions, gender stereotypes, subtle racial \n     sterotypes, ethnic identify, organizational culture, \n     intercultural conflict, and communications barriers. Ninety-\n     four percent of those participating in the program found it \n     excellent or very good.\n       [[Page S4951]] Pitney-Bowes, Inc.; Minorities Resource \n     Group/Women's Resource Group: The two groups play significant \n     roles in enriching the company's equal opportunity \n     environment. The groups work with both senior management and \n     human resources personnel to provide input into programs and \n     new initiatives such as candidate slating, job posting, \n     development of management training programs, the mentor \n     program, recruiting and hiring practices, and enhancing \n     upward mobility for all employees in the company.\n       Port Authority of New York and New Jersey; Women's Equity \n     (WE): WE was organized by a small of management women to \n     reduce their sense of isolation and to promote women's upward \n     mobility. By 1984, women were well represented in junior and \n     mid-management jobs; subsequently, WE began to recognize the \n     importance of women's voice in the workplace and to lobby the \n     agency's leaders about women's concerns. Issues of primary \n     interest included\n      flextime, parental leave, child care, and the availability \n     of promotion opportunities for all women. Opening up \n     membership into the women's organization at all levels was \n     a logical step because the group's steering committee \n     believed they would gain greater clout when voicing \n     concerns to management by representing more women in the \n     agency. To recruit new members, WE planned programs to \n     involve women at all levels, such as a workshop on \n     juggling work and family obligations, a display on women's \n     historical contributions to the Port Authority, and health \n     seminars. To ensure the relevance and usefulness of the \n     programs to all members, Women's Equity also sought \n     nonmanagement women's involvement on the steering \n     committee and on each of its five subcommittees. The group \n     then planned a special workshop cosponsored by Asian, \n     African American, and Hispanic groups to help recruit \n     women for nontraditional jobs such as the construction \n     trades.\n       Raychem Corporation; Women's Network: The Network was \n     developed in early 1991 to address women's isolation in the \n     corporation's heavily male-dominated culture. The Women's \n     Network issues a newsletter to more than 200 female and male \n     employees. The Network is drafting its formal charter, \n     organizing focus groups with female employees and top \n     management, and launching a formal study to determine whether \n     there are barriers to career development at Raychem. A \n     positive and constructive approach and its practice of \n     communicating with management regularly and openly are \n     attributes that led to the group's success.\n       Ryder Systems, Inc.; Women's Management Association: \n     Founded in 1982, the Women's Management Association defines \n     itself as a ``business association.'' Its objectives include \n     helping women to become more effective in their jobs, \n     apprising senior management of women's concerns and \n     recommending practical solutions, and improving the knowledge \n     of members of Ryder's businesses and customers. A unique \n     aspect of the group and a key to its success is the \n     involvement of senior management. The group is guided by a \n     Governing board, comprised of 10 senior-level female \n     managers, and an Executive Adivsory Committee,\n      comprised of four of the chairman's direct reports and human \n     resources executives. Throughout the year, the group \n     sponsors special events featuring nationally recognized \n     business leaders, and frequently asks Ryder's corporate \n     and division officers to formally speak to members about \n     company growth and business plans. Having the group's \n     objectives aligned with corporate objectives and the \n     involvement of senior management have been critical to its \n     success.\n       Tenneco, Inc.; Women's Advisory Council: The council was \n     established in January 1988 by then Chairman James L. \n     Ketelsen to help increase the number of women in leadership \n     positions. Since then, the group has worked with management \n     and corporate human resources officers to achieve its goals. \n     Approximately 20 executive and management women from all \n     company divisions are part of the Council, which also has a \n     non-member senior executive liaison. The council receives its \n     operating budget from the company and uses company personnel, \n     facilities and communications services. Members of the \n     Women's Advisory Council helped corporate human resources \n     officers facilitate company-wide adoption of ``Workforce 2000 \n     Initiatives,'' a training program for addressing workforce \n     diversity issues. The group also assisted corporate human \n     resources officers in developing the ``Work/Family Support \n     Program,'' which offers a range of work and family benefits, \n     including a six-month, unpaid family care leave. The number \n     of women in senior management has grown significantly since \n     the Council was established.\n       Texas Instruments; Corporate Services Women's Initiative: \n     The Initiative is a management-supported group of \n     approximately 50 female engineers, managers, and technical \n     employees in the company's Corporate Services division. \n     Founded as a grassroots effort by two women in 1990, the \n     stated charter of the group is to champion the full \n     participation of Corporate Services women at all levels and \n     aspects of the business by promoting their professional and \n     personal goals. The Women's Initiative helps top management \n     understand and resolve issues that will enable the company to \n     better recruit and retain women. Using the Corporate Services \n     Women's Initiative as a model, five additional women's \n     networks have formed in other company divisions.\n    Workforce Diversity Initiatives Elimination of Sexual Harassment\n\n       Apple Computer; Sexual Harassment Policy: The policy was \n     instituted in February 1991 as part of an overall effort to \n     bring more structure to a relatively liberal environment. \n     When confronted with sexual harassment situations, the \n     company is not reluctant to take action, offenders are \n     terminated when appropriate. The policy has three components: \n     a statement defining and prohibiting sexual harassment, a \n     section outlining managers' responsibility, and a section \n     describing the process of filing and resolving grievances.\n       AT Policy Training manual: A company-wide sexual \n     harassment policy was implemented in the early 1980's as a \n     step toward ensuring a nondiscriminatory workplace. The \n     employee manual, ``Dealing With Sexual Harassment, a Guide \n     for Employees,'' conveys the nature and implications of \n     sexual harassment by illustrating real-life examples of \n     improper behavior, and consequences for harassers. The ``New \n     Focus on Sexual Harassment'' workshop sensitizes supervisors \n     and employees to the nuances of sexual harassment through \n     videotapes, case studies, and role playing.\n       E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company; A Matter of Respect: In \n     1987, the company developed this four-hour workshop to help \n     create a responsible and respectful environment free of \n     sexual harassment and discrimination. The workshop uses a \n     videotape of real-life examples of sexual harassment, \n     including the more subtle forms, the offensiveness of which \n     men are often unaware. After an employee discussion of their \n     perceptions of sexual harassment, the facilitators define the \n     legal parameters and implications of sexual harassment. \n     Another video shows the company's chief executive officer \n     expressing his disapproval of sexual harassment. The final \n     segment outlines the resources available to employers and the \n     actions they can take.\n                        Family Friendly Programs\n\n       Eastman Kodak Company; Work and Family Program: A task \n     force was appointed in November 1986 to examine work and \n     family issues. The task force reviewed the programs of 33 \n     work-and-family-supportive companies, surveyed 2,000 Kodak \n     employees and consulted with work and family specialists. The \n     result was a comprehensive work and family program which \n     includes up to 17 weeks of unpaid, job-protected family \n     leave, child care resource and referral service, and \n     corporate funding for start-up cost for day-care homes in \n     Kodak communities.\n       Parental Leave: A surprisingly high number of men have \n     taken advantage of a generous family leave policy without \n     stigma and without derailing their careers. Also unusual is \n     the length of leave the men have taken to care for their \n     infants: an average of 12.2 weeks, which is just a week less \n     than the average leave for mothers. Full health coverage \n     continues during leave, and employees are assured of \n     returning to the same or comparable job.\n       Fel-Pro Inc.; Family Friendly Programs: Fel-Pro increased \n     its financial aid for adoption from $2,500 to $5,000 and \n     increased its tuition refund benefits from $2,500 to $3,000 \n     for undergraduate studies and from $5,000 to $6,500 for \n     graduate studies. Tuition reimbursement has been extended to \n     part-time employees, who are mostly female.\n       John Hancock Financial Services; Family Care Issues: The \n     company designed its innovative Family Care Issues to help \n     recruit and retain top talent. The company has instituted a \n     program that includes such benefits as a one-year unpaid \n     leave of absence and an on-site child care center. But the \n     company has gone beyond traditional work and family programs: \n     a Summer Care Fair offers employees and the public \n     information about summer camps and programs in New England \n     and a ``Kids-to-go'' program works with local day care \n     centers to provide activities for the school-aged children of \n     employees during school holidays and vacations.\n       Johnson & Johnson; Balancing Work and Family Program: The \n     program includes the following components: Child Care \n     Resource and Referral; On-site Child Development Centers; \n     Dependent Care Assistance Plans; Family Care Leave; Family \n     Care Absence; Flexible Work Schedules; Adoption Benefits; \n     SchoolMatch; Elder Care Resource and Referral; Relocation \n     Planning; and Employed Spouse Relocation Services. These \n     initiatives were designed in large part to address the \n     changing composition of their work force--the increasing \n     numbers of women, two-career families, single parents, and \n     the children of elderly parents. The company conducted a \n     survey that showed that between 1990 and 1992, supervisors \n     became significantly more supportive of employees when work/\n     family problems arose and supervisors were also seen as more \n     supportive of the use of flexible time and leave policies. \n     There was, however, no impact on absenteeism or tardiness.\n       Marquette Electronics; On-Site Daycare, Flexible Work \n     Schedules: Marquette has two on-site centers serving 175 \n     children. Workers can adjust their schedules daily, if \n     necessary, to meet family needs.\n       NationsBank; Shared Parenting: The bank is one of the \n     first, if not the only company to offer fathers paid time off \n     to care for their newborn children. The policy is based on \n     the company's belief that parenting is a shared \n     responsibility. New fathers receive up to six \n     [[Page S4952]] weeks of paid paternity leave: for each year \n     of service they accrue one week of leave.\n       SC Johnson Wax; Child care/parental leave: One of the \n     company's foremost work and family benefits is its on-site \n     child care program, established in 1985. The child care \n     program provides before- and after-school care, \n     transportation to and from school, a kindergarten program and \n     parent training for employees. The center has been accredited \n     by the National Association for the Education of Young \n     Children. During the summer, the company offers full-time day \n     care for school-age children of employees.\n      The parental leave policy allows up to three months of \n     unpaid leave for both male and female employees. This is \n     in addition to the paid medical leave for the mother. The \n     option to work part-time following parental leave is also \n     available.\n       Pacific Gas and Electric; Adoption Reimbursement Program: \n     The Adoption Reimbursement Program reimburses employees for \n     100 percent of their covered expenses--up to a maximum of \n     $2,000. The adoption of stepchildren is covered and adopted \n     children can be any age up to 18. There are no limits on the \n     number of adoptions per employee that can qualify for \n     reimbursement. Covered expenses include legal, court, \n     adoption agency and placement fees, medical expenses, and \n     transportation expenses, and transportation expenses with \n     picking up the child.\n       JC Penny Co., Inc.; On-Site Child Care: A child care center \n     in the home office building is available to all JC Penny Co., \n     Inc. employees. The 10,000-square-foot facility can \n     accommodate 157 children from 6 weeks to 5 years of age at an \n     average cost of $100 per week.\n       Tandem Computer, Inc.; Model Maternity Leave: Tandem has \n     offered a nine-week unpaid parental leave for over 10 years. \n     A full-time disability leave manager helps expectant parents \n     obtain and process the necessary medical and insurance forms, \n     and an on-staff nurse is available to check on the health of \n     pregnant employees. Tandem also recognizes infertility by \n     covering up to three in-vitro fertilization treatments as \n     well as expenses for surrogate mothers.\n       US Sprint; FamilyCare Program: To generate awareness and \n     build broad-based support. Sprint appointed 150 employees \n     from a range of company divisions to 11 career and family \n     action teams. The teams developed the blueprint of the \n     FamilyCare program. Announced in July 1989, FamilyCare \n     provides flexible work schedules, a dependent-care resource \n     and referral service, adoption assistance, personal and \n     family counseling, working partner relocation assistance, and \n     flexible health-care benefits.\n       Arthur Andersen & Co.; Flexible Work Program: The program \n     allows female or male managers to return to work on a part-\n     time basis for up to three years following the birth or \n     adoption of a child, while maintaining the benefits of a \n     full-time employee. Andersen clearly communicates that \n     managers who work part-time at some point in their careers \n     will remain eligible for partnership; flexible work \n     arrangements will lengthen an employee's progression toward \n     partnership, not derail it.\n       Corning Glass Works, Inc.; Alternative Job Schedules: \n     Corning's policy states that ``alternative job schedules are \n     privileges--not rights.'' An employee must have a good \n     performance rating and the position must lend itself to a \n     nontraditional schedule. Options include part-time, flextime, \n     job sharing, and work at home.\n       Eastman Kodak Company; Professional Flexible Work \n     (Arrangements (FWAs): Flexible work arrangements, including \n     those at the managerial level, have been available on an ad \n     hoc basis since the early 1980s. In November 1988 a formal \n     policy was introduced in which part-time, job sharing, and \n     flextime are available to all employees.\n       North Carolina National Bank; Alternative Work Schedules: \n     In 1987 the bank began offering employees on parental leave \n     the opportunity to rejoin the workforce at their own pace \n     during a six-month leave period. Employees arrange their \n     schedules with their managers, receive full benefits and a \n     prorated salary, and return to the same or comparable \n     position. The bank also offers Select Time, a part-time \n     program instituted in 1988. Although Select Time has been \n     used mostly by officers and managers, it is available to any \n     employee who has worked at NCNB at least a year and performs \n     at a level rated ``satisfactory'' or above.\n       Pacific Bell; Telecommuting: Pacific Bell has been \n     researching the business costs and payoffs of telecommuting \n     since the inception of its pilot telecommuting program in May \n     1985. The company defines telecommuting as working from a \n     site other than the office using telecommunications \n     technology.\n          Family Friendly Programs Flexible Work Arrangements\n\n       The San Francisco Bar Association; Model Alternative Work \n     Schedule Policy: The policy, drafted by the association's \n     Committee on Equality, outlines four options that it says \n     firms should make available to lawyers: (1) flextime; (2) \n     part-time; (3) job sharing; and (4) flexiplace. The model \n     policy is compatible with the American Bar Association, the \n     Oregon State Bar Association and the policy put forth by the \n     Minnesota Women Lawyers. The four models agree that: \n     Alternative work schedules should be available to both men \n     and women; Compensation should be calculated on a pro rata \n     basis, with full or pro rata benefits; There should be \n     periodic review of alternative work schedule arrangements; \n     There should be uninhibited promotion and advancement for \n     part-time attorneys, but those attorneys have a \n     responsibility to keep regular hours and to be available even \n     when not in the office.\n       Sidley & Austin; Part-time Work Policy: The law firm, \n     located in Chicago, introduced a part-time work policy in \n     1987. Part-time, normally 60 to 80 percent of a full-time \n     work load, is not restricted to dependent-care needs. Most \n     often it is new mothers who take advantage of the policy, \n     which entitles them to take up to an eight-month, full-time \n     parental leave. After this leave ends, the firm permits the \n     associate to work part-time for up to six months. If the \n     arrangement does not jeopardize the needs of the practice, an \n     employee can request to work part-time indefinitely.\n       Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom; Part-time policy: In \n     1981, the law firm adopted a policy allowing attorneys with \n     two years of experience at the firm to work part-time. In \n     1984, the option was expanded to include new recruits. The \n     policy has no restrictions in terms of duration. While part-\n     time attorneys are not on the partnership track, they can \n     pursue partnership once they return to full-time status.\n       Steelcase, Inc.; Professional Job Sharing: After offering \n     job-sharing for 6 years to nonexempt salaried employees, the \n     company extended the option to its entire work force in 1988. \n     Management encourages employees and their supervisors to \n     customize job sharing arrangements. The most common \n     arrangement features a weekly schedule divided between the \n     partners. Job sharers receive half of their medical, dental, \n     and life insurance benefits, but can purchase a full package \n     at the company's group rate. Vacation and sick days are \n     prorated, and annual merit raises and promotion opportunities \n     are preserved.\n       Tucson Medical Center; Alternative Scheduling: The 15-\n     member Nursing Recruitment and Retention Committee works with \n     senior administration and the governing board to identify \n     projects and programs that help prevent or reduce the effects \n     of the nursing shortage. Staffing and scheduling are known to \n     be areas of dissatisfaction for nurses and may cause a nurse \n     to leave an institution. Tucson Medical Center has the \n     traditional eight-hour shift, and also ten-hour, twelve hour, \n     split, and other nontraditional shifts. In many cases, \n     through a process of self-scheduling, the nurses put these \n     shifts together to provide 24-hour coverage. This departure \n     from traditional scheduling by the management team allows \n     staff nurses to develop their own work calendar within some \n     pre-established parameters.\n       Aetna Life & Casualty; Family Benefits: A Family Leave \n     Policy was implemented in June 1988. The policy grants \n     employees, both male and female, up to six months of unpaid \n     leave following the birth or adoption of a child or to deal \n     with a serious illness of a parent, spouse, or child.\n       Corning Glass Works, Inc.; Policy: The parential leave \n     policy provides six weeks of disability leave for maternity, \n     including full benefits, followed by an optional 20 weeks of \n     child care leave for new fathers as well as mothers, \n     including adoptive parents, and an optional part-time return. \n     At the end of parental leave or at any other point an \n     employee needs more time for family care responsibilities, he \n     or she may elect to work flexible hours, arrange a job \n     sharing situation or work at home. The program allows \n     employees temporary part-time work assignments when they need \n     to devote extra time to caring for children or other \n     dependent relatives.\n       IBM; Policy: In October 1988, IBM extended its unpaid \n     personal leave of absence from 1 to 3 years to help employees \n     balance career and family responsibilities. Employees taking \n     leaves of one year or less are guaranteed their same or a \n     comparable job upon return; workers who take longer leaves \n     are assured of a job but not necessarily at the same salary \n     or level.\n       Proskauer, Rose, Goetz & Mendelsohn; Family Benefits for \n     Men: In March 1989, this law firm adopted a policy granting \n     three-month paid parental leaves for male and female \n     associates. The policy dictates that ``eligibility for \n     partnership consideration shall not be affected in any way by \n     the fact that an associate has been on child care leave, \n     although the timing of such consideration may be affected if \n     the leave or leaves are for extended periods.'' To qualify \n     for the paternity leave, new fathers must be the primary \n     caregiver in the family and must have been employed by the \n     firm for at least a year.\n       Allstate Insurance Company, American Express Company, Amoco \n     Corporation, IBM, Johnson & Johnson, Motorola, Inc., The \n     Travelers, Xerox Corporation, and Work/Family Directions; The \n     American Business Collaboration for Quality Dependent Care: \n     The program is championed by Allstate Insurance Company, \n     American Express Company, Amoco Corporation, IBM Corporation, \n     Johnson & Johnson, Motorola, Inc., The Travelers, Xerox \n     Corporation, and Work/Family Directions. The collaboration is \n     an effort by 109 companies and 28 public and private \n     organizations to ease the work/family conflicts of their \n     employees. This unique effort aims to increase the supply and \n     enhance the quality of dependent care services for their \n     employees and the communities in which they live and work. \n     The Collaboration has invested more than $25 million in 300 \n     dependent care programs in 44 communities.\n       [[Page S4953]] American Express Company, J.P. Morgan, and \n     Philip Morris; Partnership for Eldercare: In collaboration \n     with the New York City Department for the Aging, the program \n     was developed to assist employees with elder-care support. \n     The companies fund the program, and in turn, they choose \n     Department of Aging services that best fit their needs and \n     corporate cultures. Among them are on-site seminars for \n     employees on such topics as legal and financial planning and \n     nursing home placement, individual consultation to assess the \n     elder-care needs of employees and to refer employees to \n     appropriate resources, an elder-care counseling ``hot-line,'' \n     and technical assistance for human resources professionals in \n     designing and communicating elder-care benefits packages. \n     Representatives from sponsoring companies meet on a regular \n     basis to discuss the status, strategies, and goals of the \n     partnership.\n       Champion International Corporation; On-site child care \n     center: Based on an employee survey indicating child care as \n     a major concern, and strong support from its Chief Executive \n     Officer, the company opened an on-site child care center in \n     1988. The 4,900-square-foot center, housed in an office \n     building adjacent to corporate headquarters, was \n     imaginatively designed by an architect with experience in \n     child care center planning. Each age group has a separate \n     room, and a complex security system ensures safety and proper \n     visitor identification. While the center is open to the \n     community, children and\n      grandchildren of Champion employees are given preference. \n     Currently, the center provides care for 60 children aged \n     three months to five years, and a waiting list exists. In \n     keeping with Champion's commitment to accessible, high-\n     quality care, the center is accredited by the National \n     Association for the Education of Young Children.\n       IBM; Elder Care Referral Service (ECRS): IBM introduced its \n     Elder Care Referral Service in February 1988 to ease the \n     caregiving responsibilities of its U.S. employees, retirees, \n     and their spouses. Through a nationwide network of 200 \n     community-based organizations, ECRS provides personalized \n     telephone consultation, which educates employees on elder \n     care issues and refers them to services or care providers in \n     the area in which their dependent relative resides. IBM \n     offers the referral service on a prepaid contractual basis, \n     while the employee or older relative selects and pays for the \n     actual care provided.\n       Stride Rite Corporation; On-site intergenerational center: \n     Opened in March 1990, the center was the first of its kind to \n     be sponsored by an American company. To assist with the \n     center, Stride Rite has enlisted the help of Wheelock \n     College, a Boston-based school that specializes in child care \n     and family studies, and Somerville-Cambridge Elder Services, \n     a local nonprofit agency that provides assistance to the \n     elderly. At full capacity, the center accommodates 55 \n     children (ranging in age from 15 months to 6 years), and 24 \n     adults age 60 and over. To foster the relationship between \n     children and elders, the center sponsors such activities as \n     reading and writing stories, playing games, celebrating \n     holidays, cooking and arts and crafts. It is open to \n     employees as well as to members of the community, some of \n     whom receive state-subsidized membership. There is a sliding-\n     scale fee structure based upon family income.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN.
