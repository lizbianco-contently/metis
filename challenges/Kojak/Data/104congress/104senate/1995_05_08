Mr. President, section 301 of the Congressional Budget and \nImpoundment Control Act of 1974 requires that on or before April 15 of \neach year the Congress shall complete action on a concurrent resolution \non the budget for the fiscal year beginning on October 1 of such year. \nThe failure to meet this deadline, however, has no effect on points of \norder under the Congressional Budget Act. In fact, Congress has met the \ndeadline only three times since enactment of the 1974 Budget Act; \nnamely, for fiscal years 1976, 1977, and 1994. So, it is not unusual \nthat Congress, at the April 15 deadline, has yet to complete action on \nthe 1996 budget resolution.\n  It does seem a little unusual that this year's budget resolution has \nnot been reported by the Budget Committee of either House. Perhaps our \nfriends on the Budget Committees are finding it somewhat more difficult \nto come forward with a budget resolution which will force Congress to \nmake the difficult choices that will be necessary to achieve a balanced \nbudget, than it was to sign the mostly empty pledges that were \ncontained in the vacuous rhetoric of the so-called ``Contract With \nAmerica.''\n  For a while, everything seemed to be going along swimmingly for the \nnew Republican majority in Congress. We have been told over and over \nagain by the House Republican leadership that they would balance the \nbudget by the year 2002, while at the same time they would increase \nmilitary spending, cut taxes by some $630 billion over the next ten \nyears, and take Social Security off the budget-cutting table.\n\n     Thus ornament is but the guiled shore\n     To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf\n     Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,\n     The seeming truth which cunning times put on\n     To entrap the wisest.\n\n  It was obvious to all who examined this visionary proposal that it \namounts to a return to the failed policies of supply-side economics \nundertaken during the Reagan-Bush years. The problem with the Reagan \nplan was that we did the easy part--we massively increased military \nspending and we drastically cut taxes. But when it came to the hard \npart--cutting entitlement spending--everybody balked. We all know what \nresulted from those actions--a string of unprecedented budget deficits \nwhich were the largest the country has ever seen and which ceased to \ngrow only after the election of President Clinton.\n  In other words, we went on a national spending spree on credit--not \npaying our bills, but charging them to future generations. As a result, \nthe national debt rose from $932 billion on January 20, 1981, when \nPresident Reagan was sworn in, to $4.1 trillion on January 20, 1993, \nthe day that Bill Clinton was sworn in as President.\n  Immediately following his election, President Clinton submitted a \nbudget that cut the projected Bush deficits drastically and, in fact, \nin 1993 Congress enacted a massive deficit reduction bill, which \nPresident Clinton signed into law. That package of budget cuts reduced \nthe projected deficits over 5 years by roughly $500 billion, and it was \npassed by both Houses of Congress without a single Republican vote.\n  The economy has responded well to the deficit reduction that has \ntaken place thus far under the leadership of President Clinton. I \nbelieve that the economy will continue to perform well so long as we \ncontinue our efforts to whittle away at the massive deficits built up \nover the dozen Reagan-Bush years.\n  Tough decisions will be required to balance the Federal budget. I \nknow that it will require drastic action. I believe that the American \npeople, as a whole, are prepared to face the tough choices that will \nhave to be faced in order to balance the Federal budget, so long as \nthey are certain that their elected representatives are administering \nthe budget cuts fairly across every sector of the country. The budget \naxe should not be wielded indiscriminately. This round of budget \ncutting, to be effective, should involve priority setting; it should \ninvolve separating out the truly effective and necessary Federal \nGovernment programs from those that are merely nice to have but not \ntruly necessary for the Federal Government to be involved.\n  Furthermore, if we are to achieve fairness in our deficit-elimination \nefforts, we cannot ignore the huge tax subsidies that are written into \nthe Tax Code from time to time and are never looked at again. These \nkinds of tax expenditures, many of which may well serve a worthwhile \nnational purpose, should no longer be allowed to escape scrutiny along \nwith every other area of Federal activity.\n  We are told by the Congressional Research Service that there are over \n120 separate tax expenditures in current law which will cost the U.S. \nTreasury $453 billion this fiscal year. That figure will rise to $568.5 \nbillion in fiscal year 1999--unless Congress and the President enact \nchanges to eliminate and otherwise cut back the growth in some of these \ntax subsidies. If we fail to do so, then how can we possibly expect the \nAmerican people to believe that we have administered budget cuts \nfairly?\n  Incredibly, Mr. President, we have not seen any indication by the \nRepublican leadership that they are prepared to even examine these 120 \nFederal tax subsidies to see if they are necessary or if they can be \nafforded any longer.\n  Instead, we have seen the House pass a massive tax cut bill, which \nwill cost $630 billion over the next 10 years. And, who will get the \nbenefit of those tax cuts? According to the Treasury Department:\n  Nearly half the tax benefits--47 percent--would go to the wealthiest \n10 percent of households. These households all have incomes at least \nsomewhat above $100,000, according to the Treasury measure.\n  The richest 1 percent of households--1.1 million households--would \nreceive 20 percent of the benefits from the tax package, while the \nbottom three-fifths of households--65 million households--would receive \nonly 15.6 percent of the total tax benefits, according to the Treasury \ndata.\n  The average tax reduction for the wealthiest 10 percent of all \nhouseholds would be nearly nine times greater than the average tax \nreduction for the middle fifth of households--$4,821 and $555, \nrespectively.\n  Mr. President, I am totally opposed to tax cuts at this time. I will \nnot vote for President Clinton's tax cuts, I will not vote for the \nHouse-passed tax cuts, or any other tax cuts that may be proposed at \nthis time. We need to keep an eye on the target of reducing the Federal \nbudget deficit until it is eliminated. From press accounts, I \nunderstand that Senator Domenici, the very able and experienced \nchairman of the Budget Committee, is planning to recommend to the \nBudget Committee a budget resolution which, if carried out, would \nresult in a balanced budget for fiscal year 2002. It is my further \nunderstanding that Senator Domenici's proposal will not include a tax \ncut. Instead, a tax cut would have to wait until Congress has enacted \nthe necessary legislation to achieve budget balance, under CBO scoring, \nby 2002.\n  If this is the position of the chairman of the Budget Committee, I \ncommend him for his courage and foresight, and for his integrity in \nplacing the emphasis in this year's budget resolution \n[[Page S6229]] where it clearly should be--on eliminating the deficit \nrather than on cutting taxes. I have long admired and respected the \nintelligence and wisdom of Senator Domenici. He is a Senator who takes \nhis responsibilities very seriously and who works tirelessly to carry \nout these responsibilities.\n  In addition to containing no tax cut, Mr. President, it is also \nimportant that cuts in spending in this year's budget resolution be \nadministered fairly and equitably to both entitlement and discretionary \nspending. As all Senators are aware, the discretionary portion of the \nbudget is under the control of the Appropriations Committees and \namounts to just over one-third, or $549 billion, of the President's \n1996 budget. Of the remainder, net interest on the debt will be $257 \nbillion, or 15.9 percent of the 1996 budget. The other one-half of the \nbudget consists of Social Security--which will equal $351.4 billion, or \n21.8 percent of the 1996 budget--Medicare, Medicaid, and other \nmandatory and entitlement programs.\n  If Social Security is taken off the table, and if we pay the interest \non the debt, which we must, then we have removed almost 38 percent of \nthe budget from budget cuts. We are told that the budget resolution \nwill also not cut military spending, and, in fact, will propose an \nincrease in military spending over the next 7 years. If this is done, \nthen we will have shielded 54 percent of the budget from cuts, leaving \nonly 46 percent, including other entitlements, to undergo budget-\ncutting surgery over the next 7 years.\n  I ask the American people: Is that a fair way to proceed? Is it fair \nto cut $500 billion over the next 7 years from domestic discretionary \nprograms, while increasing military spending?\n  The military consumes $262.2 billion in outlays in the President's \n1996 budget. That amount is almost equal to the $265.8 billion that is \nin the budget for all domestic discretionary programs. This includes \nlaw enforcement, education, infrastructure spending on highways and \ntransit, environmental cleanup, clean air and water, research and \ndevelopment, medical research, NASA, national parks, the Justice \nDepartment, the judiciary, the FBI, and the operations of virtually all \nagencies and departments in the Federal Government.\n  If we follow the Republican plan, we will cut all of these domestic \ndiscretionary programs by approximately 35 percent by the year 2002, at \nthe same time we increase military spending. Is that fair? It is not \nonly unfair, it is pure folly.\n  Furthermore, under the Republican budget plan, the elderly will be \nasked to pay dearly. Medicare will be cut anywhere from $259-$333 \nbillion over the next 7 years. We hear that these cuts are not being \nproposed for deficit reduction but only because Medicare will be broke \nif we do not fix it soon.\n  Well, Mr. President, I see no proposal from the Republicans on how \nthey intend to fix the Medicare program. All I see is a cut in Medicare \nspending totaling $259 to $333 billion over the next 7 years. Is it \nfair to ask for this level of sacrifice from Medicare beneficiaries at \nthe same time military spending will be rising from a starting point of \n$262.2 billion over the same 7-year period?\n  Or, is it fair to cut $500 billion from domestic spending on \neducation, law enforcement, highways, research, job training, and from \nstudent loans, and veteran's medical care while, at the same time, \nignoring the subsidies in the Tax Code that total $453 billion in 1995 \nand which, as I say, will grow by a total of $283.9 billion over the \nnext 5 years, 1995 to 1999. In 1999 alone, these tax breaks will total \n$568.5 billion, an increase of $115.5 billion over their 1995 cost.\n  It is incredible--even beyond belief--that Congress would enact a 7-\nyear, deficit-elimination package that cuts $500 billion from domestic \ninvestments and cuts between $259 and $333 billion from Medicare, while \nit cuts nothing from military spending and while we allow permanent tax \nbreaks to grow by $283.9 billion! How can we expect the American people \nto accept this approach to budget balancing? It is not only unfair, it \nis irrational.\n  What this amounts to is protecting the special interest groups and \nthe wealthy. They will get to keep their existing tax breaks, and, to \nmake matters worse, they will also get the overwhelming share of the \ntax cuts already passed by the House, which amount to a $630 billion \ndrain from the Treasury over the next 10 years.\n  On a related matter, there has been speculation that the Republican \nwelfare reform package will be included as part of this year's \nreconciliation measure. If these reports are accurate, this should be a \ncause of great concern to all Senators and to the American people. I \nsay this not from any partisan perspective. As I stated to the \ndistinguished majority leader in a letter dated March 31, 1995, I agree \nthat welfare reform is certainly necessary. But I have strong \nreservations about taking up such far-reaching and important \nlegislation as part of a reconciliation measure, upon which very \nlimited debate is allowed.\n  In my view, the reconciliation process was not intended to allow the \nadoption of major legislative proposals, such as welfare reform, under \nconditions where debate is limited. This is not a new position for me. \nI opposed such a tactic on health care reform last year, when both the \nthen-majority leader and President Clinton urged my support for \nincluding health care in last year's reconciliation measure. Major \nproposals of this kind should be thoroughly and thoughtfully examined \nby the Members of both parties on this Senate floor in a free and full \ndebate, not under the extremely limited debate that is allowed for \nreconciliation measures.\n  I implore the Senate Budget Committee, under the able leadership of \nits chairman, Senator Domenici, and its equally able ranking member, \nSenator Exon, to carefully consider these very important matters as the \ncommittee marks up the 1996 budget resolution.\n  As I have already stated, I do not believe that the American people \ndeserve, nor will they support, a deficit-elimination package unless \nits effects are distributed fairly across all segments of the \npopulation. I do not believe they will support a continuation of \nexisting tax breaks along with new massive tax cuts for the wealthy, \nwhile Medicare beneficiaries are being asked to pony up hundreds of \nbillions of dollars over the next 7 years.\n  I urge Senators not to attempt to balance the budget on the backs of \nmillions of Americans by savaging their health care benefits, while at \nthe same time enacting hundreds of billions of dollars in new tax \nbreaks which primarily benefit the wealthiest in our society. No amount \nof hollow rhetoric in a so-called Contract With America can hide the \nperverted policies being proposed by those who signed this so-called \ncontract which was, after all, fashioned by pollsters for the purpose \nof gaining political advantage.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/08/senate-section/article/S6228-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6229-S6230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF DR. HENRY FOSTER\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to announce my \nintention to vote to confirm Dr. Henry Foster to be Surgeon General of \nthe United States. I hope that I will have the opportunity to cast that \nvote, that the nomination will come to the floor of the U.S. Senate, \nand that preliminary proceedings will be cleared so that there will a \nvote up or down on whether Dr. Henry Foster should become the next \nSurgeon General of the United States.\n  When Dr. Foster's name was forwarded to the Senate by the President \nin early February, I was a little dismayed to hear the cry arise that \nhe should be disqualified because he had performed abortions. I was \nsurprised to hear that cry arise because abortions are a legal medical \nprocedure under the Constitution of the United States. This is not a \nmatter of Roe v. Wade, the decision handed down in 1973. This is \nreaffirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States in Casey v. \nPlanned Parenthood in 1992, an opinion written by [[Page S6230]] three \nJustices--Justice Souter, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Anthony \nKennedy, all nominated by Republican Presidents.\n  So it seemed to me curious, to say the least, that there should be a \ncall for his defeat because he had performed abortions, a medical \nprocedure authorized by the Constitution of the United States.\n  Then issues were cited about character, about what representations \nDr. Foster had made as to how many abortions he had performed. It then \ncame to light that there had been an indication from the White House \nabout some misinformation. Then other issues arose in a variety of \ncontexts.\n  I believe that the hearings last week have laid all of those issues \nto rest. Dr. Foster was a compelling witness, a forceful witness on his \nown behalf and he answered all of the outstanding questions, so that \nthere is no doubt about his good character or about his excellent \nservice as a physician, or about his care for the poor and downtrodden, \nand about his excellent work as a doctor over many years.\n  I had occasion to meet personally with Dr. Foster and discuss at some \nlength his own background and the issues which had been raised about \nhim. It seemed to me at that time at that meeting, which was in early \nFebruary, that his nomination certainly ought to go forward. I did not \nstate at that time support for his nomination because it seemed \nappropriate to me that we await the hearings by the committee to see \nwhat would occur at that time. After reviewing the hearings and what \noccurred at the hearings, today I am confident that Dr. Foster ought to \nbe confirmed as Surgeon General of the United States and, therefore, \nannounce my intention to vote for him.\n  I was encouraged to see the media reports that our distinguished \nmajority leader will meet with Dr. Foster, and I am hopeful that that \nmeeting will produce a result that Dr. Foster's nomination will come to \nthe floor.\n  I note the comments of the distinguished chairman of the committee, \nSenator Kassebaum, that Dr. Foster's nomination ought to come to the \nfloor and ought to be voted upon, although I do not believe at this \nstage that Senator Kassebaum has stated whether her intention is to \nvote ``aye'' or ``nay'' on the nomination itself.\n  I am hopeful that there will not be a filibuster, as has been \nmentioned, on Dr. Foster. Any Senator has the right to handle that in \nany way that any Senator pleases, and any Senator has a right, as I now \nexpress my right to say that I hope that we will not be confronted by a \nfilibuster.\n  But if we are, Mr. President, it is my sense of the Senate--and this \nis only one Senator speaking--that a filibuster will be defeated and \nthat even Senators who think that Dr. Foster ought not to be confirmed \nas Surgeon General of the United States will not support a filibuster; \nthat as a matter of fairness to Dr. Foster, he ought to get his day in \ncourt, his day in the Senate for a ``yes'' or ``no'' vote; and that he \nought not to have been railroaded out of town, as some have suggested, \neven without a hearing before the committee; and that he ought not to \nbe railroaded out of town without the matter coming to the floor of the \nU.S. Senate; and that he ought not to be railroaded, or have his fate \ndecided, without having the Senators vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on his \nconfirmation.\n  So I am pleased to be in a position today, Mr. President, to say what \nI sensed when I met with Dr. Foster in early February, that he is truly \na man who merits being confirmed as Surgeon General of the United \nStates.\n  I think that it is time that we put to rest the issue of what is the \nlaw of the land of the United States of America with respect to a \nwoman's right to choose. I personally am very much opposed to abortion, \nbut I do not believe that it is a matter that can be controlled by the \nGovernment. I believe it is a matter for the woman's choice, it is a \nmatter for the family, it is a matter for priests, rabbis, and \nministers, and it is not to be determined by the Government of the \nUnited States. When we have decisions of the Supreme Court separated \nfrom 1992 back to 1973 and the law of the land stated in Casey v. \nPlanned Parenthood, a decision written by three Justices for a majority \nof the Court, Justices appointed by Presidents Reagan and Bush, that \nthat is the law of the land, we ought not to reject a nominee because \nhe is performing medical procedures which are authorized by the \nConstitution.\n  I think it is time that the Senate of the United States faced up to \nthat proposition squarely. I hope it will be done by having the \nnomination reported to the Senate floor and by having an up-or-down \nvote. I intend to vote ``aye,'' and it is my prediction that Dr. Foster \nwill be confirmed.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, today, May 8, is V-E Day, which stands for Victory in \nEurope, and it marks the end of one front of the most disastrous event \nin modern human history.\n  The war in Europe was one in which 50 million civilians and military \npersonnel alike died. It was not only a war, but a major crime against \nhumanity.\n  Two out of three Jews in Europe were scientifically exterminated--a \ntotal of 6 million--along with 5 million other victims. In the Soviet \nUnion, 27 million people lost their lives. I visited Leningrad where \nyou see 25,000 people in one mass grave, and these are plot after plot \nafter plot. No country lost as much as did the people of the former \nSoviet Union.\n  The war spread death across six of the seven continents and all over \nthe world's oceans. In the end, much of the heart of Western \ncivilization lay in ruins.\n  Sixteen million one hundred twelve thousand Americans served in the \nU.S. Armed Forces during World War II, and they knew the ravages of \nwar. Of these, more than 1 million were Californians; 408,000 Americans \nnever came home. To these Californians and these Americans, I want to \nsay you have my deepest respect, and I know I join with all of my \nSenate colleagues in saying thank you.\n  For me, I was one of the lucky ones: I was 11 years old, a girl, \nliving in a flat in the Marina District of San Francisco. I remember \nthe blackout shades, the submarine nets under the Golden Gate Bridge, \ntroops shipping out from Fort Mason 6 blocks from my home and the Nike \ngun emplacements on the marina headlands and in the Presidio. As a \nlucky one in the land of the free and the home of the brave, for me \nthere was no Auschwitz or Bergen-Belsen.\n  V-E Day represents a victory over fascism, paranoia and the most \ndevastating war in history, all sparked and guided by one man. Probably \nthe most infamous demagog the world has ever seen, Hitler was described \nby one of his early associates, Otto Stresser, as a speaker ``who \ntouches each private wound on the raw, liberating the unconscious, \nexposing its innermost aspirations, telling it most what it wants to \nhear.''\n  Jews and Slavs were referred to as ``untermenschen,'' subhumans. \nMoscow, Leningrad, and Warsaw were hard hit, their industries left in \nruins.\n  In ``Mein Kampf,'' Hitler described what history has shown to be \ncorrect. He said:\n\n       The masses more readily fall victim to the big lie than the \n     small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies * * * \n     it would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal \n     untruths, and they would not believe that others have the \n     impudence to distort the truth so infamously.\n\n  Millions, indeed, did fall victim to the big lie. Fanatical in his \nquest for personal power, Hitler withdrew Germany from the League of \nNations, aproclaiming that the European powers will ``never act * * * \nthey'll just protest * * * and they will always be too late.''\n  In fact, the West's hesitance in the face of this evil has sullied \nthe word ``appeasement'' for all time.\n  By 1943, Hitler held the power of life and death over 80 million \nGermans and more than twice that number of vanquished people.\n  After Hitler took his own life on April 30, 1945, and the end of the \nwar [[Page S6231]] was in sight, devoted followers professed their \ndetermination to continue.\n  A Nazi-controlled newspaper said at the time:\n\n       The heart which beat only for us, the will which blazed \n     only for us, the creative genius which thought and acted only \n     for us, the voice which so often galvanized us--all this no \n     longer exists! However low fate has brought events, Hitler's \n     achievements will illuminate, far into the distant future, \n     the epoch which began with him.\n\n  Now, 50 years later, these words offer an ominous warning. Modern-day \nparanoia, built upon elaborate conspiracy theories and fears, I am \nsorry to say, is still very much alive today.\n  For several years, we have seen an escalation in fundamentalist-\ninspired killings in Egypt and Algeria, the rise of neo-Nazism in \nGermany, nationalistic fervor in former Communist States, severe anti-\nimmigrant backlash in France, and poison gas attacks in Japan.\n  The rise of fanaticism and the terrorism it spawns is ever increasing \nright here in the United States as well.\n  I think no event embodies this more than the Oklahoma City bombing.\n  Whatever the final outcome of the investigation into the bombing, a \nnew--and, I believe eye-opening--look at the growing trend of extremism \nis taking place across the world.\n  In this country, so-called militias are growing in numbers, \nstockpiling vast arsenals, preaching hate and violence against this \nGovernment.\n  Here are some examples:\n  The Federal Emergency Management Agency has orders for Hispanics and \nAfrican-Americans to be ``rounded up and detained'' in the event of a \nState of domestic national emergency.\n  That is false.\n  They say tax protesters, demonstrators against Government military \nintervention outside United States borders, and people who maintain \nweapons in their homes are the next targets.\n  That is false.\n  They say that FEMA advocates ``the rounding up and transfer to \n`assembly centers or relocation camps' of at least 21 million American \nNegroes.''\n  That is false.\n  They say there are black helicopters with no markings spying on \ncitizens. They say police officers were met by ``armed men in black \nuniforms,'' reportedly from the Federal Government.\n  That is false.\n  They say U.N. troops are training to suppress America's people.\n  That is false.\n  They say Somalia was simply a practice run for occupying the United \nStates.\n  That is false.\n  They point out that Russian trucks and personnel carriers are being \nimported as well as ``100-car trains filled with United Nations \nequipment.''\n  That is false.\n  They even say that Crips and Bloods--gangs that dominate some urban \nareas--are being trained to serve as something called ``shock troops'' \nand ``cannon fodder'' for house-to-house searches conducted by ``New \nWorld Order officers.''\n  That is false.\n  So theories about black helicopters, modern day concentration camps, \nand mass raids abound, we find, throughout this land of the free and \nhome of the brave. Even on Internet, this system is used to spread \nconspiracy theories across our land. Even a terrorist handbook is run \non the Internet on how to build a bomb. I read this handbook, and they \ntell you how to break into university chemical labs, how to find the \nchemicals you need, and how to steal those chemicals.\n  Finally, we see neo-Nazism, even signs popping up here and there \nsaying ``whites only,'' and on and on and on.\n  One must ask the question on this very special day: Will the threats, \nthe fear mongering, and the paranoia eventually fuel major bloodshed? \nWas it responsible for encouraging the terrible Oklahoma City bombing?\n  Two years ago, militia members warned about U.N. troops poised along \nthe United States-Canadian border, ready for invasion. Thirty years \nago, the John Birch Society warned of Chinese troops in box cars along \nthe Mexican border. Fifty years ago, the most deadly of all wars ended.\n  History can teach us lessons if we want to learn. Or we can be doomed \nto repeat history time and time again.\n  We all pray that the Oklahoma City bombing is a one-time-only event.\n  Yet, as a country, this is a time for us to come together, to heal, \nto begin anew, to straighten with truth vicious lies, to look for what \nunites us and strengthens us as a people, an American people, to \nstrengthen these bonds, rather than to seek what divides us.\n  The wounds of the past can guide us in the future. We simply need the \ndetermination and the political will to fight the fear and the paranoia \nthat is still so strong in our society.\n  V-E Day is a chance to celebrate the conclusion of one of the darkest \neras in our history. It is a chance to say thank you to those who gave \ntheir lives so that we might remain a free people.\n  Let us use this day to also look deeply at America as it exists \ntoday. There is a great deal of work to do to sort it out, to pull this \ncountry together before fear and intolerance rips us apart.\n  It is with the loving memory of the millions and millions of victims \nof World War II--and the hundreds of victims of the Oklahoma bombing--\nthat I make these remarks today. And I give thanks to those who fought \nand died in Europe so that we may know freedom.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. \nGrams], is recognized.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/08/senate-section/article/S6230-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6231-S6232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           PRODUCT LIABILITY\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, for the last 2 weeks we have had a serious \ndebate over our Nation's broken liability system.\n  We have heard stores from supporters of the plaintiff's bar who claim \nthat manufacturers are putting products on the market with little \nregard for consumer safety.\n  And we have also heard from supporters of manufacturers who have \nanecdotes of honest individuals who were sued for multimillion-dollar \nawards and settled out of court to avoid more costly legal fees, even \nwhen they were innocent.\n  Later today or tomorrow, there will be an effort by supporters of \nproduct liability reform to end debate, but before we do that, I wanted \nto make sure this body heard comments from a few of my constituents\n  An all-too-familiar story from America's small businesses is \nexemplified in a letter from Trade Mart Furniture's Jerry Johnson, a \nconstituent from Rochester, MN.\n  Jerry writes:\n\n       I've experienced firsthand the effects of a frivolous \n     lawsuit. After two years of court appearances, legal fees and \n     countless hours, I won. It cost almost $10,000 to defend \n     myself. I thought the legal system was created to protect the \n     citizen, not the profiteer.\n\n  Ann Hartman of Hartman Tree Farms in Victoria, MN, states, ``I am \ntired of seeing lawyers make so much money off the tragedies of \nothers.''\n  And a couple from Menahga, MN, who own Burkel Turkey Farms writes:\n\n       The system now is a free-for-all for the money-hungry and \n     the lawyers. There are far too many people out there that \n     feel the system owes them something.\n       We are at the mercy of dishonest people who are only out \n     for a buck. It's different if a person has a legitimate \n     claim, but something must be done to maintain a fair legal \n     system for the honest people of this world.\n\n  Mr. President, these are just a few of the comments I have received \nthroughout my tenure as a representative from Minnesota, and as a small \nbusinessman myself, I understand the effects of the threat of a \npotential lawsuit.\n  The fact is that almost 90 percent of all U.S. companies can expect \nto be named in a product liability lawsuit. The present liability \nsystem costs Americans $300 billion a year and like most Americans, my \nMinnesota constituents are concerned about the devastating effects the \nliability system has on them.\n  Recent polls continue to show strong support for liability reform: 83 \npercent believe the present liability system has problems and should be \nimproved, while 89 percent believe that ``too many lawsuits are being \nfiled in America today.''\n  Our current system benefits the lawyers and the dishonest. It treats \nboth plaintiffs and defendants unfairly. Inconsistent laws force both \nsides to sacrifice time and money on unpredictable \n[[Page S6232]] litigation. Both consumers and manufacturers end up \nlosers. Consumers lose because they receive inadequate compensation. \nSome estimates have shown that our tort system consumes 57 cents of \nevery $1 awarded in lawsuits.\n  In addition, consumers wait unreasonable amounts of time before they \nreceive compensation, and often pay outrageous fees to their attorneys.\n  Manufacturers lose because liability concerns stifle research and \ndevelopment.\n  A recent survey showed that because of fear of litigation, 47 percent \nof companies had withdrawn products from the market; 25 percent had \ndiscontinued some kind of research; and 8 percent actually had laid off \nworkers.\n  In fact in 1 year alone, Texas lost 79,000 jobs due to the cost of \nthe liability system.\n  Each year there are more than 70,000 product liability lawsuits filed \nin the United States--yet Great Britain only has an average of 200.\n  Now, this is only one of the reasons liability insurance costs are 20 \ntimes higher in the United States than in Europe.\n  As a result of this well-known liability gold-rush, the United States \nas a nation loses as well.\n  According to the Product Liability Coordinating Committee, the cost \nof product liability ranges from $80 to $120 billion per year.\n  These costs are passed directly on to you and me as consumers. \nAppropriately, this is known as the tort tax.\n  For example, manufacturers of football helmets add $100 to the cost \nof a $200 helmet. Auto manufacturers add $500 to the price of a new \ncar, and the markers of a $100 stepladder will add another $20 to its \ncost, just to cover potential liability.\n  I know many of my colleagues have mentioned this, but I want to \nreiterate the fact that right here in Washington, DC, the Girl Scout \nCouncil must sell 87,000 boxes of Girl Scout cookies each year just to \ncover the cost of their liability insurance.\n  In my own State of Minnesota, Attorney General Hubert Humphrey III, \nthe son of Minnesota's great U.S. Senator, recently testified before \nthe State legislature that his office spent $340,000 in 1994 defending \nMinnesota against frivolous lawsuits. Attorney General Humphrey offered \na top-10 list of lawsuits from Minnesota inmates. These are just a few \nof the ridiculous claims that prisoners have filed:\n  One prisoner claimed he had a constitutional right to a computer in \nhis jail cell. One claimed that the President gave him a fungus.\n  Another prisoner claimed underwear was not provided, and when it was \nprovided, it was so tight that it constituted cruel and unusual \npunishment.\n  If you think these lawsuits are laughable, try Mr. Humphrey's No. 1 \nfrivolous lawsuit: One prisoner claimed that his primary reason for \nfiling a lawsuit was ``pure delight in spending taxpayers' money.'' I \nunderstand that suits like these may be rare. However, they typify the \nproblems with our current system.\n  The Gorton-Rockefeller Product Liability Fairness Act will address \nmany of the problems faced by well-intentioned, honest manufacturers.\n  This legislation will establish alternative dispute resolution, \nextend protection to product sellers, provide an absolute defense for \ninjuries received when the plaintiff was under the influence of drugs \nor alcohol, and prevent automobile rental companies from being held \nliable for damages caused by the renters of its cars when the company \nis not at fault.\n  In addition, the Gorton-Rockefeller bill will provide much-needed \nrelief to suppliers of biomaterials.\n Currently, raw material suppliers who have no direct role in the raw \nmaterial's ultimate use as a biomaterial share extraordinary and \nirrational liability risk with device manufacturers.\n\n  Companies such as DuPont, Dow Chemical, and Dow Corning have decided \nto stop supplying manufacturers of medical devices with raw materials \nfor fear of lawsuits. This legislation is progress, and is the first \nstep in the right direction.\n  While I am encouraged by the hard work of the Senators from \nWashington State and West Virginia, I am concerned that we may be \nopening up a new can of worms, when this legislation is signed into \nlaw.\n  While it will offer protection for product manufacturers, my fear is \nthat it will leave the service industry as the only remaining deep \npocket.\n  I believe the Senate should continue moving forward to reform our \nliability system, making sure that individuals who deserve compensation \nare made whole and that individuals who are not at fault are not held \nliable for someone else's actions.\n  Mr. President, we should take this historic opportunity today to \napprove the Product Liability Fairness Act, and in doing so ensure that \nour liability system is fair to all parties involved, not just those \nwho are looking for their golden nugget in the liability gold-rush.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/08/senate-section/article/S6231-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BRYAN.

Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues an advertisement currently getting wide circulation by \nthe nuclear power industry.\n  This advertisement touts the virtues of legislation introduced for \nthe nuclear power industry to address the industry's nuclear waste \nproblem.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, the industry's solution to its \nwaste problem has, for a number of years, been very simple: ship the \nwaste to Nevada.\n  Since 1982, Nevada has been the target of the nuclear powder \nindustry's efforts to move its toxic high-level waste away from reactor \nsites.\n  Under current law, Yucca Mountain, 90 miles north of Las Vegas, is \nbeing studied, supposedly to determine its suitability as a site for a \npermanent geologic repository.\n  The repository program has had immense problems.\n  With $4.5 billion spent to date on the program, Yucca Mountain is no \ncloser to accepting the nuclear power industry's waste than it was 13 \nyears ago, when Congress passed the first Nuclear Waste Policy Act.\n  I am not alone in my opinion that a repository will never be built at \nYucca Mountain.\n  The nuclear power industry is also frustrated.\n  In a curious juxtaposition from the Nevada perspective, the industry \nthinks the DOE is being too careful, paying too much attention to \nenvironmental concerns, and simply not moving fast enough.\n  While the nuclear power industry still maintains that Nevada is \nperfectly suitable to host their repository, it has come to the \nconclusion that Yucca Mountain will never solve its high-level waste \nproblem.\n  The nuclear power industry has a new solution, and of course, Nevada \nis once again the victim.\n  The nuclear power industry's new strategy is to designate Nevada as \nthe site for its interim storage, beginning in 1998.\n  While the ``interim'' designation is supposed to imply a temporary \nfacility, the nuclear power industry defines ``interim'' as 100 years, \nsubject to renewal.\n  The motive is patently transparent: ship high level nuclear waste to \nNevada as soon as possible, without any regard for the health and \nsafety of Nevadans, and then forget about it.\n  The type of public relations campaign being mounted here is nothing \nnew.\n  While we in Nevada have long experience with such campaigns by the \nnuclear power industry and its hired flacks, I have to admit that this \nlatest advertisement is a masterpiece of deception and misinformation.\n  The headline alone reveals the deceptiveness of the advertisement.\n  ``There are 109 good reasons to store nuclear waste in 1 place'' \nproclaims the nuclear industry's advertisement.\n  The headline appeals to the logic of the reader--of course, the \nreader thinks, 1 site is better than 109.\n  The problem is, of course, that the advertisement does not tell the \ntrue story. [[Page S6233]] \n  Unless the nuclear power industry has some well kept secret plan to \nshut down and decommission every reactor at each of these 109 reactor \nsites, by my count creation of a new, central site for waste storage \nmakes 110 sites, not 1.\n  How the nuclear power industry gets down to one site, when its \nreactors are still running, and waste is still stored in pools on site, \nis beyond me.\n  The advertisement also ignores one of the key problems with a central \nhigh-level waste facility--the transportation of the toxic waste from \nthe 109 reactor sites to the central facility.\n  The nuclear power industry, in its obsession to dispose of its waste \nas quickly as possible, is proposing to create thousands of rolling \ninterim storage facilities, on trucks, and rail cars, in 43 States \nacross the Nation.\n  The nuclear power industry's map shows the location of the 109 \nreactor sites, but not the proposed location for the central storage \nfacility.\n  There is a good reason for this oversight--the industry's target for \na central storage facility is not central at all.\n  Not even close.\n  Looking at the map, it could not be clearer--only 15 of the 109 sites \nidentified are west of the Missouri River.\n  This second chart shows the map that the nuclear power industry, if \nit was being honest, should have run in their advertisement.\n  This map shows the location of the current reactor sites, the \nproposed location for their central storage facility, and the likely \nroutes through 43 States for the thousands of shipments necessary to \nmove the high-level waste from around the Nation to Nevada.\n  It is obvious to even the casual observer that the nuclear power \nindustry's interim storage proposal could result in an unprecedented \nlevel of shipments of extremely toxic, highly dangerous radioactive \nmaterials.\n  Every Member of the Senate should take a careful look at this map.\n  Nothing could make clearer the true scope of what the nuclear power \nindustry is proposing.\n  Over the years, as I have fought the industry and the DOE in their \nefforts to open a repository in Nevada, I have often found my \ncolleagues, both here in the Senate and among the Nation's Governors in \nmy previous position, sympathetic to Nevada's cause.\n  Many in the Senate sympathize with the outrageous abrogation of \nState's rights.\n  Others understand the potential environmental risks associated with \nopening a high-level nuclear waste dump 90 miles from the fastest \ngrowing metropolitan area in the United States--a metropolitan area \nwith nearly 1 million residents.\n  Still others have understood the potentially grave economic damages \nthat could result from the transport and storage of high-level nuclear \nwaste so close to the premier tourist destination in the United States.\n  Unfortunately, however, these expressions of sympathy have not often \ntranslated into action.\n  For too long, the commercial nuclear waste problem has been \nidentified as a solely Nevada issue.\n  The general attitude has been we feel badly for Nevada--but if it is \nnot Nevada, who would be the nuclear power industry's next target?\n  This map should make clear that the nuclear power industry's refusal \nto accept responsibility for the storage of its own waste will affect \nevery citizen of every State along the routes the industry will use to \nmove the waste.\n  Even those from the few States that are not targets of the nuclear \npower industry should be concerned. I do not know how many of anyone's \nconstituents are anxious to share the road with a truck moving high-\nlevel nuclear waste.\n  Once the word is out to these affected communities, no one will be \nable to continue to dismiss the issue as simply a Nevada problem.\n  In the absence of a permanent solution to the nuclear waste problem, \nthere is simply no reason to move nuclear waste away from the reactor \nsites.\n  The only crisis facing the nuclear power industry is a public \nrelations crisis, not a scientific one.\n  The NRC has licensed technology to store waste in dry casks, on site, \nfor the next several decades.\n  Some utilities, of necessity, have taken advantage of this \ntechnology.\n  Most refuse to do so.\n  Why are utilities so adverse to accepting the responsibility for \ntheir own waste? The answer could not be simpler.\n  Recognizing the political and public relations nightmare of seeking \npermission to increase storage for high-level waste on site, utilities \nare seeking an outside solution.\n  Nevada, a State with no reactors and about as far as you can get from \na geographically central location, has been chosen as the target.\n  Let me return for a moment to the advertisement.\n  I have not even touched on the misinformation provided by the text.\n  The ad generally relies on the tried and true tactic of the nuclear \npower industry to create the impression of impending doom if its \ndemands for relief are not met immediately.\n  Congress, then, is pressured to act quickly, irrespective of the \nwishes, or the health and safety, of Nevadans, or anyone else.\n  This was true in 1980, when the industry claimed that reactors across \nthe Nation would soon shut down if they could not get what was then \ncalled away-from-reactor storage by 1983.\n  No away-from-reactor storage was ever built, and no reactor has ever \nshut down from lack of storage.\n  There simply was no crisis in 1980--and there is no crisis now.\n  It is all an expensive, dangerous ruse.\n  I urge my colleagues to think carefully before falling for this, and \nother, deceptive misinformation campaigns by the nuclear power industry \nand its advocates.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Shelby). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  The Chair informs the Senator from New Mexico that at 12:10 morning \nbusiness is set to expire unless it is extended.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, I first want to say a few words about \nour policy toward a neighboring country, Cuba.\n  The United States objectives in Cuba are not in dispute. Our primary \nobjective is to move Cuba to a more democratic form of government and \nto a government with a greater respect for human rights. Also, of \ncourse, we want to see the lives of the Cuban people improve \neconomically, and we want to see our historically close ties with this \nisland neighbor restored.\n  First, let us review some of the facts that led us to the present \ncircumstances we find ourselves in. Fidel Castro came to power in Cuba \nsome 34 years ago, when I was still in high school and before several \nMembers of this Congress were even born. He quickly established an \nauthoritarian and anti-United States regime. He declared himself a \nMarxist-Leninist in December 1961. Early in 1961, the United States \nbroke diplomatic relations with Cuba.\n  A year later, in February 1962, we imposed a comprehensive trade \nembargo. The reasons cited for that were three.\n  First, Castro's expropriation without compensation, much property \nowned by U.S. citizens, in excess of $1 billion.\n  Second, the Castro regime's obvious efforts to export revolution to \nother parts of the world.\n  And, third, the increasingly close ties that existed then between \nCastro's Government and the Soviet Union.\n  That was 33 years ago. During the past 33 years, we have maintained \nthe trade embargo in place. In April 1961, we tried unsuccessfully in \nthe Bay of Pigs to have Castro overthrown militarily. We began in 1985 \nto use Radio Marti to undermine Cuban support for Fidel Castro, and in \nthe Bush administration just a few years ago we added TV Marti to the \nmix, as well.\n  In 1992, we passed the Cuban Democracy Act in an effort to tighten \nour trade sanctions. This year, we are being urged by some in this body \nto pass a new and tough measure entitled [[Page S6234]] ``The Cuban \nLiberty and Democratic Solidarity Act'' in order to give Castro what \nthe supporters of that legislation refer to as the ``final push.''\n  With all due respect to President Clinton and to many here in \nCongress, our policy toward Cuba today is still captive of the cold war \nmentality that created it in the first place. Simply put, the world has \nchanged, and we continue to pretend otherwise.\n  Mr. President, this is 1995. Our 34-year-old policy of trying to \nremove or alter the behavior of Fidel Castro by isolating him \ndiplomatically, politically, and economically has failed. History has \npassed that policy by. And the cold war, which provided much of the \nrationale for our policy, is now over.\n  We have normalized relations with China--Communist China, I point \nout. We have normalized relations with the countries of Eastern Europe \nand Russia, and with all the former States of the Soviet Union.\n  This morning, President Clinton goes to Moscow to meet with Boris \nYeltsin, not to find ways to isolate Moscow or to impose sanctions on \nMoscow for their human rights abuses in Chechnya or elsewhere; our \nPresident travels to Moscow to strengthen our relations with that \nimportant country.\n  Mr. President, U.S. policy toward Cuba needs to adjust to this new \nreality, just as our policy toward those other nations has adjusted. \nFor over three decades, we have tried to exclude Cuba from acceptance \nby other nations. But our policy of trying to isolate Cuba \ndiplomatically has made the United States the odd man out in the world \ncommunity rather than Cuba. Of the 35-member nations of the \nOrganization of American States, all but 5 recognize the Cuban \nGovernment and have normal diplomatic relations with it.\n  The Senator from North Carolina, who chairs the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, argues that the way out of this absurd situation \nis to turn up the pressure on Castro. As he says, ``It is time to give \nCastro the final push.''\n  Mr. President, the sanctions and the embargoes and the pressure that \nwe put on Castro in the past 34 years have not undermined the support \nof the Cuban people for his Government as we have wished. In fact, a \nstrong case can be made that the constant menacing by Uncle Sam has \nbeen used very effectively by Castro to divert the attention of the \nCuban people from the shortcomings of his own Government and his own \npolicies.\n  Mr. President, this administration has been slow to face the need to \nchange in our policy toward Cuba. But last week, we hopefully saw the \nbeginning of a more rational policy toward that nation. Last week, the \nadministration announced that in the future, illegal immigrants from \nCuba will be treated as other illegal immigrants into this country, and \nI for one hope that more steps will follow.\n  For example, as I stated here in the Senate several weeks ago, I \nbelieve the President should act to end the travel ban on Americans who \nwish to travel to Cuba. The President should also restore the right of \nCuban-Americans to make small remittances to their families and to \ntheir relatives in Cuba. In my view, the time has also come when we \nshould begin to normalize trade relations with that country.\n  Mr. President, I realize that it is politically difficult to change a \nlong-established policy. It is especially difficult given the political \nposturing that is preceding our upcoming Presidential election. But the \ntime has come to acknowledge that our current policy toward Cuba has \nfailed miserably. Newt Gingrich referred yesterday to Cuba as ``a relic \nof an age that is gone.'' I agree that Castro's Government is an \nanachronism. But it is no more so than our own misguided policy for \ndealing with that country.\n  Most agree that President Nixon's greatest achievement was his \ndecision to change United States foreign policy and move toward normal \nrelations with Communist China. That was many years ago, when the cold \nwar was still very much with us. Now the cold war is over, and a new \nand a reasonable policy for our relations with Cuba is long overdue.\n  I for one believe that the responsible course for us to proceed with \nis to establish a new policy now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/08/senate-section/article/S6233-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                V-E DAY\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to make a few statements \nabout the occasion of May 8, 1995, V-E Day.\n  It is rather difficult to think of any event in the life of a nation \nmore worthy of commemoration than the end of a world war. Remembrance \nand reflection are crucial if we are to maintain our sense of purpose \nas a nation, and our appreciation of what we value most.\n  The service and sacrifice of those who bore the battle at home and \noverseas in the Second World War can never be overstated. It was that \nwillingness to give unstintingly not only of effort but also, in many \ncases, their lives, that makes the war years such an extraordinary \nperiod in our Nation's history.\n  Americans who fought the war came from every State in the country, \nand my home State of New Mexico certainly did its part. Our own friends \nand neighbors were heroic in their actions, in their service, and in \ntheir struggle. If not for their efforts, what would the world be like \ntoday?\n  Franklin Roosevelt, whose death 50 years ago we commemorated on the \n12th of last month, left a monumental legacy for this country. Words \nfrom a speech that he wrote for delivery on April 13, 1945, had he \nlived to give that speech, still sound out a challenge, one rooted in \nthe experience of the war and pinned to his knowledge of his \ncountrymen. He wrote for that speech:\n\n       The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our \n     doubts of today. Let us move forward with strong and active \n     faith.\n\n  We did that in the Second World War. So we must, every day, move \nforward now from the conflict that threatened to consume the world half \na century ago. Without the service and the sacrifice that we honor \ntoday, we would have had no future as a nation. It is our obligation to \nthose who secured that future for us to build on it as we approach the \nnew century.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, are we still in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are still in morning business.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/08/senate-section/article/S6234-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6234-S6236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF V-E DAY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today marks the 50th anniversary of V-E \nDay, the day that saw the end of the Second World War in Europe.\n  From its European beginning on September 1, 1939, with Hitler's \ninvasion of Poland, to the surrender of the German armies in Italy, on \nApril 29, 1945, the war that was supposed to usher in the 1,000-Year \nReich ended after 6 years of death, genocide, and destruction on a \nscale never seen before or since.\n  The outcome of the war changed our world profoundly, with effects \nthat still resonate today. It left the United States the sole undamaged \nworld power. With that status came responsibilities that most Americans \nhad not imagined at the outset. In the 50 postwar years, those \nresponsibilities have demanded more in American treasure and lives than \nfrom any other participant.\n  European and Japanese cities suffered the destruction of repeated \nartillery fire and massive carpet bombing. European civilians found \nthemselves uprooted, fleeing desperately from their historic hometowns \nas massive armies moved back and forth across frontiers. But Americans \npaid a price, too.\n  By 1990, it is estimated that the total cost of the Second World War \nto the United States had reached $4.6 trillion--including the postwar \ncost of veterans care and benefits. The cost of caring for our veterans \nis a cost of war, and should be recognized as such, lest we forget, \ndecades later, the price of [[Page S6235]] war in the form of our \ngreatest treasure--our young men and women who served.\n  In total, more than 16 million American men and women served their \nNation in World War II. More than 291,000 paid the ultimate price on \nthe field of combat; 113,000 others died of wounds, accidents, \nillness--all the risks and dangers that attend service in wartime. All \ntold, more than 405,000 American lives were cut short by the war.\n  Another 670,000 Americans were casualties in that war--men and women \nwho returned with their health damaged, their bodies scarred, their \nlives changed.\n  Tens of thousands from every State in the Nation served in the Second \nWorld War. South Dakota, one of the Nation's least populous States, \nsent an estimated 60,000 men and women to fight. A postwar review in \n1950 estimated that more than 10 percent of the South Dakotans who \nserved earned citations for personal bravery, military valor, and, in \nthree case, the highest military honor our Nation grants, the award for \nservice ``above and beyond the call of duty,'' the Congressional Medal \nof Honor.\n  The Medal of Honor is the decoration of which Harry Truman said he \nwould rather have earned than be President.\n  Two of the three South Dakotans who won the Medal of Honor served in \nthe Pacific War and returned home after the war. One, Joe Foss, became \nGovernor of South Dakota. The third South Dakotan awarded the Medal of \nHonor served in the European theater. He died there, having established \na record that is outstanding, even compared with his peers.\n  Capt. Arlo L. Olson, of Toronto, South Dakota, served in the Italian \ncampaign in 1943. For 26 grueling days in the mountainous terrain \nnortheast of Naples, he led his company by foot across the Volturno \nRiver into enemy-held territory, directly into enemy machine gun \nemplacement in some of the roughest fighting experienced by any \nAmerican units in the war. He was shot on October 27, 1943, but refused \nmedical treatment until his men had been taken care of. He died as he \nwas being carried down Monte San Nicola.\n  The citations honoring South Dakotans are stirring. Harold G. Howey, \nin July 1943 in Sicily, faced a cliff fortified by the enemy and fought \nhis way to the top under intense enemy fire despite his wounds. He won \nthe Distinguished Service Cross and the Bronze Star Medal for his \nactions.\n  David Colombe of Winner leapt into a German foxhole, armed only with \na knife, seized an enemy rifle and worked his way behind enemy lines, \ndemoralizing the withdrawing soldiers with heavy fire and leading to \nthe collapse of their defense. His Distinguished Service Cross was well \nearned.\n  Like other Americans, South Dakotans were captured. Melvin McNickle, \none of the famous McNickle brothers of Doland, both of whom earned the \nLegion of Merit, maintained morale and discipline and preserved the \nlives of his fellow internees for 2 years in Stalag Luft III in \nGermany.\n  The hometowns of the men and women from South Dakota who fought in \nthe war span the length and breadth of the State. They came from Sioux \nFalls and Rapid City, Aberdeen and Buffalo, Belle Fourche and Doland, \nMilbank and Spearfish.\n  They bore names that reflect the history of our State--Jorgenson, \nNovotny, Lauer, Kilbride, Rossow, Thompson, Fischer, Haag, Labesky, \nMcGregor, Adams, Bianchi, Soissons, Zweifel--the people who settled \nSouth Dakota and became proud Americans from every corner of the Earth. \nMany of them fought on ground their fathers had called home.\n  South Dakotans take special pride in the heroism and courage of those \nlike David Colombe of Winner, Vincent Hunts Horse of Wounded Knee--who \nwon the Silver Star for the part he played in helping the United States \nArmy capture Gondorf in Germany--and Sampson One Skunk, who took part \nin the raid on Dieppe in 1942 and the first attack on Anzio, and won \nthe Silver Star for his exploits.\n  They are part of a proud and honorable tradition of native Americans \nwho have served courageously and honorably in every U.S. conflict, from \nthe Revolutionary War onward.\n  Last year Congress finally approved legislation to establish a \nnational memorial acknowledging and honoring the heroism and service of \nnative Americans in combat. The Native American Veterans' Memorial will \npay an overdue tribute to those who served their Nation, even when \ntheir Nation did not serve them--to those who fought under the U.S. \nflag before they were even granted citizenship themselves in 1924.\n  Our Lakota-speaking people played an additional role in the Second \nWorld War, one that is now as well known as it deserves to be. They, \nlike Navajo and Choctaw speaking native Americans, were the famous code \ntalkers of the war--the people who manned the radio communications in \nnative languages that no code-breaker or cipher specialist could \ndecode, because language has no breakable code.\n  There is a monument in Phoenix, AZ, to the code talkers of the Navajo \nNation. But there were others besides them. The Lakota speakers of the \nSioux Nations of South Dakota and neighboring States were responsible \nfor the safety and lives of thousands of their fellow Americans in \ncombat.\n  Philip LaBlanc, of Rapid City, served with the 1st Cavalry Division \nfrom 1942 to 1945. Others--Baptiste Pumpkinseed, Oglala or Redbud \nSioux, Eddie Eagle Boy of the Cheyenne River Sioux, Guy Rondell of the \nSisseton-Wahpeton Dakota Nation, John Bear King of Standing Rock--all \nof them and their comrades manned radio communications networks, using \nLakota, to advise of enemy troop movements, numbers of enemy guns, \ninformation crucial to saving the lives of other Americans.\n  These men worked 24 hours around the clock in headphones when the \naction was heaviest, without rest or sleep. Most famously, they served \nin the Pacific theater, but there were code talkers in the Italian and \nGerman theaters in Europe as well. Their work saved the lives of \ncountless other Americans. Along with the Navajo and Choctaw code \ntalkers, the Lakota code talkers deserve their own page in our national \nmemory of the world war.\n  Philip LaBlanc himself served for 3 years without a single furlough. \nHe left theater operations only after being hit and wounded by enemy \ngunfire.\n  As well as the men who manned the combat fronts in the war, the \nSecond World War was the first one in which American women played a \nsignificant role. They did so both at home and abroad.\n  Although the myth is that the enemy declared total war, it was \nAmerica who, in fact, declared total war. While Hitler imported slave \nlaborers from Eastern Europe to work for the German housewife, American \nwomen ran the factories that were the arsenal of democracy. American \nwomen enlisted in support battalions of all kinds on active duty as \nwell.\n  South Dakotan women were no exception. Edith Bolan of Rapid City \nraised three children, and worked as a welder during the war. It was \nher task to crawl into the small spaces that men could not reach to put \nthe finishing touches on Navy ships. She made casings for bombs. She \nled the life that so many other American women, from coast to coast, \nexperienced in the war.\n  Those who served on the homefront did not get the medals and \ncitations of those serving in combat. But their work and dedication \nwere every bit as important to the final victory. So was the work of \nthe women closer to the frontlines.\n  Loretta Hartrich, a native of Sioux Falls, served with the Red Cross \nin the so-called clubmobiles that traveled with the frontline troops, \nserving coffee, doughnuts, and morale to the men at the front. The \nclubmobiles were often in harm's way, and the women who ran them risked \ndeath and entrapment when a fast-moving front shifted. Loretta \nremembers being asked to sing the ``Indian Love Call'' and having every \nrepetition of ``when I'm calling you'' punctuated by German artillery.\n  American women served as nurses in rear units and on the front, \nlanding on Normandy 4 days after the first Allied troops. They served \nin communications, administrative, and intelligence work throughout the \nduration of the war, and they, too, have earned the proud title of \nveteran.\n  Today, those once-young men and women are the proud veterans of \nservice in what many have called the last good war. I understand what \nthose words are meant to convey, but for [[Page S6236]] those who saw \nactive duty, who saw friends die, who felt the sheer brutality of heavy \nartillery attack or the random terror of combat on unknown, rough \nterrain against a well-trained and ruthless opponent, there was no good \nwar.\n  Our cause was good, and it triumphed. But we triumphed at terrible \npersonal cost to those Americans who served.\n  Some of our Senate colleagues served, and some bear the outward \nscars. Senator Inouye, of Hawaii, served with the most decorated unit \nin the military in Italy campaign, and paid a high price for his valor. \nSenator Dole served in Italy with great honor at enormous personal \nprice. The veterans of the war who still serve in Congress were honored \nlast week at a ceremony at the National Archives.\n  I am proud to serve in the Senate with all of them, and I express my \nsense of respect for their service, my gratitude as a citizen for their \nsacrifices, and my great pride, as an American, for the spirit they and \ntheir colleagues in arms showed the world more than 50 years ago.\n  Great celebrations have occurred in the old Allied capitals in Europe \nto celebrate V-E Day. Another great celebration will be held in Moscow, \nto celebrate the end of what the Russians call the Great Patriotic War.\n  In America, there are no huge celebrations. We were the arsenal of \ndemocracy in that war, the productive force without which it might not \nhave been won by the Allies. Our people suffered death and injury far \nfrom home, for causes and quarrels in which they had no direct stake.\n  The distance of 50 years does not erase the genuine hardship, \ndifficulties, and pain they suffered or the price many of them paid. It \nwas not a good war because there are no good wars for those in the line \nof fire. Like every war, it was vicious, uncaring of life, random in \nits accidents and mistakes, brutal for its participants.\n  And yet Americans served, and did so with distinction. We ought to \ntake pause to take great pride in the kind of people we are, and to \nhonor the memories of those who paid the ultimate price. Those who \nserved have done more for their fellow citizens and for the future than \nany words can describe. They are American heroes, one and all, and we \nsalute them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 50 years ago today, the guns were silenced \nin Europe, and that continent was at last freed from the tyrants who \nhad plunged it into war.\n  And across the world on May 8, 1954, there were moments that are \nremembered today, and will be remembered for generations yet to come.\n  Here in Washington, at the White House, President Truman spoke to the \nAmerican people by radio, with these dramatic words:\n\n       This is a solemn and glorious hour. I only wish that \n     Franklin Roosevelt had lived to witness this day. General \n     Eisenhower informs me that the forces of Germany have \n     surrendered to the United Nations. The flags of freedom fly \n     all over Europe.\n\n  In New York City, a half a million people crowded into Times Square, \nand in main streets and town squares across America, smaller crowds \ngathered to celebrate.\n  In Paris, the boulevards that Hitler and his armies had once \ncontrolled were free again, and the French people rallied under the Arc \nde Triomphe.\n  And in London, Winston Churchill spoke before a large crowd, telling \nthe people of Britain, ``This is your victory.'' And many in the crowd \nshouted back that the victory was his. Later that night, the \nfloodlights illuminated Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, and St. Paul's \nCathedral for the first time in 6 years.\n  Anniversary celebrations are a time for remembering the past, but \nthey are also a time for looking to the future. And as we celebrate \nthis 50th anniversary of the Allied victory, let us remember the \nlessons that World War II taught us--lessons that hold for us still.\n  We learned that we cannot turn our backs on what happens in the rest \nof the world.\n  We learned that we can never again allow our military to reach low \nlevels of readiness and supplies.\n  We learned that we cannot appease tyrants and despots, and perhaps \nabove all, we learned the critical importance of American leadership.\n  Yes, before our involvement, Britain courageously fought on against \nthe odds. And, yes, Russia, after initially siding with the Axis \nPowers, helped to turn the tide when the Nazis turned against them.\n  But, the war could not have been won and would not have been won \nwithout the commitment, the manpower, and the leadership of the United \nStates. It is that simple.\n  It was American leadership that built the arsenal of democracy which \nmade victory possible.\n  It was American leadership that held the Allies together through the \ndarkest days of the war.\n  And it was American leadership which conquered the forces of tyranny \nand restored liberty and democracy to Europe.\n  And when I talk about leadership, I do not mean just the famous names \nof Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Marshall, Churchill, and de Gaulle. \nAnd I do not just mean the soldiers who fought their way across Europe \nand the Pacific. For we must also thank those who served at home--the \nGold Star moms, the factory workers, and the farmers. Without their \ncontribution and their sacrifice, the war effort could not have been \nsuccessful.\n  So, today is a day for all of us to celebrate the triumph of \ndemocracy, and to honor those who served and those who paid the \nultimate price on behalf of their country.\n  And the best way we can do that is to rededicate ourselves to the \npromise that President Reagan made on behalf of America on the beaches \nof Normandy 11 years ago:\n\n       We will always remember. We will always be proud. We will \n     always be prepared, so we may always be free.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/08/senate-section/article/S6236-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment about the pending \nlegislation on products liability on which there is a cloture vote \nscheduled for 4 o'clock this afternoon, that is, a vote to cut off \ndebate.\n  As I have expressed in the prior debate, it is my view that it would \nbe appropriate to have reform on product liability, providing the \nreform is very, very carefully crafted.\n  As I have noted in previous speeches, I have represented both \nplaintiffs and defendants in personal injury cases. I had one large \nproduct liability case, which I litigated many years ago. Actually, it \nwas ultimately settled. But the issue in the case concerning privity \nand coverage for a passenger in an [[Page S6237]] automobile was widely \nnoted in the law reviews. I have therefore had occasion to do very \nextensive research in the area, although that was some substantial time \nago.\n  I believe that a very key provision for limiting frivolous lawsuits \nwould be to tighten up the current mechanism to give greater authority \nunder rule 11 to the judges who sit on those cases to try to influence \nor discourage frivolous lawsuits.\n  My reading of the substitute amendment shows that the amendment \noffered by the distinguished Senator from Colorado, Senator Brown, an \namendment which I supported and which I think would be of substantial \nhelp in discouraging frivolous litigation, and therefore a provision \nwhich I think ought to be in the bill, has been deleted.\n  With respect to the issue of punitive damages, I am very reluctant to \nsee the provisions of the current bill enacted into law, because there \nare so many cases which have been disclosed in product liability \nlitigation where companies, major companies, have made a calculated \ndetermination that it is in their financial interest not to make \nrepairs or changes, because the damages awarded in litigation will be \nlesser than the costs of making the modifications.\n  Perhaps the most celebrated case--but there are many others like it--\nis the Pinto case, where the gas tank was left in a very dangerous \nposition in the rear of the car and resulted in explosions when there \nwas impact, a very common kind of accident in automobile driving, rear-\nend collisions.\n  As a result of product liability litigation, it was disclosed that \nthere was a memorandum in the files of the defendant company, Ford \nMotor Co., actually a letter to the National Highway Transportation \nSafety Administration, in which there was a computation as to what it \nwould cost to pay damages for people injured or killed as a result of \nthe placement of the gas tank, as to what it would cost to make the \nrepairs. The calculated decision was not to make the repairs.\n  And then you have the famous cases of IUD's made by A.H. Robins, in \nwhich it was known for a long period of time they would cause problems \nfor women, such as infections and sterilization.\n  There were blood cases with AIDS being transmitted, and a failure to \ntake appropriate action. And there were the flammable pajamas. There \nhave been many cases, some even resulting in criminal prosecutions. I \ndiscussed many of these cases last week.\n  So on the current state of the record, my own sense is that there \nneeds to be further refinement of the provision on punitive damages.\n  The revised bill does contain an amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio, Senator DeWine, which would limit \npunitive damages to small businesses, and small businesses are defined \nas those having fewer than 25 employees or a net worth of under \n$500,000. It may be that this provision would go far beyond product \nliability cases and would affect all ranges of tort litigation, \nincluding medical malpractice cases. I do not know if that is the \nintent.\n  It also may be that this amendment to protect small businesses does \nnot bear a sufficient nexus to interstate commerce in affecting all \ntort cases, so that we may be legislating beyond our authority, as \ninterpreted by the Supreme Court of the United States recently in the \nLopez case. I think that is another matter which requires some \namplification.\n  I do believe that there is some limitation appropriate on punitive \ndamages where small businesses are involved. I have heard the complaint \nthat a defendant small business is often compelled to make a settlement \nthat it would not make if it was not betting the business on it. I have \nfiled a proposed amendment, and will refile it so it would survive \npostcloture, if cloture is invoked, so that the amendment will be on \nrecord to be considered, which would limit punitive damages to 10 \npercent of the net worth of a business, so that there would not be a \nproblem of betting the business in litigation.\n  The substitute also deletes alternative dispute resolution, which I \nregret to see, because I think that is a way of eliminating many cases \nfrom the litigation process, by having alternative dispute resolution, \nwhich is a fancy name for arbitration or mediation. That is not present \nin the current bill.\n  I express again the concern about totally eliminating joint liability \nfor noneconomic damages as a Federal standard, where some States have \nelected to do that as a matter of States rights and others have not. I \nnote again my support for the amendment offered by the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee, Senator Thompson, which would have limited this \nbill to litigation in Federal courts, which would have been more in \naccordance with the mood of the Congress and the country now to let the \nStates decide these matters for themselves.\n  On the issue of joint liability, I am very sympathetic to the claim \nthat some people or some defendants are in it, people or individuals or \ncompanies, to a very slight extent--maybe 1 percent--and they have the \nfull responsibility for the verdict. I have filed another possible \namendment which would limit joint liability for noneconomic damages if \nthe defendant was not responsible for in excess of 15 percent of the \ninjury, which I think would provide a better balance there.\n  Again, I will comment about the case involving the death of our late \ncolleague, Senator John Heinz, where there was a collision between a \nhelicopter and the plane in which Senator Heinz was a passenger. The \nplanes fell into a schoolyard where there were children on the ground, \nand some were killed and some were injured. Those victims could not \nhave been compensated fully if joint liability had been eliminated.\n  While it is always a difficult choice as to who will bear the loss, \nand difficult for some defendants who are involved to a lesser extent \nwhere other defendants are insolvent, but as between injured plaintiffs \nwho are not responsible at all for what has happened and those who have \nbeen held liable and are subject to payment for joint liability, my own \nsense is that there ought not to be the total elimination of joint \nliability for noneconomic damages, which is the thrust of the present \nlegislation.\n  I am hopeful, Mr. President, that we can craft legislation which will \nmake an improvement in product liability litigation. But on the current \nstate of the record, I think the substitute still does not address the \nreal needs of consumers and does not strike an appropriate balance \nbetween those who are sued and those who are bringing claims.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/08/senate-section/article/S6236-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6237-S6238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FORCED MARCH OF AMERICAN \n                  PRISONERS OF WAR FROM STALAG LUFT IV\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today we commemorate the 50th anniversary \nof the end of World War II in Europe. Victory in Europe Day is one of \nthe milestone dates of this century. I rise today to honor a group of \nAmericans who made a large contribution to the Allied victory in Europe \nwhile also enduring more than their fair share of personal suffering \nand sacrifice: The brave men who were prisoners of war.\n  I believe it is appropriate to commemorate our World War II POW's by \ndescribing one incident from the war that is emblematic of the unique \nservice rendered by those special people. This is the story of an 86-\nday, 488-mile forced march that commenced at a POW camp known as Stalag \nLuft IV, near Gross Tychon, Poland, on February 6, 1945, and ended in \nHalle, Germany on April 26, 1945. The ordeal of the 9,500 men, most of \nwhom were U.S. Army Air Force Bomber Command noncommissioned officers, \nwho suffered through incredible hardships on the march yet survived, \nstands as an everlasting testimonial to the triumph of the American \nspirit over immeasurable adversity and of the indomitable ability of \ncamaraderie, teamwork, and fortitude to overcome brutality, horrible \nconditions, and human suffering.\n  Bomber crews shot down over Axis countries often went through \nterrifying experiences even before being confined in concentration \ncamps. Flying through withering flak, while also having to fight off \nenemy fighters, the bomber crews routinely saw other aircraft in their \nformations blown to bits [[Page S6238]] or turned into fiery coffins. \nThose who were taken POW had to endure their own planes being shot down \nor otherwise damaged sufficiently to cause the crews to bail out. Often \ncrewmates--close friends--did not make it out of the burning aircraft. \nThose lucky enough to see their parachutes open, had to then go through \na perilous descent amid flak and gunfire from the ground.\n  Many crews were then captured by incensed civilians who had seen \ntheir property destroyed or had loved ones killed or maimed by Allied \nbombs. Those civilians at times would beat, spit upon, or even try to \nlynch the captured crews. And in the case of Stalag Luft IV, once the \nPOW's had arrived at the railroad station near the camp, though \nexhausted, unfed, and often wounded, many were forced to run the 2 \nmiles to the camp at the points of bayonets. Those who dropped behind \nwere either bayonetted or bitten on the legs by police dogs. And all \nthat was just the prelude to their incarceration where they were \nunderfed, overcrowded, and often maltreated.\n  In February 1945, the Soviet offensive was rapidly pushing toward \nStalag Luft IV. The German High Command determined that it was \nnecessary that the POW's be evacuated and moved into Germany. But by \nthat stage of the war, German materiel was at a premium, and neither \nsufficient railcars nor trucks were available to move prisoners. \nTherefore the decision was made to move the Allied prisoners by foot in \na forced road march.\n  The 86-day march was, by all accounts, savage. Men who for months, \nand in some cases years, had been denied proper nutrition, personal \nhygiene, and medical care, were forced to do something that would be \ndifficult for well-nourished, healthy, and appropriately trained \ninfantry soldiers to accomplish. The late Doctor [Major] Leslie Caplan, \nan American flight surgeon who was the chief medical officer for the \n2,500-man section C from Stalag Luft IV, summed up the march up this \nyear:\n\n       It was a march of great hardship * * * (W)e marched long \n     distances in bitter weather and on starvation rations. We \n     lived in filth and slept in open fields or barns. Cothing, \n     medical facilities and sanitary\n      facilities were utterly inadequate. Hundreds of men suffered \n     from malnutrition, exposure, trench foot, exhaustion, \n     dysentery, tuberculosis, and other diseases.\n\n  A number of American POW's on the march did not survive. Others \nsuffered amputations of limbs or appendages while many more endured \nmaladies that remained or will remain with them for the remainder of \ntheir lives. For nearly 500 miles and over 86 days, enduring \nunbelievably inhumane conditions, the men from Stalag Luft IV walked, \nlimped and, in some cases, crawled onward until they reached the end of \ntheir march, with their liberation by the American 104th Infantry \nDivision on April 26, 1945.\n  Unfortunately, the story of the men of Stalag Luft IV, replete with \ntales of the selfless and often heroic deeds of prisoners looking after \nother prisoners and helping each other to survive under deplorable \nconditions, is not well known. I therefore rise today to bring their \nsaga of victory over incredible adversity to the attention of my \ncolleagues. I trust that these comments will serve as a springboard for \na wider awareness among the American people of what the prisoners from \nStalag Luft IV--and all prisoner of war camps--endured in the pursuit \nof freedom.\n  I especially want to honor three Stalag Luft IV veterans who endured \nand survived the march. Cpl. Bob McVicker, a fellow Virginian from \nAlexandria, S. Sgt. Ralph Pippens of Alexandria, LA, and Sgt. Arthur \nDuchesneau of Daytona Beach, FL, brought this important piece of \nhistory to my attention and provided me with in-depth information, to \ninclude testimony by Dr. Caplan, articles, personal diaries and \nphotographs.\n  Mr. McVicker, Mr. Pippens, and Mr. Duchesneau, at different points \nalong the march, were each too impaired to walk under their own power. \nMr. McVicker suffered frostbite to the extent that Dr. Caplan told him, \nalong the way, that he would likely lose his hands and feet--\nmiraculously, he did not; Mr. Pippens was too weak from malnutrition to \nwalk on his own during the initial stages of the march; and Mr. \nDuchesneau almost became completely incapacitated from dysentery. By \nthe end of the march, all three men had lost so much weight that their \nbodies were mere shells of what they had been prior to their capture--\nMr. McVicker, for example, at 5 foot, 8 inches, weighed but 80 pounds. \nYet they each survived, mostly because of the efforts of the other \ntwo--American crewmates compassionately and selflessly helping buddies \nin need.\n  Mr. President, I am sure that my colleagues join me in saluting Mr. \nMcVicker, Mr. Pippens, Mr. Duchesneau, the late Dr. Caplan, the other \nsurvivors of the Stalag Luft IV march, and all the brave Americans who \nwere prisoners of war in World War II. Their service was twofold: first \nas fighting men putting their lives on the line, each day, in the cause \nof freedom and then as prisoners of war, stoically enduring incredible \nhardships and showing their captors that the American spirit cannot be \nbroken, no matter how terrible the conditions. We owe them a great debt \nof gratitude and the memory of their service our undying respect.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/08/senate-section/article/S6237-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   FRANKLIN, NH, MARKS ITS CENTENNIAL\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing the city of Franklin, NH, on the occasion of its centennial \nand in appreciation of the contributions its citizens have made to our \nNation.\n  Founded at a gathering spot of the Penacook Tribe, where the \nPemigewasset and Winnipesaukee Rivers meet to form the Merrimack River, \nFranklin proudly traces its roots deep into the history of our State \nand our Nation. It is here, at the original settlement of Lower Falls, \nwhere Franklin's most famous native son, Daniel Webster, would commence \na career as lawyer and statesman and, eventually, go on to establish \nboth an honored place in this Senate and a prominent role in the \nshaping of America.\n  From this settlement, Capt. Ebenezer Webster, Daniel's father, would \nlead a company of local men to earn distinction in the Revolutionary \nWar and help win the independence of a new nation. Their heroics during \nthe campaign at Saratoga begins an unbroken line of Franklin's sons and \ndaughters serving our Nation and the cause of liberty with honor, \nloyalty, and valor.\n  Successful in commerce, Franklin was incorporated as a town in 1828 \nand as the city of Franklin in 1895. The historic mill town would give \nrise to the engineering ingenuity of Boston John Clark and the \ntechnological innovations of Walter Aiken and make significant economic \ncontributions to our society. Spurring inventions from the deceptively \nsimple hacksaw and the latch needle to the complexity of the circular \nknitting machine, Franklin would again play a pivotal role in the \nsecond industrial revolution, which propelled us forward as a modern \nnation.\n  Today, the city of Franklin continues to exhibit the character and \nenterprise of its distinguished past. Hardworking, first in \ncitizenship, and steadfast in its sense of community, Franklin \ncontinues to show the can-do spirit that marked its beginnings and \nfirst 100 years as a city. Recently, named one of the 100 best small \ncommunities in America, a base for advanced industry, rich in heritage, \nand energetic in shaping its future, Franklin is truly a ``Small City \non the Move.''\n  Join me to proudly salute Franklin, NH, the birthplace of Daniel \nWebster, and the enterprising spirit that has enriched a community, the \nState of New Hampshire, and our Nation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/08/senate-section/article/S6238-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6238-S6239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              V-E DAY 1995\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, 50 years ago, U.S. forces, along with those \nof our valiant and embattled allies, formally ended the victorious \nstruggle to contain a horrific evil that had spread across the European \ncontinent. For those Americans who attended the ceremonies that marked \nthe Nazi surrender, it was a solemn moment, for the struggle had been \nlong and bloody, and the price to defend freedom had come at a very \nhigh cost. For the world there was joy, renewed hope of lasting peace, \nand resolve to protect the freedom for which so many had offered up \ntheir lives. Today many of those hopes which are held deeply in the \nhearts of [[Page S6239]] the veterans who served, their families, and a \ngeneration of Americans who lived through the war, have become a \nreality.\n  For Americans too young to remember the war and those born into this \nworld in its aftermath, we have a special obligation this day to our \nparents, our grandparents, and to our children and future generations \nof Americans; 50 years from today most of those who remember the war \nwill no longer be with us. It is, therefore, our responsibility to \nlearn about what happened, and why it happened. We must ask those who \nfought in World War II what it was all about. We must remember the \nsufferings and the sacrifice, lest we become complacent with our \nfreedom and suffer the consequences. We must all, every one of us, \nlearn from our own history. Now, 50 years later, we must redouble our \nefforts to understand by talking to those who were there, those who \nremember it.\n  Americans who lived through this time and made the sacrifices, have \none last talk. It is now your duty to pass on to those of us who \nweren't on the battlefields of Europe, or fighting on the ``homefront'' \nwhat happened during the war, so that we can learn from your \nexperiences and pass along to future generations from the lesson's of \nthe power of hatred and the price of protecting freedom for all.\n  This day I encourage parents and grandparents to take some time to \ntalk to your children and grandchildren about World War II. You heroic \nveterans, tell them about the terrifying face of battle. Do not try to \nprotect them from the brutal images that you have carried with you for \nall these years. Those of you who fought on the homefront, tell them \nabout the hardships of home, the fears, the rationing; the friends, \nloved ones, and neighbors who never came home. Tell them why it all \nhappened. Tell them about the price of acquiescence, isolation, and \ncomplacency.\n  You children and grandchildren, the future of the world, go to your \ngrandparents and parents, call them on the phone, and ask them what it \nwas like. And, take the time to read about it, and understand that they \nbought you the freedom that we now enjoy. Ask them how they felt when \nits future was uncertain. They remember, they will be glad to tell you. \nListen hard, as if your life depends on it, because it does. And thank \nthem for what they have done for you. Your job is never to forget the \nstories they have to tell you. Your job is to learn those lessons now \nso that your children will never again be called upon to smite such \nevil from the Earth.\n  This is also a day when all of us should turn, particularly to those \nveterans who live among us, and offer to them our humble and loving \nthanks. The great State of Idaho sent thousands of men off to war in \nEurope. Many, many of them never again laid their eyes on the \nmountains, deserts, the forest, of Idaho, and lay buried in foreign \ngraves. The veterans who still walk among us, might have suffered the \nsame fate, if God had not chosen for them a different path. They risked \ntheir young lives for us, and suffered unimaginable horrors, so that we \nmight not have to. The people of Idaho, the Nation, and the world, owe \nthem everything.\n  Once in a while, as we live our busy lives with all of the challenges \nand trials that accompany them, we get the chance to stop and think \nabout why we are able to live in this, the greatest Nation on Earth, in \nsuch freedom. Today is such a day. When envisioning the drama and pain \nof that conflict become difficult to imagine, draw upon those who lived \nthrough it, and learn from them.\n  And as we pay solemn tribute to the memories of the victims, and the \nsurvivors, the brave, and the victorious, let us be mindful of what led \nto this terrible war and thankful to those who fought it. Let us not \nforget the cost of freedom. And let us pray that God give us peace.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/08/senate-section/article/S6238-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6239-S6240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n      IN SUPPORT OF OUR NEIGHBORS, FRIENDS, THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for the last two decades, our Federal \nemployees seem to be handy scapegoats for anything that goes wrong with \nGovernment. Whenever anyone on this floor mentions ``those Federal \nbureaucrats,'' the syntax is generally pejorative and the reference, \nunflattering. The collective term ``bureaucracy'' is uttered in the \nsame tone of revulsion reserved for former leaders of the ``evil \nempire.''\n  So it was refreshing to read an editorial in last Saturday's Times-\nArgus, which serves our State capital of Montpelier, VT.\n  The editorial simply reminds us that many victims of the Oklahoma \nCity bomb explosion were ``our friends, neighbors, brothers, and \nsisters who work for the Federal Government.''\n  It seems to needful reminder in these times to be a little more \nrespectful of the effort we get every day from millions of these men \nand women who work for us in every capacity, from guarding our national \nsecurity to protecting our rights as citizens, from fighting crime to \nenforcing public health and safety standards, from exploring space to \ncleaning up our air and water here on Earth.\n  I ask that this editorial be reprinted in the Congressional Record. I \nam not suggesting that criticism of Government operations is off \nlimits. I am only asking that it be fair. The hundreds of Federal \nworkers in my State of Vermont, are among the most dedicated and hard \nworking men and women, in public or private life, in our country. Let \nus stop careless impugning of their professional integrity.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                  [From the Times Argus, May 6, 1995]\n\n                           Neighbors, Friends\n\n       One of the results of the bombing attack on the federal \n     building in Oklahoma City has been to put a human face on the \n     entity known as the ``federal government.''\n       The people whose job it was to hand out Social Security \n     checks, to enforce the laws about drugs and firearms, or to \n     recruit people for the military were the neighbors, friends, \n     brothers, sisters of the people of Oklahoma City.\n       In Vermont the federal government consists of Forest \n     Service rangers and office workers, agriculture specialists, \n     the Marine recruiter, the Social Security workers, the court \n     personnel and others who live every day among us. These are \n     our neighbors, friends, brothers, sisters.\n       And yet to hear the more virulent strains of attack \n     emanating from anti-government extremists, these people are \n     an exotic combination of Nazi, Communist and Genghis Khan.\n       A Colorado talk show host, responding to a caller who \n     thought it was a good idea to shoot members of Congress, \n     advocated ``armed revolution.''\n       A talk show host in Arizona suggested that Sarah Brady, the \n     gun control advocate and wife of President Reagan's former \n     press secretary, ought to be ``put down'' the way a \n     veterinarian puts down a lame horse.\n       And, of course, the advice of Watergate burglar G. Gordon \n     Liddy to shoot for the head when confronted by federal agents \n     has become a famous example of the antigovernment rhetoric \n     that has become so common.\n       Imagine for a moment that it was the Rev. Jesse Jackson or \n     Ralph Nader or Patricia Ireland who was advising people to \n     shoot government workers. Would conservatives hesitate for a \n     moment in pointing out that such violent language may be less \n     than conducive to the good of the public weal? Yet when \n     President Clinton made the rather tentative suggestion that \n     this language was really not so helpful, media incidiarists \n     whined that they were being unfairly attacked.\n       Back in the 1960s anti-war dissenters, black power \n     advocates, and other dissatisfied souls said a lot of stupid \n     things that embarrassed even those who opposed the war or \n     supported the civil rights struggle. Talk then of armed \n     revolution was a naive delusion that was taken all too \n     seriously by a few people, who sometimes ended up getting \n     innocent people killed.\n       A lot of stupid things are being said again about our \n     friends, neighbors, brothers, sisters who work for the \n     federal government. In the West, there are soreheads with a \n     grievance about the way the federal government manages public \n     lands who are preventing federal workers from doing their \n     jobs.\n       Everybody ought to remember that federal lands in the West \n     do not belong only to the people who live there. They belong \n     to all of us. We have people working for us to manage our \n     lands. And people who don't like the way they are being \n     managed have a democratic process to avail themselves of to \n     change things.\n       It wasn't true in the 1960s, and it isn't true now: Our \n     government is not a dictatorship, and armed revolution is not \n     justifiable. The government in Oklahoma, in Boise or in \n     Montpelier consists of our friends, neighbors, brothers and \n     sisters, who, like the rest of us, are not always right about \n     everything they do. But that's the great thing about \n     democracy: We have peaceful methods for making \n     [[Page S6240]] changes. We also have the duty to hold \n     accountable those who break the law in an effort to attack \n     our system.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/08/senate-section/article/S6239-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         VICTORY IN EUROPE DAY\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today we are commemorating one of the \nproudest days in our history--Victory in Europe Day. World War II was \nno less than a triumph of good over evil. As President Harry Truman \nsaid, it was ``a solemn and glorious hour.'' Today we celebrate our \nvictory over the Nazis--and we honor those who gave their lives in the \nmost deadly conflict we have ever seen.\n  But most of all, we honor the Americans whose personal sacrifices \ngave us our greatest victory. In Maryland, thousands left factories, \nshops, and farms to fight on the front lines. People like my uncles \nPete, Fred, Richard, and Florene. We also honor those on the homefront \nwho kept the steel mills and shipyards going 24 hours a day to serve \nthe war effort. That includes the women--the Rosie the Riveters who \nkept America going while our boys fought on the battlefields.\n  Eleanor Roosevelt said that those days were no ordinary time and that \nno ordinary solutions would be sufficient to defeat the enemies of \nAmerica and Western civilization. No only was this no ordinary time, \nthis was no ordinary generation.\n  I was a child during the War. I grew up seeing the heroism and \npatriotism of our soldiers--and seeing America united behind a common \ngoal. I saw the sacrifices that individuals were willing to make for \nour country. That was the only America I knew.\n  Our veterans of World War II are each a symbol of the principles that \nhave kept this country strong and free. When we think of our veterans, \nwe think of everything that is good about this country--patriotism, \ncourage, loyalty, duty and honor. Our responsibility is to live up to \nthe standards they have set--to foster a new sense of citizenship and a \nnew sense of duty.\n  That is why it troubles me that too often, young Americans do not \nlearn enough about this special generation. It is our responsibility to \nhonor our Nation's veterans--not just on V-E Day--but every day. Let us \nhonor them in our homes, our schools, our churches, and our synagogues. \nAnd here in the U.S. Senate--when we set funding for veterans health \ncare and pensions.\n  Every day that we live in freedom, we should remember that their \ntriumph was democracy's greatest victory.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/08/senate-section/article/S6240-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF VICTORY IN EUROPE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today marks the anniversary of one of the \nmost important moments in modern Western history. Fifty years ago \ntoday, the Allied Powers accepted the unconditional surrender of Nazi \nGermany, ending the most devastating war in world history. It was a \ngreat victory for freedom and for civilization.\n  The Allied victory was one of courage, valor and enormous sacrifice. \nOf the hundreds of major battles fought during the war, 15 resulted in \ncasualties numbering no less than 5,000. From the beaches at Omaha to \nthe great campaigns in Europe, American lives were sacrificed in the \nname of freedom.\n  The victory in Europe marked the end of unparalleled human horror and \nof catastrophic human loss on that continent. It signified the end of \none of civilization's darkest moments. In essence, V-E Day marked the \nvery rebirth of life in Europe's scarred, and war-torn landscape. But \nthat rebirth did not come without a price.\n  We must never forget the sacrifices made to ensure our final victory. \nOf the 400,000 American soldiers who died in this horrible war, most \nlost their lives on the ground, in the trenches--literally clawing for \nvictory inch by inch. The magnitude of the human price of this effort \nshould command our deepest personal respect. We can never adequately \nthank our veterans for their supreme sacrifice.\n  Yet, through the images of fire and the remnants of ashes rises the \nhope that never again will we face such darkness. Never again will we \nface the prospect of such global sacrifice. Never again will the forces \nof freedom be asked to lay down their lives en masse in the name of \npeace and order.\n  Today marks the seminal moment in the American chapter of the War in \nEurope. It reminds us of our absolute resolve to maintain and preserve \nwhat is right and just.

Mr. President, this morning Samuel Pisar, a distinguished \nsurvivor of the Nazi death camps at Auschwitz, Sachsenhausen, Leonberg, \nand Dachau delivered the keynote address at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial \nMuseum's commemoration of the 50th anniversary of V-E Day.\n  I was very moved by Mr. Pisar's expression of gratitude to his \nliberators, the U.S. Army. He recounted his first words to the GI in \nthe American tank which rescued him, ``I . . . summoned the few English \nwords my mother used to sigh while dreaming of our deliverance, and \nyelled: `God Bless America!'''\n  That gratitude, in Mr. Pisar's words, ``as intense as it was 50 years \nago,'' serves to remind us all of the role which America has and \ncontinues today to play in the world as a beacon of hope for oppressed \npeople.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the excerpt of Samuel Pisar's address \nprinted Sunday in the Washington Post be printed in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the address was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 7, 1995]\n\nEscape From Dachau: My Own, Private V-E Day--For Prisoner B-\n                 1317,  Salvation Was a U.S. Army Tank\n\n                           (By Samuel Pisar)\n\n       World War II was coming to an end, yet we in the death \n     camps knew nothing. What is happening in the world outside? \n     Does anyone out there know what is happening here to us? Do \n     they care? I was 15 years old, and I wanted to live.\n       The day the Allies landed on the beaches of Normandy had \n     been for us a day like any other. The toll in the gas \n     chambers that day was higher than the losses suffered by the \n     combined armies under Gen. Eisenhower's command on this, \n     their longest day.\n       Judging by the brutality of our guards, we had every reason \n     to believe that all of Europe was irrevocably lost, the Red \n     Army smashed, England fighting alone, its back to the wall, \n     against the seemingly invincible forces of darkness. And \n     America? America was so unprepared, so divided, so far away. \n     How could she be expected to reverse the collapse of \n     civilization at this penultimate stage?\n       It took weeks for news of the U.S.-led invasion, beamed by \n     the BBC from London, across occupied Europe, to slip into \n     Auschwitz. There was also an amazing rumor that the Russians \n     had mounted a powerful offensive on the Eastern front.\n       Incredible! So God had not turned His face from the world \n     after all. Could a miracle still prevent the millenium of the \n     Third Reich? Oh to hang on, to hang on a little longer!\n       We could guess from the Nazis' mounting nervousness that \n     the weight of battle was changing decisively. With the ground \n     shrinking under their feet, they began herding us deeper and \n     deeper into Germany. I was shunted to Sachsenhausen near \n     Berlin, then Leonberg near Stuttgart, then Dachau near \n     Munich--camps normally reserved for political prisoners, \n     common criminals and homosexuals. [[Page S6241]] \n       It was a slave-labor enclave 50 miles away that I heard the \n     silence of night torn by powerful explosions. Fellow inmates \n     with military experience thought it sounded like artillery. \n     Within hours, we were lined up to be evacuated, ahead of the \n     ``enemy advance.'' These forbidden words, never before heard, \n     and even names of ``enemy'' commanders--Zhukov, Montgomery, \n     Patton--were now openly murmured.\n       I was beside myself with excitement. Who are these merciful \n     saviors--Russians? British? American? Salvation seemed so \n     near, and yet so far away.\n       Just as the hope of pulling through became more real, the \n     danger increased. We were headed back to Dachau, which meant \n     that at the last moment our torturers would destroy us. The \n     final solution must be completed, the witnesses of the crime \n     wiped out.\n       The death march, through winding back roads, continued day \n     and night, halting only for meager rations of bread and \n     water. At dawn, on the third day, of squardron of Allied \n     fighter planes, mistaking our column for Wehrmacht troops, \n     swooped down low to strafe us.\n       As the SS-men hit the dirt, their machine gun blazing in \n     all directions, someone near me shouted ``run for it!'' A \n     group of us kicked off our wooden clogs and made a clumsy, \n     uncoordinated sprint for the trees. The fire caught most of \n     us. Only I and five others made it into the forest alive.\n       We ran and ran, gasping for breath, until we were sure \n     there was no pursuit. After nightfall we began to move toward \n     the Western front. When we came close we decided to lie low, \n     until the German retreat had passed us by.\n       One bucolic afternoon, holed up in the hayloft of an \n     abandoned Bavarian barn, I became aware of a hum, like a \n     swarm of bees, only louder, metallic, unearthly. I peeped \n     through a crack in the wooded slats. Straight ahead, across \n     the field, a huge tank leading a long, armored convoy \n     lumbered my way.\n       From somewhere to one side I could hear the sound of \n     exploding mortars. The tank's long cannon lifted its round \n     head, turned slowly and let loose a deafening blast. The \n     firing stopped. The tank resumed its cautious advance.\n       Automatically, I looked for the hateful swastika, but there \n     was none. Instead I saw an unfamiliar emblem--a five-pointed \n     white star.\n       In an instant the unimaginable flooded my mind and my soul. \n     After four years in the pit of the inferno, I, convict No. B-\n     1713, also known as Samuel Pisar, son of a loving family that \n     has been wiped off the earth, have actually survived to \n     behold the glorious insignia of the United States Army.\n       My skull seemed to burst. With a wild roar I stormed \n     outside and darted toward the wondrous vision. I was still \n     running, waving my arms, when suddenly the hatch of an \n     armored vehicle opened, and black face, shielded by helmet \n     and goggles, emerged, swearing at me unintelligibly.\n       Having dodged death daily for so long, at the awesome \n     moment I felt immortal, though to the G.I. my condition, at \n     the heart of a battlefield, must have seemed desperate. \n     Pistol in hand, he jumped to the ground to examine me more \n     closely, as if to make sure the kid was not booby-trapped.\n       To signal that I was a friend, and in need of help, I fell \n     at his feet, summoned the few English words my mother used to \n     sigh while dreaming of our deliverance, and yelled: ``God \n     Bless America!''\n       With an unmistakable gesture, the tall American motioned me \n     to get up, and lifted me through the hatch--into the womb of \n     freedom.\n       On V-E Day 1995, my gratitude to this blessed land, never \n     trampled by tyrants or invaders, is a intense as it was 50 \n     years ago, on that German battlefield. So is my conviction \n     that the five-pointed star, which brought me life and \n     freedom, must remain a symbol of hope to all victims of \n     ethnic hatred, religious intolerance and terrorist violence.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/08/senate-section/article/S6240-4", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6241-S6242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 V-E DAY--A VICTORY FOR AMERICAN VALUES\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I join my fellow Americans and \nmillions of freedom-loving people around the world in celebrating the \n50th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day.\n  I am enormously proud of the South Dakotans who answered their \nNation's call to free Europe from Nazi terror. The 34th Infantry \nDivision--the first American division to serve in the European \ntheater--included three South Dakota National Guard units: the 109th \nEngineer Battalion, the 109th Quartermaster Regiment, and the 132d \nEngineer Regiment. South Dakotans were with Eisenhower, Patton, and \nBradley when they invaded North Africa in 1942 and Italy in 1943.\n  More than 2,200 South Dakota National Guardsmen served on active \nduty. More than 41,000 South Dakotans between the ages of 21 and 36 \nwere called into military service through the draft and 23,192 South \nDakotans enlisted. Hundreds more served as State guardsmen to respond \nto civil and military emergencies at home.\n  South Dakota was a temporary home to many of our brave soldiers in \ntraining. The Sioux Falls Training Base provided technical instruction \nto 45,000 servicemen. Pierre and Rapid City were sites for airbases. \nThe latter would ultimately become Ellsworth Air Force Base. Watertown \nand Mitchell served as subbases for the Army. Provo was the site of the \nBlack Hills or Igloo Ordnance Depot. And an area in the Badlands, known \nas the Gunnery Range, was used for bombing practice by the military.\n  I join with all Americans in saluting the enormous contributions of \nour native Americans from South Dakota in the war effort. Congressman \nBen Reifel--born on the Rosebud Reservation--was in the Army Reserve \nwhen called to active duty in 1942. He served in Europe. Reifel reached \nthe rank of lieutenant colonel by the time of his discharge after the \nwar.\n  The Lakota and Dakota code talkers' contributions deserve special \nrecognition. Their service back then was invaluable. Their story is \nstill legendary and a source of pride to all Americans.\n  My former colleague and dear friend Senator George McGovern was a \nWorld War II veteran and hero. As an Army Air Corps pilot, Senator \nMcGovern flew 35 bombing missions over Europe in a 6-month period. He \nalso received the Distinguished Flying Cross for safely crash-landing \nhis B-24 bomber--the Dakota Queen--on an island in the Adriatic Sea.\n  South Dakotans know well the heroism of Msgr. Francis Sampson, known \nas the Jumping Padre. Monsignor Sampson was a paratrooper--one of the \nfirst American liberators in the 82d and 101st Airbornes to set foot on \nEuropean soil on D-Day. He was captured by the Nazi Army, escaped and \nwas captured again, spending the rest of the war in a German prison \ncamp.\n  Mr. President, the greatest share of gratitude and tribute we owe to \nour American and Allied veterans--living and dead. For it is they who \nput their lives on the line so that their children and grandchildren \ncould live in a world free of Nazi terror. From the shores of Normandy \nto the forests of the Ardennes, American veterans pryed open Hitler's \ntyrannical stranglehold over Europe. But we must not forget Americans \nat home. It was just as much a Victory in America as it was a Victory \nin Europe.\n  South Dakotans will never forget the tremendous service of Governors \nHarlan J. Bushfield and M.Q. Sharpe, who met the enormous challenges of \nraising the State's National Guard and organizing civil defense drills \nand bond drives throughout the war years.\n  South Dakotans volunteered and raised funds for eight United Service \nOrganization [USO] clubs in South Dakota. These USO clubs were much \nneeded to boost morale among the troops stationed in our State.\n  South Dakotans young and old dug deep into their pockets and piggy \nbanks to keep American troops armed, fed, and clothed. During eight \nnational fund-raising campaigns, South Dakota exceeded its quotas. \nSouth Dakota consistently ranked first or second in the per capita sale \nof the Series ``E'' war bonds, known as people's bonds. In total, South \nDakotans raised $111.5 million from the sale of people's bonds--that's \n$173 for every South Dakotan adult and child. Some South Dakotans even \nsacrificed their homes and property for the war effort.\n  South Dakotans worked overtime in the fields and factories of our \nState growing the food and building the supplies for our troops. \nWorkers in the K.O. Lee Co. of Aberdeen made grinders and keyless drill \nchucks. The Dakota Sash and Door Company, also of Aberdeen, constructed \nwooden shell boxes. The Nichols Co., located in Spencer, manufactured \nleather carbine scabbards for jeeps.\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on to note the tremendous \naccomplishments of my State to the war effort. It is a story that each \none of my colleagues could echo. Each State, each American had a hand \nin the victory. Our hearts and minds were with our courageous American \nforces overseas. They answered the call. They stood face to face with \nHitler's machine of hate and oppression. They turned the tide of Nazi \naggression. [[Page S6242]] \n  But we could not have won on the European front without a victory on \nthe home front. Our American forces in Europe were the best trained, \nbest fed, and best supplied liberating force ever constructed on the \nplanet. They were the best ever abroad because we were the best ever at \nhome.\n  Let there be no mistake. The twisted power and oppression of Nazi \nterror, hatred, and Holocaust were no match for the collective powers \nof freedom, of democracy, of individual initiative--the very essence of \nAmerica. Today, we honor the 50th anniversary of that victory. We honor \nthat victory every day so long as we continue to stand for these values \nat home and abroad.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 956, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 956) to establish legal standards and \n     procedures for product liability litigation, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Gorton Amendment No. 596, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Coverdell/Dole amendment No. 690 (to Amendment No. 596), in \n     the nature of a substitute.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the State of Nevada, and particularly in \nLas Vegas, we have some great illusionists. The most famous are two men \nby the name of Siegfried and Roy. Every night, twice a night, they are \nsold out. Presently, they are at the Mirage Hotel and have been there \nfor the last 4 or 5 years.\n  These illusionists, as great as they are, should be taking lessons \nfrom what is going on in the Congress today and during the past several \nweeks. We are talking about things that are really illusionary. For \nexample, there has been a hue and cry that everything should be turned \nback to the States, that the States should make the decisions on their \nown destiny. All we hear is that we should leave them alone and let the \nStates decide what is best for them.\n  In the so-called Contract With America, that is what they talk \nabout--returning as much back to the States as they could. But here we \nare, Mr. President, now talking about tort reform and standing that \nissue on its head. Instead of returning everything back to the States, \nwe are saying in this area that we do not want the States to prevail, \nwe want to have a national standard, which is really unusual to me to \nfind out how people could reason that way.\n  For example, Mr. President, the State of Washington does not allow \npunitive damages. I think the State of Washington is wrong. But that is \na decision they made with their State legislature and the Governor.\n  Would it not be wrong, Mr. President, if all States had to follow the \nsame law as it relates to innkeepers, that we have in the State of \nNevada. In the State of Nevada we have over--in Las Vegas alone--over \n100,000 rooms, more rooms in Las Vegas than any other city in the \nworld.\n  The State of Nevada basically is a resort State. Would it not be \nwrong for the laws of the State of Alabama as it relates to innkeepers \nto be the same as the State of Nevada? Of course, it would. We have \nspecial problems with tort law as it relates to innkeepers. Therefore, \nthe State of Nevada should be left alone. We should be able to decide \non our own what the law, as it relates to innkeepers, should be for the \nresidents of the State of Nevada.\n  The legislation that is before this body is a bill that usurps and \ndestabilizes well-established State law and principles as it relates to \nseller liability.\n  The legislature of the State of Nevada is meeting as we speak. They \nare talking about tort reform in Nevada as this debate is taking place.\n  I would much rather rely on what the State legislature does regarding \ntort reform for Nevada than what we decide back here should be the \nstandard in Nevada.\n  The State of Nevada has carefully established rules as it relates to \nproduct liability. We have a strict liability standard for most \nproducts that are sold defectively. We are not unusual in that regard. \nThere are 45 other States that have, through their courts or \nlegislatures, adopted some form of strict liability as it relates to \nproducts.\n  Only a handful of States have chosen to remove product liability from \nthis general rule. Should not that handful of States be left alone?\n  This bill would undo the law in at least two-thirds of the States. \nContrary to nearly 200 years of State tort law, this bill would \nvirtually immunize people who sold defective products.\n  Another troubling matter, Mr. President, is that this bill \noverreaches in its efforts to protect small businesses by placing a \nrestrictive cap on punitive damages, or any ``entity or organization \nwith fewer than 25 full-time employees.'' This overlybroad language \nextends the protections of this bill well beyond the so-called small \nbusinesses. This cap, for example, would completely take away the right \nthat we have in most States to allow punitive damages against drunk \ndrivers, against child molesters, perpetrators of hate crimes, and even \nby those who sell drugs to children.\n  I have, for more than a week, listened to this debate. Prior to \ncoming here, I was a trial lawyer. I have tried scores of cases before \njuries--almost 100 jury trials. I believe that the jury system, Mr. \nPresident, is one of the things that we should be very proud of as a \ncountry.\n  We ought to reflect on the value of the Magna Carta. It was signed in \na meadow of England, in a place called Runnymede. King John could not \nwrite his name. He had to put a mark for his name. The Magna Carta was \nthe beginning of the English common law that we adopted when we became \na country. One of the things that we brought over the water and now \nhave and have had for over 200 years is a jury system, where wrongs \nthat are perpetrated can be brought before a group of people and they \ncan adjudge the wrong, if in fact, there were any.\n  My experience in the jury system, Mr. President, is that most of the \ntime the juries arrive at the right decision. I would say that about 90 \npercent of the time, they arrive at the right decision. Not always for \nthe right reason, but the right decision. I think it is something that \nother countries have looked on with awe and respect--our jury system.\n  Again, this bill would take away and undermine the jury system and \nplaces arbitrary caps on damages. The substitute arbitrarily caps \npunitive damages at two times other damages for all punitive damages \ncases. In order to have any deterrent impact, punitive damages should \nbe based on conduct that is willful and wanton.\n  We have heard so much about the McDonald's case. But what was the \nMcDonald's case? Let me explain, Mr. President, what the McDonald's \ncase was. A grandmother took her grandchild to baseball practice. She \nwanted a cup of coffee. She drove to McDonald's. She got a cup of \ncoffee. She put the cup of coffee between her legs, and as she removed \nthe lid from the cup of coffee, it spilled. She had third-degree burns \nover her body. Her genitals were burned. She had to undergo numerous \npainful skin grafts.\n  A person might say, why should she be awarded for putting a cup of \ncoffee between her legs? The fact of the matter is the reason the jury \nreacted in the way they did in this case is the fact that McDonald's \nhad had 700 other burn cases where people had been burned with coffee. \nThey had been warned and warned and warned that they served their \ncoffee too hot --190 degrees is the temperature they served their \ncoffee.\n  Mr. President, if a person buys a coffeemaker and plugs it in at \nhome, and makes his or her own coffee, it comes out at about 135 \ndegrees--something like that. McDonald's served their coffee at 180 to \n190 degrees that if accidentally spilled could result in third-degree \nburns in a matter of 2 or 3 seconds. [[Page S6243]] \n  The jury felt that McDonald's had been warned enough that they should \nnot serve their coffee as hot as they did. Why did they serve it so \nhot? There were a lot of reasons, perhaps, but one reason they served \ncoffee so hot is McDonald's felt they got more product by serving their \ncoffee hot. That is, they got more juice of the beans, so to speak.\n  The jury award, the punitive damages award in this case, Mr. \nPresident, was the amount of coffee sold by McDonald's for two days. \nThat is why they came up with the $2.3 million verdict. The jury felt \nthat McDonald's should get the message that 700 burnings or warnings \nwere enough.\n  The fact of the matter is that the court reduced this amount to \n$480,000 and the parties reached an out-of-court settlement for \nprobably even less.\n  She had skin grafts, and as I indicated, the jury came to realize \nthis was not an isolated incident. This was a wrong that had to be \ncorrected, a willful wrong in the mind of the jury.\n  If a State, however, feels the McDonald's case sets such a bad \nprecedent that they do not want to allow punitive damages, States have \nthat right today. The State of Nevada, the State of Minnesota, the \nState of Mississippi, the State of Arizona--they can eliminate punitive \ndamages if they want. But why should it not be done by the States? Why \ndo we have to go and set a standard nationwide for how they handle \ntheir punitive damages?\n  The substitute amendment does not allow punitive damages, even if a \ndefendant's conduct was reckless or wanton. Punitive damages can be \nassessed only if an injured citizen can prove the super-heightened \nstandard of, ``conscious, flagrant indifference to safety,'' a standard \nI never came across in all the time I practiced law. I never heard of \nthat. That is a new standard. It is one that is set up to eliminate \npunitive damages. Even though punitive damages is the amount that could \nbe awarded, even if you could prove conscious, flagrant indifference to \nsafety, it is cut down significantly; almost eliminated. This would \ntake any thought about having punitive damages completely out of the \nlaw. Nationally, there would be no punitive damages.\n  Take companies like McDonald's or General Motors, and let us say we \nhave a $250,000 punitive damage limit. Does that bother General Motors? \nOf course it does not.\n  What about the Exxon Valdez oil spill? Keep in mind the facts of that \ncase. A man who had previously been told not to drink on the job is \ndrunk, controlling the ship and causes all this damage to the \nenvironment. Should Exxon Valdez not be required to respond in punitive \ndamages? I think it should.\n  Over the past few years we have seen an unfortunate entrance into the \nmarket of too many dangerous products that are marketed toward women: \nThe Dalkon shield, the Copper-7 IUD, DES, silicon breast implants, are \njust a few of the alarming examples of dangerous products placed into \nthe market that affect women. Why should there be some arbitrary \nstandard now established that affects those cases? There should not be. \nIt is wrong. To come up with a standard called ``conscious, flagrant \nindifference to safety'' is almost unconscionable. So a vote for the \nsubstitute is to vote to eliminate the existing legal incentives for \ncompanies to produce the safest possible products.\n  The substitute eliminates joint and several liability for the people \nwho truly rely on noneconomic damages the most: women, children and the \nelderly. These victims will now be required to bear the risk caused by \npotentially bankrupt defendants. The joint and several liability \nstandard came about as a result of there being a number of defendants, \nsome of whom who could not respond. I ask the question rhetorically, is \nit fair to limit companies' liability to the most vulnerable when only \njoint and several liability will ensure full compensation?\n  This legislation creates a huge exemption for big business. The \nsubstitute excludes commercial loss from its scope. Is that not \ninteresting? One of the reasons the products liability legislation was \ndefeated last year is because it directed its attention to individuals \nsuing each other, it directed its attention to the individual suing a \ncompany, but it did not focus on companies suing each other, and that \nis where most of the litigation takes place in products liability \nlitigation. Again, this year the same problem exists because this \nprovision, the commercial loss exclusion, essentially exempts big \nbusinesses from the restrictions in the bill that those same businesses \nseek to impose on consumers and workers injured by the products.\n  Take an example. If a product used on the factory floor blows up \nbecause of a defect, the injured worker's right to seek compensation \nfrom the third-party manufacturer of the product is limited. But the \nowner of the factory can sue to his heart's content, for as much lost \nprofits as he deems appropriate; or if he had some property that was \ndamaged there as a result of the explosion he can sue all he wants. So \nas a result of an injury to a human being, no recovery; but injury to \nproperty, you can sue just as you always did. So big business is \nprotected.\n  There is a lack of uniformity. Proponents of this measure claim it \nwill establish uniformity in product liability law. In reality, it \ncreates prodefendant disuniformity. It is a one-way preemption at its \nworst. The amendment only preempts those State laws which favor \nconsumers. How? It imposes an arbitrary cap on punitive damages in \nthose States which allow it but it does not create punitive damages in \nthose States which do not allow it. So in my earlier statement when I \ntalked about the State of Washington having to now have an award given \nfor punitive damages, some of those who are looking at this legislation \nsay, ``That is absolutely wrong. In fact, if your standards are less \nthan what is in the bill you can keep those.'' How unfair. It also \nestablishes an arbitrary statute of repose for 20 years but allows \nStates to impose shorter limitations if they so desire.\n  So we are rushing hastily to pass a piece of legislation that \ndramatically favors big business. It dramatically will change centuries \nof State-developed law. It is ironic that those who argue most \nvigorously for a stronger 10th amendment are the proponents of this \namendment. This is the Siegfried and Roy illusion I talked about in the \nbeginning of my statement. The State of Nevada knows best as to how \ntheir litigation should be handled. Unfortunately, the proponents of \nthis legislation think they know what is best for Nevada.\n  We are saying to the American people that we no longer trust the \njudgments of State legislatures. We are saying we no longer trust \npeople sitting as juries. And as I said earlier, the American system of \njustice and the jury system--while there are some decisions that I \ndisagree with and we can all point to some of the criminal verdicts \nthat have come about--the jury system is a uniquely American concept \nwith its roots in the Magna Carta, grounded in democracy, and rooted in \nthe ideal that ordinary Americans applying their inherent common sense \ncan often best fashion a judgment or a decision that results in justice \nto the injured party.\n  Who knows the number of lives saved and the catastrophes prevented \nbecause of our laws relating to punitive damages? In the area of \nproducts liability, I pause to think what would happen if \nmanufacturers, especially big business, did not have to worry about \ntheir products being safe.\n  So, let us not throw this standard out of the window and invite \ncorporate wrongdoers to engage in a cost-benefit analysis of whether it \nmakes sense to place defective products into the market. I think we \nwould not be well served by adopting this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me first inquire if we are in a period \nof general debate on the product liability legislation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to extend my congratulations to \nthe distinguished Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton, for his \noutstanding leadership both in the Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee and here on the floor, in an effort to get a \nvery responsible piece of legislation through, the Product Liability \nFairness Act. He has worked very closely with the Senator from West \nVirginia, Senator Rockefeller, [[Page S6244]] and they really have done \nyeomen's work in producing this legislation.\n  The bill that was reported from the Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee has been expanded. A number of amendments have \nbeen adopted. And in my opinion, all of those amendments are improving \namendments. We are talking about legal reform, not just product \nliability reform.\n  Having said that, it is obvious from votes late last week we are not \ngoing to be able to get through the broader bill, as much as I would \nlike for that to happen. So there will be votes shortly, either later \non this afternoon or, I assume, tomorrow morning--maybe this afternoon \nand tomorrow morning--on exactly what will be the final bill. I presume \nwe will have a narrower bill than now exists before the Senate, one \nthat is directed primarily at product liability but with some \nadditional provisions, but not many, that have been approved \noverwhelmingly by the Senate.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote to invoke cloture to stop \nthe filibuster and allow the Senate to vote on this very, very \nimportant issue. It has been suggested that this would be a rush to \njudgment. Rush to judgment? We have been debating this issue--product \nliability--for 10 years in the Senate. This will be the third time we \nhave voted to try to end the filibuster so we can even get to a vote \nsince I have been in the Senate. This is my seventh year. We know the \nissue. We know the details. This is not a rush to judgment.\n  Plus, let it be noted once again that the Senate talks and the Senate \nstalls. The Senate is now in its third week on product liability and \nthe effort to try to broaden it to have genuine legal reform. There \nhave been legitimate negotiations going on led by Senator Gorton and \nSenator Rockefeller to bring this to a conclusion. We should be ready \nto do that. The leaders have listened to the Senate. We have looked at \nthe amendments and how close they were. What can we do to get an end to \nthe filibuster so we can get to a vote?\n  This legislation will be narrow. It will be targeted primarily at \nproduct liability. It will not include medical malpractice reform even \nthough we clearly need that and the Senate voted for it. But, if it is \nincluded, we probably cannot get the 60 votes that are necessary, once \nagain, to end the filibuster.\n  This bill does not include criminal matters. The President suggested \nthat it does. I have heard suggestions here on the floor of the Senate \nthat it does. It does not apply to criminal matters like hate crimes. \nIt is just not applicable here. That is a scare tactic.\n  Let me clarify this joint and several issues. It is amazing how \nthings can be turned around in the debate here in the Senate. Joint and \nseveral--what does that mean? That means when you file a lawsuit, you \nfile a lawsuit against everybody remotely connected or even in the area \nwhen you are wanting to sue and recover damages. But even though you \nwere only remotely involved, like say maybe 5 or 10 percent of the \ndamages attributable to you, if the other defendants are broke, you can \nbe forced to pay the entire judgment. It is called deep pockets. If you \nhappen to be in the area and you happen to be a successful company or \nan individual, you are the one who will get hit even though you were \njust involved to a very small degree. We are saying there ought to be \nsome sensible limit there. You ought to pay for the damage you caused \nbut not pay for everybody. It makes such good common sense.\n  Let me remind my colleagues here today that the American people \noverwhelmingly support the idea of legal reform--overwhelmingly. We \nhave a few interest groups that do not want that to happen. But the \npeople understand who pays. I mean it is easy to stand here on the \nfloor of the Senate and say let us make you, Exxon, pay. Let us make \nGeneral Motors pay. You know who pays? The consumer pays. It does not \njust come out of the sky. Somebody pays the bill.\n  When you have frivolous lawsuits against people acting in good faith, \nwhen you have doctors, ob-gyn's that are afraid to stay in their \nprofession because they are liable to be sued paying thousands upon \nthousands of dollars for medical malpractice insurance, who loses? The \npatients lose. They pay more. Or you have doctors getting out of the \nbusiness because they cannot afford to stay in it anymore.\n  However, we will have to reserve most of this legal reform for \nanother day. Here we are only talking about product liability. We are \ntrying to get some uniformity in an area that clearly involves \ninterstate commerce. We are trying to get some commonsense answer in \nthis area to stop forum shopping where a small company in my State that \nproduces heavy equipment can be sued in all kinds of forums all over \nthe country, and you shop around until you find the best forum. Then \nyou sue them there. Some uniformity is all we are seeking here.\n  When scholars write the legislative history of Congress in the last \nquarter of the century, I think they will be puzzled by the debate the \nSenate has been engaged in now for 2 whole weeks and entering the third \nweek. They will wonder why so much time, so much passion, so much \npressure was expended on a bill that should have brought us together in \nunanimous agreement. It passed overwhelmingly out of the Commerce \nCommittee. Yet when it gets to the floor the talk begins.\n  The scholars will note that the substance of this legislation enjoyed \noverwhelming approval of the public, that it was a moderate proposal \nwith bipartisan sponsorship, and that a much more expansive measure had \nalready passed the House of Representatives by a whopping margin of 265 \nto 161.\n  Why could the House get such a broad bill providing for legal reform \npassed by an overwhelming margin but the Senate cannot do it? Answer: \nBecause it takes 60 votes to stop the debate in the Senate. Just keep \ntalking, keep talking, keep talking and never take action. This time we \nshould take action. I believe we will.\n  People will wonder in the future what could have been so \ncontroversial about the provisions in this bill. National uniformity in \nproduct liability law and putting American manufacturers on equal \nfooting with foreign competitors should not be controversial. \nEncouraging alternative dispute resolution in place of lengthy and \nexpensive court proceedings should not be controversial. That just \nsimply says use a process to try to resolve a dispute instead of going \nthrough lengthy trials. It makes good common sense to me.\n  It should not be controversial to require that the person who creates \nharm must take responsibility for it. If someone who is drunk or under \nthe influence of illegal drugs is more than 50 percent responsible for \nhis own injury, he should not be able to extort money from others by \nblaming them for what happened. People who rent or lease cars and \nequipment should not be legally liable for the acts of those who rent \nthose items from them. If you rent a car and go out and get drunk, \ncause an accident, injure people, why should the rental company be \nresponsible for your misconduct?\n  It should not be controversial to stop the practice of holding \ndefendants jointly liable for noneconomic damages usually referred to \nas ``pain and suffering.'' That has become a way for plaintiffs to get \ninto the deep pockets of one defendant that I talked about earlier, \neven though some other defendant, with less resources, was at fault.\n  Jury awards of punitive damages in the millions of dollars have \nbecome commonplace. One example just cited was the McDonald's case. \nThat is just one example. I would recommend to people that when they \nbuy a hot cup of coffee, they not set it between their legs and try to \ndrive an automobile. It seems to me that is contributory negligence.\n  It certainly should not be controversial to set a 20-year limit--a \nstatute of repose--for a manufacturer's liability for a product used in \nthe workplace. If a product is more than two decades old it should not \nbe subject to a product liability suit unless it came with the written \nsafety warranty longer than 20 years.\n  None of these provisions should be terribly divisive. Indeed to most \nof us here, as to most of the public, they are just common sense. I \nhave referred to that several times. We are trying to curb excesses in \nthe civil--civil--justice system, not the criminal justice system, \nalthough clearly after watching television the last few weeks we have a \nlittle work we need to do in the criminal justice area, too. \n[[Page S6245]] \n  Yet somehow, H.R. 956, the vehicle for product liability reform, has \nbecome a battleground. We have allowed ourselves to get into heated \ndebate. I have been guilty of that. I have said some things about the \nTrial Lawyers Association, the plaintiffs bar, that I should not have. \nI have had things attributed to me that I do not recall saying. It has \nbeen quoted that I said ``they cheat people all over America.'' That \nwould be inappropriate. I reject that kind of language. Even having it \nattributed to me, I apologize for that. We do not need that kind of \nrhetoric. I should not contribute to it. None of us should contribute \nto it. What we should do instead is reason together. That is what is \nhappening now. We are trying to find a solution so we can stop the \ndebate, pass the legislation, get into conference with the House of \nRepresentatives, and do what is the right thing.\n  In some measures, you understand, with the intensity of the debate, \nthat ideologically divisive--left, right--divisions come into play. If \nsomething is good in the South but not good in North, we get pretty hot \nabout it because you are talking about our constituency and our regions \nof the country. But that is not what is happening here. This is \nsomething that involves economic interests of all the people. It \ninvolves trying to get some legitimate litigation reform. I think we \nwill be able to do that today.\n  But what we have now has eroded--the public's respect for, and \nconfidence in, the administration of civil justice.\n  The worst of it--and the most important reason why this bill be so \nneeded--is that litigation involving product liability is harming \nconsumers, taxpayers, businesses, and investors. It limits job \ncreation, stifles creativity, thwarts medical and scientific advances, \nand lessens our country's international competitiveness.\n  And it benefits almost no one. Certainly not the hapless defendants, \nwho often spend enormous amounts of money either defending themselves \nagainst frivolous lawsuits or settling out of court just to cut their \nlosses. Nor does it help the plaintiffs all that much when a large \nshare of their court winnings goes for attorney's fees, payments for \nexpert witnesses, and court costs. One recent settlement against the \nNation's major airlines gave consumers coupons for future flights, \nwhich they could redeem only a few dollars at a time. But the \nplaintiff's lawyers walked off with $16,012,500 in cold cash.\n  I do not mean to suggest that anyone who finds fault with some \nprovision of H.R. 956 does so from an unworthy motive. Reform of \nproduct liability laws is a complicated matter, and there are \nlegitimate questions as to how far one or another reform should be \ntaken. I will candidly admit that this bill does not go as far as I \nwould like it to. But I understand that some of its supporters do not \nwish to broaden its provisions. Despite our disagreement in that \nregard, we agree on the need for reform and are forthrightly working \ntogether toward common ground.\n  I am disappointed, however, that more Members of the Senate have not \nendorsed at least the principle of product liability reform, even if \nthey might disagree with some provisions of H.R. 956. I wish they were \ntrying to modify the bill to meet their objections, much as I might \noppose their modifications, rather than trying to kill it. As it is, \nthey have allowed themselves to become champions of the status quo, and \nthat, I submit, is not an enviable position in the eyes of the American \npeople.\n  And that is why the Senate has been spending all this time on what \nshould have been a rather brief and unifying exercise in legal reform. \nIt is why we still have the threat of filibuster hanging over our \nheads. It is why we spent so many hours over the last 2 weeks on \namendments--one that was later tabled by a vote of 94 to 3.\n  We have dealt with several critical amendments, which have been \naccepted. One dealing with punitive damage awards against small \nbusinesses and charitable and volunteer organizations, many of which \nare being crippled by a justified fear of liability suits. Another \nwould limit the use of joint and severable damage awards. A third will \noffer badly needed reforms in medical malpractice law. But what we have \nbefore us is a good start. It will bring about significant improvements \nin the way our courts operate, in the way our economy operates. It will \nmake our civil justice system fairer, less costly, and more efficient.\n So I urge my colleagues here this afternoon to vote cloture. We still \nhave some more amendments that can be offered. We could still discuss \nthe final result. But it is time we vote and get this legislation \nmoving forward.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor at this time and, observing no other \nSenator who wishes to speak, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, a substitute has been offered and I want \nto go into some of the aspects of the substitute, and I will later.\n  First, I think I stated in the beginning of the debate that I \nconsidered this to be an extremely unfair bill. While it was titled the \n``Product Liability Fairness'' bill, there were numerous provisions \nthat were one-sided and which attempted to take away rather basic \nrights of a claimant in a lawsuit, and I thought it was extremely \nunfair. Also this bill was unfair because of the fact that it exempted \nall commercial loss and made commercial loss come under the category of \ncommercial or contract law, primarily the Uniform Commercial Code.\n  Commercial loss is a business loss, not a personal injury loss. Some \nof the most egregious punitive damage suits--practically all of the \nlarge ones--have been against business. Penzoil versus Texaco, $11 \nbillion, is the one that stands out primarily in the minds of most \npeople. But commercial loss would be in most all instances restricted \nto corporate America suing corporate America.\n  Manufacturers do not want to come under the provisions of this bill \nbecause they do not want to be put under the same laws as the people \nwho receive personal injuries.\n  For example, under the statute of limitations on implied warranties \nin contract law, it is substantially longer. My State of Alabama has a \ncontract statute of limitations of 6 years. Under the Uniform \nCommercial Code, under warranties, it is 4 years. Yet, under this bill, \nit would come to apply to personal injury which is 2 years.\n  There are several types of implied warranties under the Uniform \nCommercial Code. For example, there is an implied warranty that the \nproduct is suited for the purpose for which it is sold. However, under \nthis bill implied warranties are not recognized.\n  Therefore, if a person remains silent, there is no implied warranty. \nThe rules with respect to implied warranties have been developed over \nthe years and have been recognized as being an essential element in \nsales that a product ought to be fit for the purposes for which it is \nsold.\n  There are other aspects of this that have emerged relating to its \nunfair provisions, and I will touch on some of these provisions at this \ntime.\n  First, I want to address my remarks initially to the Snowe amendment. \nThe Snowe amendment has been touted as eliminating the unfairness of \nthe original cap on punitive damages in this product liability case. \nUnder the original bill, it was set at being three times the economic \nloss, or $250,000.\n  There were those that said that noneconomic loss, such as scarring or \ndisfigurement, the infertility or loss of childbearing ability of a \nwoman, or other noneconomic factors such as loss of consortium, was \ndiscriminatory because of the fact that they would be limited to \n$250,000, whereas a person's economic loss could be up into the \nmillions.\n  In a speech I made last week, I cited a 55-year-old CEO of a \ncorporation who is making $5 million annually who has an anticipated \nwork expectancy of 10 years. We would have a situation where his loss \nof earnings, his economic loss, would be $5 million a year times 10 \nyears, or $50 million, and then multiply it by three. He would have a \ncap of $150 million, as opposed to the housewife [[Page S6246]] who has \nno economic loss, or the elderly who have no economic loss. Their cap \nwould be $250,000--$150 million versus $250,000. That is quite a \ndisparity in regard to caps, and I believe my point caused some \nSenators to reflect on the unfairness of the original punitive damage \nprovision in the Gorton-Rockefeller substitute.\n  As a result, there have been some changes made. The Snowe amendment \nnow has a formula with regard to punitive damages which provides for \ntwice the amount of total economic loss and the noneconomic loss--or \ntwice times compensatory damages.\n  Yet, there are still examples in which this would cause an even worse \nsituation. In the case where death occurs instantaneously, there is no \nnoneconomic--that is ``pain and suffering''--loss under the laws of \nmost States. We would have a situation defined as meaning noneconomic \nloss means subjective nonmonetary loss resulting from harm, including \npain, suffering, inconvenience, mental suffering, emotional distress, \nloss of society and companionship, loss of consortium, injury to \nreputation, and humiliation--all of this is in the definition of \nnoneconomic loss that is in the substitute that we have now before the \nSenate.\n  Now, on that scenario where a person died as a result of injury, what \nwould be the situation? That same 55-year-old CEO who was making $5 \nmillion a year, his economic loss would be $50 million on a work \nexpectancy of 10 years times two under the Snowe amendment--or $100 \nmillion.\n  Well, that is less of a cap than the $150 million we have. But what \ndo we have on the housewife? She also dies immediately. She did not \nsuffer any pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of society and \ncompanionship, and so forth, so she would really be in a situation \nwhere her noneconomic loss would be zero.\n  Then we revert back to what the situation was under the original \nbill. She had no economic loss because she did not work outside the \nhome, and therefore her total economic loss and her total noneconomic \nloss would be zero. We double zero, and we still have zero.\n  Now, some might say, well, she would at least have an economic loss \nin funeral expenses. Well, there are some States--and I do not know \nwhether this is the majority or not--that say that death is inevitable, \nlike taxes. Therefore, we have a situation in which we are going to \nhave to be buried, and that cannot be counted as an economic loss.\n  Let's say, for purposes of discussion and debate, that all of the \nStates were to allow it. Instead of the death case with the elderly or \nthe housewife, it would be an economic loss of maybe $5,000 for funeral \nexpenses, and we double that under the Snowe amendment and we have \n$10,000.\n  So we still have the difference between the 55-year-old CEO who is \nkilled, at $100 million; and we have, for the elderly or the housewife, \nmaybe zero, and maybe $10,000 for funeral expenses.\n  That shows, to me, the disparity of the Snowe amendment, and a \nsituation in which it would not operate fairly. At least, under the \noriginal bill, we would have had a cap of $250,000. Now the cap, under \nthe death case that I recited, would either be zero for the elderly and \nzero for the housewife, or perhaps maybe $10,000, or possibly $15,000, \nat the most, in regard to burial expenses.\n  So this Snowe fix supposedly did come up under a situation in which \ndeath occurs, and as a result, if there were personal injuries, the \npersonal injuries would have a different cap.\n But, therefore, it would be for the benefit of the wrongdoer who is \ngoing to be sued. A tortfeasor would much rather see the person dead \nthan that he would be alive and incurring some pain and suffering and \ngiving the jury some leeway in the determination of noneconomic loss, \nparticularly if it is a person like a housewife, and elderly person, or \na child or student, who has yet to begin making a living for herself.\n\n  Under the Snowe amendment, a high-income victim will continue to be \nable to receive a high punitive award, whereas a homemaker, retiree, \nlow-income victim will be limited to a very low punitive damage award \nin regards to these instances. Punitive damages are designed to punish \nand deter egregious conduct. They are not necessarily designed to have \ncaps. You have to deal with it on an individual basis.\n  As to the McDonald's hot coffee case, the situation was that the jury \ndetermined that punitive damages were in order to send a message to \nMcDonald's, after 700 instances of burn cases. The jury in that \nsituation decided on a punitive damage award of 2 days of the gross \nsales of coffee by the McDonald's Corp. which amounted to approximately \n$2.5 million, and then the judge reduced that down to $460,000. Later \nit was settled for an undisclosed sum that was protected by a secrecy \norder. There were third-degree burns in this case and McDonald's had \nrepeated warnings that its coffee was being served way too hot. This \nbill takes away from the ability of juries to determine just what type \nof egregious conduct warrants an appropriate amount of punishment as to \ndamages.\n  Other language that appears in the Dole-Coverdell substitute has been \nchanged. There was put into the substitute an amendment by Senator \nDeWine which appeared as a special rule. It says,\n\n       The amount of punitive damages that may be awarded in any \n     products liability action against an individual whose net \n     worth does not exceed $500,000 or against an owner of an \n     incorporated business or any partnership, corporation, \n     association, unit of local government or organization that \n     has fewer than 25 employees, shall not exceed $250,000.\n\n  Now it appears in the substitute that the Dewine exemption applies in \nall civil cases--not just product liability cases--against an \nindividual whose net worth does not exceed $500,000 or a partnership, \ncorporation, so on--but it has as its cap, two times the sum of the \neconomic damages and the noneconomic damages--still Snowe--or $250,000, \nbut then it has the language which says, ``which amount is lesser.''\n  So a suit against a small corporation, partnership or an individual \nwhere the net worth does not exceed $500,000--and of course a small \nbusiness has fewer than 25 employees--that has as its caps Snowe, which \nis double the compensatory damages or $250,000, but which amount is \nlesser.\n  This exemption applies to all civil cases. I believe the President \ncalled a similar provision the drunk drivers' protection act.\n  It is still a drunk drivers' protection act against a limited number \nof people. It just says that if you are drinking while driving you \nbetter not be worth more than $500,000 or you must not be an owner of \nan unincorporated business or be involved in a partnership or \ncorporation. But it still is a drunk drivers' protection act, as it \nwould apply to the limits that are placed in the bill, because it \napplies to any civil action, not just product liability.\n  But let us also look at these caps and see how they apply. That 55-\nyear-old CEO who is, we will say, killed, he has a situation in which \nhe had a work expectancy of 10 years; with a $5 million annual salary \nhe would have had a $50 million loss as his economic loss; multiply \nthat times two and that would be $100 million. But under this, he would \nbe limited to $250,000. Because that is the lesser of his $250,000 or \ntwo times his compensatory damages. So if he gets killed by a drunk \ndriver, then the drunk driver is limited under the now substituted \nproposal to $250,000.\n  Let us take the housewife, the elderly person, or the child in some \ninstances. You would think they would still be under the $250,000, but \nthat amount is greater. It is not lesser. And the language here says \n``is the lesser.'' So the housewife who has no economic loss, and no \nnoneconomic loss, it is still zero. For the elderly person who has no \neconomic loss, the cap is zero because it is the lesser. Because the \ncompensatory damages that they would suffer, in a death case, would be \nless than the $250,000, therefore the lesser amount, zero, would apply.\n  This amendment also, as it is written now affects automobile \naccidents almost every type of conceivable accident, not just products \nliability incidents. It fails to take into account how much insurance \nan individual carries on his automobile or how much liability insurance \nhe carries in his business. An individual may have $1 million or $5 \nmillion in liability insurance.\n But he still could have a net worth of less than $500,000. So he is \nprotected under this special rule. He is protected by this small \nbusiness exemption and the individual net worth figure, and his \ninsurance goes home free. Certainly, if he [[Page S6247]] had $1 \nmillion worth of insurance, as a lot of people carry on their various \nbusinesses or automobiles--many individuals carry umbrella policies to \ntry to protect them against that sort of thing--then that cap applies \nto him. But as to the housewife, the cap is zero or to the elderly the \ncap is zero.\n\n  So I just point these out to show how these caps would apply and what \ninequities would come about and would occur. These also would apply to \nany civil action. I wonder in regard to the Oklahoma City explosion if \nthere were attempts to bring suits against those that are eventually \ndetermined to be responsible for that bombing.\n  So I just want to point out that there are many problems with the way \nthis amendment is written. Certainly, if somebody carries insurance, \nthe amount of the insurance ought to be counted in calculating whether \nor not a cap goes into effect. The idea is to protect the small \nbusiness or the individual not worth more than $500,000. He might have \na total net worth of $50,000 or $100,000 or $150,000 and carry $100,000 \nworth of insurance or carry $1 million worth of insurance. But these do \nnot take into account his insurance that he carries on his car in the \nway it is written.\n  I mentioned one time in a previous speech about the situation of the \nhomeowner policy. Homeowner policies have for years and years now \ncarried comprehensive liability coverage. Comprehensive liability \ncoverage is very comprehensive, and basically it is written in a manner \nin which it has to exclude those things that are not covered. But \npractically all homeowners carry some type of comprehensive liability \ninsurance. Again, that insurance does not come into effect as the way \nthis substitute--the change of the language--took place from the DeWine \namendment. To me, that is another example of how this is being written \nfor the advantage of insurance companies. Therefore, I think that ought \nto be given very careful consideration.\n  There are numerous aspects of this bill that are unfair as they apply \nto real life situations. I think it is very unfair to local government. \nThere are some units of local government that are included under the \nDeWine amendment, if they have fewer than 25 full-time employees. But \nthe way the bill is written, a claimant is defined to include a \ngovernmental entity. This affects most local governments, anywhere from \na city that has about 25 employees. They usually define that as a city \nof anywhere from 10,000 and up with various types of departments: \nstreet department, fire department, police department and so on. I do \nnot know the exact number. But it includes in the claimant.\n  So, therefore, a city or county, State government or Federal \nGovernment which has a claim arising out of this, or property damage, \nmay have some claim in regard to subrogation rights under certain \ncircumstances and would also include the Federal Government. Therefore, \nthey come within the purview of this relative to all of the provisions \nthat are in this substitute, including the misuse and alteration of a \nproduct by any person, not the claimant himself. He might not have \nanything to do with it. But they are entitled to a reduction in regard \nto the percentage of fault in regard to misuse or alteration.\n  With regard to the statute of repose, many, many products are bought \nby these governmental entities. Then the bill, or substitute, includes \nthe Federal Government, the Army, the services. Most of our armed \nservices utilize, helicopter, trucks, automobiles, Jeeps, and other \nvehicles all of which are built for the test of time. Many of them \ntoday are far in excess in age of over 20 years. For example, many of \nthe types of helicopters that were used in the Vietnam war are still in \nuse today. But the statute of repose in effect applies to them.\n  The purpose of this bill is obviously to save money for business, \ncorporate America, and insurance companies. In this instance, who are \nthey going to save money from in regard to their defective product--\ngovernmental entities?\n  There are provisions relating to several liability which concern me. \nYou do not even have to be a party. You can prove it against a \nnondefendant in a suit. You prove several liability on that, and that \nincludes coemployees, which in most States you cannot sue the employer. \nIt has a provision that, if there is any fault to be allocated against \nthe coemployee and the employer, then that is the last item that you \nare to bring up in the priority of how you present your case before a \njury.\n  There are many other aspects of this that continue to be of concern, \nand I may mention some of these later as I go along. But there are \nnumerous provisions in this bill that are written in such a manner \nwhich are directed toward taking away rights of the injured party and \nbenefiting the wrongdoer.\n  The provision that says you cannot introduce gross negligence or any \npunitive damage elements in your main trial relative to compensation if \nyou have demanded punitive damages and there is a call for a bifurcated \nor separated trial is further evidence of the bill's basic unfairness. \nTo me that is a real serious situation. A claimant, for example, could \nnot show if a person was guilty of drunkenness. That would be a \npunitive damage element, and you could not show that in the trial in \nchief.\n  Mr. President, for the time being, I am going to yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 709 to Amendment No. 690\n\n(Purpose: To provide for a uniform product liability law and to provide \n              assurance of access to certain biomaterials)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on my behalf and on behalf of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller], I have just filed with the clerk \na second-degree amendment, and I ask that that second-degree amendment \nbe reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], for himself and \n     Mr. Rockefeller, proposes an amendment numbered 709.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I address these remarks to the President, \nand through him to my distinguished colleague from Alabama, who is \nopposed to this bill, and I hope to all Senators or to their staffs, \nbecause I hope and trust that this will be the final amendment with \nwhich we will deal on this bill, as we are to vote cloture on the \nCoverdell substitute at 4 o'clock. But as the proponents of product \nliability hope that Coverdell will be amended as per this proposal by \nSenator Rockefeller and myself, I believe I should outline the key \nchanges between the Coverdell proposal of last Friday and this one, \nbecause either before or after cloture it will be this amendment which \nbecomes the final product liability vehicle for the Senate to vote on.\n  We can discuss a bit later all of the details of the proposal. But as \nthe Senate will remember, last week what had started out to be a \nproduct liability bill was very considerably expanded, first by an \namendment by Senator Abraham from Michigan on relationships between \nlawyers and clients with respect to their fees and, second, by a \nproposal with respect to civil procedure 11 on frivolous lawsuits.\n  But more significantly, there was added an entirely new set of \nprovisions on medical malpractice--a new medical malpractice code--to \noverride, in many respects, the codes of the States. And, secondly, a \nbroadening amendment by the majority leader, Senator Dole, which \nextended the punitive damage rules contained in the product liability \nbill at that point to all civil litigation; and, of course, some change \nin the rules relating to punitive damages by the adoption of the Snowe \namendment which limited punitive damages in product liability cases and \nthen, by extension of the Dole amendment, to all [[Page S6248]] cases \nto an amount not to exceed twice the total of both noneconomic and \neconomic damages.\n  When on two occasions last Thursday cloture was rejected on that \nbroadened legal reform proposal, Senator Coverdell, with the help of \nthe majority leader, Senator Dole, put the Coverdell substitute on the \ndesk on Friday and filed a cloture motion on it. It returned the bill \npretty much to the status of a product liability bill, with one \nexception that I will speak to in a moment. It restored for all \npractical purposes the original Rockefeller-Gorton bill with the Snowe \nand DeWine changes to punitive damages.\n  The Snowe amendment, as I have already said, said that punitive \ndamages would be limited to an amount twice the amount of the total of \nall compensatory damages, economic, and noneconomic. The DeWine \namendment limited the amount of punitive damages to $250,000 in the \ncase of small businesses, those with fewer than 25 employees, and \nindividual defendants of modest means with a net worth of less than \n$500,000.\n  There was no Abraham amendment in the Coverdell substitute. There was \nno change in rule 11 in the Coverdell substitute. There were also no \nalternative dispute resolution provisions at all, as they had been \nstricken before the cloture vote by a Kyl amendment.\n  However, the Coverdell substitute did extend the punitive damage \nrules related to small businesses only--that is to say, the DeWine \namendment limiting punitive damages against small businesses or modest \nindividuals to $250,000--to all litigation. It retained that part of \nthe original Dole amendment.\n  After extensive negotiations Friday and over the weekend with my \npartner in this, Senator Rockefeller, and his negotiations with as many \nas 15 members of the Democratic Party who want some product liability \nreform but who have been, to a greater or lesser extent, opposed to any \ntheoretical limitations on the potential for punitive damages, we have \narrived at this Rockefeller-Gorton second-degree amendment.\n  How does this change the Coverdell proposal? Mr. President, it \nchanges it in about four ways.\n  First, we do return to a set of alternative dispute reasons or \nsections in the bill, but they are not the alternative dispute \nresolution provisions that were stricken by the Kyl amendment.\n  Senator Kyl opposed those for two reasons: First, because they \noverrode the alternative dispute rules of the various States; and, \nsecond, because they provided sanctions against defendants but no \ncomparable sanctions against plaintiffs when the proposed ADR solution \nwas more favorable to the winning party.\n  The new Rockefeller-Gorton proposal on alternative dispute \nresolutions simply set up a set of rules under which States will \nconduct their own alternative dispute resolution proceedings. We do not \noverride State rules on ADR, alternative dispute resolutions, except \nwith respect to the time with which they must be commenced. So the only \nplaces in which these rules would be more or less mandatory are in that \ntiny handful of States that have no ADR provisions whatsoever.\n  The second and most important change in this bill relates to the \nformula for the maximum level of punitive damages.\n  The long and short of it is, Mr. President, that there is no longer \nany theoretical maximum limit on punitive damages, which I think will \nsecure the support of many Senators of both parties who have wanted \nsome kind of reform in the product liability field but have not wanted \neven the limitations that were contained in the Snowe amendment. So let \nme describe what they are now.\n  In cases that go before juries, the Snowe amendment will continue to \nbe the case with the modifications proposed by Senator DeWine; that is \nto say, the jury will have an upward limit in its award of punitive \ndamages of twice the total of both economic and noneconomic damages.\n  Economic damages, Mr. President, are those for lost wages, for \nmedical expenses and the like, the full out of pocket losses of the \nclaimant. Noneconomic damages are those for pain and suffering which, \nalmost by definition, are more subjective in nature.\n  You will total up the sum of noneconomic and economic damages and \npunitive damages can be awarded or, of course, not awarded, but cannot \nbe awarded by the jury in an amount greater than twice the total of \nthose economic and noneconomic damages, except that if that total is \nless than $250,000, the jury can award up to $250,000. So the maximum \njury award will be $250,000 or twice the total of all compensatory \ndamages, whichever is higher.\n  The big change, Mr. President, however, is the fact that the judge in \nthe case may add to that award of punitive damages if the judge feels \nthat it is inadequate because of the egregious nature of the tort which \nled to the punitive damages in the first place. The judge may add to \nthat number and may do so in an unlimited fashion, there is no cap in \nthis Rockefeller-Gorton amendment, except that if a judge does do so--\nin other words, what we consider a requirement by the seventh \namendment--the defendant would have the right to a new trial to go back \nand start all over again.\n  There is one other major difference and that other major difference \nis a criticism which the Senator from Alabama made just a few moments \nago against the Coverdell amendment; that is, there is no attempt in \nthis bill to extend these punitive damage rules or limitations to cases \nother than product liability. In other words, that portion of the Dole \namendment of last week which was left in the Coverdell substitute is \nnow gone. This bill now applies to punitive damage cases only, as it \ndid when it was reported by the Commerce Committee.\n  The profound difference between the form in which it finds itself \nhere and the way in which it was reported from the Commerce Committee \nwith debate beginning 2 weeks ago today, if my memory serves me \ncorrectly, the profound difference is in respect to punitive damages. \nYou will remember that the original bill from the Commerce Committee \nhad a cap of $250,000 or three times economic damages only, whichever \nwas higher. The Snowe amendment effectively lifted that cap, to a \ncertain degree. This removes the cap entirely, but only when a judge \ndetermines that that limitation would be unreasonable and finds the \nactions of the defendant sufficiently egregious to warrant it.\n  Excuse me, there is one other matter, the DeWine amendment, which \ndoes set a separate rule for small business defendants and for \nindividual defendants whose assets do not exceed half a million \ndollars, designed to see a single case does not bankrupt.\n  So, Mr. President, I recognize that this is, oh, if not a complicated \nset of changes, still a complicated bill because the Senator from West \nVirginia and this Senator have collaborated on drafting this amendment \nbecause it reflects, I believe--and he can speak to it himself when he \ngets to the floor--because it reflects the views of the more than a \ndozen additional members of the Democratic Party who have been working \nwith Senator Rockefeller, and because it represents the considered \nviews of the majority leader at this point. I hope that we will be \npermitted to adopt this second-degree amendment before 4 o'clock, so \nthat it is absolutely clear exactly what the cloture vote is on.\n  I can say, Mr. President, that if that does not happen, if we have \nnot adopted the second-degree amendment by 4 o'clock, I can assure \nMembers that this amendment will be adopted postcloture before we reach \na vote on final passage on the bill. I speak in this case for myself, \nfor Senator Rockefeller and for the majority leader; in other words, I \nbelieve that among us, we can guarantee enough votes so that Members \ncan be assured that what they are bringing to a close is a debate on \nthis modified proposal, a proposal which does not have the caps on \npunitive damages which caused, I think, the great bulk of the debate on \nthis issue during the course of the last 2 weeks.\n  I can say rather bluntly, Mr. President, that I do not regard this as \na totally satisfactory response. I believe that the desire for \npredictability and for economic progress and opportunity in this \ncountry calls for limitations on punitive damages which this proposal \nlacks. [[Page S6249]] \n  So I have given up ideas which I think are quite important in \nconnection with this aspect of legal reform, but I have done so for the \ngreater good for accomplishing something, for doing something to bring \na greater degree of balance and fairness into this whole field than \nexists at the present time.\n  I expect during the course of the next hour that my friend, the \nSenator from West Virginia, will be here. I believe that the majority \nleader will ratify what I have said. I see the Senator from Alabama on \nhis feet, and I will let him either speak to it----\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I just wanted to ask if the Senator will yield and \nrespond to a couple questions.\n  Mr. GORTON. I will be delighted to do so.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Let me ask the Senator this. Is the Shelby amendment \nincluded?\n  Mr. GORTON. The single printed copy of the amendment that I had was \nsubmitted to the desk about 15 minutes ago, and it is in the process of \nbeing copied. I hope within the next 5 minutes we will have copies for \nevery Member.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. To answer my question, is the Shelby amendment included \nor not?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Shelby amendment is not included in it, I say to the \nSenator from Alabama. On consideration and on speaking to a wide number \nof other Members, we believe that the peculiar rules in Alabama with \nrespect to wrongful death decisions, that we were going to do one of \ntwo things: Either create a hole in this bill big enough to drive a \ntruck through or, alternatively, encourage the Alabama Legislature to \nchange its law to conform with those of other States.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Let me ask the Senator this. In regard to the DeWine \namendment, is it still the lesser of $250,000 or two times compensatory \nplus noncompensatory? Is it still the lesser?\n  Mr. GORTON. No, it is the greater of.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. What I have written out to me is the lesser of it. This \nwas handed out as some sort of brief statement.\n  Mr. GORTON. That is a very good question, I say to the Senator from \nAlabama. It is my intention to have it the greater. I know this says \nthe lesser. I will check and see and we will change it.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I think the distinguished Senator from Washington wishes \nto speak. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Excuse me, Mr. President, the Senator from Washington has \nthe floor.\n  Mr. President, can I have the attention of the Senator from Alabama?\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Yes.\n  Mr. GORTON. I need to say to the Senator from Alabama, I believe I \nmisspoke myself because there are two separate uses of the $250,000 \nfigure.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Parliamentary inquiry. What is the status of the floor \ndebate at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Washington has the \nfloor. The Gorton substitute, amendment No. 709, a second-degree \namendment is the pending business. He yielded the floor to the Senator \nfrom Alabama for a question and he is responding to that.\n  Mr. GORTON. There are two separate uses of the figure $250,000 in \nthis Gorton-Rockefeller second-degree amendment. The first is that in \nmost cases, in normal cases, the $250,000--rather the Snowe amendment \nsays that the maximum punitive damage award is twice the total of \neconomic and noneconomic damages. This adds to that, or $250,000, \nwhichever is greater.\n  Let us say in a case the total economic and noneconomic damages were \n$15,000. Twice that is $30,000. Under this amendment, nonetheless, the \njury could award $250,000 as being greater than $30,000.\n  In the case of the small business, however, the business with fewer \nthan 25 employees or the individual defendant with less than $500,000 \nin assets, $250,000 or twice economic and noneconomic damages, \nwhichever is the lesser is the ceiling.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to S. 565. The \nbill before the Senate claims to promote fairness, but I believe it is \nactually far from fair to consumers in my home State of Washington and \nthroughout this Nation.\n  I will leave it to the lawyers here to discuss the legal intricacies \nof the bill. However, I want to raise some very serious, commonsense \nproblems I have with this legislation.\n  First, I am deeply concerned about the bill's potential to \ndisproportionately harm women.\n  I am amazed that the bill before us treats a corporate executive's \nloss of salary as more important and deserving of compensation than the \nloss of such priceless assets as the ability to bear children, the \nsenses of sight and touch, the love of a parent or husband, and the \nability to move freely--unhindered by disability, disfigurement, or \nlifelong pain.\n  Certainly, this body must believe that raising a family, and having \nchildren should not be seen as unimportant in our legal system.\n  S. 565 would eliminate joint and several liability for noneconomic \nlosses. And, by making noneconomic damages more difficult to recover, \nit would impair a woman's ability to recover her full damage award.\n  It is unfair to require only the victims of noneconomic losses--such \nas a woman who has lost the ability to bear children, or a child \ndisabled in his youth--to bear the burden of pulling all the defendants \nwho caused them harm into court.\n  Joint and several liability allows injured victims to receive full \ncompensation, and leaves it to the guilty defendants to divide the \ndamages appropriately among themselves. It seems to me much fairer to \nplace this burden with the guilty parties, than with those who are \ninjured.\n  The singling out of noneconomic losses for adverse treatment will \nprevent women from being fully and fairly compensated. This is \nespecially objectionable because women have been the victims of many of \nour Nation's most severe drug and medical device disasters--DES, Dalkon \nshield and Copper-7 IUD's, and silicon breast implants are just three \nexamples.\n  I have met with many women from my home State of Washington whose \nlives have been devastated by these products. Their stories are tragic. \nTheir lives have been changed dramatically. They deserve a system of \nlaws that treats them fairly.\n  Mr. President, mandating a nationwide cap on punitive damages also \nseems ill-conceived in light of the number of dangerous products that \nhave been marketed primarily to women in this country.\n  S. 565 establishes a cap on punitive damages of three times a \nperson's economic injury or $250,000, whichever is greater.\n  We should not forget in our rush to make changes in this Congress \nthat the purpose of punitive damages is to deter bad behavior by making \nit impossible to calculate the risk of engaging in such behavior. Under \nS. 565's cap, I fear wrongdoers will find it more cost effective to \ncontinue marketing their dangerous products rather than removing them \nfrom the marketplace.\n  Even Senator Snowe's amendment to change the cap on punitive damages \nto two times compensatory damages does not remedy the unfairness of \nthis cap. Although, Senator Snowe's amendment includes noneconomic \ndamages within the formula for punitive damages, it does not \nacknowledge the important role of punitive damages in deterring and \npunishing outrageous misconduct.\n  Last year, Senator Kohl introduced an amendment to the product \nliability bill that, unfortunately, was not adopted. He sought to \nincorporate more fairness in this legislation by restricting the \nability of Federal courts to sanction secrecy in cases affecting public \nhealth and safety. I was proud to join him as a cosponsor of his \nantisecrecy amendment last year, and look forward to joining him again \nwhen he raises the issue in this Congress.\n  The settlement of the Stern case in 1985 by Dow Corning is a great \nexample of why such a change is necessary. As a result of a secret \nsettlement agreement, Dow Corning was able to hide its decade-old \nknowledge of the serious health problems its silicon breast implants \ncould cause for 6 additional years. [[Page S6250]] \n  The damaging information did not become public until the FDA launched \na breast cancer implant investigation in 1992. In the meantime, nearly \n10,000 women received breast implants every month, and countless women \nwere harmed.\n  Mr. President, this bill would not only disproportionately harm \nwomen, it would also deprive injured consumers in my home State of \nWashington of rights they currently have.\n  This is significant because Washington has one of the most \nconservative tort law schemes in the Nation. This bill would reduce the \nstatute of limitations in my home State of Washington from 3 years to 2 \nyears. Injured consumers would have less time in which to file lawsuits \nwhen they are harmed by dangerous products. The bill also would reduce \nthe number of situations in which product sellers can be held liable in \nWashington State. And the bill would abolish joint and several \nliability for noneconomic damages currently available in Washington \nwhen the injured person has not contributed to her injury.\n  As the Seattle Times editorialized just last week:\n\n       Recent polls show that the great majority of Americans \n     oppose restricting the right of individuals to hold \n     manufacturers and medical workers accountable for their \n     injurious act.\n       The National Conference of State Legislatures opposes \n     having Congress federalize an area of law that has been the \n     exclusive domain of state lawmakers for 200 years. And state \n     judges are coming out against federal statutes that would \n     tamper with century-old jurisprudence developed in state \n     courts.\n       The rush to impose federal rules on tort claims runs \n     counter to the Republican philosophy of giving more power to \n     the states. Surely, this is one area where state judges and \n     legislators are better suited to determine what's needed in \n     their communities.\n       The Washington Legislature, for example, passed a \n     comprehensive tort-reform law in 1986. Many other states have \n     done so in the past decade, Yet, voters in some places, such \n     as Arizona and Michigan, have turned down tort reform \n     initiatives. Why should Congress now force those voters to \n     live with legal changes they rejected at the polls. * * *\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the editorial printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                [From the Seattle Times, Apr. 30, 1995]\n\n                Federal Tort Reform Usurps States Rights\n\n       The only parties pushing for tort reform seems to be big \n     businesses, doctors intent on curbing medical malpractice \n     lawsuits, and lawmakers who receive financial contributions \n     from those lobbies.\n       Recent polls show that the great majority of Americans \n     oppose restricting the right of individuals to hold \n     manufacturers and medical workers accountable for their \n     injurious acts.\n       The National Conference of State Legislatures oppose having \n     Congress federalize an area of law that has been the \n     exclusive domain of state lawmakers for 200 years. And state \n     judges are coming out against federal statutes that would \n     tamper with century-old jurisprudence developed in state \n     courts.\n       The rush to impose federal rules on tort claims runs \n     counter to the Republican philosophy of giving more power to \n     the states. Surely, this is one area where state judges and \n     legislators are better suited to determine what's needed in \n     their communities.\n       The Washington Legislature, for example, passed a \n     comprehensive tort-reform law in 1986. Many other states have \n     done so in the past decade. Yet, voters in some places, such \n     as Arizona and Michigan, have turned down tort reform \n     initiatives. Why should Congress now force those voters to \n     live with legal changes they rejected at the polls?\n       The Senate product-liability bill, sponsored by Sen. Slade \n     Gorton, though more limited than the House legislation, is \n     still an unnecessary federal intrusion into state law.\n       The Senate bill does not include the House's onerous \n     ``loser pays'' rule that would prevent individuals and small \n     businesses from filing legitimate lawsuits for fear of having \n     to pay legal fees for the opposing side. But like the House \n     bill, it would cap punitive damages in dangerous-product \n     cases to $250,000 or three times the economic loss, whichever \n     is greater.\n       The change might make sense if it created a uniform rule \n     across all 50 states. But it won't. Washington law does not \n     allow punitive damage awards at all, so the proposed federal \n     standard won't apply here.\n       Other provisions of the Senate bill, however, will affect \n     Washington residents. One provision would make it harder for \n     people injured by defective products to collect for ``pain \n     and suffering.'' The bill places limits on lawsuits by \n     individuals, yet places no such limits on businesses.\n       Tort reform will not unclog the court systems. Though \n     businesses routinely complain about the litigation explosion, \n     tort claims account for only 9 percent of all civil suits, \n     and product-liability cases make up only 4 percent of tort \n     claims. The real problem is with companies suing each other--\n     a phenomenon completely unaddressed by the proposed \n     legislation.\n       But this isn't about clearing up court dockets or improving \n     the way judges and juries handle tort claims. It is about \n     reducing the financial exposure of manufacturers even when \n     there are serious proven injuries. If states believe \n     protection is needed for businesses, they are free to enact \n     tort reform without congressional interference.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have serious concerns about S. 565 and \ncannot support passage of this legislation. I urge my colleagues to \nthink long and hard about consumer health and safety, their individual \nState's autonomy in determining its own tort laws, as well as the \npotential impact of this bill on women.\n  I believe this bill tilts the scales of justice far too dramatically \nin favor of corporate profits. It is our job to do all we can to assure \nthe families we represent that the products they use are safe, and that \nthey will have recourse if they are harmed.\n  Mr. President, this bill hurts the little guy. Is it not time we all \nstepped back, and remembered the adage--there but for the grace of God \ngo I.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with my \ncolleague from Washington, Senator Murray, because I think that she, as \nshe usually does, puts her finger on real people.\n  Who are the real people that are going to be impacted by this change \nin this law that is before us? I hope that we do not vote for cloture. \nThe bill that would be before us, if cloture is voted, is a bill that I \nthink is very, very harmful to the American people. It is bad for \nconsumers; it is bad for a system that has produced the safest products \nin the world.\n  With all our problems, we still have the safest products because we \nhave a legal system out there that acts as a deterrent to those sitting \naround in the boardrooms deciding if they can write off a certain \nnumber of injuries and still make a profit.\n  I said the last time I debated this that this so-called reform is not \nso much about what will go on in the courtroom as what goes on in the \nboardroom, because it is in the boardroom--and we see it through \ndiscovery in other products cases--where the dollars and cents take \nhold. We have heard about automobile manufacturers who knowingly did \nnot spend enough time on safety and said, ``we can afford to have so \nmany explosions and we will still make money.'' We want to make sure \nthat that kind of callous attitude does not increase in America today. \nWe want the safest products.\n  My friend from Washington, Senator Murray--I have to be clear because \nwe have the two Senators from Washington on different sides of this--\nwas very clear on who could be hurt from this so-called reform. Again, \nI want to make the point here that it is the Republican Congress that \nkeeps on saying, ``We want the people of the States to handle \neverything. They are better at it.'' Yet, when it comes to product \nliability, for whatever reason, they want big brother and big sister \nand the U.S. Senate to dictate to every judge and jury in this country \nas to what damages ought to be. I find it almost amusing, if it were \nnot such a serious matter.\n  When it is convenient, you are for the local people, and when it is \nnot, do not let philosophy get in the way. I think Senator Thompson \nfrom Tennessee made that point very clearly, as a Republican Senator \nwho does not like this bill, asking if this goes against the grain of \nwhat he said Republicans are trying to do. I applaud him for that \ndirectness.\n  Now, we know that there are going to be some changes to the bill as \nit is before us in order to get enough votes to move forward. I was \nvery pleased to see that not even a majority of this Senate would stand \nup for that Dole amendment which would put a punitive damages cap on \nall civil cases.\n It was so far-reaching and so hurtful that Senator Dole could not even \nget 50, 51 votes. I think he got 47. That is very far from shutting off \ndebate.\n\n  I have to say that I believe the substitute bill will have some \nterrible consequences. Yes, it stripped out the [[Page S6251]] other \nareas of law, and they are just sticking to products.\n  I think there will be three consequences. By the way, I am not \nsuggesting that the people who support this bill want these \nconsequences. But I believe these are the consequences of the bill.\n  First, it will make our products less safe--less safe--for consumers.\n  Second, the formula for punitive damages is blatantly unfair. It \nfavors the wealthiest. Let me repeat that: The formula for punitive \ndamages is blatantly unfair and favors the wealthy. I will show a \nparticular case where we have a wealthy corporate executive suffer the \nsame injury from the same product as a homemaker and wait until we see \nthe difference in the award that they get. It will make your hair stand \non end, it is so unfair.\n  Third, there is another issue that has not yet been raised that deals \nwith the biomaterials section, which I believe will unduly restrict \nliability for suppliers of component parts. In other words, if a person \ngets hurt by a product that has a number of parts, what this would do \nis put some of the manufacturers of those parts off limits. They would \nhave no liability. It sets up a real problem, which I will go into.\n  Moving to consumer safety, one study done on tort law and its effect \non improved safety, reported that the State system of product liability \nsaves lives. The study estimates that 6,000 to 7,000 accidental deaths \nare prevented and as many as 3 million fewer injuries occur every year \nbecause of State product liability laws. We are talking here about \nchanging laws that studies have shown saves lives.\n  Why do we want to do that? Some 6,000 to 7,000 deaths are prevented \nevery year. Three million fewer injuries. Why do we want to change a \nsystem that helps this country? I do not believe the proponents of this \nlegislation want to see more deaths and injuries, but I believe that is \nan unintended consequence of this bill. The best products in the world, \nand we are messing with it over here, and I think it is wrong.\n  Now, I want to talk about fairness. The Dole bill, as it is before \nthe Senate, and I know that Senator Gorton plans to amend it so I will \naddress both, would do the following, and I will prove it by giving a \ncase and walking through a case.\n  There is a CEO who earns $400,000 a year. His auto engine explodes \nand he is unable to work for a year. Then, there is a 45-year-old \nfemale homemaker. She earns no wages. Same thing happens to her. Her \nauto engine explodes and she is unable to work for a year. The \nautomaker is found 100 percent liable by the jury.\n  For the CEO, the jury awards economic damages of $425,000--the \n$400,000 he makes plus $25,000 in medical bills; pain and suffering \ndamages of $25,000; he gets a compensatory damage award of $450,000. \nWhen we add that in with the punitive damages, which is two times \ncompensatory damages, he gets $1.35 million.\n  Identical injury, different results. Now we will look at the \nhomemaker, 45 years old--same age as the CEO. She earns no wages. Her \nauto engine explodes and she cannot work for a year. She is not working \nanyway. She has no wages. The automaker is found 100 percent liable. \nShe gets economic damages of $25,000. She has no lost wages. She has \n$25,000 in medical bills, pain and suffering of $25,000. Her total \ncompensatory damage award is $50,000.\n  Here is what happens to her: She gets compensatory damages of \n$50,000; punitive damages of $100,000, for a total award of $150,000. \nSame injury, different result.\n  This is the bill that is before the Senate. Senator Gorton wants to \nmake it better. I am glad he does. He is putting back the $250,000, so \nshe could get $250,000 in punitive damages if his amendment holds.\n  Now, giving them the benefit of the doubt, that they change it to \n$250,000, it is $1.35 million versus $300,000--same injury, different \nresult. This is what we are voting on.\n  I hate to say it, but it hurts women the most. Women still earn only \n71 cents for every $1 earned by a man. And women and minorities make up \nonly 5 percent of top management jobs. The consequences of that \ndisparity here will play out.\n  Who will get hurt? Middle-income people, women, the elderly, \nchildren. Who gets the highest award? A high-paid executive. Oh good. \nJust what we needed. Robin Hood in reverse. A court system that pays \nthis man $1.35 million and pays this woman $300,000 or $150,000, \ndepending on what we wind up with.\n  I have to say that anyone who votes for this is voting for something \nthat is blatantly unfair, blatantly unfair. We in the almighty Senate \nare putting our imprimatur on this kind of a plan.\n  Not this Senator. I hope we have enough Senators who stand up and be \ncounted for the little guy, as my colleague Senator Murray says, the \nlittle guy, the little gal. They do not have pinstripe suiters around \nhere. They do not get on the plane and come and knock on our door. But \nthe big guys can. And that is what this bill is for. Unfair, blatantly \nunfair.\n  The bottom line is that juries, who see these cases firsthand, can \nmake these decisions. That is the bottom line.\n  Now, I want to talk about medical devices. This is something that \nhits home again to a large number, particularly of women, although I \nmight say men who have pacemakers or other kinds of devices implanted \nshould be very concerned about the biomaterials section in this bill. \nSenator Heflin and I have discussed this, and we both agree that this \ntitle of the bill has not gotten enough attention.\n  As biomaterial suppliers, component parts manufacturers would be \nshielded from liability under this bill.\n  I am concerned that these provisions go too far. We know about \nsilicone gel implants. Would the people who make that silicone be \nimmunized under the bill? Will they be protected from lawsuits?\n  We know Dow Chemical set up a corporation just to make breast \nimplants, and they called it Dow Corning. They tried to protect Dow \nChemical from liability that way even though Dow Chemical made the \nchlorinated organic compounds, the solvents and the catalyst that went \ninto these implants.\n  The product of silicone breast implants, we know, is the subject of \nongoing litigation, but will this title in the bill that is still in \nthe bill mean that Dow Chemical could be dismissed from the case? What \nwould we be telling the women, infants, and children whose lives have \nbeen devastated by these leaking silicone implants? What would we be \ntelling them now that they are finally ending their battle with the \nchemical giants? Are they going to be told, ``Sorry, Congress just gave \nextraordinary protection to Dow, and you are left with no way to be \nmade whole?''\n I hope we will not vote cloture on this bill.\n\n  We are not sure if Dow would be shielded, but it is clear that \nmanufacturers will try for this absolute defense.\n  Mind you, in that section they will be shielded from liability for \ncomponent parts. And will these provisions encourage device \nmanufacturers to set up their own separate entities to manufacture all \nthe component parts and supply all the raw materials? Would these \nprovisions protect these shell corporations from reckless conduct or \neven deliberate harm?\n  I know small businesses are concerned about this, if they supply a \nsmall part. I am not talking about that situation. I am talking about a \nsituation that could occur in this bill with this title where a \ncorporation that makes, say, the silicone breast implant, sets up \nanother corporation at an arm's distance, legally, and that second \ncorporation supplies all of the component parts. If the product is \nunsafe and the company that makes the product goes out of business, no \none can go after the company that makes component parts because--guess \nwhy--they are shielded under this bill.\n  Let us not mess with the product liability laws in this land.\n  In the beginning we heard a lot of talk: Oh, there is a crisis, so \nmany cases. There have been about 350 cases in 25 years where there \nhave been punitive damage awards. I think we have proven that on this \nfloor over and over again. The leadership on this, from my side of the \naisle, has been magnificent. Senator Hollings and Senator Heflin have \nbeen on their feet, hour after hour after hour, peeling away the talk \nand [[Page S6252]] looking at the facts of what this bill will do.\n  I think the American people are starting to get scared, because just \nbecause somebody says ``legal reform'' does not mean necessarily that \nis what it is. This is not reform, this is basically the Federal \nGovernment taking over and tying the hands of judges and juries, tying \ntheir hands, so if someone is disfigured or has brain damage or cannot \nhave a child and suffers mightily and his or her family suffers \nmightily, that judge and that jury cannot decide the dollar number to \nput on that case.\n  We know there are enough checks and balances in the system today. We \ndo not need to take over this area of the law. I hope we will stand \nstrong today, again, against cloture. Just keep in mind in this \naccident: Identical injuries, different results--a homemaker getting a \nmaximum of $150,000; with the Gorton amendment getting a maximum of \n$300,000; and the same identical injury, a CEO making $400,000 comes \naway with $1.35 million.\n  To me that is a denial of equal protection under the law. But, yet, \nthat is the kind of law we are looking at.\n  Let us beat back this other attempt at cloture. Let us protect the \nAmerican people from this bill. It is not necessary and it will be very \nhurtful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, this bill ought to be determined kill \nthem, not injure them. Certainly in regard to the DeWine small business \namendment, where it is the lesser of $250,000 or two times noneconomic \nand economic damages, you can have instances in death cases where the \nlimit would be zero because there are no economic damages and because \ndeath occurs immediately, without pain and suffering, or with a minimum \namount of time in which one goes through that.\n  But the whole issue comes down to the role of the Senate. To me, the \nrole of the Senate in regards to this is extremely important. Some of \nmy colleagues, I am afraid, do not realize there will be a conference \nand the House of Representatives bill, which was passed, which has a \n15-year statute of repose, which does not even have the Snowe \namendment, which I consider not to be--an improvement--does not have it \nin it. And when you go to conference what is going to happen? I do not \nsee the Speaker of the House of Representatives is going to be outdone \nby my good friend, Senator Rockefeller. I think he will come out with a \nHouse version of the bill.\n  So, regardless of what substitute to a substitute might be offered \nhere, if cloture were to be agreed to then what do you do? You go to \nconference and what do you come out with? You come out with the \nGingrich bill.\n  The role of the Senate is to be a deliberative body. We are not a \nbody that votes aye and nay, and the majority rules in the event a \nperson desires to take advantage of the rules. You have the cloture \nsituation. So what is really at stake here is an issue in regards to \nthe role of the Senate and the rules of the Senate.\n  Do not be under any illusion to the effect that what you might adopt \nas a substitute to a substitute is going to be the final bill that goes \nto the President. It goes to conference. I think we ought to realize \nvery clearly what the situation will be.\n  There are just so many bugs in this. One of the lawyers on Senator \nHollings staff mentioned to me you can organize subsidiary corporations \nor you can keep down the major corporations to fewer than 25 employees. \nThere are so many maneuvers and various activities that can occur \nrelative to that, that opens the market wide open pertaining to this.\n  So I have already spoken. Senator Hollings is here, and others that \nwill probably want to speak. I am not going to speak long on this, but \nthis is basically saying that life in the United States, if a wrongdoer \nkills you, it is worth no more than $250,000, particularly in the event \nthat you fall under the small business protection. I say this is flawed \nwith great unfairness throughout. I have outlined it before.\n  But the main issue to be considered in this cloture vote that is \nupcoming is the role of the Senate. Do not forget there is going to be \na conference. Do not forget who is going to control the conference. I \nhope my colleagues bear that in mind as they consider their cloture \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Senator from Alabama is right on \ntarget. I remember my children years ago used to listen to a little \nSaturday morning radio show, ``Big John and Sparky,'' and they had \nlittle squeaky Sparky with the voice:\n\n     All the way through your life,\n     Make this your goal,\n     Keep your eye on the doughnut,\n     And not on the hole.\n\n  Keeping our eyes on the doughnut and trying to avoid falling into \nholes that these folks have on course, all we need do is go to the \ncontract, the contract and what is really intended.\n  The theme of the contract is that Government is not the solution; \nGovernment is the problem. The Government is the enemy. Abolish the \nDepartment of Education; abolish the Department of Commerce; abolish \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development; abolish the Department \nof Energy; get rid of public TV; get rid of private TV; abolish the \nFederal Communications Commission; abolish the Endowment for the Arts \non the one hand, the Environmental Protection Agency on the other hand. \nAnd then, as concerns fundamental rights, we come to trial by jury. \nThis is none other than an assault on the seventh amendment, the \nfundamental right given under our Government for a jury of your peers.\n  I could quote Patrick Henry, James Madison, Thomas Jefferson. We \ncould go right on down the line, up to Chief Justice Rehnquist --and we \nwill have time to do that--very, very interesting observations, right \nup to date. But you can see it in that contract, the English rule.\n  Now, you have to watch them closely to get the eye on the doughnut. \nIt is not in there--tort reform--but it is over in H.R. 988, a separate \nbill. In that separate bill, yes, they have the English rule on the one \nhand, and interestingly, Mr. President, they sneaked in what the \nSenator from West Virginia said. Now we do not have that in our bill \nthis year; that is, the settlement process whereby if you are offered a \nsettlement and decline, and you get a verdict of less than that \nsettlement, you have to pay the attorney's fees on the other side. That \nis the English rule of intimidation, and they have it in this separate \nbill. You can bet your boots they will get it in the conference.\n  Yes, they constantly are reminding us that we lost. You are right. \nTom Foley is not over there; Newt Gingrich is over there. I have seen \nhim whip these young Congressmen from my own State into line. It was \nsaid conscientiously we did not have the money for a tax cut. We did \nnot have it; no. They are opposed to a tax cut because we just did not \nhave it. What we needed to do was pay the bill--on and on. But we are \nnow in the bottom nine game. You either come out for practice or you do \nnot play on the team.\n  Speaker Gingrich is a hard taskmaster. You can bet your boots when \nthis bill or any bill gets there, it needs little fixes at the end \nbefore cloture votes. Essentially, they are that; just momentary fixes \nto get just a title or anything that would relate to it over to the \nHouse side, for they know what they can get by an overwhelming Gingrich \nvote over there, and bring it back where the poor majority leader has \nto mimic because he is all wound up in a Presidential race.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Kansas does not want to do away \nwith punitive damages in all civil cases. But anything you can do, I \ncan do better. So you do one. So I up the ante and go to all civil \ncases. We will find out who is for who, and who ought to be the \nRepublican nominee, and we will just out-Republican each other. And you \nhave all kinds of mischief afoot if you do not keep your eye on the \ndoughnut and watch it very, very closely.\n  They never would apply this to the manufacturers. I just allude here \nto one case because they keep talking about punitive damages. It is the \ncase of TXO Production Corp. verses Reliance Resources, decided just 2 \nyears ago by whom? The U.S. Supreme Court, on punitive damages. What \nwere the actual damages? They were $19,000. What were the punitive \ndamages? They [[Page S6253]] were $10 million. You get all of this \nanecdotal nonsense. They come out in individual injury cases like it is \nso outrageous, that the poor lady who was burned with the McDonald's \ncoffee was just outrageous, not this kind of percentage. They go to \n1,000 percent. This is way more than that $19,000 actual, $10 million \npunitive, the most recent case on punitive damages before the U.S. \nSupreme Court in a civil action.\n  So there it is. They do not believe in it because they will not apply \nthat to themselves. They have the unmitigated gall to come around \nsaying they represent the consumers, but they will not let it apply to \nthe manufacturers. Come on. Come on. Do not give me that this bill is \nfor consumers, and the consumer and the injured party are not getting \nenough money. Do not come with respect to the trial lawyers that bought \nthe crowd. Come on. Everybody is in the contribution business. I would \nlike to get some more from the trial lawyers. I would like to get more \nfrom the chamber of commerce. You do not think that the chamber of \ncommerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Conference \nBoard, the Business Round Table, and the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses, yes, they have PAC's. And they give away more \nmoney. But you cannot find it quoted in the newspaper.\n  They not only give more in contributions but they have a better \ncurrency. They have organized PAC's and organized focus. I see them in \nmy elections. They come to you, and they say, ``How about it, now? We \nwant you to help us on this bill.'' I am getting the letters. I am \ngetting the calls now. The people in a position of objecting to this \nheinous measure here, the Consumer Federation of America, the leading \none, they do not have a PAC. They do not give you a nickel.\n  Do you think you get calls at election time? The NFIB and the small \nbusiness people out there are calling, the chamber of commerce is \ncalling, big boys from the Business Round Table and the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers in my State are calling. The Consumer \nFederation of America does not have a PAC. Public Citizen does not have \na PAC. The Association of State Legislatures does not have a PAC. The \nAssociation of State Supreme Court Justices does not have a PAC. The \nAttorneys General of the United States does not have a PAC. The \nAmerican Bar Association does not have a PAC. Let us clear the air here \nand find out who is who, and who is supporting who.\n  This insulting reference that this bill ought to just whip right on \nthrough, they do not believe in it themselves, or their own \nmanufacturers that they represent. They do not believe it by way of \ncontractors, because the contractors are sending everything back to the \npeople. This bill is to take it away, take it away from the people; \nbring it to the Washington bureaucrats on the one hand, and take away \nthe rights of trial by jury on the other. You do not just outright \nabolish the seventh amendment. You nibble at it. You nibble at it. You \njust erode it like a rat just gnawing at it gradually. Yes, get rid of \npunitive damages. Get rid of joint and several liability. Limit the \nevidence that goes in. Get a bifurcated--a divided--proof of actual and \nproof of punitive. Go right on down the list. Give them the English \nrule.\n  Well, that is not 170 years ago. I had this quote from none other \nthan the British National Council for Civil Liberties, what they had to \nsay about the systematic erosion of the English jury system between \n1967 and 1978:\n\n       The jury system has been badly undermined in recent years. \n     The prosecution in criminal cases, otherwise than civil \n     cases, need no longer convince 12 jurors. They can convict on \n     the views of only 10.\n\n  They state that to come in now, to allow a check on the jurors' \nbackgrounds, while the defense is not even allowed to know his \noccupation, the prosecution can secretly bet your all for their \npolitical loyalty, yet the defense is not even allowed to ask jurors \nquestions in open court. The principle of randomness has been used to \ncut down defense challenges but leave prosecution challenges unlimited. \nA large percentage of the criminal work has been removed from the jury \nto the magistrates court. And on the civil side, we find that less than \n2 percent of the civil cases are tried before a jury.\n  I had a lawyer friend that went to the American Bar Association \nseminars and interviewed the prospective jurors at random. He kept \ngoing through, trying to find any that would serve. He could not find \nanybody in London. He went on up to Scotland. They just did not serve \non juries. You have to be a member of the elite. So do not come and \ngive me the English rule.\n  I know about the unstudied mind of the ideas of the Magna Carta, King \nJohn at Runnymede. I remember, I say to the Senator, when we went over \non one of these tourist trips to London. They got on the bus one \nafternoon and stopped at Runnymede, and my friend is as talkative as I \nam. He said, ``Now, what happened here?'' The bus driver called back \nand said, ``King John, the signing of the Magna Carta.'' And he said, \n``Well, when was that?'' The driver shouted back, ``1215.'' He looked \nat his watch. He said, ``Florence, damn it, you are 2 hours late again. \nWe are behind time.''\n  That is about how much this crowd knows about Runnymede and the Magna \nCarta. They do not know about the English system. They do not know it \nis totally eroded. The fundamental right of trial by jury here is being \nassaulted.\n  Let us look at that so-called English rule that they have on another \nbill that they hope to put in in conference. I will never forget one \ncase I had before I got elected to the Senate. In fact, it was settled \nafter I got out of the law practice and in the Senate. My law partner \nand I were the only two who tried the case. There was a firm of 12 \nlawyers in Charleston. There was a firm of 17 lawyers in Columbia. \nThere were some from New York that came in. They had 20-some lawyers. \nThey had to get three tables. And just he and I had an injured party \nand we were trying the case.\n  I think back to the fact that particular case never even received an \noffer of any kind of settlement until it went out to the jury, never a \nred cent of offer. It was one of the most injurious cases--injuries, \nclear-cut proof--that I had ever been engaged in. I never could \nunderstand why they would not make us an offer.\n  But you have these insurance company lawyers who will say, ``We don't \nsettle cases.'' They think that is macho and everything else. \nTranslated, we factor it in the cost of litigation. So we have no idea \nof settling. So what happens? You intimidate the injured party.\n  Look at a case we had last year in the district court under Judge \nRoss Anderson with General Motors. General Motors was represented by \nfour of the biggest law firms. They had a grand total from those firms \nof 1,000 lawyers. Present in the courtroom representing General Motors \nwas the former Attorney General Griffin Bell, the former Attorney \nGeneral William Barr, the former Solicitor General, Kenneth Starr--you \ncan go down the list--some of the most well known attorneys that you \nwill ever find. They have to be paid $400 to $500 an hour.\n  You would think that the plaintiff in that case would not bring the \ncase when they have General Motors and all of those lawyers and \neverything else and have to run the risk of not prevailing and getting \nall 12 jurors. They talk about consumers and everything else. They are \ntrying inch by inch, yard by yard to get rid of the trial by jury. It \nhas happened in England and they would like to have it happen right now \nin the United States of America.\n  That cannot be emphasized too much as it now concerns what we have \nbefore us because we have to look at the doughnut and not the hole. We \nlook at all these little ramifications. They will put in any and every \nkind of amendment that you can possibly think of just to fix this vote \nor fix that vote or change the vote we had last week, knowing all along \nthat they have kept their word and the amendment is clear.\n  Then when they get on the other side, they will be telling the truth \nagain when they say, ``Well, you know, Speaker Gingrich took over and \nthis is his bill, and that is all we could get the House Members to \nvote for and that is what we got in the conference report.'' And then \nyou really have all of this thing piled on you. That is why some of us \nin this Chamber struggle so because we can see exactly what is \noccurring. Everything that was reprehensible in these previous bills by \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia, in [[Page S6254]] the \nHouse bills, and considered in separate bills over there and everything \nelse of that kind, is being and is going to be reinserted. And so when \nthey get to conference, just like this bill started as a product \nliability measure; it soon became a malpractice, a medical malpractice \nmeasure. And just as soon as it became a medical malpractice measure, \nthe next thing you look around it was all civil cases that it would \napply to. And that is exactly how the conference would go if we did \nexactly as they wish, and that is let us get this little change here \nand that little change there, and we will all be happy.\n  We all have been working hard. We have been on this for several \nyears. And the plea is to what you committed. Laws are really passed at \ncampaign time. Too often it is that these eminent organizations come--\nthe National Federation of Independent Businesses--for one thing only, \nyour vote on their bill. Necessarily you want their support. In fact, \nthey give you a little award, a little statue, and that is the NFIB \naward. And it is the treasure board award that you get from that small \nbusiness group.\n  They have thousands of mailouts. I can tell you, trial lawyers do not \nhave any thousands of mailouts. The others, as well, including consumer \norganizations, do not mail out anything. They just do not have any \nPAC's at the supreme courts of the 50 States. The American Bar \nAssociation, which opposes this measure, does not have any PAC. They do \nnot have political mailouts. But the NFIB mails out; the chamber of \ncommerce has its meetings as well as the mailouts. The National \nAssociation of Manufacturers is strong in my State. They come around, \nand they have not only mailouts but special manufacturers come around \nand meet with you and everything else of that kind.\n  So if you are not studied as to the individual rights of injured \nparties, you may not realize how horrendous this legislation is, and \nthe detrimental impact it will have on our Nation's civil justice \nsystem. What's worse is that it is based on a total distorted record. \nThey lament and lament about punitive damages. However, according to \nthe hearing record, the amount of all of product liability punitive \ndamage awards in the last 30 years adds up to only a fraction of the $3 \nbillion Pennzoil versus Texaco verdict, or the $3 billion verdict in \nthe Exxon Valdez case.\n  Are they really concerned about consumers? Are they really concerned \nabout the injured parties?\n  Mr. President, of all civil filings, torts represent 9 percent, and \nof those tort filings only 4 percent of the 9 percent, are product \nliability cases--.38--thirty-eight one-hundredths--percent. And this \nthing has taken 2 weeks now. To do what? To take it away from the \nStates that have had jurisdiction for 230 years, the English law and \neverything else of that kind, or the regular statutes, the regular \nburdens of proof, the greater weight of the preponderance of evidence, \nall 12 jurors have to find it and on appeal and everything, injured \nparty on a contingent basis. It has worked. The States themselves over \nthe past 15 years have reformed their laws, and there is no question in \nmy mind that they are handling it and handling it well. My judges tell \nme so, particularly my Republican judges that we have confirmed that I \nam proud of because I voted for their confirmation.\n  But I wanted to make absolutely sure that we did not have that \nproblem. I am assured of it. But they are trying now to get their foot \nin the door, and the ultimate goal is to restrict, if not totally \neliminate, as they have in England, trial by jury.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The absence of a quorum has been \nnoted. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today is a very important day for a number \nof people on this Senate floor. It is V-E Day. May 8, 1945, was a very \nimportant day. We have a V-E Day resolution that I think deserves a \nrollcall. I hope my colleagues would agree that, immediately after the \ncloture vote, we would have a vote on the V-E Day resolution.\n  I send that resolution to the desk and ask that it be read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 115) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate that America's World War II veterans and their \n     families are deserving of this nation's respect and \n     appreciation on the 50th anniversary of V-E Day.\n  The resolution is as follows:\n\n       Whereas on May 7, 1945 in Reims, France, the German High \n     Command signed the document of surrender, surrendering all \n     air, land and sea forces unconditionally to the Allies;\n       Whereas President Harry S Truman proclaimed May 8, 1945 to \n     be V-E Day:\n       Whereas May 8, 1995 is the 50th Anniversary of that \n     proclamation:\n       Whereas, the courage and sacrifice of the American fighting \n     men and women who served with distinction to save the world \n     from tyranny and aggression should always be remembered; Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Senate joins with a \n     grateful nation in expressing our respect and appreciation to \n     the men and women who served in World War II, and their \n     families. Further, we remember and pay tribute to those \n     Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice and gave their life \n     for their country.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, it is a very brief resolution. I have taken \nthe liberty of adding World War II veterans as cosponsors. If some do \nnot want to--I have Senator Exon, Senator Hollings, Senator Glenn, \nSenator Inouye, Senator Stevens, Senator Helms--I think there are a \ncouple of others--Senator Heflin.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Senator Thurmond.\n  Mr. DOLE. Senator Thurmond. I will furnish those names at the desk.\n  So I hope, unless there is some objection on the other side, that \nthat vote could follow immediately the vote on cloture.\n[[Page S6255]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We have no objection.\n  Mr. DOLE. So, Mr. President, the yeas and nays are automatic on the \ncloture vote. Let me ask for the yeas and nays on the V-E Day \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/08/senate-section/article/S6254-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--NOMINATION OF JOHN M. DEUTCH, TO BE \n                    DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Finally, Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask \nunanimous consent that immediately following the cloture vote and the \nvote on the V-E Day resolution, notwithstanding rule XXII, \nthe Senate go into executive session to consider the nomination of John \nDeutch, to be Director of the CIA, and that it be considered under the \nfollowing time agreement: 2 hours equally divided between the chairman \nand vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, or their designees; \nthat following the conclusion, or yielding back of time, the nomination \nbe set aside; and that the Senate then return to legislative session, \nwith the vote to occur on the nomination at 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday, May \n9, 1995.\n  I believe this has been cleared on both sides. We will have debate \nthis afternoon and vote tomorrow morning. I know the President very \nmuch wants to have this nomination addressed. We are prepared to do \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me suggest the absence of a quorum \nunless someone would like to speak. There are 8 minutes before the \ncloture vote occurs. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/08/senate-section/article/S6255-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          COMMONSENSE PRODUCT LIABIL- ITY AND LEGAL REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, again, I want to emphasize what this vote \nis about. It is, of course, about product liability, but it is also the \nrole of the Senate in the legislative process.\n  The House has passed a bill that contains vast differences from what \nis proposed in the substitute and what is proposed in the substitute to \nthe substitute.\n  If we do not take advantage of our rules and do not exercise the role \nthat is intended for the Senate to be a deliberative body, and if we \nvote cloture, there is no question what will happen is it will go back \nto the House and I do not think there is much question as to what will \nhappen.\n  The Speaker of the House will control the conference, and this is \ngoing to be a bill regardless of what fixes may have been attempted in \nthe Senate, the version that is going to come out of the conference is \ngoing to be the version of the Speaker of the House of Representatives. \nIt comes back here and people say, ``Well, you can exercise your rules \nand you can have extended debate at that time.'' But we all know what \nhappens on conferences. Their reports come back, people are anxious to \nget away, and they are arranged at a time to come up where you are in a \nsituation, and we end up, with very rare exceptions, approving \nconference reports.\n  So I say to my colleagues, this is a vote not only on product \nliability but is a vote on the role of the Senate on this bill and \nother bills that may be coming down in the future.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture. It is very important \nthat they bear in mind the fact that whatever is being proposed here \ndoes not mean that that is going to be the final version. The final \nversion, I think, in the judgment of anybody who can see beyond the \nimmediate scene and can see around the corner will be that it will be \nin conference and it will come out as a Gingrich version of this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I simply want to announce to the friends \nand supporters of this bill that this will not be a meaningful cloture \nvote. In the haste to draft the Gorton-Rockefeller amendment, a couple \nof drafting errors were made that can only be removed at this point by \nunanimous consent. Unanimous consent, as the body knows, was not \ngranted.\n  Second, because the Gorton-Rockefeller amendment is in the nature of \na substitute, had cloture been granted and had the Gorton-Rockefeller \namendment been adopted, which it would have been, it would have cut off \nall other postcloture amendments from the opponents to the bill and \nthat, too, could only have been waived by unanimous consent.\n  So I say to Members who have worked on this compromise, they can vote \nfor or against cloture at will. I do not expect cloture to be invoked. \nI cannot under these circumstances vote for cloture myself. The bill by \ntomorrow morning will be in proper form, both for its own passage and \nto allow postcloture amendments. Tomorrow morning's cloture vote will \nbe the significant one on this bill and not the vote that is being \ntaken this evening.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Unanimous consent was not granted. \nTherefore, Senator Rockefeller and I both voted no on cloture this time \naround and regard this last vote as essentially meaningless.\n  Between now and the adjournment of the Senate today, we will \nintroduce a revised second-degree amendment with the majority leader \nthat will reflect our precise views and the agreement that has been \nmade with the consent of, I think, a very substantial majority of the \nMembers, as to the final form of this bill.\n  Tomorrow we will vote on cloture once again.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Biomaterials Access \n     Assurance Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) each year millions of citizens of the United States \n     depend on the availability of lifesaving or life-enhancing \n     medical devices, many of which are permanently implantable \n     within the human body;\n       (2) a continued supply of raw materials and component parts \n     is necessary for the invention, development, improvement, and \n     maintenance of the supply of the devices;\n       (3) most of the medical devices are made with raw materials \n     and component parts that--\n       (A) are not designed or manufactured specifically for use \n     in medical devices; and\n       (B) come in contact with internal human \n     tissue; [[Page S6260]] \n       (4) the raw materials and component parts also are used in \n     a variety of nonmedical products;\n       (5) because small quantities of the raw materials and \n     component parts are used for medical devices, sales of raw \n     materials and component parts for medical devices constitute \n     an extremely small portion of the overall market for the raw \n     materials and medical devices;\n       (6) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 301 et seq.), manufacturers of medical devices are \n     required to demonstrate that the medical devices are safe and \n     effective, including demonstrating that the products are \n     properly designed and have adequate warnings or instructions;\n       (7) notwithstanding the fact that raw materials and \n     component parts suppliers do not design, produce, or test a \n     final medical device, the suppliers have been the subject of \n     actions alleging inadequate--\n       (A) design and testing of medical devices manufactured with \n     materials or parts supplied by the suppliers; or\n       (B) warnings related to the use of such medical devices;\n       (8) even though suppliers of raw materials and component \n     parts have very rarely been held liable in such actions, such \n     suppliers have ceased supplying certain raw materials and \n     component parts for use in medical devices because the costs \n     associated with litigation in order to ensure a favorable \n     judgment for the suppliers far exceeds the total potential \n     sales revenues from sales by such suppliers to the medical \n     device industry;\n       (9) unless alternate sources of supply can be found, the \n     unavailability of raw materials and component parts for \n     medical devices will lead to unavailability of lifesaving and \n     life-enhancing medical devices;\n       (10) because other suppliers of the raw materials and \n     component parts in foreign nations are refusing to sell raw \n     materials or component parts for use in manufacturing certain \n     medical devices in the United States, the prospects for \n     development of new sources of supply for the full range of \n     threatened raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices are remote;\n       (11) it is unlikely that the small market for such raw \n     materials and component parts in the United States could \n     support the large investment needed to develop new suppliers \n     of such raw materials and component parts;\n       (12) attempts to develop such new suppliers would raise the \n     cost of medical devices;\n       (13) courts that have considered the duties of the \n     suppliers of the raw materials and component parts have \n     generally found that the suppliers do not have a duty--\n       (A) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of a raw \n     material or component part in a medical device; and\n       (B) to warn consumers concerning the safety and \n     effectiveness of a medical device;\n       (14) attempts to impose the duties referred to in \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (13) on suppliers of \n     the raw materials and component parts would cause more harm \n     than good by driving the suppliers to cease supplying \n     manufacturers of medical devices; and\n       (15) in order to safeguard the availability of a wide \n     variety of lifesaving and life-enhancing medical devices, \n     immediate action is needed--\n       (A) to clarify the permissible bases of liability for \n     suppliers of raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices; and\n       (B) to provide expeditious procedures to dispose of \n     unwarranted suits against the suppliers in such manner as to \n     minimize litigation costs.\n\n     SEC. 203.

The \n     discovery conducted pursuant to this subparagraph shall be \n     limited to issues that are directly relevant to--\n       (i) the pending motion to dismiss; or\n       (ii) the jurisdiction of the court.\n       (3) Affidavits relating status of defendant.-- \n     [[Page S6262]] \n       (A) In general.--Except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) \n     of subparagraph (B), the court shall consider a defendant to \n     be a biomaterials supplier who is not subject to an action \n     for harm to a claimant caused by an implant, other than an \n     action relating to liability for a violation of contractual \n     requirements or specifications described in subsection (d).\n       (B) Responses to motion to dismiss.--The court shall grant \n     a motion to dismiss any action that asserts liability of the \n     defendant under subsection (b) or (c) of section 205 on the \n     grounds that the defendant is not a manufacturer subject to \n     such section 205(b) or seller subject to section 205(c), \n     unless the claimant submits a valid affidavit that \n     demonstrates that--\n       (i) with respect to a motion to dismiss contending the \n     defendant is not a manufacturer, the defendant meets the \n     applicable requirements for liability as a manufacturer under \n     section 205(b);

APPLICABILITY.\n\n       This title shall apply to all civil actions covered under \n     this title that are commenced on or after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, including any such action with respect \n     to which the harm asserted in the action or the conduct that \n     caused the harm occurred before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask unanimous consent to speak on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, there was, to put it mildly, a certain amount of \nconfusion as to what just happened in the last hour or so. I found \nmyself on the telephone advising distinguished Senators with years of \nexperience to vote for what we just voted on and then 5 minutes later \nto vote against it.\n  That is not my normal custom in trying to be wise on these matters. \nBut the fact is that, as the Senator from Washington indicated, there \nwere procedural and technical writing problems, and the technical \nwriting problems in the bill in fact were not addressed properly and \nwere not done properly, and they have to be done properly. But make no \nmistake about it; the news of the day is not that we just had a vote on \nwhich some people thought they were going to vote no and they turned \nout voting yes or vice versa. The news of the day is that the Senator \nfrom Washington and the Senator from West Virginia have reached a very \ngood agreement on a final version of the product liability reform that \nwe think reflects the will and the objectives of Senators on both sides \nof the aisle.\n  That is where the activity and the time today has, in fact, been \nspent. It was not spent on, unfortunately, wrapping up the last-moment \ndetails. The 4:20 cloture vote really caught me by surprise. But the \ntime today has been spent between the Senator from Washington and the \nSenator from West Virginia, the Senator from West Virginia consulting \nwith many Senators on my side of the aisle, and the staff of the \nSenator from Washington and the staff of the Senator from West Virginia \nworking together.\n  We have reached agreement. That is the news. We have a product \nliability reform bill which we are now convinced will pass. After 13 \nyears of attempting to do this on the part of some, only 9 years on my \npart, this is remarkable, remarkable news. I believe that we are in a \nposition now to win product liability reform.\n  Again, I want to apologize to my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle that it has taken us so long to get here, and then, when we got \nhere, at the very last moment, we had this technical writing problem \nwhich we, in fact, had to get right and we had not gotten it right, \nbecause things were rushed. We are now in the process of doing that. It \nis very easy. It will be done before the end of the day and we will \nhave the cloture motion tomorrow, which is already ordered, and on we \ngo.\n  Then, presumably, those who oppose the bill will try to amend it. But \nthe Senator from Washington and the majority leader, Senator Dole, and \nI are convinced that we can put aside those amendments, spend the 20 \nhours or whatever it is that we have remaining in debate, and then go \nahead and pass the bill.\n  This is the story of the legislative process. It is not always \nbeautiful and today was an example of it.\n  We have on the other hand, I have to say, listened and debated and \nanalyzed and argued every aspect of product liability and the best ways \nto do reform. It is very controversial. It is something that people \nhave strong feelings on and it is hard to come to an agreement on, \nwhich makes even more formidable, it seems to me, the agreement which \nhas been reached that affects the majority leader, the Senator from the \nState of Washington, the junior Senator from West Virginia, and \nSenators that the junior Senator from West Virginia has been working \nwith on our side who favor product liability reform.\n  I think the bill that has been put together, which is now agreed on, \ndeserves support, and I think it will get support. I think, in fact, it \nwill win rather broad support.\n  So I want the Presiding Officer to be of good cheer and look forward \nto tomorrow and maybe a day or two after that.\n  We have made real changes to the section that deals with punitive \ndamages in a way which I think will ease concerns, particularly on my \nside of the aisle. We have made changes that directly address the \nconcerns of a number of Senators.\n  I know that this substitute remains balanced, represents real reform, \nand will solve some problems that have [[Page S6263]] been crying out \nfor solution for all of these years. I hope the process will untangle \nitself. I am now confident it will--there was a moment there when we \nwere not sure, but I think it will and I think it has--and we will then \nbe able to give Senators on both sides a chance to vote for good \nproduct liability reform.\n  This is not a product of the Contract With America. It is not a \nproduct of the Democratic Party. It is a product of people who want \nreform on both sides of the aisle, working within the Senate, within \nour ways, within our beliefs to achieve compromise. That is the way the \nSenate works.\n  After all, the President of the United States will have to sign the \nbill and put it into law. This is what has always struck me when people \nsay that the conference process will ruin everything. I have never felt \nthat. I know the Senator from Washington agrees with me on that, and I \nsuspect the majority leader does. I know I do. Because the President, \nif he does not want to sign the bill, if it does not meet his criteria, \nwhich he has laid out to us, will simply veto it and that will be that. \nSo there is a discipline that works there in conference process, which \nis good.\n  I remind my colleagues and the leadership in the other body of what I \nhave just said. We have tended to push aside expansionism here and \nfocus on product liability reform. We do that in the agreement between \nthe Senator from Washington and the Senator from West Virginia. So, let \nthe leadership on the other side understand that we are firm in our \nresolution, and that the President is, too. He will not sign anything \nother than what stands within his parameters of acceptability.\n  So I conclude simply by saying that the sidebar of the day was that \nthere was a certain amount of confusion during the process at the end. \nBut the story is that the two sides have reached agreement--Democrats \nwho favor reform and Republicans who favor reform. I have been through \nthis reform with most of my colleagues on my side and have met with a \nvery good reaction, and I assume the same is true on the Republican \nside.\n  So, Mr. President, I simply wanted to say that, because there was a \ncertain amount of confusion, but that pales in comparison to the good \nnews of the agreement.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/08/senate-section/article/S6256-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6263-S6274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n   NOMINATION OF JOHN M.

The debate on the nomination is limited to 2 \nhours, equally divided and controlled by the Senator from Pennsylvania \nand the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there have been requests only from \nSenator Moynihan, who was on the floor, for 15 minutes and from Senator \nHutchison for 10 minutes, in addition to statements which will be made \nby the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, the vice chairman, Senator \nKerrey, and a brief opening statement which I will make. So, in the \nevent that there are any other Senators who wish to be heard on the \nsubject, they ought to come to the floor now or at least let the \nmanagers know of their interest in speaking.\n  Mr. President, the nomination of John M. Deutch to be Director of \nCentral Intelligence was reported to the Senate last week, pursuant to \na unanimous vote in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence with a \nrecommendation that he be confirmed. It was a unanimous vote, 17 to 0.\n  The committee held hearings on April 26 and then proceeded to that \nvote last week on May 3. There is a need to move expeditiously, as I \nsee it, to have a strong Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n  In consideration of Mr. John Deutch to be Director, we took up a wide \nvariety of issues. We examined Mr. Deutch's background and \nqualifications. He has an extraordinary academic record. He has an \nextraordinary professional record. He has been a distinguished \nprofessor at MIT. He has been the head of the department there. He has \nbeen the provost there. He has worked in the Energy Department. He has \nworked in the Department of Defense. He currently serves as the Deputy \nSecretary of the Department of Defense.\n  It is my thought, and I believe with the concurrence of the committee \nmembers, that he has the kind of strength to take over the management \nas Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n  He comes to this position at a time of substantial difficulty. He \ncomes to this position at a time when the agency is with substantial \nproblems of morale, in the wake of the Aldrich Ames case, where the \nagency had a spy within the Central Intelligence Agency which they \ncould not ferret out and eliminate themselves; hardly a recommendation \nfor an agency which is charged with worldwide responsibility to gather \nintelligence.\n  There is, in my opinion, Mr. President, the need for intelligence \ngathering worldwide for the security of the United States.\n  During the course of the hearings, we explored with Mr. Deutch \nwhether there ought to be a reorganization. His confirmation hearings \ncame in the wake of extraordinary success by the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation on the Oklahoma City bombing case. We explored with Mr. \nDeutch whether perhaps the Federal Bureau of Investigation ought to \ntake over on worldwide intelligence gathering. That has been suggested \nby some.\n  It would be an extraordinary change for the United States to do that. \nIt would vest enormous authority in the FBI, perhaps more than is wise, \nin a country where we prize limitations on authority, where we prize \nseparation of power.\n  The FBI, though, is right now engaged in very extensive operations \noverseas in work on terrorism as it relates at least to prosecution, \nwork on drug trafficking, work on organized crime, many of those \nactivities being undertaken by the CIA as well. But those were some of \nthe subjects discussed.\n  I expressed at the hearings considerable concern about the Director \nof CIA being a member of the President's Cabinet. We have had the \nexperience with Cabinet officers before of the CIA, specifically \nWilliam Casey, where we had problems on Iran-Contra, and there has been \na concern that the policymakers ought to be separated from the \nintelligence gatherers to the extent there not be the motivation to \nshade intelligence gathering to support policy, to sort of cook the \nevidence.\n  The Iran-Contra Joint Committee made a strong recommendation against \nthat kind of a concern and that kind of activity. But in the final \nanalysis, there is a need to move ahead with the confirmation of the \nCIA Director, so that it is my judgment, and I think the judgment of \nothers on the committee who were concerned about having the Director in \nthe Cabinet, that we should not hold up his confirmation in that \nrespect.\n  Mr. Deutch has addressed that question very forcefully and directly, \nsaying that he will be very mindful of those policy considerations and \nwill comport himself so that intelligence gathering is separate from \nany matters of policy.\n  Mr. Deutch has made a very forceful statement on taking strong \naction. If there are those in the CIA, as there were in the Aldrich \nAmes case, who failed to act when there were lots of indications that \nAldrich Ames was in fact not doing his job--when he was intoxicated on \nthe job, when there were unexplained visits to foreign embassies, where \nhe lost his files--Mr. Deutch was emphatic that if anybody was in a \nposition of supervision over another Aldrich Ames and did not take \nforceful action, that person would be fired peremptorily. \n[[Page S6264]] \n  Then the question was raised with Mr. Deutch about somebody who was \nin a supervisory capacity who did not know but should have known, and \nMr. Deutch answered very forcefully that that person would be fired.\n  Mr. President, there are many people in the CIA who have long, \ndistinguished careers, and there are many able men and women in the \nAgency who can carry on. It is my hope, I think the hope of the \ncommittee, that the morale can be restored by a very firm and forceful \nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n  We have recently had hearings on Guatemala which, again, were \ndisturbing, with the Deputy Director of the CIA conceding flatly that \nthe CIA failed in its duty to notify both the House Intelligence \nCommittee and the Senate Intelligence Committee of what was going on in \nGuatemala.\n  In sum and substance, Mr. President, it is my view, and I think the \nview of the committee, that John Deutch is well qualified to take on a \nvery, very tough job at this time.\n  Mr. President, the nomination of John M. Deutch to be Director of \nCentral Intelligence was reported to the Senate last week pursuant to a \nunanimous vote of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, with a \nrecommendation that he be confirmed. On behalf of myself and Senator \nKerrey, in our respective capacities as chairman and vice chairman of \nthe committee, we urge the Senate to act favorably on this nomination.\n  The committee made a complete and thorough inquiry of the nominee's \nqualifications as well as his views on issues of mutual concern, and \nconcluded that he is qualified by both experience and temperament to \nhold this sensitive and critical position.\n  The Senate has moved expeditiously in this important nomination. \nNevertheless, the intelligence community has been with out a confirmed \ndirector since last December--a delay that is particularly costly when \nthe community so urgently needs a strong sense of direction, of \nmission, and of management. It is a critical time for the intelligence \ncommunity. If Mr. Deutch is confirmed as DCI, he will come to the job \nat a time of exceptional promise and peril.\n  The peril is clear. It is now conventional wisdom that the euphoria \nwhich erupted after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of \nthe Soviet Empire was premature. While nostalgia for the balance of \nterror between the United States and the Soviet Union is not in order, \nit is apparent that the post-cold-war world is not any less dangerous \nor unstale--as the bombing in Oklahoma City, the World Trade Center \nbombing, and the gas attack in the Tokyo subway have made shattering \nclear. Global threats from international terrorism and narcotics \nsmuggling, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and \nexpanding organized crime networks present the intelligence community \nwith targets far more dispersed and complicated than the traditional \nfocus on Soviet military power. The role and the priorities of the \nintelligence community in the Government's efforts against these and \nother threats--efforts which now have significant diplomatic, economic, \nand law enforcement implications--is very much in need of redefinition \nand reordering.\n  Moreover, a series of revelations have illuminated problems in the \nintelligence community that have severely damaged morale among the rank \nand file and have eroded the public confidence and trust that is \nessential for an intelligence apparatus operating in a democracy. From \nthe abuses of power evident in Iran-Contra to the incompetence and lack \nof accountability that characterized the Aldrich Ames debacle, to \ncharges of widespread sex discrimination, to the latest questions about \npolicies and practices that resulted in, at the very least, an \nimpression of culpability in murders in Central America, there is the \nsense of an intelligence bureaucracy that is not only incapable of \nmeeting our national security needs but, instead, presents a recurring \nthreat to our Nation's credibility and legitimacy overseas through its \nfrequent missteps, miscalculation, and mismanagement.\n  The American people are looking for a Director of Central \nIntelligence who will provide strong leadership, accountability, and a \nclearly defined mission. And therein lies the promise. There is growing \nsupport within the intelligence community, the Congress, and the public \nfor significant change in the way we conduct intelligence. The end of \nthe bipolar superpower conflict that dominated the cold war provides \nnew opportunities to build coalitions and achieve consensus on \ninternational threats. And thoughtful application of continuing \nadvances in technology can greatly enhance our efficiency and \neffectiveness.\n  This committee, along with the House Permanent Select Committee on\n   Intelligence and a congressionally mandated commission chaired by \nLes Aspin and Warren Rudman, will be taking a hard look at the \nintelligence community--what it's mission should be in the post-cold-\nwar world and how it should be organized to accomplish that mission--\nwith an eye to legislation early next year. This is an opportunity to \nlook forward; to begin a new era and establish a new American model for \nforeign intelligence.\n\n  A key issue for that future involves the nature of the office that \nMr. Deutch seeks to assume. The DCI must have the ear and the trust of \nthe President. Yet he cannot allow his role as confidante in any way to \ncorrupt the intelligence process or his role as intelligence advisor. \nThis is the concern that underlies questions about the wisdom of giving \nthe DCI Cabinet status.\n  We have examined the nominee's views on a number of critical issues \nfacing the intelligence community, sought and obtained assurances that \nhis position as a member of the Cabinet would not politicize \nintelligence, and examined the potential impact of his earlier \ninvolvement with issues like the Persian Gulf syndrome on his new \nappointment. Our objective has been to determine whether he can assert \nthe strong and independent leadership that is so desperately needed. I \nhave concluded that he can and I urge his prompt confirmation by the \nSenate.\n  In the remainder of my remarks, I will summarize for my colleagues \nthe nature of the committee's inquiry, and highlight the key features \nof Mr. Deutch's testimony to the committee.\n\n\n                      Summary of committee inquiry\n\n  As you know, the former DCI, James Woolsey, resigned last December. \nIn February, the administration announced that it planned to nominate \nretired Air Force General Michael C.P. Carns to replace Woolsey as DCI. \nOne month later, General Carns withdrew his name, citing immigration \nissues. The administration then turned to Deputy Secretary of Defense \nDeutch. In announcing on March 11, 1995, the decision to nominate Mr. \nDeutch as DCI, the White House also announced that the post would be \nelevated to Cabinet-level status. Mr. Deutch's name was formally \nsubmitted to the committee on March 29, 1995.\n  The committee required Mr. Deutch to submit sworn answers to its \nstandard questionnaire for Presidential appointees, setting forth his \nbackground and financial situations. These were submitted to the \ncommittee on March 30, 1995.\n  On April 5, 1995, the committee received a letter from the Director \nof the Office of Government Ethics transmitting a copy of the financial \ndisclosure statement submitted by Mr. Deutch. The Director advised the \ncommittee that is disclosed no real or potential conflict-of-interest.\n  The chairman and vice chairman also reviewed the FBI investigation \ndone for the White House on Mr. Deutch.\n  The committee held a confirmation hearing on Mr. Deutch on April 26, \n1995, at which time the nominee was questioned on a variety of topics. \nSubsequently, written questions were submitted to the nominee for \nadditional responses.\n  Based upon this examination, the committee reported the nomination to \nthe Senate on May 3, 1995, by a unanimous vote, with a recommendation \nthat Mr. Deutch be confirmed.\n\n\n                        highlights of testimony\n\n              views on the role of the dci--cabinet status\n\n  In his opening remarks to the committee, Mr. Deutch described as the \nprimary duty of the DCI ``to provide objective, unvarnished assessments \nabout issues involving foreign events to the President and other senior \npolicymakers.''\n He emphasized that ``with the exception of policy that bears on \n[[Page S6265]] the Intelligence Community, the Director of Central \nIntelligence should have no foreign policy making role.'' Speaking \ndirectly to the issue of making the DCI a member of the Cabinet, the \nnominee explained his belief that the President intended this to signal \nthe importance he places on intelligence and the confidence the \nPresident has in Mr. Deutch. The nominee went on to present his view \nthat this status is important to ensure that the DCI will be present \nwhen policy issues are deliberated so that he can present objective \nassessments of alternative courses of action and take away from those \nmeetings a better understanding of policymaker needs.\n\n  I questioned Mr. Deutch on this issue in meetings prior to the \nconfirmation hearing and again, for the record, in open session. I \nnoted my own view that if you are in the Cabinet, you are much more \nlikely to get involved in making policy than if you are not in the \nCabinet. I referred to the congressional report on Iran-Contra and \nSecretary Shultz's assertion, as reported therein, that the President \nwas getting faulty intelligence about terrorism because there was a \nproblem in keeping intelligence separated from policy. The committee \nconcluded in that report that ``the gathering, analysis, and recording \nof intelligence should be done in a way that there can be no question \nthat the conclusions are driven by the actual facts rather than by what \na policy advocate hopes these facts will be.''\n  This need to separate policymaking from intelligence gathering and \nanalysis is reflected in the statute defining the National Security \nCouncil. The National Security Act of 1947 sets forth the members of \nthe NSC and then designates others, including the DCI and the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as officials who are not members but may \nattend and participate as the President directs. It is my strong sense \nthat this is the appropriate status for the DCI with respect to the \nCabinet as well.\n  Mr. Deutch has assured the committee that he will hold to the proper \nstandard of conduct and that he would ``not allow policy to influence \nintelligence judgements and, not allow intelligence to interfere in the \npolicy process.''\n  I believe that Mr. Deutch has the best of intentions in this regard \nand that he is certainly capable of recognizing the line between \nintelligence and policy. The committee will be sensitive to any \nindication that this standard is not being met. Ultimately, however, \nthe makeup of the Cabinet is a Presidential prerogative and is not \nstatutorily defined.\n  Given the delay already experienced in naming Mr. Deutch, and given \nhis strong qualifications in every other regard, I do not think this \nissue should stand in the way of his confirmation by the Senate.\n  With respect to DCI authorities, the nominee noted in response to \nquestions at the hearing and those submitted later for the record, that \nin his view, the DCI could more effectively manage the intelligence \ncommunity if he or she had budget execution authority over key segments \nof the community.\n  In further response to questions, Mr. Deutch agreed that this was a \npropitious time to consider establishing a Director of National \nIntelligence--who would serve at the pleasure of the President and \nmanage the entire intelligence community--and a separate head of the \nCIA who would have a 10-year tenure.\n\n\n           views on the mission of the intelligence community\n\n  Mr. Deutch's prepared statement outlined some of the significant \ndangers to our national security today: Regional conflicts; the spread \nof weapons of mass destruction; international terrorism, international \ncrime, international drug trafficking, and their interconnection; \ninstability in the former Soviet Union; and China--as a threat to its \nneighbors and supplier of missiles.\n  He then described four principal purposes to which the intelligence \ncommunity [IC] should direct its efforts: First, assuring that the \nPresident and other\n policymakers have the best information available before making \ndecision; second, support to military operations; third, addressing \ninternational terrorism, crime, and drugs, particularly improving \ninteragency coordination and support to law enforcement; and fourth, \ncounterintelligence [CI] that rigorously adheres to high security \nstandards, accords priority to defensive CI and counterespionage, and \nincludes full and early cooperation within the CI community.\n\n  He emphasized that the national priorities for intelligence \ncollection established by the recent Presidential Decision Directive \nneed to be implemented.\n\n\n                          views on management\n\n  I applaud Mr. Deutch for his unusually candid and forthright opening \nstatement. In it, he outlined for the committee the significant actions \nhe would take immediately upon confirmation to begin the process of \nchange that is so long overdue in the intelligence community, or \n``IC.'' First, he indicated he would bring in several new people to \nfill upper management positions. In doing so, he will emphasize joint \noperations of the IC agencies because ``we can no longer afford \nredundant capabilities in several different agencies.'' Second, he \nplans to review and encourage changes in the culture and operation of \nthe Directorate of Operations. Third, he will move to consolidate the \nmanagement of all imagery collection, analysis, and distribution in a \nmanner similar to the NSA's for signals intelligence. Fourth, he wants \nto manage military and intelligence satellite acquisition in a more \nintegrated way. Fifth, he will put in place a planning process for \nmeeting the priorities and goals established by the Presidential \nDecision Directive. Sixth, what he described as his most important \nchallenge is to ``improve the management--and thereby the morale--of \nthe dedicated men and women who make up the IC.''\n\n\n                            response to ames\n\n  The issue of management is particularly critical in the wake of Ames. \nI questioned Mr. Deutch on how he would ensure that he knew what was \ngoing on within the CIA so that he could exert the proper management. I \ncited former Director Gates' admission that by 1987, he had only been \nadvised of about 4 or 5 compromises of U.S. agents, at a time when \nthere were in fact 40 or more compromised operations. Director Gates \ncomplained that ``nobody bothered to share that information with Judge \nWebster, my predecessor, or with me,'' when Gates was his Deputy.\n  I wanted to know what action Mr. Deutch would take if he identified a \nperson that had a pretty good idea that Aldrich Ames was a mole but \nfailed to pass that information on up the chain of command to the \nDirector. Mr. Deutch said he would terminate that individual. Moreover, \nwhen asked about reports that the supervisor of Ames, who knew that \nAmes had an alcohol dependency and had observed the negative \nconsequences of this dependency, had not only failed to fire Ames, but \nhad, instead, written a highly complimentary review of his performance, \nMr. Deutch indicated that supervisor should be fired. When questioned \nfurther, he conceded that if the supervisor's supervisor should have \nknown about this improper conduct, that supervisor should also be \nfired.\n  The key in this exchange, as emphasized by the nominee, is the notion \nof accountability. It is a sense of accountability that was absent \nunder the last DCI and that is an essential ingredient of any plan to \nrevitalize our foreign intelligence apparatus.\n  Mr. Deutch has told the committee that if confirmed, he will review \nthe Ames case and will consider the committee's report on Ames in \nconnection with any personnel action affecting the individuals \ninvolved.\n                    views on congressional oversight\n\n  On the issue of congressional oversight, Mr. Deutch emphasized in his \nopening statement that he could not accomplish the significant change \nthat is needed in the intelligence community without the strong support \nof Congress. ``I consider you my board of directors'', he said. ``I \nrealize this means I must keep you fully and currently informed about \nthe activities for which I would be responsible--both the good news and \nthe bad news. I understand that I am accountable to you, and I expect \nyou to hold me to a high standard of performance.''\n  Mr. Deutch conceded, when questioned, that, while he could not \nimagine it happening, if the President ever told him not to inform the \ncommittee he, Mr. Deutch, would ``go happily back to \nMassachusetts.'' [[Page S6266]] \n  Moreover, the nominee assured the committee that he interprets the \nrequirement for timely notification of a covert action finding, in the \nabsence of prior notification, to mean within 48 hours. Specifically, \nMr. Deutch said, ``I think that in all situations there should be prior \nnotification. There may be remote instances where that is not possible, \nin a very, very tiny percentages of the cases. Then 48-hours is what I \nsee as the measure of timely notification.''\n\n\n                     commitments for prompt action\n\n  At the conclusion of the hearing, I asked for, and received, a \ncommitment from Mr. Deutch to report back to the committee as promptly \nas possible if confirmed--preferably within 30 days of confirmation--\nregarding several issues of particular importance;\n  First, report on any needed changes to DCI authorities;\n  Second, improving the intelligence community's fulfillment of its \nobligation to keep Congress fully and currently informed;\n  Third, the need for reorganization within the intelligence community;\n  Fourth, changes in personnel;\n  Fifth, proposal for how to achieve downsizing in a way which creates \nheadroom, weeds out poor performers, and leaves the intelligence \ncommunity with the mix of skills required to accomplish its mission;\n  Sixth, intelligence reassessment of the possibility that U.S. forces \nwere exposed to chemical or biological agents during Desert Storm;\n  Seventh, actions taken in response to events in Guatemala; and\n  Eighth, improving coordination with law enforcement.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  The foregoing summarizes only the highlights of the record before the \ncommittee, which is, of course, available to all Members in its \nentirety at the Intelligence Committee.\n  Based upon the nominee's statements to the committee, however, his \nrecord of distinguished service and the absence of any disqualifying \ninformation concerning him, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \nvoted to report his nomination to the Senate with a recommendation that \nhe be confirmed by the full Senate as Director of Central Intelligence.\n  Mr. President, before yielding the floor, I want to commend my \ndistinguished vice chairman, Senator Kerrey, for his outstanding work \ngenerally with the committee and on this nomination.\n  The only other speaker who is to come to the floor on our side is \nSenator Hutchison, who has an allotment of 10 minutes, but I think \nthere will be more time within the unanimous-consent agreement if \nSenator Hutchison wants more time. Or if any other Republican Senators \nwish to partake in the discussion, they can take time on our side.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise in enthusiastic support of the \nnomination of John M. Deutch to be Director of Central Intelligence. \nWhile I cannot predict a length in time that he will be in service to \nhis country in this capacity, I can predict with confidence, should he \nbe confirmed, he will turn out to be one of the most effective and \ninfluential DCI's in the history of this Agency.\n  The President of the United States, with John Deutch, is making a \nstatement that he intends to send a man to take charge of Langley \nduring what is obviously one of the most tumultuous periods ever \nexperienced by Central Intelligence. The Aldrich Ames case and recent \nGuatemala revelations portray a troubled corporate culture at CIA.\n  In addition, many question whether the intelligence community has \ncome to grips with the post-cold-war world and whether new collection \nmethods and technologies are required to target the new threats that \nhave emerged.\n  The twin threats of international and domestic terrorism lead many to \nquestion the intelligence community's proper role in supporting law \nenforcement. The very structure of the community is in question, as a \njoint Presidential-congressional commission and several private study \ngroups ask whether intelligence is necessary at all.\n  Mr. President, we have been watching, once again, another 50-year \ncelebration in the last couple of days. This time the celebration is \nthe 50th anniversary of the day that victory in Europe was declared \nover Nazi forces. That victory is being celebrated in part because we \nare also celebrating the fact that over the last 47 or so years, we \nhave avoided, with significant efforts, a third world war. For a 75-\nyear period, roughly from 1914, when the guns of August started World \nWar I, until the fall of 1989 when the Berlin Wall itself collapsed and \nEastern Europe began to liberate itself, during that 75-year period, it \nis, I believe, accurate to say we experienced the bloodiest 75 years in \nthe history of mankind.\n  During that 75-year period, Mr. President, many things occurred, \nincluding the institution of a policy that had the United States of \nAmerica leading an effort against a clearly identified enemy, and the \ncelebration that takes place this year is not just a celebration of a \nvictory over that enemy, but a sense that we have survived, as a human \npeople, the forecast that we may annihilate ourselves through the use \nof nuclear weapons. It is a remarkable victory, and I dare not on this \nfloor take a great deal of time describing it, but it is a profound \nchange that the new Director of Central Intelligence must factor in as \nthat individual, hopefully John Deutch, begins to shape the agencies \nunder his control to meet the new challenges that this country faces.\n  You might expect that only somebody who was a glutton for punishment \nwould willingly volunteer and walk into the set of problems that John \nDeutch will face. But I can assure my colleagues, as the distinguished \nchairman of the Committee has already said, that John Deutch knows \nbetter than this. He knows, as many of us on the Intelligence Committee \nknow, we have a superb intelligence instrument in this country staffed \nby brave and intelligent people who take risks every single day and \nmake sacrifices for their country. They provide the President, the \nmilitary, the Cabinet, our diplomats and intelligence analysts a \ncapability no other country can rival: the capability to know most \nabout threats to our country's freedom and independence, and threats to \nthe lives and livelihoods of Americans.\n  Unlike the domestic agencies, our intelligence professionals cannot \nbrag about their competence. To brag would lose the all-important \nsource of information. So they are generally silent, but they are of \nimmense value. They need guidance, they need leadership, they need a \nvisionary who can help focus their talent on the Nation's pressing \nneeds, and John Deutch is the person to do it.\n Adm. Bill Studeman has rendered a vital service as Acting Director. He \nhas kept a complex enterprise on track during a difficult period, and \nthe Nation owes him its thanks. He would be the first to agree that the \nintelligence community needs a Presidentially appointed, senatorially \nconfirmed director.\n\n  Even if John Deutch's service in the Defense Department were his own \naccomplishment, he would be a strong candidate to be DCI. Most \nintelligence funding is in defense, the military continues to be the \nleading customer for intelligence, and his knowledge of defense \nintelligence is matched by few in and out of our Government.\n  But another part of John Deutch's resume appeals to me. John Deutch \nis a scientist of national renown and a distinguished science \nprofessor. Technical intelligence collection is mainly a science \nproblem. The scientific decision of which system to buy or develop to \nbest collect against a certain threat is typically made by lawyers \nadvised by scientists. In this administration, however, the scientists \nhave come to the fore. I, for one, feel very comfortable knowing that \nthe scientific judgment of Bill Perry is making the ultimate \nacquisition decisions in defense, and I will feel equal comfort with \nJohn Deutch's scientific judgment on intelligence acquisitions. The \nfact that he is a teacher and can explain these complex systems to \nthose of us nonscientists, who are charged with intelligence oversight, \nis that much better for the American people.\n  We will get the benefit of Dr. Deutch's scientific expertise not a \nmoment too soon. New threats, new collection priorities, and a rapidly \nchanging collection environment mean that [[Page S6267]] we cannot \nstand pat on our collection technologies. Just to maintain the edge we \nhave now, we must fund research and development on new technologies and \nmake hard decisions about which road we will go down.\n  We also have to maintain the health of our intelligence industrial \nbase, the private companies that produce these remarkable systems. \nThere are uniquely talented people working for these companies, \nengineers and technicians who turn the requirements statement into \nreality. If we do not keep these people at work in profitable \nundertakings, the Government will never be able to afford new systems. \nThat is why Senator Warner and I, last year, urged the administration \nto permit U.S. companies to sell 1-meter space imagery and imaging \nequipment. We did not want to see remote sensing, a technology in which \nwe lead the world, go the way of the space launch. We also wanted \nAmerica to dominate this growing industry. The administration saw it \nthe same way, and John Deutch is a firm supporter of the administration \npolicy. He knows that our industrial base is our true national \ntreasure, and he will continue to watch over its health.\n  Intelligence technology routinely saves American lives, but we should \nbe alert to opportunities to make it useful to Americans in other ways. \nFor example, the National Information Display Laboratory in Princeton, \nNJ, noticed that the technology that helped imagery analysts understand \nimages better could also be helpful to radiologists scanning a \nmammogram for early signs of breast cancer. NIDL teamed with \nMassachusetts General Hospital to adapt the technology, and the outcome \ncould be as many as 15,000 American lives saved each year.\n  Other opportunities abound for the dual-use intelligence technology. \nWe have just begun to make public use of space images and other \nintelligence collected during the cold war. The declassification \nprocess has begun and we must push the process until we can fairly say \nthat intelligence technology serves not just a handful of \ndecisionmakers in Washington but the 250 million decisionmakers across \nour country.\n  Mr. President, when I was a young man operating in the U.S. Navy Seal \nteam, we had a piece of advice we tried to follow all of the time, \nwhich was that unless you had a need to know something, you did not \npress the bet and try to acquire it. We did not disseminate \nintelligence to people who did not have a need to know. Mr. President, \nthere are 250 million citizens of the United States of America who need \nto know increasingly a set of complex facts in order to make decisions \nabout our foreign policy, in order to make decisions about our domestic \npolicy, in order to make decisions about all sorts of things that are \nincreasingly confusing our citizens.\n  Democracy cannot function unless citizens make the effort to \nunderstand those complexities and come to the table at election time \nand come to the table when it is time to influence their Senator or \nRepresentative or President with all of the facts and information.\n  The Director of Central Intelligence is the President's national \nintelligence officer. John Deutch's Government background is in \ndefense, and his testimony before the Committee made clear that he \nunderstands the priority of intelligence support to the military. But \nhe also understands the role of national intelligence, and he \nunderstands that not every problem facing the country is a military \nproblem. He is aware, for example, of the intelligence community's \ncontributions against international terrorism, against drug \ntrafficking, against illegal trade practices. He knows how important \nintelligence is to this administration's international economic \ndecisionmaking, and he knows that warning the President about the \neconomic crisis in Mexico last year was at least as important as \nwarning about a military crisis in some less important region of the \nworld. It is ironic that, with the end of the cold war, the Director of \nCentral Intelligence has a broader national charter than ever. It is an \nirony which John Deutch understands.\n  The intelligence community includes much more than the CIA. The \nNational Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, FBI, and the \nState Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research all play their \nlargely unique roles. But no question, CIA, unfortunately, lately has \nbeen at the center of controversy and likely will continue to be. At \nleast initially, the heart of John Deutch's task will be to make the \nCIA more efficient and accountable to the American people. I am greatly \nencouraged, as the chairman indicated earlier, by his testimony on the \nsense of accountability and responsibility that he intends to bring to \nCIA's Directorate of Operations. I have visited CIA officers in the \nfield, and I know the high quality of the people John Deutch will lead. \nThese are clear-headed, positive, enthusiastic Americans. The current \nsenior managers should get credit for recruiting and training and \nmotivating a fine crop of younger officers. Now it is time, as Mr. \nDeutch put it in his own testimony, for the seniors to let the younger \nofficers take the reins.\n  As they take over, they must recruit and retain more women and \nminorities, and they must be alert to gender discrimination in \nassignments and promotions. The Directorate of Operations has never \nbeen an easy place for women to get a fair opportunity to make their \nmark. Not only is gender discrimination illegal, it is also stupid \nbecause it denies the American people the brain power of more than 50 \npercent of our people. It also creates resentments which can \ndangerously weaken the agency. I have heard all the excuses for \ndiscrimination, and none of them wash. I am confident that John Deutch \nwill not permit it.\n  CIA's human intelligence activities, which consist mainly in getting \nforeigners to secretly provide information, will always take place in \nthe shadows. Human sources will have to be protected, so the activities \nwill not be able to be publicly discussed. But CIA, no less than any \nother agency of Government, must operate in accordance with American \nlaw and American values. One purpose of congressional oversight of \nintelligence is to ensure that this is so. Oversight cannot work if CIA \ndoes not inform Congress, or answer Congress' questions. Failure to \npromptly inform is one of the most troubling aspects of both the Ames \ncase and the Guatemala case. Bad news does not improve with age. The \nwithholding of bad news--withholding information on an intelligence \nfailure--jeopardizes the oversight system without which the United \nStates cannot conduct foreign intelligence operations. John Deutch \nclearly understands his reporting responsibilities, and I believe \nDirectors Gates and Woolsey and Studeman also understood. The challenge \nfor John Deutch is to know what is happening inside his organization, \nso the bad news gets to him first.\n  That is the mark of a tight, confident, organization. John Deutch has \nsome great material to work with, but it is up to him to forge that \nkind of organization.\n  If anybody in this great country of ours is up to that job, John \nDeutch is the person to get the job done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank my gallant friend from Nebraska.\n   I rise very much in support of the position he has taken and that of \nthe distinguished chairman of the committee, the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n\n  I would say by way of introduction that in the 103d Congress and then \non the first day of the 104th Congress, I offered legislation that \nwould basically break up the existing Central Intelligence Agency and \nreturn its component parts to the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of State in the manner that the OSS, the Office of Strategic \nServices, was divided and parceled out with the onset of peace in 1945 \nand 1946, to be followed, of course, by a cold war which has persisted \nalmost until this moment.\n  I had hoped to encourage a debate on the role of intelligence and of \nsecrecy in the American society. That debate has taken place. Some of \nthe results, I think, can be seen in the nomination of this \ndistinguished scientist and public servant to this position.\n  It could not have been more clear than in his testimony in which he \nmade a point, self-evident we would [[Page S6268]] suppose, but not \nfrequently to be encountered in the pronouncements of potential DCI's. \nHe said:\n\n       Espionage does not rest comfortably in a democracy. \n     Secrecy, which is essential to protect sources and methods, \n     is not welcome in an open society. If our democracy is to \n     support intelligence activities, the people must be confident \n     that our law and rules will be respected.\n\n  It may have come as a surprise--although it ought not to have--in \nrecent months and weeks, to find how many persons there are in this \ncountry who do not have confidence that our laws and rules will be \nrespected; who see the government in conspiratorial modes, directed \nagainst the people in ways that could be of huge consequence to \nAmericans.\n  I am not talking about what Richard Hofstadter referred to when he \nspoke of ``the paranoid style in American politics.'' I am talking \nabout the widespread belief that the CIA was somehow involved in the \nassassination of President Kennedy, if we can imagine. But there it is.\n  It is important to understand how deep this is in our society. In \n1956, even before Hofstadter spoke of it; Edward A. Shils of the \nUniversity of Chicago--who just passed away--that great, great, social \nscientist, published his book, ``The Torment of Secrecy,'' in which he \nwrote ``The exfoliation and intertwinement of the various patterns of \nbelief that the world is dominated by unseen circles of conspirators, \noperating behind our backs, is one of the characteristic features of \nmodern society.''\n  Such a belief was very much a feature of the Bolshevik society that \ntook shape in 1917 and 1918. The conspiratorial decision to help found \nand fund in the United States, a Communist party, half of which would \nbe class destiny, the discovery from the archives in Moscow that John \nReed received a payment of $1.5 million in 1920. Even as soft money, \nthat would be a very considerable sum today.\n  In the pattern that societies go through, it is said that \norganizations become like one other. To an extraordinary degree we \nemulate the Soviet model in our own intelligence service.\n  Unintentionally, naturally, it happens that way, but a very powerful \nanalyses of this has just been written by Jefferson Morley in the \nWashington Post under the headline ``Understanding Oklahoma'' in an \narticle entitled ``Department of Secrecy: The Invisible Bureaucracy \nThat Unites Alienated America in Suspicion.''\n  Or by Douglas Turner, in an article this weekend in the Buffalo News. \nI spoke of these concerns in an earlier statement on the Senate floor \nentitled ``The Paranoid Style in American Politics,'' which I ask \nunanimous consent be printed in the Record along with the articles by \nDouglas Turner and Jefferson Morley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, what we have is so much at variance with \nwhat was thought we would get.\n  Allen Dulles was very much part of the foundation of postwar \nintelligence, having been in the OSS, served with great distinction in \nSwitzerland during World War II.\n  Peter Grose, in his new biography, ``Gentleman Spy: The Life of Allen \nDulles,'' recounts the testimony Dulles gave before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee on April 25, 1947, as we are about to establish, \npassed the National Security Act of 1947 and created this small \ncoordinating body, the Central Intelligence Agency.\n  Personnel for a central intelligence agency, he argued, ``need not be \nvery numerous * * *. The operation of the service must be neither \nflamboyant nor overshrouded with the mystery and abracadabra which the \namateur detective likes to assume.'' In a lecturing tone, he tried to \ntell the Senators how intelligence is actually assembled.\n\n       Because of its glamour and mystery, overemphasis is \n     generally placed on what is called secret intelligence, \n     namely the intelligence that is obtained by secret means and \n     by secret agents. . . . In time of peace the bulk of \n     intelligence can be obtained through overt channels, through \n     our diplomatic and consular missions, and our military, naval \n     and air attahces in the normal and proper course of their \n     work. It can also be obtained through the world press, the \n     radio, and through the many thousands of Americans, business \n     and professional men and American residents of foreign \n     countries, who are naturally and normally brought in touch \n     with what is going on in those countries.\n       A proper analysis of the intelligence obtainable by these \n     overt, normal, and aboveboard means would supply us with over \n     80 percent, I should estimate, of the information required \n     for the guidance of our national policy.\n\n  Mr. President, that could not happen, did not happen. We entered upon \na five-decade mode of secret analysis, analysis withheld from the \nscrutiny, which is the only way we can verify the truth of a hypothesis \nin natural science or the social sciences.\n  The result was massive miscalculation, Nicholas Eberstadt in his \nwonderful new book, ``The Tyranny of Numbers,'' writes ``It is probably \nsafe to say that the U.S. Government's attempt to describe the Soviet \neconomy has been the largest single project in social science research \never undertaken.'' He said that, sir, in 1990, in testimony before the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations. ``The largest single project in social \nscience research ever undertaken,'' and it was a calamity.\n  No one has been more forthright than Adm. Stansfield Turner in an \narticle in Foreign Affairs about this time. He said when it came to \npredicting the collapse of the Soviet Union, the corporate view of the \nintelligence community was totally wrong.\n  I can remember the first years of the Kennedy administration. I \nremember having a meeting with Walt Rostow, Chairman of the Policy \nPlanning Council in the Department of State, in which he said of the \nSoviet Union, I am not one of those 6 percent forever people, but there \nit was, locked into the analyses. That is what the President knew.\n  Mr. President, in Richard Reeves remarkable biography of John F. \nKennedy, he records that the agency told the President that by the year \n2000 the GNP of the Soviet Union would be three times that of the \nUnited States. And that is what the President knew. A person might come \nto him with the most reasonable arguments, as did any number of \neconomists.\n The great theorists, Friedman, Hayek, Stigler, said it could not \nhappen, it would be theoretically impossible. Important work done by \nFrank Holzman, at Tufts, and the Russian Research Center at Harvard \nsaid, ``No, no. That is all very well what you say professor. What I \nknow is different.''\n\n  The consequences have been an extraordinary failure to foresee the \ncentral event of our time. A vast overdependence on military and \nsimilar outlays, that leave us perilously close to economic difficulty \nourselves.\n  I would like to close with a letter written me in 1991 by Dale W. \nJorgenson, professor of economics at the Kennedy School of Government, \nin which he said:\n\n       I believe that the importance of economic intelligence is \n     increasing greatly with the much-discussed globalization of \n     the U.S. economy. However the cloak-and-dagger model is even \n     more inappropriate to our new economic situation than it was \n     to the successful prosecution of the Cold War that has just \n     concluded. The lessons for the future seem to me to be rather \n     transparent. The U.S. government needs to invest a lot more \n     in international economic assessments. * * * (I)t should \n     reject the CIA monopoly model and try to create the kind of \n     intellectual competition that now prevails between CBO and \n     OMB on domestic policy, aided by Brookings, AEI [American \n     Enterprise Institute], the Urban Institute, the Kennedy \n     School, and many others.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the entire letter be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Those are the remarks I would like to make, sir. I have \nthe confidence that John Deutch, as a scientist, will follow them. I \nhave the concern that the administration will not.\n  We do know some things in social science. Mancur Olson, in his great \nbook, ``The Rise and Decline of Nations,'' on this day, V-E Day--I was \na sailor on V-E Day, so I can remember that--I can remember the Boston \nCommon, actually-- Mancur Olson asked:\n\n       Why has it come about that the two nations whose \n     institutions were destroyed in World War II, Germany and \n     Japan, have had the most economic success since? Whereas \n     Britain--not really much success at all; the United States--\n     yes, but.'' And he came up with a simple answer. The defeat \n     wiped out all those choke points, all those rents, all \n     [[Page S6269]] those sharing agreements, all those veto \n     structures that enable institutions to prevent things from \n     happening. And we are seeing it in this Government today, 5 \n     years after the wall came down.\n\n  Remember, 2 years before the wall came down the CIA stated that per \ncapita GDP was higher in East Germany than in West Germany. I hope I \ntake no liberty that I mentioned this once to Dr. Deutch and added \n``Any taxi driver in Berlin could have told you that was not so.'' And \nDr. Deutch replied, ``Any taxi driver in Washington.'' But if we cannot \nsummon the capacity to change our institutions in our changed \ncircumstances, there will be consequences and let nobody say they were \nnot predictable.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for her graciousness \nfor allowing me to speak when in fact in alternation it would have been \nher turn.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Congressional Record, Apr. 25, 1995]\n\n                The Paranoid Style in American Politics\n\n       Mr. Moynihan. Mr. President, As we think and, indeed, pray \n     our way through the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing, \n     asking how such a horror might have come about, and how \n     others might be prevented, Senators could do well to step \n     outside the chamber and look down the mall at the Washington \n     Monument. It honors the Revolutionary general who once \n     victorious, turned his army over to the Continental Congress \n     and retired to his estates. Later, recalled to the highest \n     office in the land, he served dutifully one term, then a \n     second but then on principle not a day longer. Thus was \n     founded the first republic, the first democracy since the age \n     of Greece and Rome.\n       There is no a more serene, confident, untroubled symbol of \n     the nation in all the capital. Yet a brief glance will show \n     that the color of the marble blocks of which the monument is \n     constructed changes about a quarter of the way up. Thereby \n     hangs a tale of another troubled time; not our first, just \n     as, surely, this will not be our last.\n       As befitted a republic, the monument was started by a \n     private charitable group, as we would now say, the Washington \n     National Monument Society. Contributions came in cash, but \n     also in blocks of marble, many with interior inscriptions \n     which visitors willing to climb the steps can see to this \n     day. A quarter of the way up, that is. For in 1852, Pope Plus \n     IX donated a block of marble from the temple of Concord in \n     Rome. Instantly, the American Party, or the Know-Nothings \n     (``I know nothing,'' was their standard reply to queries \n     about their platform) divined a Papist Plot. An installation \n     of the Pope's block of marble would signal the Catholic \n     Uprising. A fevered agitation began. As recorded by Ray Allen \n     Billington in The Protest Crusade, 1800-1860:\n       ``One pamphlet, The Pope's Strategem: ``Rome to America!'' \n     An Address to the Protestants of the United States, against \n     placing the Pope's block of Marble in the Washington Monument \n     (1852), urged Protestants to hold indignation meetings and \n     contribute another block to be placed next to the Pope's \n     `bearing an inscription by which all men may see that we are \n     awake to the hypocrisy and schemes of that designing, crafty, \n     subtle, far seeing and far reaching Power, which is ever \n     grasping after the whole World, to sway its iron scepter, \n     with bloodstained hands, over the millions of its \n     inhabitants.'''\n       One night early in March, 1854, a group of Know-Nothings \n     broke into the storage sheds on the monument grounds and \n     dragged the Pope's marble off towards the Potomac. Save for \n     the occasional ``sighting'', as we have come to call such \n     phenomena, it has never to be located since.\n       Work on the monument stopped. Years later, in 1876, \n     Congress appropriated funds to complete the job, which the \n     Corps of Engineers, under the leadership of Lieutenant \n     Colonel Thomas I. Casey did with great flourish in time for \n     the centennial observances of 1888.\n       Dread of Catholicism ran its course, if slowly. (Edward M. \n     Stanton, then Secretary of War was convinced the \n     assassination of President Lincoln was the result of a \n     Catholic plot.) Other manias followed, all brilliantly \n     describe in Richard Hofstadter's revelatory lecture ``the \n     Paranoid Style in American Politics'' which he delivered as \n     the Herbert Spencer Lecture at Oxford University within days \n     of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Which to this day \n     remains a fertile source of conspiracy mongering. George Will \n     cited Hofstadter's essay this past weekend on the television \n     program ``This Week with David Brinkley.'' He deals with the \n     same subject matter in a superb column in this morning's \n     Washington Post which has this bracing conclusion.\n       ``It is reassuring to remember that paranoiacs have always \n     been with us, but have never defined us.''\n       I hope, Mr. President, as we proceed to consider \n     legislation, if that is necessary, in response to the \n     bombing, we would be mindful of a history in which we have \n     often overreached, to our cost, and try to avoid such an \n     overreaction.\n       We have seen superb performance of the FBI. What more any \n     nation could ask of an internal security group I cannot \n     conceive. We have seen the effectiveness of our State \n     troopers, of our local police forces, fire departments, \n     instant nationwide cooperation which should reassure us \n     rather than frighten us.\n       I would note in closing, Mr. President, that Pope John Paul \n     II will be visiting the United States this coming October. I \n     ask unanimous consent that Mr. Will's column be printed in \n     the Record.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                  [From the Buffalo News, May 8, 1995]\n\n       Government Spooks, Beware--Moynihan Aims To Reveal Secrets\n\n                          (By Douglas Turner)\n\n       Washington.--For generations, artists like Jules Verne, \n     Graham Greene, Steven Spielberg, and Peter Benchley in his \n     novel ``White Shark,'' have harnessed the public's flirtation \n     with fear for innocent profit, fame and fun.\n       There is something lurking out there, or down there created \n     by a force beyond our knowing.\n       Far down the creative scale are conspiracy freaks Oliver \n     Stone, Ian Fleming and the publishers of checkout-counter \n     tabloids.\n       In dank corners of our society is a separate category: \n     Those who subsist utterly in paranoia: Oliver North, Gordon \n     Liddy, David Duke, Tim McVeigh and those who put on war paint \n     and military fatigues, play with assault weapons, and preach \n     war against a popularly-elected constitutional government.\n       Like Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy, they nurse on paranoia and \n     propagate it.\n       Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., suggests this last \n     category either exploits, or is partly driven by the web of \n     government secrets that has grown like spores since World War \n     II.\n       He speaks of official Washinton's ``enormous secrecy system \n     . . . which just expands, if anything, which we're in on and \n     everyone out there is not, is out of, and easily it's a \n     culture that breeds paranoia.''\n       For years, Sen. Moynihan has been sounding a warning about \n     what he calls our culture of paranoia. In an article he \n     penned four years ago, Moynihan said Stone's film, ``JFK,'' \n     could ``spoil a generation of American politics just when \n     sanity is returning.''\n       Realizing he couldn't do much about popular culture, \n     Moynihan set about stripping down government's role in \n     creating fear by going after the mountain of official secrets \n     generated annually.\n       To that end, on Jan. 22, 1993, Moynihan introduced a bill \n     creating a bipartisan commission on reducing and protecting \n     government secrecy. A Democratic Congress passed it and \n     President Clinton made it law.\n       The commission had its first meeting in January and elected \n     Moynihan chairman. Other members include Sen. Jesse Helms, R-\n     N.C., who was appointed by Sen. Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-\n     Kansas; Ellen Hume of Annenberg Washington Program, who was \n     named by the president; a Harvard professor, and Clinton's \n     nominee to head the CIA, John Deutch.\n       It has an office in an old Navy Building with view of the \n     Potomac, and a staff director, Eric Biel, formerly a senior \n     Senate staffer. It has had a couple of organizational \n     meetings, all public. And its first real working session will \n     be on May 17.\n       Moynihan in a television interview joked ``we've managed to \n     conceal our activities so far by holding public hearings. \n     Nobody goes to public hearings.''\n       On the 17th, the commission will hear about official \n     secrets from officials of the National Security Council, who \n     are cooperating as a result of an executive order issued by \n     President Clinton three weeks ago.\n       Government files harbor nearly a billion official secrets.\n       It generates about 7 million of them a year. But the \n     secret, Moynihan wrote, is that the government ``only counts \n     (secrets) up to the level of Top Secret.\n       ``All the real secrets are higher than that with code names \n     I am not at liberty to reveal, having taken a kind of vow of \n     secrecy when I became vice chairman of the Senate Select \n     Committee on Intelligence,'' he said.\n       Three million government employees have security clearances \n     up to top secret. This is fairly common stuff as most field \n     grade military officers, beginning with lieutenants, are \n     entitled to top secret access.\n       The plethora of secrets, security levels and ``cleared'' \n     employees has made a joke of the security system itself--with \n     ``secret'' material spilled into defense and intelligence \n     trade publications every day.\n       ``They'' can see it, but you can't.\n       Then there are the active classified files of the FBI, the \n     Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, the Secret Service, \n     the Customs, Immigration and Naturalization Service, the \n     Border Patrol, the Department of Energy, and even the \n     Department of Agriculture.\n       Official secrecy, endemic to big government, dies hard. As \n     in corporate life, and in the highest aeries of journalism, \n     secrets are not just the key to power. They are power.\n       Official infatuation with secrecy is reflected in the \n     forbearance in President Clinton's executive order. Existing \n     secrets must be declassified after 25 years, he said. Future \n     ones after 10 years.\n       This would matter in an age when breech-load rifles were on \n     the cutting edge of military science. The standard is \n     ridiculous in the light of today's expanding technology.\n       Thanks to the reports the CIA issued--based on ``evidence'' \n     you and I could never [[Page S6270]] see or evaluate--on \n     Soviet weaponry and the economy, this country went on a \n     military spending binge beginning with the Vietnam war and \n     ending only three years ago.\n       But these CIA fabrications served to justify quantum leaps \n     in spending on the American defense establishment, and of \n     course covert CIA. We will be paying for that buildup for the \n     rest of our lives.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 30, 1995]\n\n                         Department of Secrecy\n\n\n  The Invisible Bureaucracy That Unites Alienated America in Suspicion\n\n                         (By Jefferson Morley)\n\n       Scapegoating is a time-honored spring sport in Washington. \n     Professionals of the pastime are already in fine mid-summer \n     form on Topic A: Who is responsible for the Oklahoma City \n     bombing? Skillful soundbites indict various culprits: Right-\n     wing talk radio, the NRA, lone nuts and (the ever-reliable) \n     '60s counterculture.\n       But while the theories fly, the All-Stars of the Washington \n     blame game somehow overlook one of the leading suspects in \n     the minds of the American people: the Department of Secrecy.\n       There is no official department of secrecy, complete with \n     Cabinet officer and official seal. But there is the \n     functional equivalent: the federal bureaucracy that keeps the \n     government's secrets. It consists of the offices and archives \n     in the Pentagon, the intelligence agencies, the FBI, the \n     Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms and other federal \n     agencies that classify and guard all sorts of information \n     considered too sensitive to be shared with the American \n     public. The connection between this empire of information and \n     the Oklahoma City bombing is not obvious but it is real.\n       First, the Department of Secrecy is a significant presence \n     in American society and politics. Viewed on an organizational \n     chart, the federal secrecy system is bigger than many Cabinet \n     agencies. According to a Washington Post report last year, \n     the secrecy system keeps an estimated 32,400 people employed \n     full-time--more than the Environmental Protection Agency and \n     the Department of Education combined. According to the Office \n     of Management and Budget, the bureaucracy of secrets may cost \n     as much as $16 billion a year to run.\n       Second, mistrust of the government and its many secrets is \n     now raging out of control. The assumption that the government \n     is not accountable for its actions is now the norm.\n       It is an article of faith among many on the religious and \n     paramilitary right (including, apparently, one of the bombing \n     suspects in custody) that the federal government has not been \n     held accountable for the 1993 raid in Waco which left 85 \n     people dead.\n       Liberals and the left were angered but not surprised by the \n     recent revelations about the CIA in Guatemala. In the name of \n     protecting its ``sources and methods,'' the agency shielded \n     from justice the Guatemalan colonel who is the leading \n     suspect in the murder of an American innkeeper and the \n     husband of an American lawyer.\n       Robert McNamara's memoirs are an infuriating reminder to \n     moderates that the veil of secrecy allowed utterly \n     respectable mainstream Washington officials to send thousands \n     of American boys to slaughter in a disastrous and still-\n     divisive war.\n       In the movie theaters of America, the most treacherous, \n     evil Hollywood villains often work inside the Department of \n     Secrecy. Popular movies like ``Outbreak'' and ``Clear and \n     Present Danger'' routinely depict senior officials in \n     Washington as smooth-talking criminals who think nothing of \n     betraying the public trust and sending innocent Americans to \n     their death.\n       ``The pathology of public attitudes toward government are \n     due in large part to excessive and unnecessary secrecy,'' \n     says Steven Aftergood of the American Federation of \n     Scientists, a leading advocate of government openness in \n     Washington.\n       The State Department, for example, retains the right to \n     withhold information that would ``seriously and demonstrably \n     undermine ongoing diplomatic activities of the United \n     States.'' Under this standard the CIA-in-Guatemala story \n     would almost certainly still be secret and two American women \n     would still be wondering who murdered their husbands.\n       For now, the effect of Clinton's order is expected to be \n     modest.\n       ``I don't think it's going to make much difference,'' said \n     retired Lt. Gen. William Odom, the former director of the \n     National Security Agency and a skeptic of openness efforts. \n     Odom recalled that a similar directive from President Carter \n     in 1978 had little effect on how he, Odom, actually \n     classified information for the government at the time.\n       Aftergood praised Clinton's directive as a distinct \n     improvement over the old secrecy\n      rules but added ``I just hope we are at the beginning of a \n     reform process, not the end.''\n       That will depend, in part, on what the public, the \n     president and Congress learn from Oklahoma City.\n       Is the bombing the work of isolated madmen with no \n     connection to the larger political culture? Or is it a \n     warning of the pathological possibilities opened up when the \n     federal government loses the faith of its people?\n       These questions are especially pertinent for people working \n     within the secrecy system. Most of them do not hide \n     wrongdoing from the American people. The information they \n     guard is often legitimately secret: military codes, the names \n     of law enforcement informants, the U.S. position in \n     international trade talks and the like.\n       But they shrug off the widespread mistrust of their work at \n     their own peril. With the government generating so many \n     secrets each year--an estimated 6.3 million in 1993--and \n     continuing revelations about governmental abuses of power, \n     the line between the paranoia of a few and legitimate fears \n     of the many gets harder to draw.\n       A few years ago, the notion that the U.S. government had, \n     over the course of several decades, routinely conducted \n     dangerous radiation experiments on thousands of unwitting \n     Americans would have been regarded by most reasonable people \n     as unfounded, if not ridiculous. Today, thanks to the \n     aggressive release of long-secret documents by Secretary of \n     Energy Hazel O'Leary, the radiation experiments are cold, \n     disturbing historical fact.\n       O'Leary's leadership shows that full disclosure of \n     embarrassing material is not political or institutional \n     suicide. In fact, the Department of Energy, by all accounts, \n     enjoys more credibility on Capitol Hill and with the public \n     for coming clean.\n       We don't know what other abuses of governmental power, if \n     any, the secrecy system is hiding. But we do know that a \n     citizenry without access to its own history has no guarantee \n     of democratic accountability. And as long as democratic \n     accountability is in doubt, the citizenry, not just \n     government office buildings, will remain vulnerable.\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n         Harvard University, John F. Kennedy School of Government,\n                                    Cambridge, MA, March 18, 1991.\n     Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Pat: This is just a personal note of thanks for your \n     eloquent and stimulating contribution to the lunch discussion \n     with the new National Research Council Board on Science, \n     Technology, and Economic Policy last Friday. Needless to say, \n     I think you are absolutely right about the significance of \n     the long-standing intelligence failure in assessing the \n     Soviet economy and the Soviet military effort. While I do not \n     concur with your Galbraithian view of economics as a failed \n     profession, this has to be one of the great failures of \n     economics--right up there with the inability of economists \n     (along with everyone else) to find a remedy for the Great \n     Depression of the 1930's.\n       On your specific arguments: In 1985 Paul Samuelson was \n     relying on the CIA estimates, so that this is not an \n     independent piece of evidence. For every quotation you can \n     give from people like Lawrence Klein, you can find a counter-\n     argument in the writings of Friedman, Hayek, Stigler and many \n     others. All three have been amply rewarded for their efforts \n     with the Nobel Prize, the National Medal of Science, and the \n     esteem of their colleagues (with the conspicuous exception of \n     your former neighbor on Francis Avenue). They deserve a lot \n     of credit for the positions they took in the 1930's all the \n     way up to the 1980's and they are getting it.\n       It seems to me that it is better to address the issue of \n     international economic assessments within your framework of \n     post-Cold War recoversion that Galbaith's entertaining but \n     wrong-headed view of economics as a failed profession. Given \n     the importance of economic assessments of the Soviet Union, \n     it is almost incredible that the U.S. government established \n     an in-house monopoly on these assessments. The principal \n     academic centers for research in this area at Columbia and \n     Harvard were allowed to wither away. Over the past decade, \n     Frank Holzman of Tufts and the Russian Research Center at \n     Harvard has been a lonely voice in opposition to the CIA \n     view.\n       I believe that the importance of economic intelligence is \n     increasing greatly with the much-discussed globalization of \n     the U.S. economy. However, the cloak-and-dagger model is even \n     more inappropriate to our new economic situation than it was \n     to the successful prosecution of the Cold War that has just \n     concluded. The lessons for the future seem to me to be rather \n     transparent. The U.S. government needs to invest a lot more \n     in international economic assessments. Second, it should \n     reject the CIA monopoly model and try to create the kind of \n     intellectual competition that now prevails between CBO and \n     OMB on domestic policy, aided by Brookings, AEI, the Urban \n     Institute, the Kennedy School, and many others.\n       An important subsidiary lesson we can learn from the \n     failure of the CIA Soviet assessments is the importance of \n     ``sunshine''. Although economic intelligence is always going \n     to be sensitive to somebody, it should be carried out in full \n     sight of the public, including the professional peers of the \n     intelligence analysts. I hope that the new National Research \n     Council Board can contribute to the post-Cold War re-\n     conversion of our economic intelligence establishment in a \n     positive way. As I see it, this is a daunting task. To use a \n     medical analogy, this will require something more like a \n     ``life style'' change than a simple remedy for a chronic \n     disease.\n       I hope that you can find the time to present your \n     perspective on this issue to the \n     [[Page S6271]] policy community, say in the form of an \n     article for Public Interest. This would be an interesting \n     opportunity to bring your ideas about post-Cold War \n     conversion to a specific problem of great importance to the \n     national interest.\n       With best regards,\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                Dale W. Jorgenson.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am always happy to yield to the \nsenior Senator from New York, because I always enjoy hearing what he \nhas to say.\n  Mr. President, the importance of intelligence gathering for our \nNation is at a critical juncture. Never has it been as important as it \nis today that we have foreign intelligence gathering capabilities, \nparticularly because we are now facing a time when weapons of mass \ndestruction, nuclear, chemical and biological, are being made in \ndifferent parts of the world. Even worse, the weapons that transport \nthose weapons are also being developed in different parts of the world. \nThere is an urgent need for us to know where those weapons are and \nwhere the capabilities are to transport those weapons, either within \ntheir own theater or over to our country.\n  So, there is no question in my mind that we must have a strong \nforeign intelligence gathering capability. We also have a problem. That \nis we need a leader and we need a focus and we need a mission for the \npeople who are in our intelligence gathering operations right now. We \nhave had several mishaps. The Aldrich Ames case is one that has been \ntalked about on this floor and it is one that is very troubling to us, \neven today. Many people feel this traitor was not dealt with in a way \nthat will show there is an accountability when a drastic mistake \nhappens.\n  The lack of management accountability did demonstrate, by recent \nevents in Guatemala, the lack of information that the oversight \ncommittees had about the situation in Guatemala. The escalation of \nterrorism all over the world is causing an ongoing need for us to have \nintelligence-gathering capabilities.\n  So, we do need a person who can take control of our central \nintelligence-gathering operation, lift the morale of the wonderful \npeople who work there, and put an accountability into the system. We \nalso need someone who can make it more efficient. As we are downsizing \nour budget we need to make sure that we have a mission, that we are \nusing our assets in the most efficient way.\n  So we need someone to come in and show that leadership. I believe \nJohn Deutch is that person. I think the President has made a good \ndecision.\n  There are some issues that must be dealt with. First, I must say I \ndisagree with the President giving Cabinet rank to the Director of \nCentral Intelligence. The National Security Act of 1947 sets forth the \nmembers of the National Security Council and then designates others, \nincluding the Director of Central Intelligence and the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, as officials who are not members but may attend \nand participate as the President directs. I believe that is also the \nappropriate role for the DCI with respect to the Cabinet.\n  Mr. Deutch was asked these questions in our Intelligence Committee \nhearing on his nomination regarding the Cabinet status of the Director \nof Central Intelligence. He assured the committee that he would hold to \nthe proper standard of conduct and that he would not allow policy to \ninfluence intelligence judgments and not allow intelligence to \ninterfere in the policy process.\n  That is a very important distinction that the new Director has \nadopted and which I think is very important for us to keep--the \nseparation between intelligence gathering and policymaking. The \ncommittee is going to be sensitive to any indication that this standard \nis not being met, but I believe the makeup of the Cabinet is the \nresponsibility of the President. That is not within our mission in \nconfirmation. And, therefore, I hope the standards that we have \ndiscussed will be adhered to, both by the President and by the new \nDirector of Central Intelligence.\n  I brought up two major issues in committee that I thought were \nimportant. First, a closer working relationship with the oversight \ncommittees in Congress, the Intelligence Committee in the Senate, and \nthe one in the House. I think it is most important when you have a \ncovert operation which, of course, intelligence gathering is, to have \nan even more strong relationship and communications network with the \noversight committees that can assess the judgments that are being made \nin these covert operations.\n  It is good for Congress and it is good for the intelligence \ngathering, as well. It is very important that we have an oversight and \nwe have the ability to make judgments by the duly elected officials in \nthe U.S. Congress when we are dealing with such sensitive intelligence \nmatters.\n  So I talked to the new Director-designate about that. And he agreed \ntotally that we needed to have that line of communication, and I think \nit has been reiterated by every person who has spoken on the floor \ntoday, and most certainly every member of the committee.\n  The second issue that was very important to me was complete financial \ndisclosure of every person who works at the CIA and every contractor \nwho is working on CIA projects. I felt this was important because one \nof the obvious things that was missed in the Aldrich Ames case was a \nhigh-living lifestyle by Aldrich Ames and his family, clearly one that \ncould not be shown to have been supported by a person on the salary of \nAldrich Ames.\n  If we had the vehicle in place to have total financial disclosure, \nthe CIA could immediately have begun to check on this lifestyle to see \nif there was something that was not right. Clearly, it was not right \nthe way Aldrich Ames was living. And we found out later it was because \nhe was receiving millions of dollars from the Russian Government for \nsecrets that he was giving to them from our CIA. So we need the basic \ninformation.\n  Mr. Deutch said, and promised, that he would make sure that every \nperson who works for the CIA, who willingly comes to work for the CIA, \nwill give basic financial disclosures. I think that is going to be a \nvery important tool for us to show that there is an accountability in \nthe CIA and that an Aldridge Ames case will not as easily be repeated \nand, if it is repeated, that we will have the ability to go in \nimmediately and see what the assets are that have been disclosed and if \nsomething seems to be amiss.\n  So these are two areas that I am satisfied that Mr. Deutch is going \nto address, and he has already given me his word that there is going to \nbe financial disclosure among the CIA employees and people who are \nworking for the CIA under contract.\n  So in conclusion, Mr. President, I support Secretary Deutch for the \nrole of Director of Central Intelligence. This is one of the most \nimportant nominations that we will have before us this year, because \nthis agency needs such direction. I believe Mr. Deutch can provide that \ndirection. I have worked with him as a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee in his capacity as Deputy Secretary of Defense. I find him to \nbe a person of integrity. I respect his judgment, and I think he did a \nfine job as Deputy Secretary of Defense. I think he is the person to \nfulfill this mission at this very important time in our intelligence \ngathering reorganization.\n  I think we must take our responsibility in confirming him, to do this \nin a swift and timely manner. We have had five DCI's in the last 10 \nyears. This agency needs leadership. We need some reorganization. We \nneed a mission, and we need to make sure that we are using our assets \nefficiently and well so that everyone in our country is secure so that \nwe have the information that we need to keep that freedom, \nindependence, and liberty that we have.\n  So I am supporting Mr. Deutch for this very purpose. I wish him well. \nIt is going to be a very tough job. I hope that he will work with \nMembers of Congress who want him to succeed, and we do. For all of our \ncountry, we must succeed with this new Director.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues today to \nurge confirmation of John Deutch as Director of Central Intelligence. \nAs a permanent resident of Belmont, MA, and having a lifelong \ninvolvement in [[Page S6272]] the Massachusetts community, John Deutch \nis a neighbor and a man who has built a national and international \nreputation as a leader and as a forceful and effective professional. I \ndescribed him publicly, not long ago, as ``superb and first rate'', and \nI reiterate that description today, without hesitation and with renewed \nrespect and continued confidence in his extraordinary ability.\n  Let me add a few words about the task he will face and the talent he \nwill bring to the position of Director of Central Intelligence. The \nworld is undoubtedly changing. It will continue to change more quickly, \nperhaps, than at any other time in our history. We are seeing old \nthreats and new threats emerge in a shifting political and economic \natmosphere that will test our resolve and challenge our leadership.\n  Mr. President, John Deutch is undoubtedly up to the challenge, and he \nis a leader for his time. There is no question about that. He \nunderstands the critical task that he will face, and the importance of \nfacing it with resolve, strength, and a firm hand. He has proven that \nhe knows the need and has the expertise to address what we all \nacknowledge are operational and administrative problems at the CIA. As \nDirector of Central Intelligence he will face two daunting managerial \ntasks: First, he must try to restructure the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity at a time when many believe there is no longer a need--nor \nthe funds--for the level of intelligence activity to which we became \naccustomed during the cold war. He will have to balance proper and \nappropriate intelligence activity with increasing congressional and \npublic scrutiny of scarcer and scarcer tax dollars.\n  Second, in the wake of recent events at the CIA, he will have to look \ncritically at internal operations and move quickly to rebuild morale, \npublic trust, and confidence while maintaining the integrity of \nAmerica's intelligence capability. As far as restructuring the \nintelligence community, I believe John Deutch has one very important \nadvantage over many who could have been chosen to serve. He is not an \narchitect of either the current intelligence system or the processes \nthat have been put into place. He is a fresh face, a new voice, a real \nleader with the talent and the foresight to succeed.\n  Now, as far as what Secretary Deutch will face at the CIA, \noperationally and administratively, there is a need to act \nexpeditiously to turn things around even if it means significant \npersonnel changes, and I am confident that John Deutch has the \nnecessary judgment and will to quickly act in the best interest of the \nAgency and the Nation.\n  Mr. President, the American intelligence community will be well \nserved by the experience and leadership of John Deutch who rightfully \nobserved in his statement to the Intelligence Committee that ``changing \nintelligence priorities, as well as intelligence failures, dictate that \nwe carefully re-examine the need for, and specific missions of, \nintelligence.'' He added that he sees ``four significant dangers to our \nnational security and the social and economic well-being of our \ncitizens.'' He cites major regional conflicts; the spread of weapons of \nmass destruction; international terrorism, crime, and drug trafficking; \nand the present nuclear danger that still exists in Russia and the \nRussian republics as they move toward democracy.\n  I also see the new Director of Central Intelligence moving, as he \nsaid he would, to improve the support that the intelligence community \ngives to law enforcement agencies in areas of narcotics trafficking, \ninternational crime, and terrorism. I agree with his assessments and I \nam confident he will move expeditiously to address the continuing \nthreat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and \nparticularly the emerging threat of terrorist attacks with these \nweapons. I see the new Director re-defining and establishing new \nstandards for the proper role for the intelligence community in the \nareas of economic intelligence, and addressing the issue of making \ninformation, when appropriate, more readily available by lowering \nclassifications or through declassification. And I see the new \nDirector, like every other director of a Federal agency, looking for \nways to economize and streamline the operations at CIA to give us more \nfor our tax dollars.\n  From all we've heard about John Deutch, I believe he has the \nexperience, the expertise, the professionalism, the reputation, the \nperseverance, the qualifications and the integrity to do the job, and I \nurge my colleagues to confirm his nomination.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  the nomination of john deutch to be director of central intelligence\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I would like to add my voice in support of \nthe nomination of Dr. John Deutch to be Director of Central \nIntelligence. This nomination is extremely important, Mr. President, \nbecause the Central Intelligence Agency is at a crossroads and I \nbelieve John Deutch has what its going to take to redirect the Agency's \ncourse during its next few crucial years.\n  There is no question that strong leadership is critical for the CIA \nto be able to transform the Agency's mission into one that provides \npolicymakers with timely, useful, and target-specific intelligence. CNN \ncan cover the world; the CIA needs to bring greater attention and \nresources to bear on countries and issues that represent a threat to \nour national security interests.\n  Dr. Deutch was brutally frank in his assessment of CIA successes and \nfailures, and refreshingly candid about what he would like to \naccomplish as DCI. His candor was unusual, since nominees normally go \nout of their way to avoid categorical statements about agendas and work \nplans. Dr. Deutch, in contrast, went out of his way to explain exactly \nwhere he is headed and what he would like to do.\n  During his confirmation hearing, I heard Dr. Deutch speak of bringing \nin a new generation of leaders at the CIA, streamlining imagery \noperations, and getting to the root of problems inside the Operations \nDirectorate.\n  Mr. President, John Deutch brings with him a demonstrated track \nrecord of achievement in both government and academia. He is widely \nrespected within the defense community for his performance as Secretary \nPerry's deputy at the Pentagon and within the scientific community for \nhis tenure at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I believe he \nis more than equal to the task of restoring luster to the CIA.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have worked with John \nDeutch, and I have seen firsthand the quality of his work and his \nconscientious commitment to our national defense and to the men and \nwomen who serve our country.\n  Finally, Mr. President, as a Senator from Virginia, I'm pleased that \nDr. Deutch understands the distress of talented Agency personnel and \nalumni who have watched the CIA and other intelligence branches endure \na rough patch. He is, in my judgment, the right man at the right time \nto restore dignity and respect to deserving and hardworking public \nservants working in the Intelligence Community.\n  Mr. President, I have high hopes for Dr. Deutch's tenure at the CIA, \nand I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\nnomination of john m. deutch to be the director of central intelligence\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination of \nJohn M. Deutch to be the Director of Central Intelligence. The \nnomination of Dr. Deutch, who presently serves as the Deputy Secretary \nof Defense, has received the unanimous, bipartisan support of the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence. This strong support reflects \nDr. Deutch's outstanding qualifications, including his first-rate \nperformance as Deputy Secretary of Defense and Under Secretary of \nDefense for Acquisition.\n  I have had the opportunity to work closely with Secretary Deutch, \nboth in my prior capacity as chairman of the Armed Services Committee \nand in my current role as ranking minority member. He has made an \noutstanding contribution at the Department of Defense, and is well-\nqualified to serve as the Director of Central Intelligence.\n  Secretary Deutch came to the Department of Defense following a long \nand distinguished academic and government career. His positions in \nacademia included service as provost and institute professor at the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. His prior Government experience \nincluded service on the staff of the Office of the Secretary of Defense \nduring the early [[Page S6273]] 1960's, and as Under Secretary of \nEnergy during the late 1970's. In addition, he served on the Defense \nScience Board and on many other advisory boards over the years.\n  In 1993, he was nominated by President Clinton and confirmed by the \nSenate to serve as the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition. When \nBill Perry became the Secretary of Defense in 1994, Dr. Deutch was \nnominated and confirmed to his current position as Deputy Secretary of \nDefense.\n  I have known Secretary Deutch personally for many years, including \nthe periods of his service in the Department of Energy and during his \ntenure at MIT. His entire career--both in academia and in Government \nservice--has been devoted to developing creative and thoughtful \napproaches to national defense and intelligence policy issues.\n  Secretary Deutch has compiled as solid record in the Department of \nDefense as a strong manager. He has served the Nation well, not only in \nthe management of internal Department of Defense functions, but also as \nthe DOD official with primary responsibility for interface with the \nintelligence community. He knows how to solve problems, make clear \ndecisions, and address pressing issues. On the Armed Services \nCommittee, we have appreciated his breadth of knowledge, his candor, \nand his willingness to engage in dialog. He also has a good sense of \nhumor, which he uses to put difficult issues in perspective--a quality \nthat will be most useful in his new position.\n  The intelligence community faces many difficult challenges in the \npost-cold war era, particularly in the aftermath of the Ames espionage \nmatter. The Oklahoma City tragedy underscores the dangers of terrorism \nin the modern world. The tensions in the Persian Gulf and North Asia, \nas well as the problems faced by the States of the former Soviet Union, \nare but a few of the difficult challenges facing the intelligence \ncommunity. John Deutch has the experience and background to take on \nthese challenges. I strongly urge the Senate to confirm his nomination \nto be Director of Central Intelligence.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, there are, to my knowledge, no other \nSenators who wish to speak on this nomination. I will offer a couple of \nclosing comments and then yield time, alerting colleagues who are \nwatching of the possibility that we may be yielding back, and they have \nnot told us they wanted to speak. They could rush over here and say a \nfew words.\n  In my statement, I indicated, and it is correct, that one of the \nproblems we have with our intelligence effort is that as a consequence \nof needing to protect security, we are unable--the intelligence people \nare unable--to brag about successes, and thus not only is it difficult \nfor us to give credit, but increasingly citizens are needing and asking \nfor information that will enable them to judge whether or not their tax \ndollars are being well spent. I would argue that this condition of \nbeing unable to disclose sometimes puts us in a position of not being \nable to give citizens information or having them say, ``Now I \nunderstand why we are doing this, and I believe we are in fact getting \nour money's worth.''\n  I would like as a consequence to identify for citizens two recent \nevents that were publicly disclosed. And for the information of \ncitizens, it is the President of the United States who has the \ncontrolling authority both to make a classification decision and to \nmake a declassification decision. That decision is spelled out in \nstatute. It is not a decision that can be made by either the Congress, \nin the absence of changing the law, or an individual Member of \nCongress. But two recent disclosures, probably, I suspect, disclosed by \na decision made by the President to make the disclosure, underscore the \nimportance of this intelligence effort.\n  The first was that the United States of America presented to the U.N. \nSecurity Council clear and present evidence that North Koreans were \nengaged in a policy, a strategy, an active effort to acquire nuclear \ncapacity. We could say that they were, and people did or did not \nbelieve it. They mostly said, ``Well, maybe that is just the United \nStates just sort of hung up again.'' Because we had the intelligence \ncapacity, we presented information--in this case, images--to the \nSecurity Council, and the Security Council sees clearly North Korea is \nbuilding nuclear capability and the Security Council takes actions \nsupportive of the United States' effort to make certain that North \nKorea does not become a nuclear nation.\n  Again, with the use of images disclosed to the public, our Ambassador \nto the United Nations, Madeleine Albright, at the direction of the \nPresident of the United States, at the time when the French and the \nRussians were weakening in their resolve in regard to sanctions on \nIraq, buying into the Iraqis' assertions that, ``We are impoverished \nnow; we don't have very much money; and, no, we are not building any \nchemical or biological chemical capability, and we are not really a \nmilitaristic nation. You need not worry about us any longer.''\n  Our Ambassador presents, in a week-long trip to I think 10 or 12 \nnations, again, images that are our intelligence images to these world \nleaders on the Security Council, information clearly indicating that \nthe Iraqi leader had built a $1.2 billion palace, hardly the sort of \naction taken by a nation that was impoverished; second, that chemical \nand biological capability continued to be a problem; and that the \nacquisition of Kuwaiti military equipment during their occupation of \nKuwait was being integrated into the Iraqi forces, giving lie to all \nthree of the statements made by the Iraqi leader and giving the United \nStates the capacity, the President the capacity, through his United \nNations, our U.N. Ambassador, the ability to make the argument to keep \nthe sanctions still tightening around the nation of Iraq.\n  In both cases, the United States of America received benefit. Who \nknows what the cost to the world would have been had North Korea been \npermitted to continue building its nuclear capability or had the \nsanctions been dropped from Iraq, a nation that continues to exhibit \ndangerous tendencies, indeed dangerous actions.\n  I cite those two amongst the latest that have been disclosed publicly \nbecause citizens deserve to get enough information upon which they can \nmake a decision about whether or not we are either sort of captive to \nthe intelligence community, as is very often suspected by many who are \nnot on this Intelligence Committee, and perhaps other citizens as well, \nthat we in fact are looking at these successes, insisting upon \naccountability, trying to assess the threats in the world and organize \nour intelligence efforts to meet those threats, to maintain the \ncapability to keep the United States of America as safe as is humanly \npossible.\n  Let me, in addition, Mr. President, point out that there are two \nthings Mr. Deutch is going to be addressing which in some ways are a \nconsequence of both our successes and at times our failures of the \npast.\n  The first is, many of the threats that we are now dealing with are \nthreats that are a consequence, sort of a residual, of the cold war. \nThe proliferation threat on the nuclear, biological, and chemical is a \nthreat that came as a consequence of our building capacity and the \nSoviets' building capacity. This proliferation threat is a very real \nthreat, and we are having to now take the sort of residual problem of \nthe cold war and move it to the top of the list knowing that the \nbombing in Oklahoma City would be magnified several thousand times over \nwere either chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons to be used in a \nterrorist effort.\n  This is a very real and present problem. It requires the United \nStates of America to lead. No other nation is going to do it. We saw \nrecently, when the President put sanctions on Iran, our friends in \nEurope said, ``Well, we think that's a bad idea. We want to continue to \nengage with a country that's involved with terrorism.''\n  I do not know what they are going to do; I suspect wait until \nsomething terrible were to happen. Only the United States of America \ncan lead on that issue, lead trying to get Russia not to sell nuclear \ntechnology to Iran. Only the United States of America, I believe, is \nwilling to make the kind of diplomatic and financial effort necessary \nto make this world safe in the area of nuclear, chemical, and \nbiological weapons and the terrorism that comes from that. \n[[Page S6274]] \n  There is a second problem, Mr. President, that our new, hopefully new \nDirector of Central Intelligence is going to have to be dealing with. \nThe distinguished Senator from New York in his comments referenced \nthat, and that is not just a cynicism toward Government but a precise \nsuspicion that the CIA is involved in all sorts of things that are bad. \nThat the CIA is possibly responsible for the assassination of John \nKennedy is something that is actually honestly believed by some \nAmericans who see a conspiracy in which the Central Intelligence Agency \nperhaps played some central role.\n  We are going to have to face an awful lot of that, Mr. President, and \nwe are going to have to face it very squarely and very honestly. As I \nsaid earlier, I am very excited watching the accounts of the \ncelebration of the victory in Europe 50 years ago, watching old men \nrecall the stories of bravery and heroism and sacrifice. I say, with no \ninterest in disparaging that success--I thrilled in that success and am \nunable to measure truly the sacrifice and heroic behavior that was \nnecessary, but it stands in stark contrast to an event that occurred, \noh, I guess about a month or so ago when former Secretary of Defense \nMcNamara published a mea culpa book saying that in 1966 the Secretary \nof Defense of the United States of America, with all the intelligence \neffort at its disposal, had actually concluded that the war in Vietnam \nwas unwinable.\n  Well, I was there in 1969. I do not remember McNamara saying anything \nabout it then. And that kind of a statement is the example of the sort \nof thing, unfortunately, that feeds this cynicism and this conspiracy \ntheory and causes people to say that the Government really is against \nrather than trying to be on their side in making their lives not only \nsafe but their lives secure as well. It means that we are going to have \nto press the envelope a bit on secrecy. By that I mean we are going to \nhave to take great care that a secret is, indeed, necessary to protect \nthe American people rather than protecting those who are operating, \neither the Director of Operations or other sorts of entities. It cannot \nbe that we keep a secret from the American people because we are afraid \nof what they will do to us if we tell them the truth. It must be that a \nsecret is being maintained because we are concerned about our inability \nto carry out an important security mission if full disclosure were to \noccur.\n  As I indicated, there is a tremendous capacity in the intelligence \ncommunity to help citizens in a very difficult time acquire the \ninformation needed to become informed. When you are born in the United \nStates of America, you are given enormous freedoms at birth and should \nhave been told at some point during your public education or upbringing \nby your parents or upbringing by others, you should have been told that \nfreedom is not free; that a contribution has to be made back of some \nkind. And our citizens are increasingly aware of the contribution of \ntime and effort that they have to make to become informed about what is \ngoing on in Chechnya, what is going on in the former Yugoslavia, what \nis going on in Mexico, what is going on in places where they have a \ndifficult time pronouncing the name let alone making decisions about \nwhat our foreign policy ought to be. I believe the technologies that we \nhave at our disposal, if we press the envelope judiciously and not in a \nreckless fashion, can, indeed, help our citizens make decisions and \nmake it more likely that government of, by, and for the people works \nboth in foreign as well as domestic policy.\n  Mr. President, no one has traipsed over to the floor to provide \nadditional testimony, and I am prepared to yield back what time is \nremaining and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty Between the Government of \nthe United States of America and the Government of the Republic of \nHungary on Extradition, signed at Budapest on December 1, 1994. Also \ntransmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the \nDepartment of State with respect to this Treaty.\n  The Treaty is designed to update and standardize the conditions and \nprocedures for extradition between the United States and Hungary. Most \nsignificantly, it substitutes a dual-criminality clause for the current \nlist of extraditable offenses, thereby expanding the number of crimes \nfor which extradition can be granted. The Treaty also provides a legal \nbasis for temporarily surrendering prisoners to stand trial for crimes \nagainst the laws of the Requesting State.\n  The Treaty further represents an important step in combating \nterrorism by excluding from the scope of the political offense \nexception serious offenses typically committed by terrorists, e.g., \ncrimes against a Head of State or first family member of either Party, \naircraft hijacking, aircraft sabotage, crimes against internationally \nprotected persons, including diplomats, hostage-taking, narcotics-\ntrafficking, and other offenses for which the United States and Hungary \nhave an obligation to extradite or submit to prosecution by reason of a \nmultilateral treaty, convention, or other international agreement. The \nUnited States and Hungary also agree to exclude from the political \noffense exception major common crimes, such as murder, kidnapping, and \nplacing or using explosive devices.\n  The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content \nor extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States. Upon \nentry into force, it will supersede the Convention for the Mutual \nDelivery of Criminals, Fugitives from Justice, in Certain Cases Between \nthe Government of the United States of America and the Austro-Hungarian \nEmpire, signed at Washington, July 3, 1856, with certain exceptions.\n  This Treaty will make a significant contribution to international \ncooperation in law enforcement. I recommend that the Senate give early \nand favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and \nconsent to ratification.\n                                                  William J.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today, as we celebrate the 50th \nanniversary of V-E Day, I am proud to submit a resolution honoring a \nspecial group of World War II veterans, the code talkers of the Lakota \nand Dakota tribes.\n  In the early days of World War II, American radio codes were \ncontinually being broken by Japanese cryptographers, placing American \nlives at great risk.\n  That changed with the code talkers, who used their native American \nIndian languages to communicate and relay critical communications. It \nwas a code the Japanese could not decipher.\n  The heroic efforts of the Lakota and Dakota code talkers saved many \nlives. And it was just one of the many ways in which native Americans \nserved their Nation with great honor and distinction and valor during \nWorld War II.\n  On December 1941, there were approximately 5,000 American Indians in \nthe armed service. By the end of the war, more than 44,500 American \nIndians served in uniform. Indeed, more than 10 percent of all native \nAmericans, alive at the time served in World War II.\n  In 1982, Congress and a Presidential proclamation recognized the \nheroic contributions of the Navajo code talkers and their communication \nefforts during World War II. Today, let us also recognize the patriotic \nefforts of the Lakota code talkers who served in the same line of duty.\n  And let us say to them ``pilamayapelo,'' thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  So the resolution was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 116), with its premable, is as follows:\n                              S. Res. 116\n\n       Whereas the Lakota and Dakota Code Talkers, Native \n     Americans who were members of the Sioux Nation, worked in \n     radio communications during World War II and used their \n     Lakota and Dakota languages to relay communications;\n       Whereas Japanese cryptologists never deciphered the Native \n     American languages that were used as codes during World War \n     II, including the Lakota and Dakota languages; and\n       Whereas the Lakota an Dakota Code Talkers deserve to be \n     recognized for their contribution to the successful \n     resolution of the war effort in the Pacific: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes and commends the \n     Lakota and Dakota Code Talkers for their invaluable \n     contribution to the successful resolution of World War II.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/08/senate-section/article/S6275-5", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              A SALUTE TO GLEN LEE FOR HIS 33-YEAR CAREER\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, B. Glen Lee retired the other day, and just \nabout everybody who ever had dealings with the gentleman will testify \nthat for 33 years he was a worthy public servant--which is just about \nthe best monument to any public servant.\n  Glen Lee is indeed admired by his fellow citizens. It was Hawthorne \nwho asserted years ago that nobody who needs a monument ever ought to \nhave one.\n  Glen Lee does not need a monument, but he deserves the one he has.\n  Mr. President, B. Glen Lee's career was devoted to his diligent work \nwith and for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He was Deputy \nAdministrator of the USDA's Plant Protection and Quarantine Program--a \npart of the Department's Health Inspection Service. In that capacity, \nMr. Lee served so well that last year he was 1 of 6 winners of the 1994 \nExecutive Excellence Award presented by the Professional Development \nLeague.\n  And, Mr. President, in that connection he was singled out for praise \nfor having persuaded the Peoples' Republic of China to allow the entry \nof United States apples and other produce.\n  Glen Lee was graduated from N.C. State University in 1962 and began \nhis career as an inspector in the Plant Pest Control Division of the Ag \nResearch Division in North Carolina. His retirement rolled around while \nhe was serving as the top plant protection official in the United \nStates.\n  He served the American people well.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/08/senate-section/article/S6275-6", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6275-S6276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           THE MOSCOW SUMMIT\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to praise President Clinton \nfor his determination to push forward our national agenda with the \nRussians at this week's summit in Moscow.\n  It is no secret that recently several items of dispute have arisen to \ncloud the relationship between Russia and the United States. In \nresponse, there have been scattered voices calling on the President to \ncancel his trip.\n  Mr. President, such a course would have been a profound mistake, and \nI am gratified that our President had the wisdom and maturity to stay \nthe course. Russia, both in spite of and because of her current \ndifficulties, remains fundamentally important to this country. We must \nremain engaged with the world's other major nuclear power and continue \nto strive to bring her into a European security system of democratic \ncountries.\n  Moreover, British Prime Minister Major, German Chancellor Kohl, and \nFrench President Mitterrand all will be attending the ceremonies \nmarking the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II and honoring \nthe heroic sacrifices that the Russian people made in the victorious \nstruggle against nazism. In that context it is unthinkable that \n[[Page S6276]] the President of the United States would be absent.\n  But President Clinton's attendance at the Moscow summit in no way \nsignals tacit approval of Russia's brutal behavior in Chechnya. On the \ncontrary, President Clinton will make clear, as he has done in the \npast, that while we support the territorial integrity of the Russian \nFederation, we strongly condemn Russian attacks on civilians in \nChechnya. The President will, I trust, also call on President Yeltsin \nto extend the current cease-fire in Chechnya and make it permanent.\n  Mr. President, another area of profound difference with the Kremlin \nis the proposed sale of a Russian nuclear powerplant and delivery of \nnuclear technology and training to Iran. Even though, legally speaking, \nMoscow is correct that its proposed sale falls within international \nguidelines, I am convinced that Iran has embarked upon a program to \nbuild nuclear weapons and, hence, that the sale would be a reckless and \ncounter productive act.\n  Although it is highly unlikely at this point that Russia can be made \nto back down totally, President Clinton--on site, face-to-face with \nPresident Yeltsin--will be able to press for important adjustments such \nas preventing the sale of a gas centrifuge plant, which would \nsignificantly increase the danger of Iran's being able to produce \nweapons-grade enriched uranium. Also, the President may push for an \nagreement whereby spent nuclear fuel would be returned from Iran to \nRussia.\n  I have been dismayed at recent bellicose statements by Senior Russian \nofficials against NATO expansion. In Moscow, President Clinton will \nmake crystal-clear to President Yeltsin that Russia does not have veto \npower over any actions of NATO, including the alliance's enlargement.\n  In addition, President Clinton will reiterate that NATO has always \nbeen a defensive alliance and that binding qualified Central and East \nEuropean democracies into the alliance's comprehensive security system \nwill enhance stability in the region and thereby be a gain, not a \ndanger, for Russia. The President might pose the rhetorical question to \nYeltsin whether Russia would prefer that there be potential isolated \nloose cannon countries in the middle of Europe or fully integrated \nmembers of a defensive alliance led by the United States. The answer is \nsurely the latter.\n  In Moscow, President Clinton will be able to urge President Yeltsin \nto sign Russia up formally as a member of the Partnership for Peace so \nthat it can participate on an ongoing basis in a range of discussions \nwith NATO.\n  There are other crucially important outstanding issues to discuss \nwith the Russians at the Moscow summit. President Clinton will \nundoubtedly urge that Russia continue its budget austerity and \nprivatization programs and other economic reforms.\n  Several arms control issues will certainly be on the agenda, \nincluding prospects for ratification of START II, crafting a joint \nstrategy in support of the indefinite extension of the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty, demarcation between antiballistic missiles and \ntactical missile defense, and holding to the terms of the Conventional \nForces in Europe Treaty.\n  President Clinton will, I am certain, explain in Moscow that \ncooperation on the issues I have enumerated would strengthen Russia's \ncase for membership in important international bodies such as the Group \nof Seven Advanced Industrial Nations.\n  On the other hand, threatening to curtail economic and technical \nassistance to Russia because of disagreements with Russian policy, as \nsome in the majority party in Congress have advocated, would be \n``shooting ourselves in the foot,'' since such a move could only serve \nto harm the transitions to a free-market economy and true political \ndemocracy in Russia that are very much in the United States national \ninterest.\n  Mr. President, the way to move forward in our emerging relationship \nwith the new Russia is not to sit pouting on the sidelines. Rather, it \nis to engage the Russians in open, frank, even contentious dialog.\n  Americans can be proud that we have a President thoroughly versed in \nall these highly complex matters and able to bring the full weight of \nthe Presidency to bear in face-to-face negotiations.\n  I know that all Americans join me in wishing President Clinton every \nsuccess in his vitally important mission.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/08/senate-section/article/S6275-7", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/08/senate-section/article/S6276-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/08/senate-section/article/S6276-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-876.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Indian Child \nWelfare Improvement Act of 1995. Representative Deborah Pryce has \nintroduced companion legislation in the House. The purpose of this bill \nis to clarify the definition of ``Indian child'' in the Indian Child \nWelfare Act of 1978.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Indian Child Welfare \nImprovement Act of 1995. Representative Deborah Pryce has introduced \ncompanion legislation in the House. The purpose of this bill is to \nclarify the definition of ``Indian child'' in the Indian Child Welfare \nAct of 1978.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is a direct response to a situation \ninvolving a family in Ohio. The Rost family of Columbus, OH received \ncustody of twin baby girls in the State of California in November 1993, \nfollowing the voluntary relinquishment of parental rights by both birth \nparents. The biological father did not disclose his native American \nheritage in response to a specific question on the relinquishment \ndocument. In February 1994, the birth father informed his mother of the \npending adoption. Two months later in April 1994, the birth father's \nmother enrolled herself, the birth father and the twin girls with the \nPomo Indian Tribe in California. The adoption agency was then notified \nthat the twins may be eligible for tribal membership, and that the \nadoption could not be finalized without a determination of the \napplicability of the Indian Child Welfare Act.\n  The bill I am introducing today clarifies existing law. The \ndefinition of Indian child in my bill would limit the applicability of \nthe Indian Child Welfare Act to those living on a reservation and their \nchildren, and those who are members of an Indian tribe. In addition, \nthe bill would stipulate that for the purpose of a child custody \nproceeding involving an Indian child, membership in an Indian tribe is \neffective from the actual date of admission in the Indian tribe and \ncannot be applied retroactively.\n  To do otherwise, Mr. President, is not acting in the best interests \nof the adopted children, and that is my principal concern--the \ninterests of the children.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this bill does not in any way weaken or \ncompromise current law or protections extended to Native American \nchildren and families. The Indian Child Welfare Act was enacted to \nprovide safeguards or standards with respect to State court proceedings \ninvolving Indian child custody matters, in an effort to curb \ninvoluntary separation of Indian children from their Indian families, \nheritage, and culture. These objectives and protections are not \nthreatened by the bill I am introducing.\n  Mr. President, the Rost family is now facing a very difficult \nsituation. This bill and the one introduced by Representative Pryce \nwill clarify the Indian Child Welfare Act, and I urge its passage by \nthe Senate.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 765. A bill to amend the Public Buildings Act of 1959 to require \nthe Administrator of General Services to prioritize construction and \nalteration projects in accordance with merit-based needs criteria, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n federal buildings construction and alteration funding improvement act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I'm introducing legislation to help \nensure that funding for the construction and repair of Federal \nbuildings is allocated according to need and priority.\n  First, the bill would require the President to submit the \nadministration's building construction budget request in the form of a \nprioritized list of projects. Second, and most importantly, the bill \nwould require the General Services Administration to prepare and \nmaintain a ranked priority list of all ongoing and proposed \nconstruction projects. The list would be updated and reprioritized with \neach new project added either through administrative or congressional \naction.\n  Last year, the U.S. Government spent nearly $400 million on Federal \nbuilding construction and repair. That is an enormous sum of money. \nClearly, the Federal building construction program can and must share \nin the sacrifice as we seek to gain control over the deficit.\n  As we rein in spending, it's more critical now than ever to ensure \nthat scarce financial resources are allocated to our highest \npriorities.\n  In order to trim the fat in an informed and efficient manner \nCongress, the administration and the taxpaying public must know what \nour construction priorities are.\n  Earlier this year, during debate on the rescission bill, the Senate \nconsidered proposals to cut Federal construction funding. The list of \nprojects proposed for defunding was rather arbitrary and capricious. \nThe tenets of good government dictate that when we reduce spending, our \nlowest priorities should be put on the chopping block first. Yet, \nCongress can not readily determine what those priorities are. By \nrequiring the General Services Administration, which administers the \nFederal building fund, to maintain a ranked list of project priorities, \nwe can be sure that funding decisions will be made on the basis of \nmerit rather than politics or congressional caprice.\n  Mr. President, foremost, this amendment will help us address the pork \nbarrel politics which has played far too great a role in the process of \nFederal building construction. Currently, when a member decides a new \nbuilding is needed in his or her State or district, the General \nServices Administration conducts what's known as an 11b survey to \ndetermine the need. In most cases, the GSA determines that a need \n[[Page S6278]] exists. The study is then used to justify project \nauthorization and appropriation, even though a finding of need is not a \nfinding that such a project is a priority.\n  As projects that are not in the President's budget request are added \nby Congress we do not always have a clear idea of where they are ranked \namong competing priorities. Passage of this legislation will ensure \nthat this vital information is readily available.\n  I hope that the relevant committees will expeditiously examine this \nproposal in the hope that we can approve rapidly this relatively minor \nbut I believe important and helpful change in procedure.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Biomaterials Access \n     Assurance Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) each year millions of citizens of the United States \n     depend on the availability of [[Page S6284]] lifesaving or \n     life-enhancing medical devices, many of which are permanently \n     implantable within the human body;\n       (2) a continued supply of raw materials and component parts \n     is necessary for the invention, development, improvement, and \n     maintenance of the supply of the devices;\n       (3) most of the medical devices are made with raw materials \n     and component parts that--\n       (A) are not designed or manufactured specifically for use \n     in medical devices; and\n       (B) come in contact with internal human tissue;\n       (4) the raw materials and component parts also are used in \n     a variety of nonmedical products;\n       (5) because small quantities of the raw materials and \n     component parts are used for medical devices, sales of raw \n     materials and component parts for medical devices constitute \n     an extremely small portion of the overall market for the raw \n     materials and medical devices;\n       (6) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 301 et seq.), manufacturers of medical devices are \n     required to demonstrate that the medical devices are safe and \n     effective, including demonstrating that the products are \n     properly designed and have adequate warnings or instructions;\n       (7) notwithstanding the fact that raw materials and \n     component parts suppliers do not design, produce, or test a \n     final medical device, the suppliers have been the subject of \n     actions alleging inadequate--\n       (A) design and testing of medical devices manufactured with \n     materials or parts supplied by the suppliers; or\n       (B) warnings related to the use of such medical devices;\n       (8) even though suppliers of raw materials and component \n     parts have very rarely been held liable in such actions, such \n     suppliers have ceased supplying certain raw materials and \n     component parts for use in medical devices because the costs \n     associated with litigation in order to ensure a favorable \n     judgment for the suppliers far exceeds the total potential \n     sales revenues from sales by such suppliers to the medical \n     device industry;\n       (9) unless alternate sources of supply can be found, the \n     unavailability of raw materials and component parts for \n     medical devices will lead to unavailability of lifesaving and \n     life-enhancing medical devices;\n       (10) because other suppliers of the raw materials and \n     component parts in foreign nations are refusing to sell raw \n     materials or component parts for use in manufacturing certain \n     medical devices in the United States, the prospects for \n     development of new sources of supply for the full range of \n     threatened raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices are remote;\n       (11) it is unlikely that the small market for such raw \n     materials and component parts in the United States could \n     support the large investment needed to develop new suppliers \n     of such raw materials and component parts;\n       (12) attempts to develop such new suppliers would raise the \n     cost of medical devices;\n       (13) courts that have considered the duties of the \n     suppliers of the raw materials and component parts have \n     generally found that the suppliers do not have a duty--\n       (A) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of a raw \n     material or component part in a medical device; and\n       (B) to warn consumers concerning the safety and \n     effectiveness of a medical device;\n       (14) attempts to impose the duties referred to in \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (13) on suppliers of \n     the raw materials and component parts would cause more harm \n     than good by driving the suppliers to cease supplying \n     manufacturers of medical devices; and\n       (15) in order to safeguard the availability of a wide \n     variety of lifesaving and life-enhancing medical devices, \n     immediate action is needed--\n       (A) to clarify the permissible bases of liability for \n     suppliers of raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices; and\n       (B) to provide expeditious procedures to dispose of \n     unwarranted suits against the suppliers in such manner as to \n     minimize litigation costs.\n\n     SEC. 203.

The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and \nrevenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con.

The current estimate of the \ndeficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $238 \nbillion, $3.1 billion below the maximum deficit amount for 1995 of $241 \nbillion.\n  Since my last report, dated April 24, 1995, there has been no action \nthat affects the current level of budget authority, outlays, or \nrevenues.\n  The report follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 1995.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, no other legislation which is \nlikely to come before the Congress this year will have more direct \nimpact on my State, North Dakota, and the people who live there than \nthe 1995 farm bill. For a farm State, for a State with a predominantly \nrural economy, it is critically important legislation.\n  When Congress and the President begin to draft that legislation, I \nbelieve it is essential that we be about the business of fundamental \nreform. The time for farm program facelifts has long since passed. It \nis time for real change, change that returns the farm program to its \nfundamental and original mission: helping family farmers survive and \nprosper.\n  I recently wrote a guest editorial which was published in a number of \nNorth Dakota newspapers which outlined my thinking on this important \nissue in some detail. I would like to share that article, and those \nthoughts, with my colleagues and ask that it be reprinted at this point \nin the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n   No More Facelifts for the Farm Program--It's Time for Real Reform\n\n                   (By U.S. Senator Byron L. Dorgan)\n\n       The new U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, is \n     coming to North Dakota Friday at my invitation to meet with \n     family farmers. His visit comes at both an opportune and very \n     challenging time.\n       This year Congress will cut federal spending to reduce the \n     deficit. It will also write a new five year farm program. The \n     two are closely related. Budget pressures will limit the \n     amount of money available for a farm program.\n       Farm program price supports have already been cut deeply--\n     slashed by 62% since 1986--but still, some leaders in the new \n     Congress are pushing for even deeper cuts. House Majority \n     Leader Dick Armey (R-TX) and Senate Agriculture Committee \n     Chair Richard Lugar (R-IN) are calling outright for the \n     federal farm program to be phased down and, effectively, \n     abolished.\n       Those of us who believe that a decent farm program is \n     essential to the survival of family farmers face a major \n     challenge. To retain a decent farm program, we are going to \n     have to propose new, and more effective approaches. We must \n     take a fresh look at what works and what doesn't in the farm \n     program.\n       I hope that will be the focus of the discussion in North \n     Dakota on Friday with the Secretary of Agriculture.\n       At the outset we have to admit that the current farm \n     program doesn't work very well.\n       First, price supports are too low to offer real protection \n     to family-sized farms. That's because the nation's largest \n     farms--often big corporate farms--soak up too much of the \n     farm program's funds.\n       Second, the current farm program is far too complicated.\n       Third, it is built on a ``supply management'' approach that \n     no longer works. In the new global market place of the 1990's \n     and beyond, it is virtually impossible for one nation to \n     control supplies. When we cut production of a commodity, \n     other countries eargerly step in and fill the gap.\n       The bottom line is that the current farm program does not \n     do a good job serving as a safety net for family farmers nor \n     does it do much to boost market prices for farm commodities.\n       Under the current program, we have ended up with more \n     government employees to run the farm program, and fewer \n     family farmers. That's moving in the wrong \n     direction. [[Page S6289]] \n       So, this year we need real reform--not another farm program \n     facelift.\n\n\n                             a new approach\n\n       The first thing we must do in re-thinking the federal farm \n     program is to establish a new benchmark for farm legislation, \n     one that focuses on preserving and building a network of \n     family farms which are the backbone of rural America's \n     economy and its communities.\n       The first sentence in the new 1995 Farm Bill should state, \n     clearly, that the objective of the federal farm program is to \n     help preserve and build a network of family farms. Everything \n     after that must work to make that goal a reality.\n       If the purpose of the farm program isn't to give family \n     farmers an opportunity to make a living on the farm, then we \n     ought to scrap it. We don't need a farm program that helps \n     giant agri-factories plow the ground.\n\n\n               the dorgan plan to strengthen family farms\n\n       I propose a family farm-targeted farm program, which would \n     provide a better price safety net for family farmers.\n       It would end government interference so that all farmers \n     could make their own production decisions based on the best \n     use of their land resources, the opportunities of the \n     marketplace, and their skills and knowledge as producers.\n       Here is how it would work:\n       1. My plan would establish a new Family Farm Target Price \n     at $4.50 per bushel on wheat (compared to the current target \n     price of $4.00 per bushel) up to the first 20,000 bushels of \n     production. Proportional target prices and production levels \n     would be set to cover feed grains or a producer's mix of \n     basic farm program commodities.\n       2. Farmers would be free to make their own decisions about \n     what they produce based on the market situation. Production \n     beyond the amount of grain eligible for target prices, would \n     be up to the farmer, and would not receive farm program \n     benefits.\n       If someone wants to farm an entire county, they have every \n     right to do that. But under my plan, they, like family-sized \n     farms would get price protection for 20,000 bushels of wheat \n     produced. What they produce above that, they do without any \n     government interference, and without price supports--they \n     assume all the risks of the market place.\n       3. On those first 20,000 bushels of wheat, the plan would \n     provide non-recourse market-opportunity loans set at out-of-\n     pocket production costs as determined by the Secretary of \n     Agriculture. Crops produced beyond this benchmark level would \n     not be eligible for this loan.\n       4. It would extend the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) \n     and make it more flexible to assist producers in meeting \n     stewardship and environmental goals. Savings achieved by \n     making some changes in the CRP program could be used to \n     restore funding for other conservation programs that assist \n     farmers, and to improve farm program support prices.\n       5. It would limit participation in the farm price support \n     program to those who are actively engaged in farming, and end \n     program payments to off-farm investors. We could use the \n     savings to improve the safety net of price supports for \n     family farmers.\n       My plan tightly focuses federal farm programs--and \n     dollars--on family farmers. It would put price supports under \n     family farmers, rather than under farm commodities.\n       It will provide our farm families the opportunity to make a \n     living at efficient levels of production.\n       It will provide an abundant supply of efficiently produced \n     food and fiber for our nation, and make the best use of \n     limited federal farm program dollars. It will provide the \n     strongest price support for the first increment of production \n     which will provide the most help for family sized farms.\n       It will end the practice of providing unnecessary and \n     unlimited price protection to the nation's largest corporate \n     farms, while shortchanging the nation's family farmers.\n       My farm program proposal would also end the practice of \n     paying price supports to off-farm investors. We would define \n     who is really a farmer and who is farming the system. Under \n     my plan, the farm price safety net would go to actual farm \n     operators (and retired farmers who derive a majority of their \n     income from crop-share arrangements). The safety net would \n     extend only to those who are engaged in the day-to-day \n     running of a farm operation or depend on a farm operation for \n     a majority of their income.\n       We would repeal and close the loopholes by which some of \n     the biggest landholders and corporations receive multiple \n     farm program entitlements.\n       We need to get back to the original purpose of agricultural \n     programs: to preserve and protect a network of family farms \n     and help them compete in an unpredictable world in which \n     weather, market conditions, and economic policies constantly \n     undermine their efficiency and their productivity.\n       My family farm targeted farm program would give family \n     farmers a chance--an opportunity--to preserve a production \n     system and a lifestyle that is important to our \n     country.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/08/senate-section/article/S6288-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n HONORING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT LOS ANGELES BASKETBALL COACH \n                              JIM HARRICK\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a great \nman and a great head coach; Jim Harrick of the UCLA Bruins.\n  While everyone may be familiar with Jim's most recent accomplishment, \nwinning the 1995 NCAA Championship, those that have followed his career \nsee a man that has accepted challenge after challenge and built a \nreputation for success.\n  Jim attended the University of Charleston were, in addition to \nreceiving his bachelor's degree in speech, he earned a place in the \nHall of Fame and Alumni Gallery of Achievement. He then went on to \ncomplete his master's degree in education from the University of \nSouthern California.\n  Jim began his coaching career at Morningside High in Los Angeles, \naveraging over 25 victories and winning three Sky League titles in four \nseasons. After distinguishing himself as an assistant coach at Utah \nState and later UCLA, Jim accepted the head coach position at \nPepperdine University. In his nine seasons at Pepperdine, coach Harrick \nwon five conference titles, four WCAC Coach of the Year Awards, and, of \ncourse, the invitation to come back to UCLA as the new head coach.\n  The UCLA basketball program has flourish under Jim's direction. He is \nthe first UCLA coach to have 7 consecutive 20-win seasons and 7 \nstraight tournament bids in his initial 7 seasons. At 146 wins and 54 \nlosses, he also owns the best UCLA record after his first 200 games. \nUnder coach Harrick's tutelage, the Bruins have advanced to the NCAA \ntournament's second round five times, the Sweet 16 three times, the \nElite Eight twice and, in 1995, earned the crowning achievement as NCAA \nNational Champions.\n  And it is important to note that Jim Harrick's successes have not all \ncome on the basketball court. He and his wife, Sally, celebrate 34 \nyears of marriage and proudly speak of their three sons, Monte, Jim, \nand Glenn, and of their granddaughter, Morgan Paige. His integrity and \ncharacter are well known and have earned him invitations to travel the \nworld as an American goodwill ambassador.\n  His dedication to the game, his concern with the well-being of the \nplayers, his focus and determination, and the integrity of the UCLA \nprogram all show his fine qualities as a coach and as an \nAmerican.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/08/senate-section/article/S6289-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, MAY 9, 1995\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.
