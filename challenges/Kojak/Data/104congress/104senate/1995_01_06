And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in \nthine heart: And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, \nand shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou \nwalkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest \nup.--Deuteronomy 6:4-7.\n  God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, God of our fathers, we pray this \nmorning for our families. Be especially with those who are traumatized \nby the process of moving to Washington--finding a residence and \nsettling in a new neighborhood--as the typical Senate schedule begins \nto build. Help your servants to take seriously the fact that the \nfoundation of the social order is the family. As the family \ndisintegrates, society collapses. Grant to every spouse and every child \na special dispensation of grace as the process of legislation demands \nmore and more time from Senators and staffs.\n  Gracious Father in Heaven, bless our families. Help us to be faithful \nto them in giving our love, attention, and care. Help us to be faithful \nto ourselves, allowing time to receive the love, patience, and support \nfrom our families which we need and depend upon so much.\n  Eternal God, as I close this prayer, thank you for the great \nprivilege of serving the Senate through seven Congresses.\n  In the name of the King of kings, and the Lord of lords.

The distinguished Senator from Minnesota \nis recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. President, yesterday, in introducing an amendment with Senator \nLevin of Michigan, Senator Feingold, and Senator Lautenberg which dealt \nwith lobby disclosure but mainly with gift bans, I on the floor of the \nSenate read from what I think is a very, very interesting, very \nimportant, and very revealing piece in Roll Call of October 17, 1994. \nThe title is, ``How Lobbyists Put Meals, Gifts to Work.''\n\n       This memo, obtained by Roll Call, says one prominent D.C. \n     firm lays out 1994 strategy, \n     [[Page S530]] including meals, campaign contributions * * *.\n\n  And we talked yesterday about trips.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that I am going to introduce today \nfocuses on lobbying. Yesterday, what I urged my colleagues--since so \nmany of us ran on a reform agenda and since so many of us have talked \nabout the need to make this process more accountable, open, and \nhonest--I asked my colleagues really, under the leadership of Senator \nLevin, to vote on an amendment which would say that we would put an end \nto this taking of gifts. The vote was ``no.''\n  So today, focusing on the same question, I am going to, in this \namendment, essentially say to my colleagues if you are going to vote \n``no'' against the taking of gifts, the gift ban part, at least let us \nput a stop to this, I think, insidious connection between the lobbying \nand the taking of cash and campaign contributions.\n  So this amendment is going to prohibit lobbyists who may lobby within \nthe preceding year from making contributions to or soliciting \ncontributions for Members of Congress and from lobbying Members of \nCongress to whom they have contributed or on whose behalf they have \nsolicited funds within the previous year.\n  In other words, if you have made a contribution or you have \ninstructed a PAC you control to make a contribution to a candidate, \nthen for 1 year thereafter you should not be lobbying that candidate or \nstaff. Vice versa, if you have been in that office lobbying a Senator \nor lobbying staff, then there is a 1-year window here whereby you would \nnot be allowed to make a campaign contribution.\n  This amendment is all about congressional accountability. Let me \nrepeat that. This amendment is all about congressional accountability. \nAnd it is designed to sever the connection between lobbyists and big \nPAC contributions to Members of Congress.\n  This covers congressional staff, and it would prohibit lobbyists from \nlobbying new Members of Congress to whom they have contributed or on \nwhose behalf they have solicited funds during the past year which I \nthink, from the point of view of the new class, also represents real \nreform.\n  Mr. President, this amendment was part of S. 3, which the Senate \npassed by a very lopsided vote. Senators then said that they thought \nthis was an important reform idea, or I should say an important reform \nmeasure. It would prohibit the practice whereby a lobbyist who lobbies \na Member for a client then directs that client to make a contribution \nto the Member. It closes the potential loophole allowing lobbyists to \nget around the prohibition by having clients make contributions to \nMembers to further their lobbying efforts.\n  In other words, it is not just a question of lobbyists not being able \nto do it, but it is also a question of a lobbyist not being able to \ninstruct a client to make such a contribution.\n  This amendment will also prohibit a lobbyist from directing that a \ncontribution be made by a political action committee to a Member of \nCongress whom that lobbyist has lobbied during the past year, a key \nelement of any reform effort designed to sever--let me emphasize that--\nthe connection, big money connection, between large lobbying firms, \ntheir clients, and PAC's.\n  Mr. President, one more time, we have before us the Congressional \nAccountability Act. We are talking about how to make this process more \naccountable. Reform is in the air in America. We started out this \nsession on the basis of a focus on reform, and this particular \namendment speaks to that question.\n  Yesterday, I urged my colleagues to vote for an amendment that I \nthought was a huge step forward--not a small step forward, but a huge \nstep forward--in changing the political culture of Washington in \nputting a stop to taking these gifts. Many Senators, though I am proud \nto say by no means all Senators, but certainly many Senators, and on \nthe other side of the aisle, all Senators on the other side of the \naisle--I guess there were two exceptions--voted ``no.'' With this \namendment, I am saying if you are not willing to put an end to the \naccepting of gifts, at least put an end to this insidious connection \nbetween lobbying and the giving of money.\n  If there is one thing we have heard from people in the country, it is \nthat they do not like this mix of money and politics. They do not like \nthe fact that some people march on Washington every day. They do not \nlike the fact that this is such a closed loop in which they do not feel \nas if they participate. And I cannot think of an amendment that would \nspeak more clearly and more directly to people's concerns than this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, this provision, when this amendment was first brought \nup for S. 3--which again I remind my colleagues was passed by an \noverwhelmingly positive vote--was crafted narrowly to withstand the \ntest of constitutionality. The Court has said that any seeming \ninfringement on first amendment speech rights has to be balanced \nagainst concerns about corruption or the appearance of corruption. That \nis what we are talking about here, the appearance of corruption. If you \nrun for office and you are elected, lobbyists come in and lobby you, \nand then later there is a contribution. Or, vice versa, you receive a \ncontribution and lobbyists instruct a PAC or client to make a \ncontribution to you, and then shortly thereafter the lobbyist is in \nyour office.\n  If you want to talk about the appearance of corruption and if you \nwant to talk about a way of making this process more accountable and \nyou want to talk about a way that Senators can live up to our mandate \nto be reformers, this amendment speaks directly to this question.\n  Mr. President, again, this amendment meets that test. It is directed \nnarrowly at the question of the appearance of corruption or \nimpropriety. Let me emphasis that again. It is directed narrowly at the \nquestion of the appearance of corruption or impropriety.\n And it covers only those situations where a lobbyist has made a \nlobbying contact and then contributes, solicits on behalf of, or \ndirects that a contribution be made to a Member.\n\n  It attempts to define who is a lobbyist. By the way, so no mistake \nwill be made, we simply go by the current definition. We get into none \nof the debate and argument on the reform of lobby disclosure. We just \ngo with the current definition which--and by the way, I think all of us \nagree, if our words are to be believed--eventually has to be changed. \nThere are many who lobby who are not officially registered as lobbyists \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I also want to include in the Record a letter from the \nWhite House, January 5, 1995, which was addressed to the Speaker, in \nwhich the focus is on congressional reform, with a strong focus on this \nwhole question of lobbying reform.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                      Washington, January 5, 1995.\n     Hon. Newt Gingrich,\n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: We have an opportunity to make historic \n     change in the way that Washington works and the government \n     does the people's business.\n       This week, the Congress has begun to take important and \n     positive steps to change its operations for the better. \n     Shrinking the number of committees, reducing staff, and other \n     measures are valuable, and long overdue. The passage of \n     legislation that would apply to Congress the laws that apply \n     to the public is only fair, is simple common sense, and is \n     also long overdue. I hope that this time, unlike the last \n     session of Congress, the Senate follows the House's action. I \n     congratulate you on these steps.\n       But true congressional reform must reduce the power of \n     lobbyists and special interests. The power of organized money \n     in Washington hurts the middle class, bloats spending and the \n     deficit, and blocks needed change. Today, some 90,000 people \n     in Washington are associated with lobbying Congress on behalf \n     of specific interests, which too often are able to manipulate \n     the congressional process to insert spending projects or tax \n     provisions in legislation that do not serve the larger \n     public's interest. Lobby power coupled with the ever-\n     escalating cost of campaigns, which has risen fourfold over \n     the past two decades, gives wealthy interests and wealthy \n     candidates disproportionate influence in decisionmaking.\n       These are not partisan concerns; they are American \n     concerns. I urge you, as you undertake the task of reforming \n     Congress, to take on these real political reform issues.\n       First, as you enact legislation to apply general laws to \n     Congress, it is vital that professional lobbyists be barred \n     from giving \n     [[Page S531]] gifts, meals and entertainment to members of \n     Congress--just as they are now barred from giving these \n     benefits to executive branch officials.\n       Second, Congress should also quickly enact legislation to \n     bring professional lobbyists into the sunlight of public \n     scrutiny. The current lobby disclosure statute is cumbersome \n     and\n      antiquated. Lobbyists should disclose who their clients are, \n     what bills they seek to pass or block, and how much they \n     are paid.\n       Third, I am pleased that the Congress wants to pass a line \n     item veto authority for the President, something that I have \n     consistently supported before and during the 1992 campaign \n     and since. The line item veto authority will help us cut \n     unnecessary spending and reduce the budget deficit. It is a \n     powerful tool for fighting special interests, who too often \n     are able to win approval of wasteful projects through \n     manipulation of the congressional process, and bury them in \n     massive bills where they are protected from Presidential \n     vetoes. It will increase the accountability of government. I \n     want a strong version of the line item veto, one that enables \n     the President to take direct steps to curb wasteful spending. \n     This is clearly an area where both parties can come together \n     in the national interest, and I look forward to working with \n     the Congress to quickly enact this measure.\n       Finally, we must clean up political campaigns, limit the \n     cost of campaigning, reduce the role of special interests, \n     and increase the role of ordinary citizens. Real campaign \n     finance reform, too, should be an area of bipartisan \n     cooperation. Requiring broadcasters to provide time to bona \n     fide candidates would cut the cost of campaigning and ensure \n     that voters hear all arguments, regardless of candidate \n     wealth. Strong proposals for free TV time have been \n     introduced in previous years by Senator Dole and by the new \n     chair of the House Commerce Committee, Rep. Thomas Bliley; \n     these proposals should be the basis of agreement on reform.\n       I look forward to working with the Congress to achieve \n     results that are bipartisan, bold, and give the government \n     back to the people.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me just summarize for my \ncolleagues, because I think that we will be casting an important vote \non this amendment, I think it is an important vote because this is sort \nof a litmus test as to how committed we are to reform.\n  I cite this as a relevant document: Roll Call, Monday, October 17, \nwhere the whole focus is on meals and travel and campaign \ncontributions, as ways of having access for clients. Mr. President, if \nyou want to talk about a memo that tells it all, if you want to talk \nabout a memo that, unfortunately, sort of speaks to the very concerns \nthat people have about this process, this is an example.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this Roll Call piece be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Roll Call, Oct. 17, 1994]\n\n                 How Lobbyists Put Meals, Gifts to Work\n\n                         (By Timothy J. Burger)\n\n       During the protracted debate over new lobbying and gift \n     rules--which went down to stunning defeat in the waning days \n     of the second session--Members argued violently over the \n     influence of lobbyist-paid meals and campaign contributions.\n       ``Now, a Big Mac will not buy influence from anybody. I am \n     sure $15,000 will not buy influence from anybody,'' Rep. Dan \n     Burton (R-Ind) said on the floor.\n       Mocked retiring House Minority Leader Bob Michel (R-Ill): \n     ``Here we are today demeaning ourselves by saying. `Oh, \n     please stop me before I accept another cup of coffee and a \n     Danish.'''\n       Despite such protestations, meals and contributions are \n     fixtures in the lobbying world--and internal documents from a \n     prominent Washington lobbying firm demonstrate just how \n     central they are to conducting business.\n       In December 1993, principals of Gold and Liebengood \n     assembled plans for expanding their network of Hill contacts \n     for 1994.\n       The planning documents, copies of which were obtained by \n     Roll Call, offer a rare glimpse into the world of lobbying \n     and, specifically, how meals, gifts, and contributions are \n     put to use.\n       Take, for instance, the strategy for James Capel and Co. \n     Ltd., a British securities firm, that is a longtime client of \n     Gold and Liebengood.\n       According to the memo: ``Capel is desirous of dinners, \n     lunches, and meetings for themselves and their clients, with \n     a diverse list of Members of Congress Capel has agreed to pay \n     G a separate fee for each and every one of these \n     Congressional visits we arrange.\n       Potential targets: John Dingell, Jack Brooks, Norman \n     Mineta, and Al Swift, were the initial Members mentioned. \n     Capel would be receptive to suggestions from us.''\n       The 12-page memo was drafted by Charles Merin, a Gold and \n     Liebengood partner, and John Scruggs, the firm's managing \n     director and a former aide to then-Rep. Trent Lott (R-Miss). \n     It includes specific agencies for each of the principals.\n       Among Scruggs's ``targets'' were Reps. Porter Goss (R-Fla) \n     and Pat Danner (D-Mo).\n       ``Congresswoman Danner defeated Tom Coleman. Coleman was a \n     strong and consistent supporter of Wilcox. Need to develop \n     similar relationship with Danner,'' the memo noted. ``Action: \n     Continue to work with staff (hesitancy to accept gifts). Ask \n     Chuck Merin for introduction followed by fundraising \n     activity.''\n       Wilcox, a manufacturing company, is a former Gold and \n     Leibengood client.\n       Regarding Goss, the outline noted: ``Porter Goss became a \n     member of the Rules Committee early in this Congress. Only \n     Minority Member on the committee with whom I do not have an \n     established relationship.\n       ``Action: Seek opportunity for campaign contribution, \n     followed by goodwill development.''\n       It appears, however, that Gold and Liebengood did not \n     follow through on all of its plans. Goss and Danner told Roll \n     Call they never heard from Scruggs.\n       Among the ``targets'' outlined for Merin were Alan Roth, \n     staff director of the House Energy and Commerce Committee--\n     ``Multiple client interests before the Committee would be \n     enhanced by a better working relationship with him''--and \n     Democratic Reps. Bobby Rush (Ill), Scotty Baesler (Ky), and \n     Bobby Scott (Va).\n       The Merin outline describes the Congressmen as ``Promising \n     Freshman Members with whom I need to firm up an existing, but \n     casual relationship.\n       ``Action: Arrange sit-downs/meals with these Members and \n     mutual Member friends.\n       ``Ask Jack Clough, former E Committee top aide, to \n     arrange a lunch.''\n       Merin said he never followed through with Roth, Baesler, or \n     Scott and that he become acquainted with Rush through \n     meetings, not meals, with the Congressman.\n       Scruggs, Merin, and a founding partner, former Senate \n     Sergeant at Arms Howard Liebengood, last week were shown \n     copies of the documents obtained by Roll Call.\n       In a letter of response, Scruggs wrote: ``The documents are \n     not newsworthy in any respect and were intended solely for \n     private not public consumption. The activities suggested in \n     the documents are neither unique nor inappropriate in any \n     manner. As this firm is bipartisan and has no Political \n     Action Committee, all members are encouraged to participate \n     in political development-individually and they do.''\n       Gold and Liebengood is in the final year of a five-year \n     buyout and will be wholly owned by Burson-Marsteller at the \n     end of 1994.\n       The memo also documents the firm's involvement in \n     leadership races.\n       Written some 11 months ago, the Gold and Liebengood \n     ``Campaign Activity Outline'' discussed Merin's plans to work \n     on the year's most dramatic long-shot leadership race: \n     ``Charlie Rose for Speaker.''\n       Merin's plans were to ``Continue working with Rose and his \n     campaign deputies to broaden the network of Member \n     commitments.''\n       This type of activity is ``always a game of Russian \n     roulette,'' said Howard Marlowe of the lobbying firm, Marlowe \n     & Co., who served as president of the American League of \n     Lobbyists from 1988 to 1990 and is a member of the \n     organization's board.\n       ``As long as you back the winner, then you've made the \n     right choice,'' said Marlowe. ``[And] in this case, the loser \n     is somebody who's still around and so whatever you did to \n     help him or her out is probably going to be remembered. So I \n     think that probably represents a smart political move on \n     their part.''\n       But, Marlowe said, ``I think in general lobbyist ought to \n     probably try to refrain from getting involved in the internal \n     leadership of the House or Senate.''\n       Said Merin of his involvement in the leadership race: ``The \n     election of a Speaker of the House, much like the appointment \n     of any Member to any committee, is a matter exclusively and \n     totally within the purview of the institution. The ability of \n     any outsider to leverage the process to his or her advantage \n     is virtually nil. The only real role any outside can play in \n     the process is to provide limited advice and counsel.''\n       Said Rose: ``I don't see Chuck Merin much more than I see \n     other lobbyists that visit me. But be's a friend. * * * He \n     has been helping me [with] new candidates and [to] raise \n     money from some of his clients. * * * Some of the people he \n     represents have given money to my leadership PAC. * * * He's \n     told them that I have a good chance to be Speaker.''\n       Rose noted that ``since the beginning of Congress, \n     [lobbying firms] have helped people become Speaker and \n     Majority Leader and get elected to Congress. The vote for \n     leadership around here comes from the Democratic Caucus. And \n     Chuck has helped me raise money for Democratic candidates.''\n       Also on Merin's agenda is ``Vic Fazio for Caucus Chair.''\n       The plan called for Merin to ``Assist Fazio [D-Calif] with \n     Member contacts on an as directed basis, relative to hid bid \n     to succeed Steny Hoyer.'' Fazio, the Democratic Caucus vice \n     chairman, is unopposed in a bid to succeed Hoyer.\n       Asked about the memo, a Fazio aide said: ``Mr. Merin has \n     been a good friend and supportive of Mr. Fazio's campaigns in \n     the past.''\n       [[Page S532]] The most prominent political activity listed \n     for Scruggs, meanwhile, is the ``Bob Walker for Whip'' \n     campaign. Walker (Pa) is running against Reps. Tom DeLay \n     (Texas) and Bill McCollum (Fla) for the GOP Whip post that \n     Rep. Newt Gingrich (Ga) will leave when he's elected \n     Republican Leader in December.\n       Scruggs, the memo states, is ``Serving on advisory group of \n     lobbyists supporting Walker Whip campaign.'' It cites a \n     ``Commitment\n      to do `meet and greets' for GOP candidates identified by \n     Walker as he campaigns for potential GOP freshmen in next \n     year's Congressional races.''\n       Said Walker in an interview, ``This is a guy who is a \n     personal friend of mine of 20 years standing. * * * It's not \n     being done as a lobbyist. It's being done as a personal \n     friend.'' Walker said Scruggs ``consults with me from time to \n     time * * * and has put together some meet and greets.'' \n     Walker said Scruggs is only one of many lobbyists working on \n     his behalf.\n       Gold and Liebengood does not have a PAC and does not as a \n     firm formally back specific candidates, although its 13 \n     individual lobbyists are encouraged to follow their own \n     political development agendas. This sometimes leads Gold and \n     Liebengood lobbyists to support opposing candidates for the \n     same office.\n       Underscoring this point, Scruggs said in the interview that \n     ``Gold and Liebengood is not working for Charlie Rose for \n     Speaker. Because I'm the managing director and I'm supporting \n     Newt Gingrich for Speaker and I think that sort of sums it \n     up.''\n       Said Ellen Miller, executive director of the Center for \n     Responsive Politics: ``We always expect this happens. But you \n     know that level of involvement in leadership races is pretty \n     startling. It's another chapter in the book `How Washington \n     Really Works'. * * * I'm afraid it's not unique at all.''\n       ``Do I know we get targeted? Sure,'' said Goss. As a public \n     official, ``You give up some privacy and you just expect \n     people are trying to figure out ways to get access to get \n     their views across.''\n       Other political development projects listed for Merin:\n       ``Mel Watts [sic] for a Rules Committee seat. The \n     Congressional Black Caucus will be able to recommend a \n     successor to [A]lan Wheat on the Rules Committee. Mel is the \n     CBC Chairman's choice for that vacancy. Assist Mel in \n     building a network of non-CBC Steering and Policy Committee \n     Members who will support his appointment.''\n       Watt said this month he has no knowledge of the memo or \n     Merin's interest in winning him a spot on the Rules panel.\n       ``Al Wynn for an Energy and Commerce Committee Seat. \n     Maryland is looking to get back the seat it lost with Tom \n     McMillen's defeat. Anticipated Member defeats/departures will \n     create Democratic vacancies at the Committee. Help Albert \n     craft his campaign for an appointment.'' Merin gave Wynn's \n     re-election $200, according to FEC records.\n       An aide to Wynn--who had previously expressed interest in \n     Rules, not Energy and Commerce--had no comment.\n       ``Greg Laughlin for a Ways and Means Committee Seat. The \n     departure of Representatives Pickle and Andrews from the \n     Congress will create two vacancies for Texas Democrats to \n     fill. Greg is the leading delegation choice for one of those \n     vacancies. Assist him in securing non-Texas Steering and \n     Policy Committee votes as the year goes on.''\n       Laughlin could not be reached for comment.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, to summarize, this amendment is \ndesigned to prohibit lobbyists from making contributions to, or \nsoliciting contributions for Members of Congress whom they have lobbied \nwithin the preceding year, and from lobbying Members of Congress to \nwhom they have contributed or on whose behalf they have solicited funds \nwithin the previous year.\n  If you have gone in--this includes staff as well--if you have gone in \nto see one of the Senators as a lobbyist or gone in to lobby with \nstaff, then for 1 year--that is what we are talking about--you are not \nallowed to make campaign contributions. If you have contributed to a \nSenator, then within a 1-year period of time, you are prohibited from \nlobbying the Senator or staff.\n  This is all about making this process more open. This is all about \nreform. This is all about making sure we have a system in our country \nof democracy for the many and not democracy for the few. This is all \nabout congressional accountability. And yesterday, too many of my \ncolleagues--as it did not get a majority vote--voted against ending \nthis practice of receiving the gifts, the argument being we will get to \nit later. By the way, since I have been here in the Senate, I have \nheard that argument over and over and over again. I think we will get \nto it later this term. I know I will bring this up over and over and \nover again until we do get to it.\n  Today I say this to my colleagues: If you are not going to agree with \nthe proposition that we should put an end to the taking of these gifts \nnow, then at least agree to the proposition--if we are talking about \ncongressional accountability--that we ought not to be taking this money \nfrom lobbyists. At least agree there ought to be a 1-year period of \ntime between the lobbying activity and the giving of money. Does it not \nseem as if this is reasonable? Does it not seem as if this is a prudent \ncourse? Does it not seem that if we are talking about reform, we ought \nto vote for this? We cannot separate the legislative lives we live and \nhow we vote from the words we speak.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 5\n\n      (Purpose: To restrict political contributions by lobbyists)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, I, in a short period of time, have to \nget ready for a call-in that I do back with Minnesotans. So not seeing \nanybody, I am wondering whether colleagues are interested in debating \nthis. If not, I will ask unanimous consent that this amendment, for the \nmoment, be set aside.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. What was \nthe specific point that the Senator from Minnesota requested?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I asked unanimous consent that if there \nwas no further debate at the moment, that my amendment be temporarily \nset aside. I have another engagement, but I will be back at 11 and \nready to debate.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I think some debate may proceed on your amendment while \nyou are gone because people on our side of the aisle want to speak on \nthat. So I would like to keep his amendment before the body.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Iowa that \nthat course is very reasonable, as long as I would have time to \nrespond. I will be back here at 11.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Obviously, we will be able to do that since there is no \ntime agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the request withdrawn?\n  Mr. GLENN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not, just to \nclarify this, if there is not sufficient opposition on this side to \ntake up the time, if another amendment was brought to the floor before \nSenator Wellstone comes back, I presume it would be OK if we set it \naside and went on with the other amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would be agreeable to either \nproposition. If Senators want to debate this--and certainly there \nshould be debate on this amendment, as that is what we are all about, \nand it is an important debate--I would be pleased to have this \namendment out on the floor. I will be back at 11 and I will be pleased \nto respond. If other Senators come with amendments and there are not \nSenators speaking directly to this amendment, I would be pleased to \nhave this amendment set aside.\n  Mr. GLENN. I will not object.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I do withdraw my initial unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the situation this morning, Friday \nmorning, is that we are on S. 2. This is a bill that we Republicans, \nthe new majority, promised that we would give early consideration to, \nand hopefully pass early on to get the bill to the President for \nsignature.\n  The House of Representatives, in their first day of session, \nunanimously, on a rollcall vote, passed this piece of legislation. This \nlegislation provides that the exemptions that Congress as an \ninstitution and individual Members of Congress have had as employers \nfrom certain employment and safety laws, in some instances for over 60 \nyears, will no longer be in place.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to end the environment in this \ncountry where we have two sets of laws--one for Capitol Hill and the \none for everybody else, everywhere else in the country.\n  It will end a situation where there is one set of laws for \nPennsylvania Avenue and another set of laws for Main Street, U.S.A. It \nwill end the situation where employees of Congress do not have the same \nemployment and safety rights and access to the courts for the \nenforcement of those rights that private sector employees have.\n  For a long period of time people, in the private sector, both \nemployees and employers, but particularly employers, have resented a \nlegal situation in this country where laws passed for the safety and \nthe employment rights of individual private-sector employees of this \ncountry, have been in place for one set of employees but not for \nanother. The burden of regulation on the private-sector employer has \nbeen in place, but that burden of regulation has not been in place for \nCapitol Hill. And, of course, that resentment has mounted, and mounted, \nand mounted over several years now that this has become an issue.\n  It was No. 1 on the list of promises that the new majority made to \nthe American people that we would pass. Consequently, that is why it \ndid pass the House of Representatives and that is consequently why our \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Dole, made a promise to make \nthat the first bill for consideration of this body.\n  So we had a full day's debate on this bill yesterday and we are \nprobably going to have a full day's debate today and into next week. \nBut I notice from the debate yesterday and the debate so far today, it \nis not on the substance of the legislation: ending the situation where \nwe have one set of laws for Congress and another set of laws for the \nrest of the country.\n  I am glad to know that there is that fair amount of unanimity, maybe \na great deal of consensus, at least, on the issue of the legislation. \nBut debate yesterday was on the issue of lobbying and on the issue of \ngifts--very legitimate issues to be discussed before this body--and now \nthis morning we are starting debate on unrelated legislation dealing \nwith lobbying; again, a very legitimate subject for the Senator from \nMinnesota to bring to this floor.\n  But is it legitimate at this time to bring it before this body? Well, \nof course, under the rules, it is. But does it fit in with the goals \nthat people desired for this Congress early on when they made the \ndecision in the last election to send a new majority to the House and \nSenate and to the House for the first time in 40 years? I think not, \nparticularly in light of the fact that the distinguished majority \nleader, Senator Dole, has promised that all of these issues will have \ntime for discussion on the floor of this body very early in this \nsession, probably within the next 2, 3, 4 months, at the latest.\n  So I beg the Senator from Minnesota and the Senators from other \nStates that have other amendments not germane to the specific purpose \nof S. 2 to wait for the appropriate time so that \n[[Page S534]] we do not frustrate the will of the people expressed in \nthe last election, and that we move forward with ending this special \ntreatment of Capitol Hill to be exempted from 11 major pieces of \nlegislation. Let us move on with this bill, get it to the President for \nsignature--the President wants to sign it--and then take up the usual \ncourse of business and abide with faith in the promise of the \ndistinguished majority leader that these issues will be brought up and \nbring them up at that appropriate time. We should not try to wreck a \nvery good piece of legislation that passed the House unanimously and I \nwill bet will almost pass this body unanimously as well.\n  I yield the floor and urge Senators on my side who want to debate \nSenator Wellstone's amendment to please come over here and do that, \nbecause we will not have rollcalls as long as there is a leadership \nmeeting down at the White House.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I do not have a dog in this fight. I do not \nhave an amendment that I am proposing here, but I cannot help but \nrespond to the remarks of my distinguished colleague from Iowa. I will \nbe very brief because I know Senator Simon would like to make a \nstatement here on the floor and I am happy to see him do that.\n  But this idea that somehow because there is a push on for something \nhere that we can avoid having anyone put on amendments is wishful \nthinking. I need only go back in my mind's eye and remember what was \nhappening about 60 days ago or 90 days ago here on floor when anything \nwe put forth was subject to amendments, extraneous or not. It was delay \nfor delay's sake and it was a scorched earth policy.\n  To say that we should let some piece of legislation, as much as I \nwant it--and I am as big a backer on this piece of legislation on \ncongressional accountability one could possibly be, but it is entirely \nwithin the right of any Senator who wants to offer an amendment. \nAlthough I do not have an amendment to offer, I do not want to let \nanything go by that would be critical of people who do have amendments \nto offer and are offering them in all good sincerity. They think it is \nright. If they want to attach it on by the rules of the Senate, we, \nobviously, can do that.\n  We had talk here yesterday about we should be giving the new majority \na chance to govern. Well, we do not set aside all the Senate rules in \ngiving anybody a chance to lead or a chance to govern. I am all for \nleadership having all the leadership prerogatives, but those \nprerogatives do not mean that we are able to set aside amendments that \npeople may, in all sincerity, propose, whether I agree with them or \nnot.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for 5 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/06/senate-section/article/S529-5", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE STRIKE AT BRIDGESTONE/FIRESTONE\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, on July 12, of last year, 4,200 members of \nthe United Rubber Workers went on strike at Bridgestone/Firestone. The \nplants are in Decatur, IL; Des Moines, IA; Oklahoma City; Akron, OH; \nand Noblesville, IN. Negotiations had been going on for some time prior \nto that on the new contract. The United Rubber Workers had insisted on \na similar contract to the contract they had with Goodyear. Bridgestone/\nFirestone, which is wholly owned by a Japanese company, insisted they \ncould not do that, and then negotiations broke off.\n  The distinguished Senator from Ohio, as well as some of our \ncolleagues, met with the Japanese Ambassador and urged that they renew \nnegotiations. Unfortunately, the situation has deteriorated so that \nBridgestone/Firestone has said they are going to permanently replace \nall these workers.\n  It is the first time in modern history that that has been done in a \nlarge scale, with the exception of the PATCO strike. And there, \nfrankly, you had people who were breaking the Federal law, and \nPresident Reagan--and I think it could have been handled better--but \nPresident Reagan made the proper decision that you cannot violate the \nFederal law and he replaced the workers.\n This is an unusual situation. It is contrary to the traditions of \nlabor-management relations in our country. Interestingly, it would be \nillegal in Japan.\n\n  Now, we have a situation where 2,000 or more workers are going to be \npermanently replaced. It is not going to be good for labor-management \nrelations in those communities. It is not going to be good for United \nStates-Japanese relations. It is just a bad situation all the way \naround. My hope is that we can urge our friends in Japan and urge the \nleaders of this company to recognize this is not wise.\n  Short-term may save a few bucks. I do not know any of the details of \nthe negotiations. But I have been involved in labor-management \nnegotiations often enough that I know if you sit around a table and try \nand work things out, generally you can work out a practical compromise. \nI urge they do that. That they not go ahead as they are now planning.\n  I will, later today, be contacting some of our colleagues in the \naffected States with a resolution that they may want to cosponsor, \nurging that they get back to the negotiating table and not have this \npermanent striker replacement. It is interesting that of the modern \nnations only Great Britain, Singapore, and Hong Kong permit permanent \nstriker placement, plus the United States. But we have a tradition of \nnot doing it. That tradition is occasionally violated by a very small \ncompany, but rarely by any company this large.\n  I hope we can have some common sense by the leaders of this industry. \nI hope the leaders of this industry and the United Rubber Workers can \nget together. I urge them not to proceed with the permanent replacement \nof these workers.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Clerk will call the roll. The assistant \nlegislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to ask my good friend from \nMinnesota if he was or had ever been a member of the American Civil \nLiberties Union?\n   [[Page S535]] Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I do not think that I am \nnow. I make a lot of contributions to a lot of organizations and I \ncannot tell the gentleman for sure. If I had been a member, I would \nhave been proud to do so. However, I cannot answer for sure because I \ncannot remember our previous records.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to call my wife, Sheila, and we \nwill go over our records and be pleased to announce when we made a \ncontribution, if we did.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am sure my friend from Minnesota agrees with the \nSenator from Kentucky that the American Civil Liberties Union on many \noccasions has done fine work. Much of it I find myself in disagreement \nwith. There have been those times, I think, clearly proving the \nobjectivity of the ACLU when I find myself allied with them. The \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union as earlier testified on the proposal \nthat the Senator from Minnesota has offered, because it was as he \nindicated, a part of S. 3, an unfortunate measure that the Senate \nmercifully put to rest last year through some effort. The occupant of \nthe chair participated in this effort, as well as the Senator from \nKentucky, regarding the rights of people to participate in the \npolitical process.\n  Now, what the Senator from Minnesota has done is craft a measure \nwhich I am certain would be quite popular with the people of the United \nStates since they have become convinced that lobbyists are odious folks \nwho are up here buying influence and subverting the political process. \nUnless, of course, the lobbyists happens to be working for a cause they \nbelieve in, in which case they think the lobbyist is doing great work \nfor America.\n  Regardless, this notion that this particular segment of our society \nshould be singled out for unconstitutional treatment, it seems to me, \nis completely absurd. Maybe what we ought to do is introduce an \namendment saying trial lawyers cannot contribute to a campaign, or \nmaybe labor unions cannot contribute to campaign. How about bad \nlobbyists cannot contribute to campaigns? Surely there are good \nlobbyists and bad lobbyists. Maybe we would pick out the bad lobbyists \nand they cannot contribute.\n  Well, Mr. President, you get my drift. The Constitution clearly does \nnot allow us to single out certain kinds of Americans because of their \nprofessions and take away their constitutional rights. It is simply \nimpermissible. It might be popular.\n  Somebody told me, and I did not see the survey, somebody told me that \nin recent years many Americans indicated they do not support the Bill \nof Rights. I do not know whether that is true or not. Apparently some \npollster asked a series of questions based upon the Bill of Rights and \napparently many people did not support those items.\n  It would not surprise me that the amendment as crafted by the Senator \nfrom Minnesota would probably make for a terrific campaign commercial \nbut the point is it trashes the Constitution. It absolutely trashes the \nConstitution. It is not even in the gray area.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to read from the \ntestimony of the American Civil Liberties Union before the Senate Rules \nCommittee, May 19, 1993, on this point, in testifying on the issue of \nprohibiting contributions from lobbyists. And the testimony said: \n``Another clearly unconstitutional provision in the President's \nproposal''--this was in President Clinton's campaigning finance bill--\n``is the ban on political contributions by registered lobbyists (or \nalternatively, the ban on lobbying by political contributors). Lobbying \nis both the essence of political speech and association and is \nspecifically protected under the first amendment as the right of the \npeople `to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.' The \nvarious expressive rights encompassed by that notion are considered \nindivisible. After all, the first amendment `was fashioned to assure \nthe unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of legal and \nsocial change as desired by the people'. Lobbying is nothing more than \na manifestation of this interchange,'' said the ACLU, ``because \nlobbying is designed to influence public policy, the speech that is \nburdened by this proposal is `at the heart of the first amendment's \nprotections'.'' Quoting the case of First National Bank of Boston \nversus Bellotti in 1978 and constitutes ``the essence of self-\ngovernment,'' and CBS versus FCC, Garrison versus Louisiana.\n  ``Moreover,'' the testimony said, ``it is wholly at odds with the \nguarantees of the first amendment to place legislative restrictions on \nthose engaged in 'the discussion of political policy generally or \nadvocacy of passage of defeat of legislation'.''\n  ``The Court's decision'', the ACLU went on, ``make apparent that \nthese activities involve the highest level of constitutional \nprotection.''\n  The highest level of constitutional protection, Mr. President. We are \nnot talking about an issue that is in the gray area. This is not a \nclose call, Mr. President. The highest level of constitutional \nprotection.\n  The ACLU went on,\n\n       Like other provisions in the proposal, the ban on making \n     political contributions is an unconstitutional condition \n     imposed because of the exercise of a constitutional right. It \n     does not matter that it is primarily aimed at those who \n     represented moneyed interests, because the provision will not \n     affect those interests--only their registered lobbying \n     representative.\n\n       Thus, it is both ineffective in accomplishing that goal and \n     in preventing the appearance of corruption. Because the bill \n     already establishes contribution limits in order to cabin the \n     potential for corruption, that potential has been removed \n     from the field of contention. There are no legitimate \n     grounds----\n\n  I repeat, Mr. President, no legitimate grounds--\n\n     to believe that a lobbyist restricted to the same maximum \n     contributions will have any more undue influence over a \n     legislator's views than anyone else. Thus, the specially \n     restrictive treatment of lobbyists can only be viewed as a \n     penalty for their frequent and sustained exercise of their \n     constitutional right to address public policy issues before \n     the political branches of Government.\n\n  This is it, Mr. President. And I see my friend from Indiana is here. \nI am about to wrap it up.\n\n       The Constitution simply does not tolerate that result.\n\n  The Constitution does not tolerate that result.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask unanimous consent----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for some \nquestions?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Just for a second.\n  I would like to ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that a letter \ndated today from the American Civil Liberties Union legislative \ncounsel, Robert S. Peck, on the amendment before us, appear in the \nRecord at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               American Civil Liberties Union,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 6, 1995.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: This morning, Senator Wellstone \n     proposed an amendment to S. 2 that would prohibit political \n     contributions to federal officeholders by registered \n     lobbyists. The American Civil Liberties Union opposed the \n     amendment as inconsistent with the guarantees of the First \n     Amendment.\n       The amendment would prohibit lobbyists from making \n     political contributions during a period of one year following \n     a lobbying contact. Alternatively, if a lobbyist does make a \n     political contribution, the lobbyist would be prohibited from \n     making a lobbying that member of Congress or covered \n     executive branch officers for a one-year period following the \n     contact. Finally, it prohibits lobbyists from suggesting to \n     clients possible recipients of their campaign contributions.\n       The First Amendment provides, among other things, broad \n     guarantees of freedom of speech and the right to petition the \n     government for redress of grievances. The Supreme Court, in \n     the case of Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), held that \n     campaign contributions are a form of free speech that is \n     protected under the Constitution. The Buckley Court approved \n     of a system of campaign contributions limitations that were \n     designed to avoid the appearance of corruption as the least \n     restrictive means of furthering an important governmental \n     interest without unduly obviating a constitutional right. \n     Because these contribution limits still stand, further \n     restrictions on contribution rights, such as the limitation \n     on contributions by lobbyists, do not meet the constitutional \n     requirements of the least-restrictive-means test.\n       Moreover, the First Amendment also the right to lobby, \n     denominated in the Constitution as the right ``to petition.'' \n     As the Court \n     [[Page S536]] said in Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, \n     484\n      (1957), the First Amendment ``was fashioned to assure the \n     unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of \n     political and social changes desired by the people.'' \n     Lobbying is nothing more than a manifestation of this \n     interchange. Because lobbying is designed to influence \n     public policy, the speech that is burdened by this \n     proposal is ``at the heart of the First Amendment's \n     protection,'' First National Bank of Boston v. Belloti, \n     435 U.S. 765, 776 (1978), and constitutes ``the essence of \n     self-government.'' CBS, Inc. v. FCC, 453 US. 367, 396 \n     (1981) (quoting Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 64, 75 \n     (1964)). Moreover, it is ```wholly at odds with the \n     guarantees of the First Amendment''' to place legislative \n     restrictions on those engaged in ```the discussion of \n     political policy generally or advocacy of passage or \n     defeat of legislation.''' Meyer v. Grant, 486 U.S. 414, \n     428 (1988) (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 50, 48 (1976)). \n     The court's decision make apparent that these activities \n     involve the highest level of constitutional protection.\n       The ban on making political contributions proposed by this \n     amendment is an unconstitutional condition imposed because of \n     the exercise of a constitutional right. It does not matter \n     that it is primarily aimed at those who represent moneyed \n     interests, because the provision will not affect those \n     interests--only their registered lobbying representative. \n     Thus, it is both ineffective in accomplishing that goal and \n     in preventing the appearance of corruption. The existence of \n     contribution limitations already cabins the potential for \n     corruption. Thus, there are no legitimate grounds to believe \n     that a lobbyist restricted to the same maximum contributions \n     will have any more undue influence over a legislator's views \n     than anyone else.\n       The ACLU urges the Senate to reject this amendment, as \n     unconstitutional and ill-conceived.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Robert S. Peck,\n                                              Legislative Counsel.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Actually, Mr. President, instead, the Senator from \nIndiana wants to speak to the same amendment. I wondered whether I \ncould just respond for a moment first to the Senator from Kentucky, if \nthe Senator from Indiana will give me that courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Minnesota objecting to the \nrequest of the Senator from Kentucky?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. No.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I believe I have floor. I do not want \nto unduly detain the Senator from Indiana. I want to wrap it up.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, if I may inquire of the Chair of the \nprocedure here, it is my understanding that we will move to procedure \nunder the unanimous-consent agreement. If that is the case, I will not \nbe able to give my statement and I can give it later.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. COATS. I will be happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe the vote will be at a quarter to 12. I will \nbe through in a minute.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Instead of asking a question, I wonder if I may have \nsome time to respond. Then, of course, the Senator from Kentucky----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Why not have the Senator from Minnesota and myself \nsimply enter into a colloquy and address the Chair?\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Minnesota is in the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the colloquy is in order.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am pleased to do so.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have enjoyed having colloquies and \ndiscussion with the Senator from Kentucky in the past and always \nrespect what he has to say.\n  Let me start out by saying that I just bet there is one thing the \nSenator from Kentucky and I will agree on, and what we will agree on is \nthat the American Civil Liberties Union is not always right. Does the \nSenator from Kentucky agree with me on that?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I certainly agree with the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. \nPresident, that the ACLU is not always right. However, it certainly has \nbeen on the campaign finance issues, and I think they have been a lot \nright on constitutional questions.\n  This is an organization, Mr. President, we all know exists to help \nAmericans enforce first amendment rights. And what the Senator from \nMinnesota is seeking to do here today is to set aside a type of \nAmerican citizen and say that because you earn your income in this \nparticular way, you do not have the constitutional rights that \neverybody else in America has. The ACLU said this is constitutionally \nimpermissible. I hope that will be persuasive to my colleagues, and \nthat is the reason I raised the point.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the reason I make this point is the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union is not always right, and I think all of \nmy colleagues understand that. I do not think they are right on this \nissue. I do not think the American Civil Liberties Union was right on \nthe lobbying disclosure. They take a certain position. I think my \ncolleagues know, including, Mr. President, my colleague from Kentucky, \nthat my record, my passion about the importance of first amendment \nrights is clear, very clear. But the American Civil Liberties Union is \nsimply wrong again.\n  Mr. President, what the Supreme Court has said in Bellotti is that \nany significant infringement on first amendment speech rights has to be \nbalanced against concerns about corruption or appearance of corruption.\n  Mr. President, understand what this is all about, this is trying to \nbreak this very clear nexus----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. In just a moment. I would like to finish my analysis, \nif I may.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thought we were in a colloquy here, and I would like \nthe Senator to respond to a question, if he can.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. We are in a colloquy, but I think the Senator will be \nbetter able to ask me a question if I can just finish my point.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. All right.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. So, Mr. President, the point is that we are talking \nabout a very clear nexus here between lobbying and the giving of money. \nJust so my colleagues understand, this amendment is designed to \nprohibit lobbyists from making contributions to or soliciting \ncontributions for Members of Congress whom they have lobbied within the \npreceding year--1 year, that is what we are talking about--and from \nlobbying Members of Congress to whom they have contributed or on whose \nbehalf they have solicited funds within the previous year.\n  Now, Mr. President, this amendment was part of S. 3, which passed by \na fairly significant margin in the Senate.\n  At the very end of the last session, we had a filibuster which \nprevented the campaign finance reform bill from going to conference \ncommittee, as I remember. But many Senators voted for this amendment. \nIt was in the bill. And once again, Mr. President, I am just simply \nresponding to the bill before us. I am trying to improve this bill. It \nis called congressional accountability.\n  Yesterday, Senators said they would not vote for the proposition that \nwe should not take the gifts. Today, I am saying should we not at least \ngo on record, if we are interested in a more accountable process, that \nwe do not take these contributions within this 1-year period of time? I \nthink this is, of course, open to a challenge, a constitutional \nchallenge, as is much of the legislation that we pass. But with all due \nrespect--I am not a lawyer, Mr. President, but I can just tell you that \nthere are two sides to this question. The fact that the ACLU does not \nagree with this amendment does not mean, therefore, that this \namendment, ipso facto, should be declared unconstitutional by my \ncolleagues. That is simply not the case. I think it will withstand the \nscrutiny of the courts.\n  In any case, the real issue here is about reform, is about the \ninfluence of lobbyists, is about making sure that we make this process \nmore accountable, and it is about breaking this connection between \nmoney and lobbying and at least having this 1-year window. That is what \nthis is about.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  The Chair indicates that the Senator from Kentucky, under the \nprevious order, is recognized until 11:25, and the Senator from \nMinnesota is to be recognized from 11:25 to 11:45. You, by unanimous \nconsent, are engaging in a colloquy, so it is your time.\n   [[Page S537]] Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am just going to \nreclaim the floor very briefly, and then I am going to yield the \nremainder of my time to the Senator from Indiana.\n  The Senator from Minnesota cites no cases--because there are none--\nfor the proposition that he suggests. I cited four or five. This is not \nin the gray area. This is clearly unconstitutional. The Senator argues \nthat because of the perception problem, the rights of lobbyists should \nbe taken away. My guess is there may be a perception that labor unions \ncontribute to campaigns, too. Maybe we should take their rights away. \nOr others may think we ought not to have trial lawyers contribute to \npolitical campaigns and maybe we should take their rights away.\n  The Constitution does not make it possible to pick on people by \ntaking rights away in legislation. This is not a close call, Mr. \nPresident. This is clearly, blatantly unconstitutional.\n  Mr. President, what time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair indicates the Senator from Kentucky \nhas 6 minutes and 20 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield all of my time to the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. I do want \nto state I came to the floor to make a statement on the underlying bill \nand not on this particular amendment. If it would be more appropriate \nto make that statement at a different time, I will be happy to do that. \nThe Senator may want to address the specifics of this amendment before \nhe yields the time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to the Senator from Indiana, I have said all I \nwant to say about this and I am happy to yield the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, 200 years ago, our Founding Fathers fought a \nrevolution against what they saw as an imperial government, a \ngovernment that taxed them to the point of despair and denied their \nfreedom. From this revolution, they built a country on the idea that \nthe preservation of the freedom and the integrity of the common man was \nthe measure of good government.\n  Last year, on the 8th day of November, the American people rebelled \nonce again, this time not against an imperial government but against an \nimperial Congress. They fought this revolution with the legacy of our \nFounding Fathers. They fought it with their vote.\n  The American people voted in November to overthrow an entrenched, \ndistant Congress. They forcefully demonstrated that they were very \ndeeply cynical about their Government and deeply skeptical about its \nability to create sound public policy. They decided that an institution \nwhich could not govern itself could not govern the rest of us.\n  It was a sobering decision because it is impossible to be \nsimultaneously held in contempt by the American public and to be viewed \nas an institution capable of providing leadership on the major problems \nfacing our Nation.\n  And so the simple conclusion and the simple fact is this. We must \nrestore the faith of the American people in their elected \nrepresentatives if major problems are to be effectively addressed and \nendorsed and embraced by the American people. We need to create an \nenvironment in this body where we can focus on important problems. That \nis the mandate of the election and that requires major reform in the \nway that this institution conducts its business.\n  Four years ago I stood before this body to introduce four measures \ndesigned to rein in an out-of-touch Congress. These measures ensured \nthat there would be an end to the midnight pay raises slipped in in the \nback rooms to an otherwise popular bill, hoping to slip it by the \nprocess that would expose it to debate and allow Members to vote up or \ndown and have their constituents know what their vote was. I am pleased \nthat this measure has now been adopted into law and is part of the \nConstitution of the United States so that no longer will we be allowed \nto raise or adjust our pay without exposing it to the light of debate \nand putting our yeas and nays in public for the public to judge us on.\n  I introduced a measure to reform the way in which we judge each other \nand I introduced a measure that would return this body from one of a \nprofessional body to a citizen legislature, which I believe our \nFounding Fathers intended.\n  Finally, I introduced a measure guaranteeing that the Congress would \nlive under the same laws it passes for everyone else. Significantly, we \nare here today debating that fourth measure. It is the worst, most \nobvious hypocrisy, for the Senate to pass legislation that applies to \nevery other American except for those who wrote the legislation. It \nsets the Congress apart as a privileged elite, unbound by normal rules \nand standards. And it protects the Congress from the consequences of \nits own failures and excessive burdens. This measure, this one that we \nare debating today and will vote on--this measure ensures that public \nlaws would be applied to public servants. Anything less is a dangerous \ndouble standard.\n  From the Clean Air Act, which I supported, to the Americans With \nDisabilities Act, to OSHA regulations, to labor standards, to civil \nrights laws, Congress will be forced to come into compliance with the \nvery laws that Congress has passed and imposed on the citizens Congress \nwas elected to serve. Knowing that Congress must comply with laws that \nit considers, hopefully we will write better laws or perhaps maybe no \nlaw at all. I fully expect that we will be overwhelmed and in many \ncases simply unable to comply with the laws already on the books. The \nbasement of the Capitol alone will be enough to employ a team of OSHA \ninspectors in perpetuity. Yet, if it is impossible for us to comply, \nperhaps we will finally understand the extent of the burden which we \nhave placed on American citizens. Our citizens and families, small \nbusinesses, the lifeblood of jobs in America, are suffering under the \nweight of unprecedented Government intrusion into the very way they \nlive their lives and do their work. The premise is simple enough. We \nwill write better laws if we are forced to live under those laws. If it \nis impossible to comply with the law, we should not write it.\n  With a vote earned by the sacrifice of so many Americans, the \nAmerican people have staged a second American revolution. The \nCongressional Accountability Act is the first measure in fulfilling the \npromise of that revolution for future generations of Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Indiana has \nexpired. Under the previous order, the Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized for up to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me be very clear. I \nsaid this yesterday and I want to say it again to my colleagues, I am \nvery supportive of this Congressional Accountability Act. I think this \npiece of legislation should and must be passed. That is why I did not \nwant this to be open-ended. I wanted this debate to be within a \nreasonable period of time.\n  But if we are going to say that we are trying to make the Congress--\nthe Senate accountable, we can do much better. There is no reason why \nwe cannot strengthen this piece of legislation. We do that all the time \non the floor of the Senate. That is the very essence of our \naccountability. Senators come out with amendments to strengthen a piece \nof legislation and we vote on those amendments up or down and then we \nare held accountable for our votes.\n  This amendment was part of a campaign finance reform bill which was \npassed June 17, 1993, I guess at 2:11 p.m. This was the vote: 60 yeas, \n38 nays. This amendment was part of this piece of legislation that was \npassed by many Senators who now still serve in this body. These \narguments, and really they are smokescreen arguments, about the ACLU--\ncolleagues come out and say, ``The ACLU said this, therefore we better \nnot vote for it.'' I have to smile, because I have never in the past \nnoticed that was the litmus test for my colleagues, that the ACLU took \na position therefore that is our position. That is a smokescreen \nargument.\n  One more time, Mr. President. If we want to talk about, agree or \ndisagree with one of the major Court decisions about this whole issue \nof campaign finance, it was Buckley versus Valeo. It was made crystal \nclear by the Court that any potential infringement on first amendment \nspeech rights has to be balanced against concerns about \n[[Page S538]] corruption or the appearance of corruption.\n  I want to say to my colleagues, I am not talking about corruption. I \nam talking about the appearance of corruption. What this amendment \nsays--and I went over it very carefully this morning--is that if a \nlobbyist comes into your office to see you or staff, then at least a \nyear ought to go by before that lobbyist contributes money to you or \ninstructs a client to do so. Or if a lobbyist, or a client instructed \nby a lobbyist, a PAC instructed by a lobbyist, contributes money to you \nin your race--I say that to those Senators who have just come to the \nSenate--a year ought to go by before that lobbyist is allowed to come \nin and lobby you.\n  We voted for this before. There was strong support for it before. We \nare talking about congressional accountability. If my colleagues think \nthey can hide behind a smokescreen argument--you know, different \nSenators have different views about how to interpret legislation. Of \ncourse someone can stand up and say the ACLU says it is not \nconstitutional, therefore it is not constitutional. Many of us voted \nfor it before. And I would think that many of my colleagues who ran on \na reform agenda, who said they were interested in reform, would vote \nfor it now. I do not think we should trivialize this issue. We are \nfocusing on congressional accountability. We are focusing specifically \non an essential problem with the way Government operates.\n  I have heard a lot about the way Government operates. If we want the \nGovernment to operate in such a way that the citizens we represent back \nin our States feel that Government is open and accountable and \nresponsive to them, and not just those folks who march on Washington \nevery day--that is to say who are here every day, well heeled, well \noiled, well financed, with lobbyists, having way too much access and \nsay--then certainly we can break this link.\n  This is an extremely modest amendment. I am astounded, frankly, that \nthere is any real opposition to it. I really am.\n  Mr. President, yesterday I came out on the floor with Senator Levin, \nSenator Feingold, and Senator Lautenberg. And we said at the very \nbeginning of the session, let us send a strong message to the people we \nrepresent. As long as we are talking about congressional \naccountability, let us pass an amendment that focuses on prohibiting \nthe taking of these gifts, trips to the Bahamas or Hawaii paid for by \nwhomever; meals, tickets, you name it; not because we think that \nSenators or Representatives are corrupt--we do not believe that, we are \nproud of being in the Senate--but because we know that the people we \nrepresent--I have heard this standard over and over again; I have heard \nSenators announce this standard on the floor--we know that the people \nwe represent do not receive those gifts and it is inappropriate. It is \nreally unacceptable. Let it go.\n  Yesterday the vote was against that amendment. Really the only \nargument I heard was the control argument. We are in control. We are in \ncontrol here, and therefore there are not going to be any amendments on \nthis bill. It was not the merit of the amendment. It did not have \nanything to do with at the beginning of the session making it clear to \npeople we were for reform. It was control. Well, Senators did not vote \nfor that.\n  Today I have an amendment that says at the very minimum, if we are \ngoing to talk about reform and accountability, I urge my colleagues to \nvote for this amendment. I think it sends a very positive signal to the \npeople we represent, which is we are not going to take one thing while \nwe campaign, and then vote against it on the floor of the Senate. We \nare not going to hide behind the ACLU. We vote it up or down. We are \nnot going to hide behind a control issue. Our party is in power; \ntherefore, we are not accepting any amendments. I have even heard some \nof my colleagues say--I think, I do not have the particular day or \ntime--that campaign finance reform is off the agenda this Congress. Mr. \nPresident, it is not off the agenda. The reason it is not off the \nagenda is that each and every Senator has a right to come to the floor \nwith amendments that focus in on what a Senator believes are important \nissues to the people he or she represents.\n  I happen to believe that for Minnesotans this is an extremely \nimportant issue. By the way, not that polls always make the difference. \nI actually hope they do not because I hope every Senator votes his or \nher conscience when that is the case. But if you were to do a poll in \nthe cafes of Minnesota as to whether or not we ought to vote for an \namendment to put an end to this sort of insidious connection between \nthe lobbying and the giving and the taking of money with at least a not \noutright prohibition but at least a 1-year moratorium, 99.9999 percent \nof the people in Minnesota would agree. What is the hesitation? Why \nwould my colleagues be opposed to it?\n  Mr. President, I had actually looked forward to more debate on this. \nSo far we have heard about the American Civil Liberties Union's \nposition and that is it. So I have to assume that is the reason my \ncolleagues are going to vote against this, if they are going to vote \nagainst this. I have not heard another Senator come to the floor with \nany other substantive reason given for voting against this amendment.\n  I can tell you, Mr. President, in the spirit of accountability--and \nwe are talking a congressional accountability act--I would think \nSenators would be clear as to why they are opposed. I have not heard \nthat. And in the absence of hearing that opposition, though one \nSenator, Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky certainly spoke \nagainst it, I look forward to this vote and I believe that this \namendment should be passed by the Senate. And certainly as to those \nSenators who voted for this campaign finance reform bill, which \nincluded this amendment before, I look forward to their support and the \nsupport of some of my colleagues who are new to this Senate whom I know \nare very strong reformers.\n  Mr. President, I conclude my remarks and yield the rest of my time. I \nthink we are going to have a motion to table at 1:45.\n  So I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would like to ask unanimous consent--\nif I have to and I am not sure I have to--that I reserve for myself the \nfinal 2 or 3 minutes before the vote, if I am so inclined, and before \nthe motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. For the moment, Mr. President, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, could I have order in the Chamber for a \nmoment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, before the vote on this amendment I just would like to \nbe very direct with my colleagues. This amendment speaks to a very real \nproblem.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is not an abstract amendment. It does \nspeak to a very real problem. We are talking about part of the \npolitical culture in Washington. Let me lay it on the line at the very \nend, because that is what this amendment is about. I will just lay it \non the line. It is not uncommon for a Senator to be lobbied by a \nregistered lobbyist and a month later to get a $5,000 PAC check. It \nhappens.\n  Let me just be very blunt and direct at the very end of this debate. \nThe reason that I introduced this amendment as part of the campaign \nfinance reform bill--and that bill got overwhelming support in the \nSenate--and the reason I bring this amendment today as part of the \nCongressional Accountability Act \n[[Page S539]] is that this happens. Let us get away from all of the \nabstract arguments.\n  The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, that all too often \nlobbyists come in to see a Senator, and shortly thereafter the money \nflows in. All too often, lobby money flows into campaigns, and shortly \nthereafter lobbyists and groups and organizations represented by \nlobbyists appear. That is egregious. That does not give people \nconfidence in this process. That does not make the Congress very \naccountable to the many. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  Mr. President, I simply say to my colleagues that if you are serious \nabout reform, then this amendment is a test case of that commitment to \nreform. I do not know how any of us can go back to any of the cafes or \nrestaurants in our own States and justify to people how we voted for \nthe continuation of this practice. We ought to end it. It is a good \nGovernment reform. It is part of congressional accountability, and I \nurge my colleagues--urge my colleagues--to support this amendment. They \nhave in the past. Many of my colleagues found this to be a compelling \nproblem and issue in the past. It is just as compelling today.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I support campaign finance reform \nlegislation and I have cosponsored it repeatedly over the years only to \nhave it filibustered or vetoed by the other party.\n  For me, taken outside the context of campaign finance reform, this \namendment is problematic. It would prohibit a Senator from receiving \nsupport from lobbyists but it would not prevent a challenger from \nreceiving contributions from those very same lobbyists. Yet that \nchallenger could be an incumbent--a Governor, a State legislator, a \nmayor--and not be subject to the same restrictions. In my most recent \ncampaign, I was challenged by the speaker of the house in the New \nJersey State Legislature. I can tell you that he had the ability, based \non his contact with various groups and issues, to raise a lot of money \nfrom lobbyists and special interest groups. So, without a comprehensive \ncampaign finance program in place, the prohibition in this amendment \nsingles out incumbent Senators--not all incumbents--unfairly.\n  Further, comprehensive campaign finance reform set a limit on the \ntotal amount of money one could spend on a campaign. So even if a \nchallenger could receive funds from lobbyists while an incumbent could \nnot, the limit on total spending would not necessarily create an uneven \nplaying field. In an environment of unlimited spending, however, \ndenying one candidate resources which are available to another is not \nequitable.\n  I support the goal of the Wellstone amendment--to break the link \nbetween contributors and any real, or perceived, influence on public \npolicy. We can best achieve that goal in the context of overall reform \nof our campaign finance system.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. On behalf of the distinguished majority leader, I move \nto table the Wellstone amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, during the last session of Congress, I was \na cosponsor of the gift ban bill and was among a handful of Republicans \nwho voted for cloture on the conference report. Nevertheless, I voted \nto table the gift ban amendment to the Congressional Accountability \nAct.\n  Congress has been severely criticized for passing legislation that \napplies one set of rules to itself and a separate set of rules to the \nrest of the Nation. The Congressional Accountability Act changes that \npractice, once and for all. The House already has agreed to similar \nlegislation and is expected to endorse the Senate version. Passage of \nthe gift ban bill would delay final approval of this important measure.\n  Furthermore, passage of a ban on gifts from lobbyists prior to \nconsideration and passage of strict lobbying disclosure requirements \nis, in my view, shortsighted. The majority leader clearly stated his \nintention to address the entire issue of how lobbyists interact with \nMembers of Congress and their staffs. Banning gifts from lobbyists \nshould be addressed in that context. To ban gifts from lobbyists under \nour present inadequate system of registering lobbyists could act as a \ndisincentive to proper registration.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON.

In answer to my friend from New Mexico, the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, the amendment that I am sending to the desk outlines \na series of procedures that I think are absolutely necessary to make \nsure that the balanced budget amendment, which I support, can be fully \noperative in a reasonable period of time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 6.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .--CONGRESSIONAL ENFORCEMENT OF A BALANCED BUDGET.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The Congress declares it essential that the \n     Congress--\n       (1) adopt in the first session of the 104th Congress a \n     joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution \n     requiring a balanced Federal budget;\n       (2) set forth with specificity in the first session of the \n     104th Congress the policies that achieving such a balanced \n     Federal budget would require; and\n       (3) enforce through the congressional budget process the \n     requirement to achieve a balanced Federal budget.\n       (b) Point of Order Against Budget Resolutions That Fail To \n     Set Forth a Glide Path to a Balanced Budget.--Section 301 of \n     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended by inserting \n     at the end thereof the following new subsection:\n       ``(j) Congressional Enforcement of a Balanced Budget.--It \n     shall not be in order to consider any concurrent resolution \n     on the budget (or amendment, motion, or conference report \n     thereon) that--\n       ``(A) fails to set forth appropriate levels for all items \n     described in subsection (a)(1) through (7) for all fiscal \n     years through 2002;\n       ``(B) sets forth a level of outlays for fiscal year 2002 or \n     any subsequent fiscal year that exceeds the level of revenues \n     for that fiscal year; or\n       ``(C) relies on the assumption of either--\n       ``(i) reductions in direct spending, or\n       ``(ii) increases in revenues, without including specific \n     reconciliation instructions under section 310 to carry out \n     those assumptions.''.\n       (c) Requirement for 60 Votes To Waive Or Appeal in the \n     Senate.--Section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 \n     is amended by inserting ``301(j),'' after ``301(i),'' in both \n     places that it appears.\n       (d) Suspension in the Event of War or Congressionally \n     Declared Low Growth.--Section 258(b)(2) of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended \n     by inserting ``301(j),'' after ``sections''.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I suggest that the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senate please come to order and will \nSenators remove conversations from the floor.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we are here today considering the worthwhile \nand laudable goal of applying to the Congress the laws by which all \nother Americans live. I wholeheartedly support this endeavor and, I \nmight add, it is long overdue.\n  But, in all of the discussions, many may have lost sight of the fact \nthat the single most significant law that we are going to apply to the \nAmerican people this year is an amendment to the Constitution to \nrequire a balanced Federal budget.\n  I rise today to offer an amendment that would apply to the Congress \nitself a constitutional amendment to balance the Federal budget. Simply \nput, my amendment would create a point of order against considering any \nbudget resolution that fails to comply with the requirements set out in \nthe balanced budget amendment. In other words, under my amendment, it \nwould be out of order to consider any resolution that failed to show a \nbalance in the fiscal year 2002. That is what the balanced budget \namendment requires. No more and no less.\n  My amendment will force the Congress to live up to the policy \nstatement it will set forth in the balanced budget amendment, which I \nam confident will be adopted sometime this year.\n  Mr. President, I want to put my colleagues on notice, if anyone is \nfor a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution--truly for it--he \nor she should be for my amendment, too. My amendment merely forces \nCongress to abide by the balanced budget amendment in its budget \nresolutions. There are no gray areas in this amendment.\n  Specifically, my amendment creates a point of order against \nconsideration of a budget resolution that would not: First, reach a \nbalance in 2002; second, provide at least the usual budget resolution \ndetail; and third, include reconciliation instructions to the affected \ncommittees for all entitlement and tax changes assumed.\n  My amendment requires 60 votes to waive the point of order. This is \nreal enforcement. My amendment applies the same standards before 2002 \nthat a balanced budget amendment would apply to after the year 2002.\n  My amendment is also sensible. It provides that the new point of \norder, just like other points of order under the Budget Act, will be \nsuspended if the Congress declares war or adopts a resolution \ncertifying low economic growth, using the existing procedures under the \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings measure.\n  Now, some might say to me: ``Just wait until the balanced budget \namendment comes up in a couple of weeks.''\n  Mr. President, with due respect, that is just not good enough. That \nis not good enough for the people of the United States of America. That \nis not good enough for this Senator who has come to the floor of the \nSenate year after year seeking passage of a balanced budget amendment, \nonly to come away empty handed.\n  To uphold our responsibility to the American people on the eve of the \nnear certain passage of a constitutional amendment, we must have the \nguarantee before--and I emphasize, Mr. President, before--we vote on \nthe balanced budget amendment itself that we are going to guarantee the \nspecifics of how to reach a balanced budget.\n  Without that, our action would be only a concept and not a plan.\n   Without that, our action would be a politically palatable sham. \nWithout that assurance, we would merely be voting for an idea of a \nbalanced budget, conveniently leaving in the never, never, Alice-in-\nWonderland future the enforcement mechanisms that are essential to \ngetting us there. Without that guarantee, we are adults promising a \nbridge to fantasyland without pillars or even preliminary plans.\n\n  Some may say we can only do so much deficit reduction at any one \ntime. To them I say that my amendment does not force Congress to put \nall of its deficit reduction in 1 year. Under my amendment, Congress \nmay even choose to delay action on deficit reduction into the year 2001 \nor 2002. But my amendment forces Congress to choose. It must lay out \nsome plan to get us to a balance.\n  Let me add, we cannot afford to delay. Yesterday, the Congressional \nBudget Office issued a brief preliminary report on the state of the \ndeficit. I had been advised of this previously, and it has come to \npass.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of that \nreport be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. EXON. Let me just note a few highlights that are quite evident \nfrom that report.\n  The Congressional Budget Office tells us that unless we take action \nright now, the deficit will rise to $322 billion in the year 2002. In \norder to balance the budget between now and then, the Congressional \nBudget Office tells us that we will need to achieve some $1.2 trillion \nin deficit reduction, and if we add into the plan tax cuts in the \nRepublican-controlled Contract With America and, to a lesser extent, \nthe tax cuts suggested by the President of the United States, that \nfigure will easily exceed $1.5 trillion in cuts that we are going to \nhave to make between now and then.\n   [[Page S541]] Let us get on with it. To achieve this herculean task, \nwe must begin to act now. Maybe we are already too late. To quote the \nCBO report:\n\n       If the budget is to be balanced by the year 2002, it is \n     vitally important that Congress and the President begin \n     immediately to put into effect policy that will achieve that \n     goal.\n\n  That, Mr. President, is what my amendment is all about. My amendment \nwill force Congress to start dealing with this challenge now, not in \nthe year 2002. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle may choose \nto vote against requiring compliance with a balanced budget, but make \nno mistake they will have to vote, they will have to go on record, and \nif Senators vote against my amendment today we will know that they are \nin favor of the idea of a balanced budget but they are not for the \nreality of a balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this is a critical time. We are at a \njuncture where we have the responsibility to show the American people \nthat there is more to our commitment to balance the Federal budget than \nsimply words and phrases, and passing the amendment.\n  I suggest that it is time we showed some courage, as difficult as \nthat is going to be, some responsibility and some constructive \ndefinitive action.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office Economic and Budget Outlook: fiscal \n         Years 1996-2000--a Preliminary Report, January 5, 1995\n\n       In late January, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) will \n     publish ``The Economic and Budget Outlook: Fiscal Years 1996-\n     2000.'' That volume will provide a detailed analysis of the \n     economic and budget situation facing the nation. Because the \n     104th Congress plans to consider economic and budget policies \n     during January, however, CBO is releasing this summary of the \n     forecast, estimates, and projections that will be discussed \n     in the forthcoming report.\n       In brief, there have been no fundamental changes in the \n     economic and budget outlook since CBO's last baseline \n     revisions were released in August 1994. The economy may be a \n     bit more robust in 1995 than was anticipated in August, but a \n     likely slowdown in growth in 1996 leaves the current economic \n     projection for 1999 little different from that which was \n     expected in August.\n       Since CBO's August projections, the short-run outlook for \n     the deficit has deteriorated modestly, but the longer-run \n     picture is essentially unchanged. Higher-than-anticipated \n     interest payments and lower revenues--only partially offset \n     by reduced medical care costs--have pushed up the deficit \n     projections for fiscal years 1995 through 1999 by an average \n     of almost $25 billion a year. CBO now projects that the \n     deficit will be $176 billion in 1995, rising to $207 billion \n     in 1996. CBO's less detailed longer-term projections (for \n     2001 through 2005) indicate, however, that the deficits after \n     2002 will be somewhat lower than those that CBO projected in \n     August.\n       The currently projected deficit for 2002--the first year \n     that a proposed constitutional amendment requiring a balanced \n     budget could go into effect--is $322 billion. CBO has devised \n     an illustrative path to a balanced budget in 2002 that is \n     composed of deficit reduction totaling $1.2 trillion over the \n     1996-2002, an amount that would require major changes in \n     current policies.\n\n                          The Economic Outlook\n\n       CBO expects that the strong business investment and \n     personal consumption of durable goods that spurred the \n     economy to a 4.0 percent real rate of growth in 1994 will \n     continue into the first part of 1995 (see Table 1). The 3.1 \n     percent rate of growth forecast for 1995 is lower than the \n     rate in 1994 but is slightly higher than that anticipated \n     last August. Because CBO estimates that the economy is \n     already operating close to potential, such growth is expected \n     to result in somewhat higher inflation and interest rates. In \n     turn, those higher interest rates are likely to slow growth \n     by the end of the year--cutting it to 1.8 percent in 1996 but \n     dampening inflationary pressures. In CBO's longer-term \n     projections, annual average growth is close to the estimated \n     2.4 percent rate of growth for potential\n      gross domestic product (GDP), inflation averages 3.4 \n     percent, and interest rates are lower than in 1995 and \n     1996.\n\n                           The Budget Outlook\n\n       CBO projects that the deficit will decline from the $203 \n     billion registered in 1994 to $176 billion in 1995, or 2.5 \n     percent of GDP (see Table 2). The deficit's decline in 1995 \n     is not as great as anticipated last August when CBO projected \n     a deficit of $162 billion for that year (see Table 3). Very \n     little of the reestimate for 1995 or other years is the \n     result of legislation adopted since the last baseline. \n     Instead, higher interest rates have increased projected \n     federal interest costs, and lower wage and salary income has \n     led to slightly lower revenue estimates. Changes in \n     projections that cannot be attributed to legislation or to \n     changes in the economic forecast are called technical \n     reestimates. One such reestimate is a reduction in projected \n     revenues to reflect slightly lower-than-expected tax \n     collections in 1994. In addition, the costs of Medicare and \n     Medicaid have been reestimated downward since August to \n     reflect lower-than-expected spending for Medicaid in 1994 and \n     the slowdown that is occurring in the growth of health care \n     cost.\n       Deficits are expected to rise after 1995--to $421 billion \n     in 2005, or 3.6 percent of GDP (for projections of revenues, \n     outlays, and deficits for 1995 through 2005, see Table 4). \n     Those projections assume that current policies governing \n     taxes and mandatory spending remain unchanged. They also \n     assume that discretionary spending is consistent with the \n     statutory limits on appropriations (both for general purpose \n     spending and for spending from the Violent Crime Reduction \n     Trust Fund) that are in effect through 1998, and that \n     discretionary spending grows at the rate of inflation after \n     that. See Table 5 for a comparison of that baseline with one \n     constructed using identical assumptions, except that after \n     1998 discretionary spending is frozen at the dollar level of \n     the 1998 cap. Table 6 shows the projected outlays for the \n     major components of mandatory spending, which are the same in \n     both baselines.\n\n                 Illustrative Path to a Balanced Budget\n\n       A constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget will \n     be considered during the early days of the 104th Congress. If \n     the Congress adopts such an amendment this year and it is \n     ratified by three-quarters of the state legislatures in the \n     next few years, the requirement could apply to the budget for \n     fiscal year 2002. If the budget is to be balanced by 2002, it \n     is vitally important that the Congress and the President \n     begin immediately to put into effect policies that will \n     achieve that goal. According to CBO's latest projections of a \n     baseline that assumes inflation adjustments for discretionary \n     spending after 1998, some combination of spending cuts and \n     tax increases totaling $322 billion in 2002 would be needed \n     to eliminate the deficit in that year. The amounts of deficit \n     reduction called for in the years preceding 2002 depend both \n     on the exact policies adopted and on when the process is \n     started.\n       For illustrative purposes, CBO has devised one possible \n     path leading to a balanced budget in 2002 (see Table 7). \n     Starting from the baseline that assumes an inflation \n     adjustment for discretionary spending after 1998 (see Table \n     4), that path first shows the savings that would be achieved \n     if discretionary spending were instead frozen at the dollar \n     level of the 1998 cap through 2002. Such a freeze, along with \n     the resulting debt-service effects, would produce $89 billion \n     of the required savings of $322 billion in 2002. Under this \n     freeze policy, the buying power of total discretionary \n     appropriations in 2002 would be approximately 20 percent \n     lower than in 1995.\n       CBO also built into the illustrative path a possible course \n     of savings from further policy changes. The amounts of those \n     savings are not based on the adoption of any particular set \n     of policies, but they do assume that policy changes are \n     phased in between 1996 and 1999 in a pattern that is similar \n     to the changes in mandatory spending enacted in the last two \n     reconciliation acts. After 1999, the assumed savings increase \n     at the baseline rate of growth for entitlement and other \n     mandatory spending, excluding Social Security. Such a pattern \n     of savings implies that the cuts implemented in earlier years \n     are permanent and that no additional policy changes are made. \n     If those savings were achieved entirely out of entitlement \n     and other mandatory programs (excluding Social Security), \n     they would represent about a 20 percent reduction from \n     current-policy levels for those programs. Over the entire \n     1996-2002 period, the savings in CBO's illustrative path that \n     result directly from policy changes total more than $1 \n     trillion (in relation to a baseline that includes an \n     inflation adjustment for discretionary spending after 1998). \n     When the resulting savings in debt-service payments are \n     included, the total exceeds $1.2 trillion.\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       CBO's most recent economic and budget projections \n     underscore the challenge that will face policymakers who may \n     have to enact the spending cuts or tax increases needed to \n     balance the budget by 2002. Although, the long-term budget \n     outlook is no worse now than it was last August, the new \n     projections reinforce the fact that the deficit can be \n     eliminated only through major changes in current policies.\n\n                                                                                                                \n[[Page S542]]\n                            TABLE

The     \n  exact path depends on when the deficit reduction begins and the specific policies adopted by the Congress and \n  the President.

The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first let me say to my friend, Senator Exon, who will \nbecome the ranking member of the Budget Committee, I truly welcome you \nsitting with me in the Budget Committee. You will be right next to me, \nand I am hopeful that what you are saying here today in the Chamber \nmeans--and I believe it does--that as we try to put together a major \ndeficit reduction package in the next 8 to 9 weeks, you will be here \nand that you will be at my side as we try to do that.\n  I want to say to the Senate and the public, the Senate Budget \nCommittee intends to make a very significant downpayment on a balanced \nbudget. I do not believe in the very first budget resolution that we \npropose that we can be expected to get to a balanced budget.\n  First of all, we have not adopted the constitutional amendment. That \nmeans the President of the United States is not bound by it, because \nuntil we have that, which would then become the law of the land, the \nPresident does not have to give us a balanced budget format. We are on \nour own.\n  I wish to submit to the Senate, if we come up with a budget deficit \npackage, I say to Senator Nickles, that is anywhere from a $400 to $450 \nbillion reduction over the game plan that is in existence right now, \nthat will be a historic budget. It will start to make Government \nsmaller. It will start to change the underlying law of the land so that \ninstead of going up, the budget deficit will be down and down \npermanently--perhaps, perhaps, I say to my friend, the occupant of the \nchair, down as close as $100 billion 5 years from now, where today it \nis expected to be over $300 billion.\n  Now, I submit all of that can be done if the Senate wants to do it. \nAnd while I commend my friend from Nebraska, who is dedicated and \ndevoted to a constitutional amendment and balance, while I submit that \nwe are also, I do not believe we ought to be legislating how we \nimplement a constitutional amendment here on the floor of the Senate \nwith a 15-minute introduction of a major bill and 15 minutes to discuss \nit. This sounds more like what the Congress of the United States will \nbe engaged in once the States send us this constitutional amendment and \nsay it is the law of the land. Then obviously that amendment says \nimplement that by statute law. This sounds more like an advanced \nimplementation done here in the Chamber of the Senate with no hearings \nand no discussion.\n  I do not say that in any way to denigrate the seriousness that \nSenator Exon, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, places on \nthis issue. It is important. It is important that we not send mixed \nsignals to the public. If we send them a constitutional amendment, we \nought to make a very large downpayment, major downpayment, on that \ndeficit in this very first budget resolution.\n  Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office is warning us today and \nconfirming what some of us on this side have been saying that the last \npackage of so-called deficit reduction efforts did not get the deficit \ndown. It did for a very short period of time. But the underlying basic \nlaws of the land were not changed enough, so that it is going back up \nagain. Our pledge is that in our first resolution we will change that \ntrend by forcing substantive law to be changed, and we will put \neverything on the table, fellow Senators.\n  We do not need this proposal. We are going to put everything there \nexcept Social Security. And we are entitled to a reasonable period of \ntime--3 months--to see if we can do that. We do not need to change the \nBudget Act or change the rules, implement a constitutional amendment on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  Having said that, I understand this matter is debatable, but I would \nlike to make a point of order, unless somebody wants to speak, in which \nevent I will withhold that, but it clearly violates the Budget Act and \nrequires 60 votes from what I understand. I see my friend, Senator \nNickles, standing.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator withhold before he makes the point of \norder----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be pleased to withhold.\n  Mr. NICKLES. So I can address the Senate for a few minutes?\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment Senator Domenici for \nhis statement and also I compliment our colleague from Nebraska for his \nbill. I was hoping in a way it would be a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. But I just tell my colleague from Nebraska, who is now the \nranking member of the Budget Committee, I think the Budget Act should \nbe amended. I will work with him to amend it. I do not think it should \nbe amended on the floor of the Senate today.\n  We do not have to pass--I just make mention to my colleagues--we do \nnot have to pass every amendment that might be around in our first week \nin session. I know there are ideas on campaign reform. There are ideas \non lobbying reform. I hope the majority would like to pass a bill to \nmake Congress abide by the laws like everyone else in the country. The \nHouse has already passed it and the Senate has not. I really would like \nthe Senate to pass it. I introduced it in 1991. We did not win that \ntime. I remember at that time the majority leader was Senator Mitchell. \nHe spoke out very vigorously and he convinced a lot of people and we \nlost. I would really like to pass it. I would like to pass it clean.\n  I am interested in amending the Budget Act. I think our budget \nprocedures do not work very well and one of the things I would like to \nchange is our baseline so we do not have inflated baselines. That is \nsomething, now, that has gained some popularity. Maybe that can be in \npart of our Budget Act Resolution.\n  There are some other things we can do in the Budget Act, I think, \nthat also would make sense. When the Senator from Nebraska says that \nany budget resolution should move us on a path towards a balanced \nbudget, I may well support that. Maybe a direct path. We can negotiate \nthat. But I think the Budget Act probably needs some amendments and I \nwill be happy to work with my colleague from Nebraska to make that \nhappen.\n  I know there are some other amendments that need to be made to the \nBudget Act in addition to this that is before us today. This particular \namendment does not have anything to do with making Congress abide by \nthe laws like everybody else. There are 11 statutes from which Congress \nhas exempted itself, going all the way back to 1935, and we are trying \nto remedy that.\n  I know colleagues have amendments: We want to ban lobbying; we want \nto ban gifts; we want to ban this, and try to correct everything that \ncan possibly be wrong in our first week in session. \n[[Page S546]] We are going to be in session next week. We are going to \nbe in session the following week. The majority leader has already said \nwe can take up several of these issues soon.\n  The Senator from New Mexico said we are going to take up a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. We are going to take up \nimplementing legislation. We are going to take up a budget resolution. \nThat happens by statute. It has to happen, I believe, by April 15. We \nhave to pass a joint resolution implementing the budget resolution. So \nthis is going to happen. It does not have to happen today.\n  So the intent of my colleague from Nebraska, I think, is well made. \nBut I hope we will defer it, or postpone it, and let us look at \nrewriting the Budget Act. Let us not do it on this bill. Let us pass \nthis bill as it is. I would like to pass it today. Let us send it to \nthe President and get his signature on it. I think it would be a \npositive accomplishment for this Congress and for this President.\n  I yield the floor and I thank my colleague from New Mexico for \nyielding to me.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Exon amendment to \nbalance the budget. I am a longtime proponent of balancing the Federal \nbudget and I believe the most effective manner to do this is through an \nhonest budgeting process. This amendment will require truth in \nbudgeting. I wish to add, however, that my support for a balanced \nbudget is contingent on the exemption of the Social Security trust fund \nfrom its enforcement. An overwhelming majority of Americans support a \nbalanced budget amendment but not at the expense of our Nation's senior \ncitizens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I failed to mention one other argument I \nwould like to lay before the Congress. I say to my good friend, as soon \nas the constitutional amendment is adopted by the sovereign States and \nremitted as it must under the Constitution, and it becomes the \nsovereign law of the land, there is a very different dynamic that takes \nplace that we do not have today. That is, we will not be the only part \nof this Government that has to produce a budget resolution that is in \nbalance because, by that time, the President of the United States will \nhave to submit one. The Congress of the United States and the President \nwill be bound by the same generic sovereign law of the land, and I \nbelieve we are going to move ahead with a very substantial, large \ndownpayment, probably far in excess of what the President will submit, \nas our first efforts in the committee.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, I make a point of order that the \npending amendment violates the Budget Act of the United States.\n  Mr. EXON. addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904(c) of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive section 306 of the act for \nthe purpose of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is debatable. The Chair recognizes \nthe Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask that it be in order to ask for the \nyeas and nays at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is in order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank very much my great friend and \ncolleague, the chairman of the Budget Committee, and my friend from \nOklahoma, who is also an important member of the Budget Committee, for \nthe kind statements. We have worked together on many, many things in \nthe past. I assure my chairman of the Budget Committee that I will be \nthere with him, I think as he knows. That does not mean we are always \ngoing to agree on every detail. But I think over the years, we have \ndemonstrated the fact that while we might disagree on some of the \ndetails, I am not certain that our goals have been very significantly \ndifferent.\n  Back to the devil in the details--if we pass a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, then the devil will be in the details. \nWhat I am trying to do is to get a jump start on that. The chairman of \nthe Budget Committee has indicated that we should not bring this up on \nthis particular bill. This is such a far-reaching bill that we cannot \nhave a 15-minute debate, without any hearings, and then come to a \nconclusion.\n  I am prepared to debate this for whatever length of time is \nnecessary. I do not think we can only debate this for 15 minutes. There \nare no time agreements that this Senator is aware of at the present \ntime.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator Kohl of Wisconsin be \nadded as original cosponsor to the amendment that I have offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the chairman of the Budget Committee seems \nto be saying, in one form or another, that we will comply with the \nbalanced budget amendment at some later date. That is just what I am \nconcerned about. Why wait? We all know, as evidenced by what happened \nin the House of Representatives earlier this week, that a balanced \nbudget amendment of some form is going to come over here; 80 percent of \nthe people of the United States, in several polls that I have seen, \nindicate that they support a balanced budget amendment. Therefore, I \nthink it is very clear that we are going to have a balanced budget \namendment before us and I intend to vote for it.\n  We only lost by, if I remember, two or three votes on obtaining the \nrequired two-thirds in the last session of the Senate. So it is a \nforegone conclusion that this is going to come to pass. I am very much \nconcerned, though, when I hear my chairman of the Budget Committee \ntalking about a downpayment, a significant downpayment on the budget. I \nhave just cited the CBO report that indicates over 5 years, the budget \ndeficit is going to be $130 billion to $150 billion more than \npreviously anticipated. I cited in my opening statement the fact that \nthe Congressional Budget Office has said that at a minimum, we are \ngoing to have to cut $1.2 trillion from the budget by the year 2002. We \nare probably going to have some kind of a politically popular middle-\nclass tax cut, which will easily swell that to $1.5 trillion. So I \nsimply say this is not a time to wait.\n  The $500 billion downpayment that is referenced by the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee took a lot of hard work. But it lacks, as far as I \nknow, any real specifics at this time. That is what I am concerned \nabout. We are going to rush to the passage of a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget without anyone having any idea of the \nroadmap and the detail we are going to have to use to get there. As I \nsaid in my opening statement, it is like building a bridge to fantasy \nland without specifying any pillars, and without even specifying any \nhastily sketched plan as to what the bridge is going to look like.\n  It seems to me that, as the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee, \nthe Budget Committee of Republicans and Democrats, we have a \nresponsibility, if indeed we are for a balanced budget amendment, which \nI think most of the Members of this body are, that in doing so we have \nthe responsibility--that is what the Budget Committee is all about--to \nstudy and to bring back the details of how we are going to reach that \ngoal, at least in some specific a fashion, as much as possible. What we \nhave to do, it seems to me, is to show the way, to be specific. I do \nnot think we can wait.\n  If I had some assurance that the amendment that I have offered would \nbe considered in an up or down majority vote sometime in the immediate \nfuture, then I might not be pressing this today. However, I have a \nstrong belief that the more we delay in doing what the Exon amendment \nsays we have to do, the more we are going to be suspect in the eyes of \nthe American people. I am afraid that many of the American people would \nthink passing a constitutional amendment to balance the budget will \njust take care of everything. I say to the Chair and I say to my \ncolleagues, the easiest thing in the world \n[[Page S547]] to do is to pass a constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget which everybody would say amen to; 80 percent of the people \nin the United States and probably 60 to 80 percent of the Members of \nthe Congress would say that is a great idea without fully understanding \nthe difficult role that all are going to have to play in getting from \nhere to there by the year 2002.\n  One thing that comes to mind, Mr. President, very clearly is the \nindication of the chairman of the Budget Committee and I compliment \nSenator Domenici for the hard work he did in coming up at least with \nsome figures in the $400 billion to $500 billion range. But that is \nover a 5-year period. If we would accept that and if the balanced \nbudget amendment is ratified by the States, which I presume it would \nbe, and if we go along with what is recommended by the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, then at best we would be less than halfway and maybe \nonly a third of the way to the $1.2 to $1.5 trillion realistic amount \nof cuts that we are going to have to make to get there.\n  I simply say, Mr. President, by opposing this amendment, I think we \nare sending far more mixed signals to the people of the United States \nas to where the Congress is going and where it is not going and \nprobably how serious we are about passing a politically popular \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  On the subject of hearings, that has been brought up, let me note \nspecifically for the record that this body passed a very famed Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings. We saw that come to the floor of the U.S. Senate \nwithout 1 minute of hearing. I simply say that a constitutional \namendment to balance the Federal budget has been discussed. Hearings \nwere held on it for a long, long time. It is not a particularly \ncomplicated piece of legislation in and of itself. It just creates a \nconstitutional amendment that has to be passed by both bodies and sent \nto the States where 75 percent of the States would have to ratify that \nbefore it becomes law. I simply say that if we passed Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings way back in 1985 without hearings, which in some ways was a \nvery complicated piece of legislation, then we do not have to have more \nhearings on this subject because we know we are going to pass it \nanyway. Certainly, I must say that I believe the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee is very sincere in his belief. But this is one of those cases \nthat I indicated earlier which it just so happens that good friends who \nI think are working in the same direction do not agree on how fast we \nshould move.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee wants to wait for ratification \nof the constitutional amendment seemingly before we do anything more \ndynamic than the $400 to $500 billion grab bag of reductions that have \nbeen suggested. I know the chairman has worked very hard on those. I do \nnot mean to say that his task was not sincere. I do say, though, that \nif all we are going to do is to come up with $500 billion in possible \nsavings, then if we are going to wait around for the States to ratify, \nthe months and years are going to go by and then the next Congress of \nthe United States and maybe the one after that or the one after that \nwill be facing a 2-year period between the year 2000 and the year 2002 \nwhen they are going to have to cut $1 trillion or somewhere in that \narea over and beyond, assuming we enact all of the cuts of the roughly \n$500 billion that has been named in one fashion or another by the \nchairman of the Budget Committee.\n  I think more than anything else, Mr. President, that demonstrates the \nneed that, if we are sincere about this, we have to do much more than \nthe timely work that has been done by the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee with the reference to the $400 to $500 billion that has been \nidentified loosely in one fashion or another. I am afraid that we \ncannot wait. We must not wait or we are going to send the signal to the \nAmerican people that after their States ratify a constitutional \namendment, then we will get on with our business of balancing the \nbudget.\n  If we are sincere, then I think we should start making \nrecommendations now, making cuts now that we know we are going to have \nto do anyway. I simply say that putting off the hard choices until \nafter a constitutional provision is ratified by the States would be a \nstep in the wrong direction.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma says that there is nothing \nin my amendment dealing with applying the laws of Congress. What \ngreater law is there in applying laws of Congress to the laws that we \nhave imposed on the people than offering them a constitutional \namendment but then saying but we are not going to get into the details \nof this until you make your determination? I happen to believe that the \nBudget Committee, the House of Representatives Budget Committee, the \nSenate Budget Committee, respective bodies have an obligation to spell \nout in as much detail as we possibly can what it is going to take, what \nthe sacrifices are that are going to have to be made to reach the \nbalanced budget by the year 2002. That is why I said in my opening \nstatement that unless we do something more than what has been done now, \nI am afraid that we are bringing forth a sham on the American people. \nCertainly I do not believe that the American people want any more \nshams. I guess that was one of the conclusions that this one Democratic \nSenator from a Republican State took from the last election.\n  I, therefore, say delaying the decisions that have to be made is not \nonly unwise and unsound fiscal policy of which we have been on for far \ntoo many years, but it is also not satisfactory. It is not carrying out \nour responsibility to tell the people of the United States of America \nto tell the legislatures of the 50 sovereign States of the United \nStates and to tell all interested parties how we might be able to get \nthere in the year 2002.\n  I simply say that you do not have to be a mathematical genius to \nrecognize the fact that we are going to twiddle our thumbs and not do \nmore than has been thus far recommended--and\n again I salute him for the recommendations he has made. But if we are \ngoing to sit and twiddle our thumbs for 5 years and say we are going to \ncut about $500 billion in this fashion, then when and if the States \nratify the measure, that Congress, both the Members of the House and \nthe U.S. Senate, are going to be in dire circumstances indeed. And we \nwill be faced with the proposition of either extending the year 2002 to \nsome other date 7 or 8 years into the future beyond that, or they are \ngoing to have to make more draconian cuts than they can make in the \nbudget that is still running to a large extent out of hand, and/or they \nwould have to pass such massive tax increases to meet the year 2002 \nthat it would be universally unpopular with 80 or 90 percent of the \npeople of the United States of America. If that is not enough, such a \ntax increase would certainly send the United States of America into a \ndeep, deep depression, not unlike what some of us remember happened \nback in the 1930's.\n\n  Therefore, I renew my plea, Mr. President, and say that there is \nnothing revolutionary about the Exon amendment. The Exon amendment is \nstraightforward. I think the amendment, if people sit and study it on \nboth sides of the aisle, could simply be summed up that if you are for \na constitutional amendment to balance the budget, then you have to be \nfor the Exon amendment or you are not being fully square with the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I inquire if we are going to have a recess at the \nhour of 1 p.m.?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no such order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you. I ask unanimous consent that I may speak for 7 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. The \nSenator is not going to speak on this issue?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Very briefly, in passing, just a sentence to make an \nobservation. But I have a bill I have introduced and I would like to \ntake about 7 minutes to speak about it, if I might.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I say to my friend from California, the majority \nleader is suggesting that we are almost finished with this amendment \nand that perhaps you can have that time after we have disposed of this \namendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I inquire, what time does he feel we will be voting on \nthis amendment.\n   [[Page S548]] Mr. DOLE. Does the Senator from Arkansas wish to speak \non the amendment?\n  Mr. PRYOR. The Senator from Arkansas would like to speak for a few \nmoments in making an observation about this amendment. I ask, through \nthe Chair, the distinguished majority leader, do we plan on a vote on \nthe Exon amendment this afternoon?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I may----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I would say that from the majority leader's standpoint, I \nwould like to vote on the Exon amendment very quickly. We are supposed \nto be meeting from 12 to 2 with the Governors. Half of that time has \nalready elapsed and I have yet to show up at the meeting. From a \npersonal standpoint--if we can vote on the Exon amendment, I would be \nhappy to yield whatever time the Senator from California may need or \nhowever long the Senator from Arkansas may wish to speak following \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you. I compliment Senator Exon and associate myself \nwith his remarks. We have to balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, I request 60 seconds, if I might, at this time to \nspeak on another topic.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Boxer pertaining to the introduction of \nlegislation are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as I understand it, the Senator from \nArkansas would like to speak on the amendment, and the Senator from \nPennsylvania would like to speak for 3 minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we vote on the motion to waive at 1:05.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. EXON. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. EXON. Reserving the right to object. I would say to the majority \nleader that I do not intend a filibustering action on this, but when \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee said something earlier about only \nhaving 15 minutes to debate that, that came as a big surprise to me. I \ndo not know, nor did I hear, what the majority leader said a few \nmoments ago about some kind of a vote between 1 or 2 o'clock sometime. \nI am here ready to debate and do business.\n  I believe there are some other individuals that would very much like \nthe opportunity to possibly come over and say a few words on this. I \nhad not anticipated that we would vote that early. However, I recognize \nthe parliamentary rights of the other side to make a motion to table at \nany particular time. May I ask of the majority leader, why do we want \nto vote on this at 1:05 when I have some other things I would like to \nsay on this myself? The Senator from California has indicated some \ninterest in it, as has the Senator from Arkansas. What is the rush to \nvote by 1:05?\n  Mr. DOLE. There is no rush, but I can move to table right now and we \ncan vote at 12:55. We can always do that. We do not have to wait until \n1:05. I am trying to accommodate the Senators on each side, including \nthis Senator, but we will vote at 4 o'clock then. Would that be all \nright?\n  Mr. EXON. Yes, 4 o'clock is all right.\n  Mr. DOLE. I do not want to vote at 4 o'clock. But we are going to do \na lot of work here today. We are not going to have one or two votes \ntoday, because we are trying to finish this bill by Monday evening. I \ndo not see any way that is going to happen. I do not have any quarrel \nwith the Senator from Nebraska taking all the time he wishes, up to \nsome reasonable point. At that point, we would move to table. But \nbecause he has not had much time for debate----\n  Mr. EXON. May I say, Mr. President, to the majority leader that \ncertainly I would think that I could agree now to a vote not later than \n4 o'clock, with the time between now and then equally divided. We might \nbe able to speed it up, depending on how many want to talk.\n  Mr. DOLE. I would rather not make that request now. I know some \nMembers have other plans this afternoon--not this Member, but other \nMembers on both sides of the aisle--who would like to not only complete \nthis amendment but a couple of others and maybe get an agreement. As I \nunderstand it, there will be a meeting at 1 o'clock on the other side \nto see if we can reach some agreement so those who had amendments could \nstay and debate them. Those who did not have amendments could keep \ntheir commitments, in some cases far away from here. We are trying to \naccommodate all Senators. So I would not want to wait until 4 o'clock. \nWhy do we not just say we will revisit it in 30 or 45 minutes?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I understand the difficult task the majority \nleader has, and I think usually I have cooperated, and I want to \ncooperate now. He has indicated probably we will not finish this bill \ntoday and we may be stacking some votes and vote next week.\n  Mr. DOLE. Next week means next Monday. Probably votes will occur \nafter 3 o'clock. In any event, I know the distinguished minority \nleader, Senator Daschle, will be meeting at 1 o'clock to see how many \namendments will be remaining on that side. We are perfectly prepared to \nreach agreement so that those who have amendments can stay and debate \nthem but not vote. But we would like to vote on this one today.\n  Mr. EXON. I would prefer, frankly, if I could, to stay here and \ndebate this however late and possibly stack the vote on the Exon \namendment along with any other votes that the majority leader wishes to \nstack next week, or whatever is his pleasure.\n  Mr. DOLE. My pleasure would be not to do that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not want to deny the Senator time. \nAnd I hope he did not interpret my saying 15 minutes--I had inquired of \nhis staff how long the Senator intended to speak and they said 15 \nminutes and I, quite inappropriately, assumed that was the extent of \nthe debate. I clearly do not intend to hold anybody to 15 minutes. That \nis what I understood.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I had not planned to speak this afternoon. \nI certainly do not want to obstruct the flow of legislative business \nhere.\n  First, I would like to compliment my colleague and friend from \nNebraska on his proposal this afternoon. I also want to say that I \ncannot support it at this time.\n  I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues, Mr. \nPresident, the fact that in one section of the amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska, which the Senate this afternoon, \nin just a few minutes of debate, is going to be asked vote on, states \nthat it is ``essential that Congress, one, adopt a balanced budget \namendment.'' That is one thing that the Exon amendment proposes to do.\n  So we, after a very few moments and a very small skirmish on a very \nlarge constitutional issue, Mr. President, are going to be required in \na few moments, with many absences--I assume some of our colleagues have \ngone back to their States, to vote on whether or not we think ``the \nCongress should adopt a balanced budget amendment.'' Maybe we think \nthat the Congress should; maybe we think the Congress should not. But \nthis is a very, very far-reaching proposal.\n  Mr. President, my colleague and friend from Nebraska stated in the \nopening moments of his very eloquent presentation the fact that the \nAmerican public, by overwhelming numbers, says, yes, we need a balanced \nbudget and we need a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I \nthink there was a CBS poll or one of the polling operations that \nreported today or yesterday that a great majority of those polled say \nwe need a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, I know there is a great euphoria around the Capitol \nthese \n[[Page S549]] days, but I do not think that euphoria is of such \nmagnitude and intensity and velocity at this moment that the American \npeople might not give us say a few months, a few months, perhaps even \nin the summer, early fall or October, certainly before we leave, to let \nus decide whether or not we want to propose to the 50 States that an \namendment to the Federal Constitution be adopted to require a balanced \nbudget.\n  The Exon proposal, in my opinion, is a very, very responsible \nproposal because it will require, Mr. President, the policies to be \nspecified that would be required to enforce a balanced budget amendment \nor, to say it in another way--I assume I am speaking with some degree \nof correctness--it would imply that there would have to be implementing \nlegislation that would have to go along with a balanced budget \namendment. I think that is a responsible course of action.\n  I think, Mr. President, for us to this afternoon, on Friday, with a \nshort debate, to even take a position on whether we want to, require 60 \nvotes to waive a point of order--that is a new order of consideration \nprovided by the Exon amendment--is questionable. We even go back to a \nprocedure under the old Gramm-Rudman-Hollings concept that provides \nthat the point of order will be suspended if Congress declares war or \nadopts a resolution certifying low economic growth. This is another \nquestion.\n  But the Senator from Nebraska has put his finger on one of the most \nimportant things, and that is, do the people want us to vote for a \nbalanced budget amendment before we know the facts?\n  Now, do we know the facts, Mr. President? No, we do not know the \nfacts. When we know the facts, then it will be the proper time and the \nproper opportunity for us to vote yes or no on whether we prefer a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Federal Constitution.\n  I hope that there will be some way to accommodate the Senator from \nNebraska. I wish we could debate this even until next week, because I \ndo not see the necessity to rush an amendment like this through, one of \nsuch important consequences, for which I do applaud my colleague and \nfriend from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend and colleague from Arkansas. I will be \nvery brief, I say to my friend from Pennsylvania.\n  I thank the Senator for his very kind remarks and observations. I, \ntoo, would like to put off the vote on this until next week, as I \nindicated in my conversations with the majority leader.\n  There is not anything very revolutionary about this proposal. I would \nsimply explain to the Senator from Arkansas that if we did not pass a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, that even if we passed \nthe Exon amendment it would have no real effect. The Exon amendment \nwould only have effect if and when we do pass a constitutional \namendment.\n  The reason I think it is appropriate to address this now is that we \nare talking about applying the same rules to the Congress as we do to \nthe people. I think it follows, then, that if we are going to rush \npell-mell, as I suggested we are going to do--we are not going to wait \nseveral months, I suggest, as the Senator from Arkansas said he would \nlike to see. I think that the first 100 days, maybe the first 10 days, \nat least the first 10 weeks of this session are going to be very \nclimactic ones and I am very fearful that things are going to be rolled \nthrough over here very rapidly.\n  What this Exon amendment does is simply send out the signal that when \nand if we do pass a constitutional amendment, then we have the \nresponsibility to direct the Budget Committee to come back with some \ndetails, rather than passing the amendment and worrying about the \ndetails afterwards.\n  I thank my friend from Arkansas for his observations.\n  Mr. President, let me say I just want to correct myself. It does have \nan effect whether we pass the balanced budget amendment or not. It \nreally says that if we proceed, we proceed in an orderly fashion, which \nis what the amendment is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is no disagreement on the floor \ntoday about the desirability of having a balanced budget so that the \nFederal Government would live within its means as every other \ngovernmental entity, like the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has a \nconstitutional requirement to have a balanced budget. Every city and \ncounty in my State and every governmental unit across the country has \nto live within its means within a balanced budget. Only the Federal \nGovernment has the prerogative to print money, script, and borrow and \nnot live within its means. This is an affront to every family, and the \ncomment has often been made on this floor.\n  In the 14 years-plus that I have been in this body, we have debated \nand talked about this subject, I think, more than any other and there \nis I think agreement that we need a balanced budget.\n  Yesterday, in the Judiciary Committee, we had a very constructive \nhearing analyzing many legal considerations on enacting a \nconstitutional amendment for a balanced budget. I think we will soon do \nthat.\n The amendment proposed by the Senator from Nebraska on its face does \nsomething a little different. That is, it ``enforces through the \ncongressional budget process the requirement to achieve a balanced \nFederal budget.''\n\n  The distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee has raised an \nunderstandable objection to this point in tying the hands of the Budget \nCommittee this afternoon with very little debate and only a few \nSenators on the floor, tying the hands of the Budget Committee on what \nit will do. I would suggest to the Senator from Nebraska that the \npreferable course would be for the Senator from Nebraska in his \nposition as the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee to offer the \nspecific amendments to achieve a balanced budget. One of the \ndifficulties in the Senate and the House has been that we have done a \nlot of talking about the desirability of a balanced budget, but no one \nhas come forward and introduced on the floor the specifics of a \nbalanced budget.\n  So I would say to the Senator from Nebraska, as the ranking member, \nthe senior Democrat on the Budget Committee, let him come forward with \nthe specifics. He wants a balanced budget. We all do. He thinks he can \npropose a balanced budget this year. Let him do so. Let him take it to \nthe committee or let him take it to the floor and then we will vote on \nit.\n  I expect to be a chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee this \nsession on Labor, Health, Human Services and Education, a committee I \nhave served on in the 14 years-plus I have been in the Senate, and was \nranking member last year. I have already called the Secretaries of each \nof those departments and have said to them, what are you going to be \nasking for by way of appropriations next year? What is it that may be \neliminated? What is it that we may be able to cut on the budget in \nterms of specifics? I think there is no doubt that the mandate of last \nNovember's election was that the American people want smaller \nGovernment, want reduced spending, and would like to see tax cuts.\n  I believe that we should have tax cuts but I am not prepared to vote \nfor a tax cut sight unseen. I am not prepared to engage in the bidding \non a middle-class tax cut until we see that we have savings. I do not \nthink we should have tax cuts if it will add to the deficit. I do \nthink, parenthetically, we should have promptly a capital gains tax \ncut. That is the one tax cut which we could enact promptly which would \nnot lead to a revenue loss. There were 56 Members of this body in the \nlast session of Congress prepared to have a capital gains tax cut. We \ncould not get it through against a filibuster. That is one tax cut we \ncould have.\n  As to others, we ought not to be in that bidding war until we see \nwhat spending cuts we will have. Now, as the prospective chairman of \nthe Subcommittee of Labor, Health, Human Services and Education with a \ndiscretionary budget of approximately $70 billion, I am looking for \nplaces to cut. But I am not prepared to make cuts \n[[Page S550]] with a meat ax but instead with a scalpel. I am not \nprepared to talk about the generalizations.\n  I think that the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Senator \nDomenici, the chairman of the Budget Committee, is exactly right when \nhe says, as the chairman with the responsibility to direct those \ndeliberations, that he does not want to see an enforcement mechanism \nwhich will compel the Budget Committee to take action before the Budget \nCommittee has a chance to go through the items line by line, which is \nwhat the Senator from Arkansas, Senator Pryor, is in effect saying. \nWhat I am saying, is take a look at the specifics of the budget on \nLabor, Health, Human Services and Education, three committees that have \ndiscretionary budgets up to $70 billion.\n  The other two provisions in the amendment by the Senator from \nNebraska I think are not worthy of adoption. The first one is to adopt \nin the first session of the 104th Congress, a joint resolution \nproposing, an amendment to the Constitution requiring, a balanced \nFederal budget. We are already considering that. It will not do any \ngood to talk any more about that until the Judiciary Committee reports \nout an amendment and we act on it on the Senate floor.\n  The second line to set forth with specificity in the first session of \nthe 104th Congress is what the policies of achieving such a balanced \nFederal budget would require. Mr. President, I think we are well aware \nat this stage of the life of the Congress of what the policies are. I \nwould say that although this matter is worthy of debate it has been on \nthe floor for a little more than an hour. I do not see any avalanche of \nSenators coming to the floor to debate the resolution.\n  What we ought to be doing at this point is talking about the \nspecifics. Talking about the specifics in my subcommittee and talking \nabout the specifics in the Budget Committee. I would invite the Senator \nfrom Nebraska to propose the details as to how he would balance the \nbudget. I can assure that this Senator will look closely at that role \nand would work with him in trying to balance a budget with real money. \nNot a confederate proposition of ``let's talk about it,'' but let \nMembers be specific about how we will do it. I join him in that effort.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I certainly thank my colleague and friend \nfrom Pennsylvania for his remarks, as much as I disagree with them. \nCertainly, the Senator from Pennsylvania knows, as I believe the \nchairman of the Budget Committee knows, and as he has indicated in \nremarks on this debate this afternoon, that the ranking Democrat on the \nBudget Committee will and is prepared to play a role in developing a \nlist of possibilities that we could come up with.\n  This does not fall solely on one Senator, just as it does not fall on \nany one Senator as to what is done in the Health and Labor Committee, \nthe Judiciary Committee, or anything else.\n  I would simply say that I will be working with the Republican \nmajority the control of all of the committees and all of the \nsubcommittees to jointly work out something. This is not a sole \nexercise on any Member's part.\n  The Exon amendment that is currently before us simply tries to define \nthe difficult task that we have in front of us. It simply says that \nwhether we pass the balanced budget amendment or not, and I think we \nwill, we still have a serious, serious, deficit problem on our hands. I \nthink the Budget Committee should play a key role in this.\n  And in answer to the suggestions of the Senator from Pennsylvania, I \nwill be working very closely with the other members of the Budget \nCommittee, whether or not the Exon amendment is adopted, in the name of \nfiscal responsibility, where I have been working now, for a long, long \ntime.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania has remarked on the valuable hearings \nthat the Judiciary Committee has been holding regarding the enforcement \nof the balanced budget amendment. As he probably noted, and this is \nalso a concern of this Senator, one of the important considerations \nunder that amendment is whether and how the courts--the courts, I \nemphasize--might enforce the balanced budget amendment. That is one of \nthe reasons that I offered the amendment that I have. I do not think \nthat the courts should be making these decisions. They should be made \nhere in the U.S. Senate and in the House of Representatives.\n  My amendment, contrary to what I am afraid my friend from \nPennsylvania thought, helps clear some of that up by mandating that the \nreal congressional enforcement by specifics would be outlined, \ntherefore, keeping, hopefully, endorsement in Congress and out of the \ncourts, where I think none of us thinks it belongs.\n  I think we need to talk specifics. I think we need to talk specifics \nnot as individual Senators but in the Budget Committee, and in the \nother committees of the Congress that have some jurisdiction. We need \nto start planning now where we are going to go between now and the year \n2002. I object very strenuously to some of the talk that has been \ncarried forth here. With regard to that we do not have to rush into \nthis. We do need to rush in, I suggest, to some kind of a blueprint \nthat would give us some kind of a guide, some kind of an understanding \nby the people at large on where we are going to go, ask how we are \ngoing to get there.\n  Let us make no mistake about it, we have to work together. But let us \nalso make no mistake about it that, as the last election clearly \nindicates, while the Republicans are in the majority here, I have said \ntime and time again during this debate, and will be saying it in the \nfuture, that I will work as a dedicated Member of the loyal opposition, \nnot being an obstructionist but pointing out fiscal responsibility and \nwhere I think we should be going, not taking the easy road and simply \nsaying, ``Let's just go ahead and pass this constitutional amendment to \nthe budget. Then if the States, in their wisdom, 75 percent of them, \nratify this, we will get down to the basics.''\n  I think that is not the way to go, and I am very fearful that that is \nthe course that we are about to travel. I understand that the minority \nleader will be on the floor shortly to talk on this subject. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would like to fill in a little time, if \nmy colleagues do not object--but when the minority leader comes to the \nfloor, I will cease my remarks.\n  I would like to make just two or three more points, Mr. President. I \nthink that what the Senator from Nebraska is doing, the concept that he \nis laying out is absolutely sound. I think it is responsible, and I \nthink that it is something we have to do prior to the vote on a \nbalanced budget amendment. There may be a lot of different thought in \nthis Chamber as to what the outcome of this debate might or might not \nbe.\n  Second, I think we need to know some more basic things about a \nbalanced budget amendment. I think we need to know how we are going to \nachieve a balanced budget, and if some Senators say, ``Oh, we have 7 or \n8 years to figure that out; we'll just vote the balanced budget \namendment in and we will feel good; we will write a press release; we \nwill go back home and we will boast that we have voted for a balanced \nbudget amendment,'' that does not take a lot of creativity, nor a lot \nof courage.\n  I think what we have to ask ourselves is this: How are we going to \nachieve a balanced budget if we adopt the balanced budget amendment? \nWhat will be the implementing legislation that will be called for? What \nis going to be the issue with regard to rescission? What is going to be \nthe answer with regard to impoundment? Are we going to basically \nexclude or include Social Security? Are we going to exclude or include \nveterans benefits?\n  These are the types of issues, Mr. President, that I think we need to \nknow before we stake out the course of this afternoon, saying it is a \ncongressional decision, that it is essential for \n[[Page S551]] Congress to adopt a balanced budget amendment.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania stated there is no disagreement among \nanyone, I think, in this Chamber of whether we need a balanced budget. \nThat is different from a balanced budget amendment, I say respectfully, \nand I certainly agree with my colleague and friend from Pennsylvania. \nBut we have a lot of things going on here. We have the Contract With \nAmerica. Some of it has already started to roll. Things are happening \nvery quickly.\n  We are going to have a markup on Monday, I believe, in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, on an issue that may or may not change \nthe relationship between the Federal and State governments. That is a \nvoluminous piece of legislation. It is a piece of legislation that I \nwill probably vote for. But, Mr. President, I do not think we are \ntaking enough time to really look and analyze some of these far-\nreaching pieces of legislation before we cast our vote.\n  But a constitutional amendment to the Federal Constitution to require \na balanced budget I think should be voted on when we have the facts, \nwhen we know how we are going to achieve and how we will implement that \nbalanced budget that all of us may ultimately support.\n  Mr. President, those are the comments that I have. I see other \nSenators may be coming to the floor desiring to speak. So with that I \nwill yield the floor, and I will suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, do I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does have the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent that I may, as \nthe Senator who has the floor, propound a question to the Senator from \nNebraska without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. My question is this, may I say to the distinguished \nSenator: Would the Senator be willing to revise his proposal in a way \nthat would delete the language that is set forth in paragraph (1) and \nin (a), preceding (1), which reads as follows:\n\n       Purpose.--The Congress declares it essential that the \n     Congress--\n       (1) adopt in the first session of the 104th Congress a \n     joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution \n     requiring a balanced Federal budget.\n\n  Mr. President, before he responds, there are some other aspects of \nthis proposal that the distinguished Senator has made here that I like. \nI think he is not willing to go into this thing with his eyes shut. He \nis not willing just to go along with having a constitutional amendment \non a balanced budget, although I believe I heard him say he was going \nto vote for one. I hope he will, in his characteristic fashion, think \nthat through. I have always thought of him as a man who really thinks \nmatters through, and the fact that he has offered this as a proposal \ntoday indicates to me that he is thinking that through and that he sees \nsome problems with it.\n  I like most of what the Senator has, but I do not like and could \nnever support (a) and (1):\n\n       The Congress declares it essential that the Congress adopt \n     in the first session of the 104th Congress a joint resolution \n     proposing an amendment to the Constitution requiring a \n     balanced Federal budget.\n\n  I am not for that. I will not be for it tomorrow, and I am going to \ndo everything I can to oppose that for reasons that I will explain \nlater.\n  Now, would the Senator consider revising his proposal so as to leave \nout that language to which I object strenuously?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, in response to my friend and colleague from \nWest Virginia, I hear his sound and wise advice very clearly. You are \nnot the only Senator that has raised that question, but you are the \nfirst one.\n  I will certainly say I have a right to revise the amendment. I have \nit under consideration to revise it at this time.\n  As I take it, if I would revise the amendment and any amendment \nanyone ever writes, we could say afterwards, ``Had I had it to do over \nagain, I would have struck this way.''\n  If I could anticipate the support of the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia, I take it that he would simply say that we would strike \nlines 7, 8, and 9, and strike ``(2)'' in line 10 and make that ``(1)''; \nlikewise, on line 3, on the second page, strike ``1'' and make it \n``2,'' that the Senator would feel, with those changes, he would be in \na position to support the amendment?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is getting very close. He is getting very \nclose. I do not want to say right here that I would support that as the \nSenator has outlined the precise changes, but he is moving in the \ndirection, and I would like to see what he puts in as (a). I would like \nto see what goes in in lieu of what is being taken out.\n  Mr. EXON. May I ask the Senator from Arkansas, who has also spoken to \nme privately about this general subject, if he agrees with the \ndiscussion that just took place between the Senator from West Virginia \nand this Senator.\n  I would certainly say that I am one of those who for a long time has \nsupported a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, and I \nintend to support one when it is finally presented in some form, if \nthat form does not raise too many barriers. If I am presented with a \nconstitutional amendment that says but you cannot touch this and you \ncannot touch that, I may be in a position of having to say that that \nkind of a constitutional amendment is unworkable and under those \ncircumstances I could not support it. But I want to make it clear that \nthis Senator supports a constitutional amendment to balance the budget \nbut not just any one.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, do I still have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Before the distinguished Senator from Nebraska inquires of \nthe distinguished Senator from Arkansas with reference to this matter, \nmay I also ask the Senator how he would feel about this proposed \nlanguage, if the Senator from Arkansas will also indulge me.\n  I would ask the Senator from Nebraska, does he see anything \ninherently objectionable in the following changes that I would propose:\n\n       (a) Purpose. The Congress declares that prior to any vote \n     to adopt in the first session of the 104th Congress a joint \n     resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution \n     requiring a balanced Federal budget, it is essential--\n\n  This is paragraph (2).--\n\n       That it set forth with specificity in the first session--\n\n  And I am picking up the Senator's language thereon.\n  This would not declare that it is essential that the Congress adopt a \nconstitutional amendment on a balanced budget. I do not think that is \nessential. So I am opposed to that. But if we are going to have that, \nthen the Senator would then be saying with his proposal:\n\n       The Congress declares that--\n       (1) Prior to any vote to adopt in the first session of the \n     104th Congress a joint resolution proposing an amendment to \n     the Constitution requiring a balanced budget;\n       (2) It is essential that it set forth with specificity in \n     the first session of the 104th Congress the policies that \n     achieving such a balanced Federal budget would require; and\n       (3) Enforce through the congressional budget process the \n     requirement to achieve a balanced Federal budget.\n\n  I do not have any comments on the rest of it at this point. I will \nhave to look carefully at the remainder of the Senator's proposal. But \nI think he is working on what seems to me to be a very worthwhile \nproposal.\n  I have asked the question.\n  Mr. EXON. I am glad to respond to my friend from West Virginia. I \nwill take all that I have under consideration.\n  The Senator makes some good points. There are some others who may not \nbe totally enthusiastic about this.\n  But I do not, again, think that there is any set language or set \nrules. I just want to make it clear that this Senator has long \nsupported a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. After the \nSenator from Arkansas, \n[[Page S552]] who I believe sought recognition and was going to ask me \na question, remarks, I am looking forward to thoughts and suggestions \nby my friend from Illinois, with whom I have worked for many, many \nyears and was one of the pull horses when we lost by two or three votes \nlast year. I am very much interested in what his views are on all of \nthis.\n  Did the Senator seek to ask me a question or was the Senator seeking \nthe floor in his own right?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I still have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that I may yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska for the purpose of his asking those \nquestions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Without my losing the right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas had thought that \nthe Senator from Nebraska was posing a question, and I was rising to \nanswer that question. I would like to answer, if I may, by saying I \nthink the Senator is certainly moving in the right direction.\n  Right now, on Friday afternoon, before we have really geared up the \nSenate, before we really place our feet and our positions in concrete \non whether we support or reject the idea of a constitutional amendment, \nit is in the spirit of good legislative wisdom and in keeping with the \nlegislative philosophy of the Senator from Nebraska, I am sure, that \nthis change be made, and if that change is made, I will \nenthusiastically--enthusiastically--support the requirements of \nspecificity that the Senator from Nebraska is addressing in his \namendment.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend from Arkansas. I will take that under \nadvisement.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend from West Virginia for yielding.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. If I may have the attention of my colleague from Nebraska \nand also the attention of my friend from West Virginia, I have no \nobjection to dropping point one because this is coming down the road.\n  I would have objection to the language offered by Senator Byrd. \nSenator Byrd and I differ on this, and Senator Byrd is obviously trying \nto put some language in here where we will end up fighting over how we \nbalance the budget rather than first establishing the principle. I \nthink it is important that we first establish the principle.\n  So if my colleague from Nebraska were to accept the Byrd amendment, \nwith all due respect to the Cicero of the Senate, I would have to \nobject, I would have to oppose the Exon amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield for just a brief statement?\n  Mr. SIMON. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. EXON. I was very interested in hearing the Senator--Cicero, or \nthe Senator from Illinois--because I had anticipated exactly what my \ncolleague just said. He probably would not object to what I suggested \noriginally. But when Senator Byrd carried it one step further, I saw \nhim rise.\n  Mr. SIMON. That is correct.\n  Mr. EXON. It is nice, though, that we do have this kind of \nconsideration.\n  Mr. President, to try to bring this matter to a head, I send a \nrevised amendment to the desk which is the revised amendment that I \nfirst suggested. It strikes lines 7, 8, and 9 of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois still has the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. I am sorry.\n  Mr. SIMON. If I could just ask one other question on the amendment, \nbecause I basically like the thrust of the Senator's amendment. Suppose \nthat a year from now or 2 years from now or 3 years from now, we come \nin with a health program for the Nation with an increase in cigarette \ntaxes or some other revenue. This amendment would not cause us to have \n60 votes to pass such a package, would it?\n  Mr. EXON. It is neutral on that. I think the Senator knows full well \nwhat happened in the House of Representatives the other day. But as of \nnow, it would be considered as it has traditionally been considered, a \nmajority vote.\n  However, I would simply say that if something like that were offered \nunder the budget rules, a point of order could be raised if we do not \npay for it.\n  Mr. SIMON. Yes, that is correct. And I agree with that completely. \nWhatever we do in the way of spending we have to have the revenue for \nit. I just want to make sure that we are not locking out some other \npossibility.\n  Mr. EXON. We are not.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank my colleague from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I understand the leader hopes to speak on \nthis amendment very shortly. I understand that Senator Bradley wishes \nto speak on the amendment shortly and is on his way over.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished leader, \nSenator Daschle, be added as original cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 6, As Modified\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk as earlier \noutlined. It simply strikes lines 7, 8, and 9. On line 10 it strikes \nthe number 2 and inserts the number 1. And on line 3, on the second \npage, it strikes the number 3 and inserts the number 2.\n  I send that modified amendment to the desk and ask the amendment be \nso modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to modify his \namendment. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 6) as modified is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .--CONGRESSIONAL ENFORCEMENT OF A BALANCED BUDGET\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The Congress declares it essential that the \n     Congress--\n       (1) set forth with specificity in the first session of the \n     104th Congress the policies that achieving such a balanced \n     Federal budget would require; and\n       (2) enforce through the congressional budget process the \n     requirement to achieve a balanced Federal budget.\n       (b) Point of Order Against Budget Resolutions that Fail To \n     Set Forth a Glide Path to a Balanced Budget.--Section 301 of \n     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended by inserting \n     at the end thereof the following new subsection:\n       ``(j) Congressional Enforcement of a Balanced Budget.--It \n     shall not be in order to consider any concurrent resolution \n     on the budget (or amendment, motion, or conference report \n     thereon) that--\n       ``(A) fails to set forth appropriate levels for all items \n     described in subsection (a)(1) through (7) for all fiscal \n     years through 2002;\n       ``(B) sets forth a level of outlays for fiscal year 2002 or \n     any subsequent fiscal year that exceeds the level of revenues \n     for that fiscal year; or\n       ``(C) relies on the assumption of either--\n       ``(i) reductions in direct spending, or\n       ``(ii) increases in revenues, without including specific \n     reconciliation instructions under section 310 to carry out \n     those assumptions.''.\n       (c) Requirement for 60 Votes To Waive or Appeal in the \n     Senate.--Section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 \n     is amended by inserting ``301(j),'' after ``301(i),'' in both \n     places that it appears.\n       (d) Suspension in the Event of War or Congressionally-\n     Declared Low Growth.--Section 258(b)(2) of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended \n     by inserting ``301(j),'' after ``sections''.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as a longtime supporter of a balanced \nbudget amendment, I am pleased to join my very distinguished colleague \nfrom Nebraska in offering this amendment.\n  This amendment says we should translate words into action that we \nhave to take immediate steps to balance the Federal budget. Passing a \nconstitutional amendment to require a balanced budget 7 years from \nnow, \n[[Page S553]] while highly appropriate, does nothing today.\n  From all appearances, a balanced budget amendment will pass Congress \nthis year. There appears to be widespread support on both sides of the \naisle on that point.\n  But we simply cannot afford to wait until 2001 to start complying \nwith the balanced budget amendment. By doing so, we will be adding a \nfar greater burden to our national debt, which already is above $4 \ntrillion.\n  If we pledge our commitment to continued deficit reduction today, we \nwill still need more than $1 trillion of cuts over the next 7 years to \nbalance the budget by the year 2002.\n  If we delay even 1 year, the national debt will increase by over $150 \nbillion as a result of that delay, and the interest on the debt will be \napproximately $50 billion greater. Each year that we delay adds another \nenormous sum to our already-astronomical national debt, and increase \nthe percentage of our budget that must be dedicated to servicing that \ndebt.\n  In the last Congress, we passed a deficit reduction package that will \nreduce the budget deficit by nearly $500 billion. Given the magnitude \nof our existing debt, it would be irresponsible and profoundly \nillogical not to continue striving toward a balanced budget this year, \nnot next year or the year after.\n  To illustrate the point that Senator Exon and I are trying to make, \nconsider the simple situation of a person who has run up huge amounts \nof debt at the bank. Does the bank say to that person, ``You have 7 \nyears to pay off your debt and, by the way, feel free to incur more \ndebt in the meantime?''\n  Certainly not. The bank would insist that, at a minimum, the debtor \nnot incur further debt.\n  That is precisely what we are talking about here, and that is why \nevery Member of this body who supports the balanced budget amendment \nshould support this amendment today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am not sure that everybody is aware of \nwhat we are considering as the underlying bill in this body. But \nremember, during the campaign there was a hue and cry from the \ngrassroots, expressed very clearly in that election, that people wanted \nto end the situation where we had two sets of laws in America, one for \nCapitol Hill and one for the rest of the Nation.\n  In other words, Congress did not have certain employment safety laws \napply to us that applied to the private sector. The small business \npeople of America are very up in arms about the fact that they have to \nabide by very egregious legislation, and we who make the laws have \nexempted ourselves from that. That bill passed the House of \nRepresentatives 2 days ago unanimously. Senator Dole placed the \nCongressional Accountability Act, which I and Senator Lieberman are \nmain sponsors of, as a first bill on the agenda because he wanted to \nrespond to the people at the grassroots who expressed in that election \nthe resentment of a dual system of law in America.\n  So that is why that bill is before us. We had debate on that bill \nyesterday. Senator Glenn, the Democratic manager, spoke very eloquently \nof the reasons that legislation ought to pass. Senator Lieberman did, \nseveral other Democrats and several Republicans did.\n  There does not seem to be much disagreement about what the people \nsaid in that election and that S. 2 ought to pass the Senate like it \nhas already passed the House. Yet, we are not getting from there to \nhere very quickly because we are dealing with a lot of amendments that \nare unrelated to the bill that the people so clearly expressed in the \nelection that we ought to pass and do it very quickly.\n  By the way, one of the things that the new majority wants to do is \nshow the people of this country that it is not business as usual \nanymore in Washington on Capitol Hill passing legislation that they \nclearly stated they wanted passed and that is on the agenda of the \nvictor of that election, and we ought to get to it and get the job \ndone. The other body stated that they understood that very well with \ntheir action 2 days ago. Hopefully, we will get that done in this body \nvery quickly. But we have dealt with lobbying reform. We have dealt \nwith campaign finance reform. We are going to deal with the issue of \nprivate use of frequent flyer mileage. We are now dealing with a very \nimportant issue of balancing the budget.\n  There is not one of these issues that is being presented by our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle that are not very legitimate \nissues to be discussed here. But every one of these issues will be \ndiscussed pursuant to the promise of our distinguished leader, Senator \nDole, who said that within just a few weeks we will have lobbying \nreform and campaign finance reform before this body. It is already on \nthe majority agenda in both the House and Senate that we are going to \ntake up a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. In just \n6 weeks we will be working on the budget resolution that fits right \ninto what my friend, the Senator from Nebraska, is trying to accomplish \nthis time on this very important underlying piece of legislation.\n  So I wish that we could get some sort of understanding that we could \ndeal with what the people want us to deal with. The purpose of S. 2 is \nresponding to the mandate of the people in the last election that we \nshould end the dual system of law within this country, one set of law \nfor Congress, and another set of law for the rest of the Nation. But \nall of this other discussion that is going on is preventing us from \ngetting at what we promised the people in the last election.\n  I do not have a fight with the Senator from Nebraska. He has very \nworthwhile goals on budget issues. In fact, if you remember in the last \nCongress, the only successful effort to change President Clinton's \nbudget was the Exon-Grassley amendment that was adopted that cut $26 \nbillion from the President's budget when it passed the Senate and $13 \nbillion from the compromise version that came out of the conference \ncommittee.\n  So I have worked very closely with Senator Exon in trying to bring a \nsound fiscal policy to our Federal Government. I will continue to work \nwith him for a sound fiscal policy. Why do it on legislation that is so \neasily understood by the American people that they very clearly want? \nAnd we are almost set to give it to them. The President is prepared to \nsign it. And I just think we ought to get on with the show and final \npassage of this legislation and forget about all of this extraneous \nstuff that is not unimportant. It is a very important issue to be \ndiscussing. But there is a time and place for everything, and the time \nand place is set for all these other issues within just the next few \nweeks. We are taking up what ought to be No. 1 on everybody's mind. We \nhave it up. We ought to pass it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, the debate of the Senate on a Friday \nalways has a certain unique quality to it. I rise today simply to say \nto the distinguished Senator from Nebraska that I do not know how this \nissue will be resolved. I assume it will be resolved today. But I \napplaud him for raising the issue and the amendment that he has \noffered.\n  This is really a precursor to a debate we will have here in the next \nweek on the balanced budget amendment. It is really a truth-in-\nadvertising amendment. It makes explicit what anyone who supports a \nbalanced budget amendment should know--which is if you vote for it you \nhave to deliver on it. And it makes explicit what delivering on it, \nvoting for the balanced budget amendment, will cost.\n  I really do not think that there has been adequate public focus on \nwhat the cost of a balanced budget amendment will be for average people \nin this country, for regions of the country which get a \ndisproportionate share of the Federal dollar or elements of the economy \nthat have heavy subsidies.\n  I think that the public needs to see what will be cut if we have to \nmeet a balanced budget by the year 2002. And I am all for that.\n  In the last Congress I was on this floor offering spending cut after \nspending cut on virtually every appropriations bill. I am pleased that \nwithin the Democrats I was No. 4 in voting for spending cuts. I am \nmaking the point \n[[Page S554]] only because after you vote for a balanced budget \namendment, you then have to vote to cut spending.\n  The balanced budget amendment is just a process. What the amendment \nof the Senator from Nebraska, as I understand it, does is say that \nafter a balanced budget amendment passes, if it should pass, that any \nbudget resolution has a point of order against it if the budget \nresolution did not submit a budget that reached a balanced budget by \nthe year 2002, which by the way it is projected will be the year in \nwhich the deficit is $322 billion.\n  So anyone who supports the balanced budget amendment would have to \nsupport this Exon proposal, because that would make explicit how we cut \n$322 billion by the year 2002. I applaud the Senator very much for his \namendment.\n  I know that we will yet have a chance to debate the balanced budget \namendment. One of the puzzling things for me with regard to \nunderstanding the support for the balanced budget amendment--and maybe \nthe Senator from Nebraska is aware of this--is that there are certain \nStates in the Union that get a higher return on their tax dollar than \nother States. Certain States pay taxes, and get back a lot more in \nFederal spending than they have sent to Washington in taxes. \nUnfortunately, my State is not in that group because we have a high \nincome. We pay a high tax, and we send a lot of tax dollars to \nWashington. We do not get back that many tax dollars relative to what \nwe sent.\n  Once we get a balanced budget amendment, all those States which get \nback much more than they kick in--and these States are \ndisproportionately in the West--those\n are the States that will be disproportionately hit by the need to \ndramatically cut spending $322 billion by the year 2002. And in the \ncoming debate, I hope that we will be able to focus on these facts.\n\n  I think the Senator's amendment is an enormously positive step in \ngetting us to face up to what actually balancing the budget will mean. \nIt will not be easy. There will be no substitute for cutting spending, \nand there will be no substitute for Senators coming to the floor of the \nU.S. Senate and voting to cut spending, not voting for a process in \nthat 7 or 10 years from now if it goes into effect, and if there are no \nexclusions or if there are loopholes, will lead to a balanced budget. \nWe need to have Senators actually coming over here and voting to cut \nspending.\n  So I applaud the Senator from Nebraska for his amendment. I know that \nperhaps he and I have a different view on the balanced budget \namendment, but his amendment makes explicit what steps must be taken if \nwe are to balance the budget and requires the Congress to belly up to \nthe wire and say in 7 years we are going to balance the budget, and \nhere is how we are going to do it--not that in 7 years we will create \nsome budget glidepath down to a balanced budget in 10 years or 15 years \nfrom now, but in 2002.\n  So I am anxiously awaiting such a congressional resolution, because I \nthink once that congressional resolution is out there and you see how \nmuch is going to have to be cut in virtually every subsidy, virtually \nevery Federal program, virtually every entitlement there for the last \n14 years in the Federal Government, there will be a moment of truth for \nthe Congress and a moment of truth for those who have voted for the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I salute the Senator for his amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from the \nState of New Jersey very much for his excellent remarks. I think he has \nindeed hit it right on the head. This is a truth-in-advertising \namendment, in addition to a truth-in-budgeting amendment. And the \nSenator made an excellent, right-on point as to what this is all about. \nI hope, therefore, we will have the votes to pass this. We first have \nto get the 60 votes to waive.\n  I also thank my friend and colleague from Iowa. Senator Grassley and \nmyself have worked together on many things over the years, and we will \nbe working on things in the future. I simply say to my friend from Iowa \nthat I was very pleased with the fact that he mentioned once again what \nfew know--that the only reductions made in the budget last year were \nthe Exon-Grassley amendments that he and I fashioned and worked through \nthe Congress.\n  What I am doing in this particular case, as the Senator has clearly \nindicated, is to apply to Congress what we apply to others--And if \nCongress wants to have a balanced budget amendment, which I hope they \ndo, then they should live up to it. You had indicated in your remarks \nthat while you thought the Exon amendment was probably a good one, this \nis the wrong place to put it. Well, I suggest that this is the right \nplace to put it. What we are talking about here today is to make \nCongress live up to the laws that it applies to the people of the \nUnited States. If we are going to have a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget, then that has to apply to the Congress. So I think \nit is very appropriate that this measure be passed on the bill, the \nunderlying bill before us, which I indicated in my opening remarks I \nstrongly support.\n  Now, it is not the intention of this Senator to delay at all the \ninstitution of the measure that is going to receive overwhelming \nsupport.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield----\n  Mr. EXON. I am prepared to come to a vote in a relatively short \nperiod of time. I do not want to be accused of holding up anything.\n  I think it is important enough that it should go on this legislation. \nI do not think there is any piece of legislation we are likely to pass \nthis year that is going to be more important than a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, which 80 percent of the people in the \nUnited States of America want. I want to get on with that. I do not \nhappen to buy the reason or excuse, depending on your point of view, as \nto why it should not be an amendment to the measure before us.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. EXON. Yes, I am happy to yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have listened to some of the debate on this issue, and \nI have heard some say, Gee, I do not necessarily oppose what you are \ntrying to do, but maybe this is not the place or time to do it. That is \nalways an interesting discussion. I understand that one can make a \nstronger or weaker case against doing something like this on one bill \nor another. But the fact is that the ultimate--it seems to me that the \nultimate rule and the ultimate circumstance, which is that we ought to \nlive the way everybody else does in this country, would be to have a \nbudget process that says when you come here with a budget, let us, if \nwe are going to pass a constitutional amendment--and I think we will--\nto balance the budget, and let us require the budget document itself to \nget us to that point.\n  In other words, if you bring a road map to the floor of the Senate \nthat is purported to be the budget but never gets to the destination, \nof what value is the map? And the Senator from Nebraska, who I think \nhas been one of the most consistent voices on this subject over the \nyears, I think, does a service by raising the question. I assume if the \nSenator from Nebraska loses the vote here because some people say, Gee, \nthis is a great idea but the wrong place, I assume we will see it \nagain. I hope we see it again.\n  I fully intend to vote for it, because I do not think this is a \nquestion of what place you put this in the process. The question is \nwhether this makes sense in the context of what we are about to embark \non this year as a body. The answer clearly is yes. It makes perfect \nsense, and it makes perfect sense to do now, this minute. I wanted to \nstate that the Senator has done a service, I think, by offering this.\n  I hope my colleagues will look at the merits of this and say: Gee, \nthis makes a lot of sense. If we are going to put out a budget map \nhere, let us have a destination on the map that gets us to what all the \nAmerican people want--that is, a balanced budget.\n  I will frame it in a question. As I have understood the debate, is it \nthe understanding of the Senator from Nebraska that there seems to be a \nfair amount, at least, of sympathy with this amendment, but some are \nsaying, Gee maybe we cannot vote for it because it is the wrong time? \nWill the Senator once again explain, is there a better time anywhere he \nknows of than to pass this at this moment?\n   [[Page S555]] (Mr. THOMAS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. EXON. In answer to my friend from North Dakota, I do not know of \na better time or a more appropriate time, as I have said. Since we are \ntalking about making laws that we apply to others apply to ourselves, \nwhat more important law is there than a constitutional amendment?\n  I simply say that I thank my friend from North Dakota for his kind \nremarks. I must say to him that this Senator was somewhat surprised to \nfind opposition to this amendment, because I felt that this amendment \nwould pass overwhelmingly since we had almost two-thirds of the Senate \nvote for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget last year. \nThen I heard about the fact that there may be a point of order raised \nagainst the amendment, since it was not particularly germane, as the \nrules of the Senate so indicate, so therefore that. We have to have 60 \nvotes now to even have an up-or-down vote on the Exon amendment. I was \nquite surprised because I thought the opposition to the Exon amendment \nwould come from the relatively few Members of the U.S. Senate that \ntraditionally have stood against passing a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget.\n  And there are some legitimate reasons that those people have, and \nvery well thought of Members of this Senate. I do not suppose there is \na better constitutional lawyer in this body than Senator Byrd of West \nVirginia. He is fundamentally opposed to a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the Federal budget. He has pointed out in several speeches that \nI have heard him give that, while it is true that you have this in some \nof the States, it does not and should not apply in the Congress of the \nUnited States.\n  To answer the Senator's question, I am somewhat mystified at the \nopposition that has arisen to this, since I thought two-thirds of the \npeople were for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I am, \ntherefore, very concerned about the fact, I must tell my friend from \nNorth Dakota, that possibly some of our colleagues are for the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget but do not want to spell \nout the hard choices that are going to have to be made.\n  So I will simply say, in answer to another question that the Senator \nfrom North Dakota raised, if the Exon amendment is defeated in any \nfashion on this particular measure, I assure my friend from North \nDakota that it will, in the words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, come up \nagain and again and again. So there will be chances for people to vote \non this again if it fails today.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might ask the Senator from Nebraska \nto yield one more moment, just for one additional question.\n  Mr. EXON. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The prospect here of voting today and deciding not to \nsupport this, as the Senator has said, will produce this same amendment \nin the future. I am pleased to hear him say that.\n  I think all of us probably agree that a balanced budget--that is, a \nzero balance--is not necessarily nirvana somewhere out there.\n  I did not used to think we should change the Constitution to do this, \nas a matter of fact. But year after year after year of a budget that is \nfundamentally out of balance with respect to operating budget deficits, \nthat cannot continue. That hurts this country. And I decided some years \nago, gee, I mean, we do not have much choice.\n  But we could change the Constitution at 2:15, 3 minutes from now, and \nit will do nothing, nothing, to balance the budget. We will simply have \nchanged the Constitution to require a balanced budget, and then others \nwill have to find ways to achieve those ends.\n  I must also say to you that I would not care at all if we had a \nbudget deficit that was $300 billion this year if that budget deficit, \nby its expenditure, had cured cancer, as an example. Spend $300 billion \nyou do not have and cure cancer. Is that a good investment? Your darn \nright it is a good investment. It would not bother me a bit.\n  But the billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars, that we \nare now spending that we do not have are not investments. They are \noperating budget deficits, year after year, that cannot continue. If \nthis were an investment, it would be one thing. But it is not an \ninvestment, it is the operating budget. And it is, in my judgment, \nimpeding this country's economy and opportunity.\n  So that is why I support what the Senator is doing. I hope, Mr. \nPresident, the Senator will prevail today. If not, I hope the Senator \nwill tell us how soon he will be back to give us the opportunity to do \nthis once again.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend from North Dakota.\n  Let me say, in probably closing debate, since I am ready to vote on \nthis at the pleasure of the majority leader, the Senator is certainly \nright. The balanced budget amendment does not in and of itself balance \na budget. And that needs to be said time and time again. We will need, \nsooner or later, an amendment just like mine if we are ever going to \nbalance the budget.\n  When the Senator was talking about--and I thought he made an \nexcellent point--if we had a $200 or $300 billion deficit and we had \ncured cancer as a result of it, I think we would all vote for it. But \nthe deficit has become a way of life, unfortunately.\n  Not only is the budget deficit something that we talk about--and I \nthink we should have possibly a better understanding by the American \npeople of this addition to the problem of the annual deficits in the \nbillions of dollars; that is only part of the problem. The real problem \nis, at the end of each and every fiscal year, we take whatever the \ndeficit is and we get rid of it. It goes away. Where does it go? On the \nnational debt.\n  I find many times that many people simply have not taken the time to \naddress the fact that they hear about billions and billions of dollars, \nbetween a $100 billion and a $350 billion deficit, and that is only for \n1 year. All of that, of course, goes on to the national debt at the end \nof every fiscal year.\n  So we not only have the annual deficit to worry about, we have the \nabsolutely skyrocketing national debt of the United States that, of \ncourse, is the accumulation of all the deficits over the years.\n  At the present time, that national debt stands at $4.7 trillion. \nInterest alone on the national debt that, once again, is the \naccumulation of the annual fiscal year deficits, is the fastest growing \npart of the debt--not welfare, not food stamps, not even national \ndefense. The fastest growing part of the drain on your tax dollars is \ninterest on the national debt.\n  I thought the President explained it pretty well recently in a speech \nwhen he said that very shortly, when you pay your income taxes in April \n1995, 28 cents--28 cents--of every dollar that is paid in taxes by the \nAmerican people next April 15 goes directly to pay interest on the \nnational debt which, of course, is the accumulation of the annual \ndeficits. I wonder how many Americans fully understand that.\n  Not only is that a serious problem, but I say to you that as far as \nwe can see into the future--and even the projections into the future by \nthe year 2002, where we are going to have annual deficits in the $200 \nbillion to $350 billion range annually--that national debt that is \nalready at $4.7 trillion is clearly going to go up at the rate of $200 \nto $300 to $350 billion a year, if and when we pass the constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, and if and when we ever line up how we \nare going to reach that by the 2002 date.\n  Another way of saying that is under the best scenario, the most \noptimistic scenario, we are going to see the national debt go from $4.7 \nto $6 or $7 trillion while we are twiddling our thumbs here and \ndebating whether or not an amendment to put teeth in the balanced \nbudget amendment is germane on a bill before the U.S. Senate.\n  It does not make any sense to me. I do not think it will make any \nsense to the American people when they understand it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, pursuant to the majority leader's \nrequest, with the approval, I believe, of the Democratic leader, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate vote on or in relation to the motion \nto waive the \n[[Page S556]] Budget Act with respect to the Exon amendment at 2:30 \ntoday, with the time between now and 2:30 equally divided between \nSenator Exon and Senator Grassley.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I do not object. I agree to the unanimous-\nconsent request offered by my colleague from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? If not, without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from North Dakota \nwhatever time he desires.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska.\n  I have come to the floor to commend the Senator for what I think is \nan excellent amendment, precisely the kind of amendment we ought to \nconsider and we ought to support today. Mr. President, the Senator from \nNebraska has offered an amendment which says simply and clearly and \npowerfully, that if we are going to pass a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution, something that I support, that we ought to match our \nwords and our deeds.\n  That is precisely what the Senator from Nebraska has put before this \nbody. Mr. President, that is what the underlying legislation is all \nabout. Matching words with deeds. Holding Congress accountable. Having \nCongress follow the laws that it writes. Nothing could be more \nimportant with respect to a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution than that we actually start to write a balanced budget. \nNot just pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, and then \ndo the same old thing and not start to actually balance the budget. The \neasiest thing in the world is to pass a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution and then do nothing to start balancing the budget. I \ncannot think of anything that would be more destructive of public trust \nthan to engage in that kind of cruel public hoax. That is precisely \nwhat could happen here.\n  We all know what is politically easy and what is politically hard. \nWhat is politically easy is to stand up and say ``I'm for a balanced \nbudget;'' what is politically hard is to actually do the work of \nbalancing the budget. That is what is challenging. That is what is \ndifficult. That is what is politically hard to do.\n  The Senator from Nebraska says ``Yes, let's have a balanced budget \namendment; but beyond that, let's actually start to balance the \nbudget.'' What a novel idea. Mr. President, it is precisely what we \nought to do. That is exactly what we ought to do. I cannot think of \nanything that would give this country more confidence in what we are \ndoing than that.\n  Now, Mr. President, one of the things I am concerned about as I watch \nthis debate is we talk about balancing the budget, but we rarely talk \nabout why we should balance the budget. It is not just because it makes \nus feel good. It is not just because you should match what you spend \nwith what you take in. It is because balancing the budget has real \neconomic consequences that are positive for this country. It makes a \ndifference in the lives of people.\n  Mr. President, we got the evidence today of a package we passed 2 \nyears ago doing something positive in the lives of people. Just today \nwe received news of what has happened with the unemployment rate in \nthis country. It has dropped to 5.4 percent, the lowest level in 4 \nyears, and 3.5 million jobs were created in this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nremaining 3 minutes belongs to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we might \nextend the time by 10 minutes, to be equally divided.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would yield 5 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield whatever time is remaining to me to \nmy colleague from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska.\n  As I was pointing out, 3.5 million jobs were created in 1994--3.5 \nmillion. I believe one of the key reasons is that a number of us had \nthe courage to vote for a budget package 2 years ago that reduced the \ndeficit by over $500 billion over the next 5 years. Because we did \nthat, because we cut spending, and, yes, raised taxes on the wealthiest \n1 percent among us, the result was a reduced deficit. The result of \nthat was reduced interest rates. The result of that was renewed \neconomic growth in this country, increased job creation, and a much \nstronger economy.\n  That is why we need to move toward a balanced budget, because it will \ntake pressure off of interest rates. It will allow this economy to \ncontinue to grow. It will allow this country to get back on track. That \nis why the amendment of the Senator from Nebraska is so important.\n  Mr. President, I thank, again, the Senator from Nebraska.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on both \nsides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five and one-half minutes for the Senator from \nIowa and 1 minute and 14 seconds for the Senator from Nebraska\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield back the remaining time on this \nside.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield back the time remaining on this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive section 306 of the \nBudget Act.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], the \nSenator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], and the Senator from Arizona [Mr. \nMcCain] are necessary absent.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I announce that the Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden], \nthe Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], the Senator from Arkansas \n[Mr. Bumpers], the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford], the Senator from \nAlabama [Mr. Heflin], the Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], \nthe Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], the Senator from Nebraska \n[Mr. Kerrey], the Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], the Senator from \nConnecticut [Mr. Lieberman], the Senator from Virginia [Mr. Robb], and \nthe Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller] are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] is \nabsent on official business.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn] is absent \nbecause of Illness.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nVermont [Mr. Leahy] would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is \nbeing offered to a bill that was not reported by that committee in \nviolation of section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  The point of order is sustained. The amendment fails.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator seeking consent to set aside \nthe amendment of the Senator from Kentucky?\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \namendment of the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 7\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the Bridgestone/\n                           Firestone dispute)\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon], for himself, Mr. \n     Glenn, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Moseley-Braun, and Mr. Feingold \n     proposes an amendment numbered 7.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Bridgestone/Firestone, a subsidiary of foreign owned \n     Bridgestone Corp., has recently announced its decision to \n     hire permanent replacement workers displacing more than 2,000 \n     American workers;\n       (2) this action may result in the largest permanent \n     displacement of workers in over a decade:\n       (3) the practice of hiring permanent replacement workers is \n     devastating, not only to the replaced workers, but also to \n     their families and communities;\n       (4) the position of management of foreign owned \n     Bridgestone/Firestone appears to be that they cannot compete \n     with their American owned competitor, Goodyear, if they \n     provide wages, benefits, and conditions of employment \n     benefits patterned after those provided by Goodyear;\n       (5) hiring permanent replacement workers is illegal under \n     the laws of the parent company's own country; and\n       (6) most of the United States' major trading partners, \n     including Japan, Germany, France, and Canada, recognize that \n     using permanent replacements is bad business and bad public \n     policy.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) Bridgestone/Firestone should reconsider its decision to \n     hire permanent replacement workers and return to the \n     bargaining table and bargain in good faith with the United \n     Rubberworkers of America, the representative of their \n     employees; and\n       (2) the Clinton Administration, working through the \n     appropriate diplomatic channels and using the appropriate \n     trade negotiations, should impress upon the parent company's \n     home government the concern of the United States over this \n     matter and seek their assistance in getting Bridgestone/\n     Firestone to reconsider their decision.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of Senator \nGlenn, Senator Harkin, Senator Moseley-Braun, Senator Feingold, and \nmyself. And I believe I am willing to enter into a time agreement on \nthat. I am checking with Senator Daschle on my side on the time \nagreement and I should know that very shortly.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SIMON. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Before we will be able to enter into a time agreement, some \nof us would like to know what the amendment does. We did not let the \nclerk read it.\n  Mr. SIMON. I did not let the clerk read it but I will be happy to \nexplain the amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I hear that before we are asked to enter into an \nagreement?\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nregarding a strike situation that we face in this country. Bridgestone/\nFirestone is a company wholly owned by a Japanese corporation. They \nbought Firestone, merged the two companies. They have had a strike on \nsince July. And back, I guess about a month ago, Senator Glenn and \nSenator Harkin and Senator Moseley-Braun and several of us met with the \nJapanese Ambassador and urged that they negotiate, that they sit down \nand negotiate.\n  I, frankly, do not know, in terms of the dispute between labor and \nmanagement, which side is right. What I do know is that they ought to \nsit down and negotiate. But the Bridgestone/Firestone has announced \nthey are going to fire all the strikers and permanently replace them. \nThat is--I have been doing some checking--we have had only two \nprecedents like that since the 1930's. We have had no striker \nreplacement law, as Western Europe and Canada and the other countries \ndo, but we have had a tradition that you do not do that. And this \nresolution simply says to the corporation: Sit down and negotiate, \nrather than just firing several thousand workers.\n  I would hope that we could adopt this resolution. My friend from Iowa \nindicates that he has some concerns, otherwise we could adopt it by \nvoice vote. That is basically the situation.\n  Let me point out one other thing. This is a Japanese--wholly-owned \nJapanese firm now. In Japan it would be illegal for them to do what \nthey are doing in Illinois, in Iowa, in Oklahoma, Ohio, and Indiana. My \nhope is that this sense-of-the-Senate resolution could be adopted and \nthat we can move forward. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment of my colleague, the senior Senator from \nIllinois, [Mr. Simon], and to give some background on this issue. It is \nsomething that has troubled us greatly and that I believe is a matter \nthat really boils down to good corporate citizenship.\n  Mr. President, some 4,000 members of the United Rubber Workers, \nincluding 1,250 members of local 713 in Decatur, IL, have been \nexercising their right to strike against the Bridgestone/Firestone \ncompany which is, as Senator Simon indicated, a foreign-owned \ncorporation. The strike began when, after months of negotiations, the \ncompany refused to accept a contract that was similar to the contract \nthe United Rubber Workers had negotiated with Goodyear, which is an \nAmerican company. Throughout the duration of the strike the United \nRubber Workers have maintained a willingness to bargain with \nBridgestone/Firestone to attempt to resolve their differences. In fact, \nearlier this week the URW bargaining committee notified Bridgestone/\nFirestone that it would be meeting with Federal mediators in an effort \nto resume bargaining and to end the work stoppage.\n  Unfortunately, the company has not shown the same willingness to \nnegotiate in good faith. In fact, some 2 days ago the company informed \nits workers that they will be permanently replaced as a result of this \nongoing dispute. A number of Senators and I, whose workers are affected \nby this strike, have done everything we can, everything possible, to \ntry to help resolve this dispute. In fact, just this afternoon I called \non and had a conversation with some of our trade negotiators, to see to \nit that these kinds of issues of the conduct, the corporate citizenship \nof foreign companies doing business here in America, was an issue that \nwould be brought up in their trade discussions and negotiations in \nfuture times. We will see how that plays out.\n  But the point is, without giving a long speech about this because I \nunderstand there are others who want to speak to this issue, this \ncompany is doing to American workers what American companies cannot do, \nor have not done, to American workers, by and large. Senator Simon has \ndiscovered one tiny precedent of similarity in one instance. But by and \nlarge, in this industry, what is going on here is quite extraordinary. \nWhile on the one hand we do not want to get in a situation in which \ninvestment by foreign companies is discouraged--we want to encourage \ninvestment, we want to encourage participation--we certainly want to \nencourage positive relations with our \n[[Page S558]] companies from whatever part of the world they may come, \nthe fact is that when one is doing business here in the United States \nit is only appropriate and only a function of good corporate \ncitizenship that one does business in keeping with the values and the \ntradition and the fair play that American workers, I think, have every \nright to expect.\n  We do not have a striker replacement law in this country but we know \nfor a fact it is against the law to fire a worker for exercising the \nright to strike. It is not against the law to permanently replace that \nworker. But at the same time, to have permanent replacement resorted to \nas a measure by corporate leadership in an instance in which it would \nnot happen if it were an American company, or has not happened in \ncertain similarly situated American companies, sours the atmosphere and \nsets an unfortunate precedent that I hope the leadership of \nBridgestone/Firestone would take a good hard look at and reconsider.\n  Mr. President, with that I encourage my colleagues to support this \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to support the actions being taken \nby Senator Simon. It is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. Certainly we \nwould not be willing to vote today to do exactly the opposite and to \nsay no, we do not think there should be any more negotiations; no, we \nthink it should be final. Even Japanese law, it was pointed out here, \nin the home country of Japan--this is a wholly-owned Japanese \ncorporation now--but the law in Japan would prevent them from doing \nexactly what we are doing here, even though we have yet to put into \nplace any striker replacement legislation in this country.\n  So surely we do not go the opposite tack and say, ``No. We don't \nthink there should be any more negotiation.'' We do quite the opposite. \nWe say, ``Look, it is never too late.'' And while we cannot take sides \nin this as U.S. Senators and come down on exactly what the final \nsolution would be, surely it is within our responsibility to our people \nin our respective States and this country to say, ``Look, don't just \ngive up on this thing. At least sit down and talk about it some more.'' \nI know it has been a long discussion. They have had long negotiations. \nBut sometimes just when things look the blackest in the negotiation is \nwhen real progress can be made.\n  I hope this is not just a negotiating ploy. I do not think it is. I \nthink Bridgestone/Firestone is serious about this, and that makes it \nall the more incumbent upon us to take some action here on the Senate \nfloor.\n  So I had real hope after we met with the Japanese Ambassador that he \nwas going to use his good offices to do everything he possibly could. \nPerhaps he did. I certainly will not say that he did not do everything \nthat he could possibly do. But what we are saying is, in the interest \nof fairness to our workers and in the interest of even the company \nadhering to what the Japanese law is, sit down again and let us see if \nwe cannot work this thing out before we go through the throes of seeing \nsome 2,000-plus American workers being tossed out permanently. I think \nthat would be too bad.\n  I want to compliment Senator Simon for taking the lead on this and am \nglad to support his sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank Senator Glenn.\n  Mr. President, let me just add one other point. In addition to the \nlabor-management factor here, I think the other factor is United \nStates-Japan relations. This is not the kind of thing that is going to \nhelp relations between our two countries.\n  So I hope that, if we adopt this resolution--and I hope we do--that \nthe corporation would take another look at this. This is not good for \nUnited States-Japan relations as well as not good for the future of \nthis corporation, Bridgestone/Firestone. The rubber workers have taken \nthe position they should have the same contract as they do with the \nFirestone competitor, Goodyear. I do not know whether they are right or \nwrong. That is not the point. All we say is sit down and negotiate and \nsee if this can be worked out.\n  Mr. President, if no one else seeks the floor, I question the \npresence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nprior to a motion to table the Simon amendment be as follows: 5 minutes \nunder the control of myself, 20 minutes under the control of Senator \nSimon; and, further, at the conclusion or yielding back of time, the \nmajority leader or his designee be recognized to make a motion to table \nthe Simon amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. SIMON. I say to my colleague from Iowa, if he is going to yield \nhis time, I am willing to yield my time and proceed to a vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Except for Senator Kassebaum to speak a few moments, as \nshe put it, we will do that.\n  Mr. SIMON. I always welcome Senator Kassebaum's speech.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield such time as she might consume \nto the distinguished Senator from Kansas, Nancy Kassebaum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum], is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I appreciate that. I appreciate the \ncourtesy of the Senator from Illinois as well. As he knows, I have some \nstrong views on this issue that I would like to express. I can \ncertainly appreciate the points of view of the Senators from Illinois, \nSenators Moseley-Braun and Simon. But I have to rise in strong \nopposition to the resolution that has been offered by the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the resolution offered \nby the Senator from Illinois. The Senator's resolution expresses the \nsense of the Senate that Bridgestone/Firestone Tire Co. should not use \npermanent replacements for workers on strike in a labor dispute in \nOhio, Oklahoma, Indiana, and Illinois.\n  Mr. President, we have been through this argument on the floor, and \nit is well understood by most everyone here.\n  The Congressional Accountability Act passed the House of \nRepresentatives on a unanimous vote 2 days ago, and now we are here on \na late Friday afternoon with a sense-of-the-Senate resolution on an \nenormously important issue that does not relate in any way to the \nCongressional Accountability Act.\n  I know the Senator from Illinois is well-intentioned. But this is \nneither the time nor the place for Congress to be considering anything \nother than this very important bill which is before us--the \nCongressional Accountability Act.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Illinois is completely \nextraneous from the matter at hand, and for that reason alone I believe \nthe Senate should table his amendment.\n  Not only is the amendment inappropriate and untimely, but it is also \nwrong on the substance as well.\n  Just for a moment, if I may reiterate what we have talked about \nbefore in the debate on this issue, Congress should not take sides in a \nprivate labor dispute as this amendment clearly does. We should not \ntake sides in a private dispute.\n  Because we have many new Members in this body, I think it might be \nhelpful to provide a brief background on our Federal labor laws. It has \nbeen established Federal labor law for over 50 years that labor has the \nright to strike, and companies have the right to continue operating \nduring the strike. On rare occasions, this may require hiring permanent \nreplacements.\n  These competing rights, and the risks they entail, enable the parties \nto settle the overwhelming number of labor disputes at the bargaining \ntable which is the way I believe strongly they should be resolved.\n  [[Page S559]] Without the ability to hire permanent replacements, \nlabor could strike at any time, for any reason, without any risk. It \nreally disrupts completely. I would argue that the balance is a \ndifficult one, but I think a fair balance.\n  The compelling nature of these arguments led the Senate to defeat \nlegislation--S. 55--during both the 102d and 103d Congress. S. 55 would \nhave prohibited employers from hiring permanent replacements during an \neconomic strike. So the law is clear the employers may hire permanent \nreplacements during economic strikes.\n  Mr. President, Congress established the private collective bargaining \nsystem to facilitate the peaceful resolution of labor disputes. We \nleave it to the parties to decide for themselves what a fair deal is.\n  As difficult as it may be--and each of us has had these disputes in \nour own States and we wish we could do something that could bring it to \na resolution, but as sure as we start down that path, we will all \nregret it and all the parties to those labor disputes will regret it as \nwell.\n  It is not for this body to decide whether Bridgestone is justified in \nhiring permanent replacements during the course of their current labor \ndispute. We are not the arbiters of labor disputes in the U.S. Senate, \nand we do not judge the fairness of any of the terms of a particular \nlabor agreement.\n  Mr. President, it is improper for the Senate to single out one \ncompany and attempt to influence a private labor dispute. Regardless of \nthe merits on either side, we do not negotiate collective bargaining \nagreements in the Senate. There is a good reason for this.\n  We would be establishing a dangerous precedent if we approved this \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution, because we would be opening ourselves \nup to debating the merits of very single labor disputes. In fact, we \nwould see a virtual parade of labor and management groups coming to \nCapitol Hill seeking to gain a bargaining advantage through \ncongressional action. We do not want to start that kind of precedent.\n  Mr. President, I am also perplexed by the language in the resolution \nthat compares the laws of the United States and Japan. The resolution \nseems to suggest that there is something wrong with Bridgestone, a \nJapanese-owned company, following the laws of the United States, \nbecause using permanent replacements would be illegal in Japan.\n  Companies doing business in the United States are supposed to follow \nour laws. We demand that they follow our laws, whether they are owned \nby the Japanese or by Americans. So the fact that Japanese law does not \nallow permanent replacements is totally irrelevant.\n  The irony, of course, is that often we complain that American \ncompanies export jobs overseas. In this case, a Japanese company bought \nan American company--Firestone--and invested billions of dollars in an \nAmerican company to make it financially viable. I think we want to \nencourage that kind of investment.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, let me say in response to my colleague from \nKansas, that we are not passing the law on striker replacement. This is \nsimply a sense of the Senate stating they ought to sit down and work \nthese things out. We do have traditions of not hiring permanent \nreplacements for strikers. And as far as interfering in a labor-\nmanagement situation, we have passed a lot of resolutions on these, \nincluding specific legislation. This is not legislation. We have, on at \nleast three occasions that I know of, passed legislation dictating what \nis going to happen in railroad strikes, since I have been in the \nSenate. And since my colleague from Kansas has been here longer, she \nhas probably voted for more than three of these.\n  This is only a sense-of-the-Senate resolution urging the two parties \nto sit down and work things out. We do not take sides. We do not say \none side is right and one side is wrong. We do say that firing these \nthousands of workers who are on strike is not the direction we think \nthey should go. I have participated in the striker replacement \nlegislation, and I think everyone here on the floor said we do not \nthink this is the way people should go, even though that ultimate right \nshould be there for employers.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SIMON. I yield, of course, to my colleague from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Is it not a fact that the parties are refusing to \nnegotiate or even discuss the contractual issues at this time?\n  Mr. SIMON. That is correct.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Is it not also a fact that this sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution, which is not now legislation, simply calls on the \ncompany to discuss the issues with its workers?\n  Mr. SIMON. And to negotiate, that is correct.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Is it not also a fact that the American company \nwith which this company is the competition has already reached closure \non the issues that are currently at issue here?\n  Mr. SIMON. That is correct.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Is it not also a fact that you have taken this \nopportunity on this bill--and I understand the Senator from Kansas is \nconcerned about this coming in the middle of the Congressional \nAccountability Act, and I think we are all concerned about that and \nwould like to see this legislation resolved. But at the same time, \ngiven the enormity of the concern of the company and the workers, is it \nnot a fact that time is of the essence and this was an opportunity to \nmove on this issue in order to facilitate--or at least encourage--that \nsuch discussions take place over the weekend?\n  Mr. SIMON. Absolutely. In terms of cluttering up this bill, as the \nSenator from Kansas indicated, if she will indicate to me that she will \nbe happy to support this legislation if we introduce it independently \nand not on this bill, I will be happy to withdraw it, and we will bring \nit up independently.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, if I may respond. I must say that I am \nvery sensitive to the concerns the Senator has with an industry that is \nfacing some real turmoil in his State and other States. I realize it is \na sense-of-the-Senate resolution, and it applies specifically to one \nprivate company. When you mention the railroad strikes, just to draw a \ndistinction, that was a strike that affected the whole country and was \nof national concern. Even then we were sensitive to intrusion by \nCongress.\n  The reason I went over the striker replacement issue is because you \naddress it in the sense-of-the-Senate resolution. In many ways I would \nsay I am sympathetic. But I do not think that we should address it here \nin the United States Congress. It opens every other private labor-\nmanagement dispute to our wanting to try to address it from Washington \nand intruding on what is a private bargaining position. That is my \nconcern. I thank the Senator from Illinois, even though I recognize \nSenator Simon's and Senator Moseley-Braun's interest in the issue.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I am a great believer in sitting down and \nworking things out. Any time anybody in this body wants to put up a \nresolution for any corporation where there is a strike resolution, \nencouraging both sides to sit down, I am willing to support it. I think \nthat is a sensible position for the U.S. Senate to take.\n  Let me add that I am willing to vote soon. I understand Senator \nHarkin is on his way over here to speak. I hope we can just give him \nanother minute or two to get over here. I am sure he will speak \nbriefly, because I know some people are anxious to get out of here. I \ndo not want to hold anyone up. If no one else seeks the floor, I will \nsuggest the absence of a quorum for about 3 minutes. If Senator Harkin \nis not here, we will move ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have Senator \nKennedy added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I agree with Senator Simon's interest in \nencouraging the Bridgestone-Firestone management and labor to return to \nthe bargaining table.\n  [[Page S560]] Bridgestone-Firestone is the largest manufacturing \nemployer in Polk County. The recent developments surrounding this 6-\nmonth strike are very unfortunate for all concerned. I am a strong \nsupporter of the collective bargaining process, and although companies \nhave the right to replace strikers during an economic strike, it is a \ntragic decision for the workers and their families. It is not helpful \nfor our economy, and frankly, for that matter, the company.\n  I am deeply concerned about the workers and their families, and \ntherefore have written a letter to the Federal Mediation and \nConciliation Service urging them to redouble their efforts and find \npossible alternatives to bring company and union officials together to \nbring this dispute to a satisfactory conclusion. Others may want to do \nthe same.\n  However, as I have voted against all other amendments to the \ncongressional coverage bill, I will vote against this resolution as \nwell. The congressional coverage bill is not the appropriate vehicle.\n  Mr. SIMON. I am willing to yield back my time and move to a vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield back the time on this side.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment of the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], the \nSenator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], the Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], \nand the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. BREAUX.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I was unable to be on the floor prior to \nthe vote to join my colleague from Illinois on this debate on this \nresolution. But I did want to take a couple minutes now to add my voice \nin support of the resolution that Senator Simon offered. I was pleased \nto be a cosponsor of it.\n  As Senator Simon said before the vote, what Bridgestone Corp., a \nJapanese-owned corporation, is doing with our workers at the Firestone \nplant in my State of Iowa would be illegal for them to do in their own \ncountry. What they want to do with our workers would be illegal in \ntheir own country.\n  Mr. President, I am very close to the Firestone plant in Des Moines, \nIA. Many of my cousins work there. In the small town of 150 that I come \nfrom, almost half the town had worked at Firestone at one time or \nanother. Many of my cousins work there. In fact, I spoke to one just \nyesterday. He has worked there almost 20 years, has a couple of kids in \ncollege, and has given the best years of his life to Firestone. Now \nthey are told that they can just go take a walk, that they do not have \na contract to operate under, and that they have to accede to what I \nconsider to be unconscionable terms that Bridgestone has put up.\n  I might also point out, Mr. President, and for the benefit of my \ncolleagues here, that the Bridgestone Corp. in Japan also has union \nemployees--Japanese union employees in Japan--and they make tires, just \nas they do in America. The average annual wage of a Japanese union \nemployee in Japan working for Bridgestone is $52,500 a year. In the \nUnited States, their average wage is $37,045 a year.\n  Yet, Bridgestone is telling our people in this country, our workers, \nthat they have to take less money. Is that based on productivity? \nHardly. In March of 1994, the workers at the Firestone plant in America \nreached a new high of 80.5 pounds of rubber tire per man hour and set \nan all-time record, and they did it with 600 fewer workers. So it is \nnot based on productivity. Bridgestone simply wants to ratchet down the \nwages of our American workers, even much lower than what they pay their \nown in Japan.\n  But most unconscionable, I think, is the kind of work schedule they \nwant to put them on. Understand this: The Bridgestone company has said \nto the Firestone workers: ``We want you to work a 12-hour shift.'' \nThere would be two 12-hour shifts a day at their plants. But then they \nwould work 3 days on a 12-hour shift, and they would have 2 days off. \nThen they would work 2 days on a 12-hour shift and have 3 days off. \nThen they would work 2 days on a 12-hour shift and have 2 days off. \nThen they would come back around and work 2 days on, 3 days off. You \nhave to have a calculator to calculate when your days off will be.\n  You might be off one Saturday and not off on another Saturday for 3 \nweeks. Most of these people have spouses who work and kids in school; \nthey could never plan to be home with their families. And yet the \nBridgestone employees in Japan do not work those 12-hour days. They \nwork 8-hour shifts; three 8-hour shifts a day. They know exactly what \ndays they are going to have off.\n  But Bridgestone is telling our workers: ``Forget it; you can't plan \nany time with your families. You are on this rotating shift of 12 hours \na day.'' And they are going to pay them less money.\n  So I just want to make these points, Mr. President, because I think \nwe ought to send a signal to Bridgestone Corp. that we just cannot \nallow our workers in this country to be treated in that manner. We have \nhad a long tradition of collective bargaining in this country. With \nwhat is happening now with the replacement of these workers, the right \nof collective bargaining is a hollow right. The right of collective \nbargaining takes with it the \n[[Page S561]] right to be able to bargain with whatever power and \nresources you have. The only power and resource that a worker has in \nthis country is to withhold his or her labor. They have no other \nbargaining power.\n  And so if that power then becomes a hollow power; if, in fact, I do \nexercise my legal right to go on strike and the company says, ``Fine, \nyou can do that; then, bang, I will replace you,'' then, A, there is no \nreal right to strike, and because there is no real right to strike and \nwithhold your labor then, B, there is no real right to collective \nbargaining any longer in this country.\n  I said to the replacement workers that were being hired in Des \nMoines: ``You may think you have a good job, but without a contract, \nyou may not have a job next year or next week or even tomorrow.'' In \nfact, I have already been contacted by one of those replacement workers \nwho was just fired for the most scant reasons. He said: ``I came, I \nthought I had a good job, and they told me I was fired.''\n  So what is happening to our workers in this country and what \nBridgestone is doing to our workers, as Senator Simon pointed out, is \nillegal in Japan.\n  I say to Bridgestone/Firestone that this issue is far from over. The \nJapanese Prime Minister is coming to this country next week to meet \nwith our President. I intend to take the opportunity, when he is here, \nto take this floor to speak about this injustice by a Japanese \ncorporation.\n  Now, I am not blaming the Japanese Prime Minister for this. He may \nnot even know about it. But I want him to know about it. I want him to \nknow what that corporation is doing in this country.\n  I know the Japanese Prime Minister is interested in good relations \nbetween Japan and America. I am, too. I do not want to join those who \nare bashing Japan. They are a good, strong ally and a good friend of \nours. I respect them highly, and I like them. I spent a year and a half \nof my life living in Japan. But this kind of action by this corporation \nis unconscionable. I believe that the Government of Japan ought to be \nlooking into what this company is doing with their workers in this \ncountry.\n  So I intend, as I said, Mr. President to take this floor next week \nwhen the Prime Minister of Japan is here to once again talk about this \ncompany and what it is doing so that he is not mistaken in any way, so \nthat he takes back with him the strong feelings that this Senator and I \nbelieve the people I represent have about the gross injustice being \nperpetrated on the Firestone workers in this country.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. SIMON. I wish to commend him for his statement, and I simply want \nthe officers of that corporation to know this vote today was just the \nfirst salvo. This is not the end of the road. The Senator is talking \nabout when the Japanese Prime Minister is here. I do not know what \nother opportunities we are going to have. All I know is what has \nhappened is wrong, wrong, wrong. We have to turn it around in some way.\n  I do not know whether the rubber workers are right in all their \nrequests. I do not know all the things that management has requested. \nAll I know is that the right way to settle this dispute is to sit down \nand work it out between labor and management, not to hire workers \npermanently to replace workers of those families the Senator is talking \nabout.\n  So I commend my colleague, and I look forward to working with him.\n  Mr. HARKIN. My colleague is absolutely right. In fact, the Department \nof Labor has had the Federal Mediation Service working on this case for \nquite some months. They have been working in good faith to try to \nresolve these differences. They have been very close. There is not that \nmuch separating the two parties. I think if Bridgestone/Firestone would \nin good faith sit down and negotiate, they could reach an amicable \nsettlement of the strike.\n  Mr. SIMON. The Senator from Iowa is absolutely correct. It is \ninteresting that the former chief executive of the American operation \nreceived awards for his labor-management relations and the improvement \nof productivity that took place. Now, all of a sudden, with the change \nin executives, things went downhill fast. We have to do what we can to \nencourage the two sides to get together.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague. I have a letter to the editor of \nthe Des Moines Register written by a farmer who was commenting on this \nstrike, what Bridgestone was doing.\n  He said I went out and counted and that he counted his tractors, \ntrucks, wagons, combine, there were over 140 tires. He said that should \nBridgestone continue to refuse to negotiate, he would never buy a tire \nmade by them. I would like to ask unanimous consent that a copy of this \nletter to the editor and several others be included in the record at \nthe conclusion of my statement.\n  I think that ought to be a signal to Bridgestone/Firestone. There are \nother tires out there, and I know this Senator and probably a lot of \nthe workers in this country who drive automobiles are going to look \naskance at Bridgestone/Firestone if they will not sit down and work \nthis thing out and will feel that maybe there are other tires they can \nbuy and maybe there ought to be a boycott against buying tires from \nBridgestone/Firestone if they are going to treat our people in this \nmanner.\n  There being no objection, the letters to the editor were ordered to \nbe printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n   The Register's Readers Say--A Tire Company's ``Assault'' on Union\n\n       The situation at Bridgestone/Firestone has been of great \n     concern to me since the strike began.\n       It is a continuation of the story family farmers and our \n     laboring friends have experienced since 1980 from those who \n     want cheap raw materials and labor to maximize their profits.\n       A quick inventory tells me that my tractor, trucks, wagons, \n     combine and cars roll on more than 140 tires. My vow to \n     Bridgestone/Firestone is that if this strike is not settled \n     within 30 days, I will never buy another tire made by them--\n     Joe Weisshaar, chairman, Iowa Farm Unity Coalition.\n       There are many ways to do violence. Twelve workers at \n     Bridgestone/Firestone were fired by the company three days \n     before Christmas as a response to what the company referred \n     to as ``acts of violence, threats and aggressive behavior.''\n       I do not condone physical violence and physical threats. \n     Most of us abhor such things as they occur in labor \n     confrontations. However, that is what company officials are \n     counting on in this situation as they commit their own brand \n     of violence by refusing to bargain in good faith for an end \n     to the strike. The company is using its financial might as a \n     club over the workers.\n       The management of Bridgestone/Firestone wants nothing less \n     than complete capitulation by the members of the United \n     Rubber Workers union. The union is trying to hang on to \n     benefits gained over the years in legitimate negotiating \n     processes.\n       It behooves the rest of us in the community to understand \n     that what is happening out on Second Avenue in Des Moines and \n     at the other Bridgestone/Firestone locations around the \n     country is an attempt to further erode the rights of workers \n     to maintain some control over their own lives, minds and \n     bodies rather than become the de facto property of the \n     company.\n       Do not be fooled by the actions of the management of \n     Bridgestone/Firestone. It is every bit as violent (and more \n     so) as any act of physical violence on the picket line in its \n     destructive effects on human life.--The Rev. Carlos C. Jayne, \n     Des Moines Area Urban Mission Council, The United Methodist \n     Church.\n       Bridgestone/Firestone's strategy to wear down the striking \n     tire workers is becoming more self-evident: undercut public \n     support by repeatedly making strikers look like the bad guys. \n     Three recent examples are instructive:\n       (1) In firing 12 union members, a company spokesman cited \n     ``violence, threats, and aggressive behavior'' as the reason \n     for dismissal.\n       (2) Firestone's request for an injunction limiting the \n     number of picketers implied that strikers in groups larger \n     than two presented a danger to company employees.\n       (3) During a peaceful march, when a handful of strike \n     supporters (many from out of state) threw snowballs toward \n     the plant, the company and TV stations described the event as \n     a ``riot.'' This amounted to an absurd exaggeration. But the \n     message to viewers was ``These guys are dangerous.''\n       Since the strike began, I have visited the picket line 20 \n     or 30 times and have spoken with maybe 100 striking tire \n     workers. I have yet to meet a single one who condones the \n     isolated acts of violence that have occurred on both sides of \n     the conflict.\n       In fact, given the financial and emotional hardships they \n     have suffered, the strikers deserve praise for the extent to \n     which they have remained peaceful and nonviolent.\n       Firestone's focus on violence may sell to the media, but it \n     distracts public attention from the real issue: Management \n     wants more concessions, while the union feels it's already \n     given up enough. Given the workers' solidarity and the \n     fairness of their position, I am convinced this strike will \n     end only when the company agrees to come to the \n     [[Page S562]] table and talk.--Ed Fallon, State \n     representative.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, as a result of committee assignments \nannounced yesterday, I have the privilege and delight to be a member, \nfor the next 2 years, of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. I \nwant to take this opportunity to discuss, in general, why I feel that \nassignment to be so significant and why I feel so privileged to be a \nmember of a committee with the jurisdiction that it possesses. I also \nwant to discuss one specific issue which has been discussed in that \ncommittee in the past, which I regard as being of peculiar and special \nimportance.\n  First, however, I express my delight in being a member of the \ncommittee chaired by the distinguished junior Senator from Kansas [Mrs. \nKassebaum] who has been, during the course of the last Congress, my \nseat mate in this part of the body and will continue to be so. I look \nforward to her leadership and to her wise advice and counsel. Issues \nwhich will come before the Labor Committee include many that are of \nvital concern to all Americans in today's world. These issues include \nthose relating to aging, to disability policies, overwhelmingly to \neducation, to families and children, to employment, and to \nproductivity.\n  I see two profound tidal changes in American society today that are \ndriving the concerns of millions upon millions of our people. As the \nUnited States is in the midst of an inevitable shift of its economic \nbase from an industrial/manufacturing system to an information-based \neconomy, millions of families find their justified expectations \nshattered and find themselves in a new and very difficult world. This \nshift gives every promise of being as cataclysmic as the shift from an \nagrarian-based economy to an industrial-based economy in the latter \npart of the last century and the beginning of this century.\n  Understandably, many people are deeply concerned and apprehensive \nabout this change, about the direction in which our country is heading, \nand wish that it were not so. It is so, however, and we need to meet \nthat challenge.\n  The American people understand that the societal contract is changing \nand that we must change with it. Today, the receipt of a high school \ndiploma, or for that matter a college diploma, lacks the meaning it \nonce had. Some families, some people are stuck on welfare and have few, \nif any, alternatives which they see as being viable. Today, there is no \nsuch thing as guaranteed lifetime employment. Working families find it \nmore and more difficult to get ahead. Sending both parents into the \nworkplace used to be a matter of choice, sometimes as a fulfillment for \nthe second spouse to be employed, sometimes as an option to help a \nfamily buy a new home or to take a special trip. Today, for far too \nmany, it is not a choice but a necessity. It makes or breaks a family's \nbudget. And without two paychecks, bills would not be paid and the \nchildren might not be fed. Women in the workplace still find themselves \nstuck in either clerical or middle management positions and their \ngrowth stopped dead short by a glass ceiling that has not yet \ndisappeared. Families are still deeply concerned about health care; \nsome cannot change jobs for fear of losing their insurance; others let \nillness drag on because there is no money to pay in an uninsured \nsituation; and many worry about retirement security. No individual \nwants to spend his or her golden years being taken care of, being \ndependent upon their children. But it seems increasingly difficult to \nsave money for retirement.\n  All of this I believe to be the most significant cause of the \nconsistently found proposition that the majority of the American people \nfeel that the country is moving in the wrong direction, that the \nprograms of this Government do not help, but actually hinder, the \nability of our citizens efficiently to manage their lives in a changing \neconomy.\n  As a result, I am excited and delighted about the challenges and \nabout the prospects of being on a committee that is designed to address \nprecisely these challenges. I believe we need to reorient the programs \nof the Federal Government to deal with this new reality. Only when this \nGovernment understands this changing reality will Americans believe \nthat their Government is once again on the right track. I think the \ncommittee and its Members can make a difference.\n  Beyond my desire to work with my distinguished colleague from Kansas \nand others on these paramount issues, I am convinced that one of the \nmost important issues facing this country today is the need to educate \nour children in an environment conducive to learning. In the age of \ninformation, nothing--nothing at all--is more important to America's \nsuccess than a well-educated citizenry.\n  In that connection, I believe the largest single threat to successful \neducation today is the growing spate of violence in our schools.\n  A year ago this month, I held an education conference in Fife, WA, at \nwhich educators and parents from across Washington State spent an \nentire day discussing what the Federal Government could do to improve \nour system of education. For the first time in a long career, the No. 1 \npriority was not more money, it was not more teachers in specific \nareas, it was not longer school days. The men and women and kids at \nthis conference talked about school violence.\n  In Washington State, violent crimes by young people have doubled in \nthe past decade in spite of a 3-percent drop in the number of students. \nRecently, our superintendent of public instruction released a report \nthat calculated a total of 2,237 incidents of firearms or dangerous \nweapons violations reported by school districts and by private schools. \nAnd just today, of course, in the Washington Post, we see of a gun-\ninduced killing at the very door of one of the high schools in the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  Teachers and parents from all around Washington State have shared \nwith me horror stories of violence in their childrens' schools: First \ngraders threatening their peers with screwdrivers; a fourth grader \nextorting lunch money at knife point; a sixth grader who brought a fake \nbut real-looking gun to school and threatened fellow students' lives \nwith it.\n  How can we expect our children to learn calculus and Tolstoy when \nthey are afraid of walking the halls between classes?\n  On the issue of school violence, the role of the Federal Government \nhas not been a positive one. This Government has not concerned itself \nsufficiently with the safety of children threatened by these violent \nstudents. The Federal Government does not concern themselves with the \nsafety of the faculty and administrators in these schools. It does not \nseem sufficiently concerned with the disruptive impact of violence in \nthe learning process. In fact, the rules and regulations pursuant to \nstatutes passed by this Congress on the part of the Federal Government \nhas severely limited the ability of local school officials and teachers \nto deal effectively with violence in our schools. It has, in many \nrespects, tied their hands. It has set up a double standard, depending \nupon the classification of students in our schools, with respect to the \ndiscipline of violent students who bring guns into the schools.\n  Mr. President, this is profoundly the wrong direction in which to go. \nI am frustrated because the Federal Government, in fact, is making it \nfar more difficult for communities to create an environment in our \nschools conducive to learning. As a result, last year, I led a fight on \ntwo separate occasions, with \n[[Page S563]] the distinguished Senator from Connecticut [Mr. \nLieberman], which would restore to schools the authority to deal with \nthis growing tide of violence.\n  Our amendment, considered radical by many in this body, said that \nschool districts in Morton, WA, for example, or in Bridgeport, CT, for \nexample, were in a far better position than was any Federal bureaucrat \nto judge what was necessary to combat this rising and disruptive wave \nof violence. Although on both occasions our amendment was accepted \nfirst by a voice vote and secondly by an overwhelming majority, in each \noccasion it was dropped in conference. I felt so strongly about this \nprovision that I voted against the final passage of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act late last fall.\n  There are, of course, some who will continue to disagree with this \ngoal, who will continue to find that only the Federal Government is \ncapable of making value judgments among students when violence is at \nissue. I am certainly going to be willing to work with those who \ndisagree and to craft a policy that will attempt to deal with their \nconcerns. But our primary goal, one which cannot be compromised, must \nbe to restore local control to the educators--who are on the firing \nline, who are in the classroom--the right, the privilege, and the duty \nto deal with school violence.\n  I intend to work, as a member of the Labor Committee, to ensure that \nthe Federal Government does not stand in the way of educating our \nchildren in a safe and positive environment.\n  I invite all of the school teachers and principals and their \norganizations around the country who have stories to tell about how \nFederal rules and regulations have tied their hands when it comes to \ndealing with violent students to contact me, to contact my staff, to \ncontact the committee. I want to know how I can make certain that the \nFederal Government does not make this problem worse.\n  I want you to know that this Senator trusts the teachers and \nadministrators of the schools of this country and wants to give to them \nthe flexibility to deal with these challenges. We must do everything we \ncan to ensure that our children go to school in an environment \nconducive to learning, and that means an environment safe for them and \nfor their teachers.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to provide for restitution of victims of crimes, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     crime victims restitution act\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to \nreintroduce the Crime Victims Restitution Act. Last fall when the \nSenate passed it's version of the crime bill, I lauded the inclusion of \nmy victim's rights and mandatory restitution provisions in the \nlegislation. Three years ago, I introduced the Victim's Rights and \nRestitution Act, and many of those victim's rights provisions passed as \npart of the 1990 crime bill. However, each time this restitution \nprovision has passed the Senate it has subsequently been dropped in \nconference.\n  Pasage of this legislation would signal a great victory for all \nvictims of crime. If these provisions become law, crime victims will \nenjoy rights at the Federal level that many States already guarantee. \nMost important are the act's restitution provisions, making criminals \npay for their crimes. Under the legislation, crime victims will be \nentitled to receive full financial compensation directly from the \ncriminal in the form of mandatory restitution.\n  Over the last several years, it seems we have continuously debated \nwhat should be done to improve our Nation's judicial system. Now is the \ntime to do something about it. I strongly believe our judicial system \nneeds fundamental reform to help our police officers and courts deal \nwith the overwhelming increase in crime. Furthermore, it is crucial \nthat while trying to facilitate more effective and efficient methods of \ndealing with criminals, we must not forget about the most important \npart of the crime-fighting equation: The victims.\n  In 1990, I authored the crime victim's bill of rights which passed as \npart of the 1990 crime bill. For crimes tried in Federal court, victims \nnow have the right to be notified of and involved in court proceedings, \nthe right to be protected from the accused, the right to be treated \nfairly and with respect, and the right to be informed of the detention \nstatus of the convicted criminal.\n  However, passage of just the victims rights portion of my proposal \nleft some unfinished business. Crime victims should be entitled to \ncompensation for losses sustained from their victimization. This \nglaring inequity was remedied in the crime bill when it passed the \nSenate last year. It contained mandates that courts order restitution \nin all Federal criminal cases. Victims would be able to recover \nfinancial losses resulting from the criminal act. This restitution \norder would be a condition of any form of release for the offender. The \nlegislation would ensure that the criminal not only pays his debt to \nsociety, but he also pays his debt to his victim. However, the \nDemocrats in the House voted to delete these provisions from the final \ncrime bill.\n  The provisions of this legislation also overturn the Supreme Court's \nruling in the Hughey case which stated restitution could not be ordered \nfor crimes beyond the scope of the offense of conviction. So, if a \ncriminal is convicted of a criminal offense, but plea bargains his way \nout of a conviction on a second offense, he cannot be held responsible \nto repay the victim of the second offense. This obvious shortcoming \nwould be corrected by allowing the court to consider the course of \ncriminal conduct and order restitution for crimes other than the \noffense of conviction. Plea bargains should not result in victims being \ndenied the justice they deserve which certainly includes full \nrestitution from the offender.\n  Over the years mandatory restitution has received the written \nendorsements of victim rights experts across the Nation including the \nNational Organization for Victim Assistance, the National Victim \nCenter, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, and the National Coalition \nAgainst Sexual Assault.\n  This landmark victim's legislation needs to be enacted into law. \nMandatory restitution, while not healing all the wounds associated with \na crime, will provide some compensation to help people who have been \nvictimized and allow them to get their lives back in order. If Congress \nreconsiders crime legislation this year, these provisions certainly \nneed to be a part of the final bill.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/06/senate-section/article/S564-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                  S. 3\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the name of the Senator from New \nHampshire [Mr. Smith] was added as a cosponsor of S. 3, a bill to \ncontrol crime, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 145\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gramm, the name of the Senator from Iowa [Mr. \nGrassley] was added as a cosponsor of S. 145, a bill to provide \nappropriate protection for the constitutional guarantee of private \nproperty rights, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 6\n\n  At the request of Mr. Thurmond, the name of the Senator from Alabama \n[Mr. Heflin] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Joint Resolution 6, a \njoint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States relating to voluntary school prayer.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 4\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bradley, his name was added as a cosponsor of \namendment No. 4 proposed to S. 2, a bill to make certain laws \napplicable to the legislative branch of the Federal Government.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/06/senate-section/article/S564-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S564-S565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         SENATE RESOLUTION 31--RELATIVE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \nKennedy, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Simon, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Baucus, \nMr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Jeffords, \nMr. Pell, Mr. Chafee, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Bradley) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 31\n\n       Whereas there are approximately 900 clinics in the United \n     States providing reproductive health services;\n       Whereas violence directed at persons seeking to provide \n     reproductive health services continues to increase in the \n     United States, as demonstrated by the recent shootings at two \n     reproductive health clinics in Massachusetts and another \n     health care clinic in Virginia;\n       Whereas organizations monitoring clinic violence have \n     recorded over 130 incidents of violence or harassment \n     directed at reproductive health care clinics and their \n     personnel in 1994 such as death threats, stalking, chemical \n     attacks, bombings and arson;\n       Whereas there has been one attempted murder in Florida and \n     four individuals killed at reproductive health care clinics \n     in Florida and Massachusetts in 1994;\n       Whereas the Congress passed and the President signed the \n     Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994, a law \n     establishing Federal criminal penalties and civil remedies \n     for certain violent, threatening, obstructive and destructive \n     conduct that is intended to injure, intimidate or interfere \n     with persons seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health \n     services;\n       Whereas violence is not a mode of free speech and should \n     not be condoned as a method of expressing an opinion;\n       Whereas persons exercising their constitutional rights and \n     acting completely within the law are entitled to full \n     protection from the Federal Government;\n       Whereas the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of \n     1994 imposes a mandate on the Federal Government to protect \n     individuals seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health \n     services; and\n       Whereas the Attorney General has at her disposal law \n     enforcement personnel including 10,000 FBI agents and over \n     2,000 members of the United States Marshals Service: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     United States Attorney General should fully enforce the law \n     and take any further necessary measures to protect persons \n     seeking to provide or obtain, or assist in providing or \n     obtaining, reproductive health services from violent attack.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am submitting a resolution that calls on \nthe Attorney General to do everything she can to protect reproductive \nhealth care clinics, given the violence that we have seen throughout \nAmerica. I think that all of my colleagues share that view this \nviolence is deplorable. This is a bipartisan resolution that I am \nsubmitting today. It includes Republicans and Democrats.\n  I hope the Attorney General will follow the advice of the resolution, \nand I hope she will also listen to the advice of the President, who \nsays please let us \n[[Page S565]] do something about protecting these clinics.\n  Mr. President, today I am submitting legislation calling on the \nAttorney General to take all necessary measures to protect reproductive \nhealth care clinics and their staff from violent attack.\n  I know that many of my colleagues are as shocked as I am about the \nongoing terror and violence directed at our Nation's family planning \nclinics. That is why I am pleased that my legislation has bipartisan \nsupport.\n  In 1994 there were over 130 incidents nationwide of violence or \nharassment directed at clinics and the people who work there. They \ninclude 50 reports of death threats to doctors and other clinic \nworkers, 40 incidents of vandalism, 16 incidents of stalking, 4 acts of \narson and 3 attempted bombings.\n  Tragically, since the murder of Dr. David Gunn in March, 1993 outside \nof the Pensacola Women's Health Clinic there have been four additional \nslayings at clinics.\n  In July, 1994 Dr. John Britton and his escort Jim Barret were shot to \ndeath at The Ladies' Center in Pensacola, FL. Mr. Barret's wife was \ninjured.\n  On December 30, Shannon Lowney and Leanne Nichols were shot and \nkilled while working at reproductive health care clincs in \nMassachusetts. Five others were wounded. A day later the gunman fired \nshots at another clinic in Virginia.\n  The resolution I am submitting today urges the Attorney General to \nuse all of the tools at her disposal to stop this escalating violence, \nincluding the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act which we passed \nlast year, the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in working to protect our Nation's \nreproductive health care clinics from violent attack.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the murderous assaults at two clinics in \nBrookline, Massachusetts last week were despicable acts of terrorism. \nThis kind of vicious, hateful assault against women and health care \nproviders cannot be tolerated in any community in America.\n  Two women who worked at the Brookline clinics, Shannon Lowney and Lee \nAnn Nichols, had their lives brutally cut short. Five other people were \nseriously wounded, and four of them are still hospitalized. My heart \ngoes out to these victims and their families.\n  No effort can be spared to make sure that these crimes are not \nrepeated anywhere else. Women must be able to seek reproductive health \ncare without fear of violent assault. Doctors should be able to \npractice their profession without wearing bullet-proof vests. Clinic \nstaff should be able to go to work each day in safety.\n  Abortion is a constitutionally protected right, and it must be safe \nand accessible. Many of the clinics targeted by violence and \nobstruction provide a wide range of health care services for women, \nincluding family planning and prenatal care. We cannot allow access to \nthese important services to be reduced or blocked.\n  Last year, we passed and President Clinton signed the Freedom of \nAccess to Clinic Entrances Act. That law gives the Attorney General the \ntools she needs to prevent violence and obstruction and to punish such \nacts whenever and wherever they occur with the full force of Federal \nlaw. The Justice Department has already brought several enforcement \nactions under this law, and it is actively investigating other possible \nviolations. In addition, the Attorney General has made U.S. Marshals \navailable to protect clinics.\n  Some have suggested that the new Federal law is somehow responsible \nfor fomenting violence at abortion clinics, because it allegedly closes \noff peaceful picketing as an outlet for those with strongly held views \nagainst abortion. Any such suggestion is nonsense.\n  The clinic access law does not prohibit or punish peaceful picketing \nor any other expression protected by the first amendment. On the \ncontrary, it expressly allows it. What the act prohibits is violent, \nthreatening, obstructive, or destructive conduct--none of which has \never been protected by the Constitution. For that reason, every one of \nthe Federal courts that have been asked to review the law since \nPresident Clinton signed it last year has upheld it.\n  Tough laws against clinic blockades and clinic violence are not the \nproblem. They are the solution.\n  I commend President Clinton and Attorney General Reno for their \nvigorous enforcement of the new Federal law, and for their commitment \nto work with local law enforcement authorities to protect the clinics \nthroughout the country. They are doing everything in their power to \nguarantee public safety and deter the use of violent tactics aimed at \npatients and providers.\n  I am proud to join in sponsoring this legislation. The Senate must go \non record unequivocally to denounce the violence, and to express our \nsolid support for vigorous enforcement and implementation of the \nFederal clinic protection law. I hope that every Member of the Senate \nwill join in supporting this important measure.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/06/senate-section/article/S564-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 32--MAKING MINORITY PARTY APPOINTMENTS TO SENATE \n                               COMMITTEES\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                               S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       [[Page S567]] (1) Bridgestone/Firestone, a subsidiary of \n     foreign owned Bridgestone Corp., has recently announced its \n     decision to hire permanent replacement workers displacing \n     more than 2,000 American workers;\n       (2) this action may result in the largest permanent \n     displacement of workers in over a decade;\n       (3) the practice of hiring permanent replacement workers is \n     devastating, not only to the replaced workers, but also to \n     their families and communities;\n       (4) the position of management of foreign owned \n     Bridgestone/Firestone appears to be that they cannot compete \n     with their American owned competitor, Goodyear, if they \n     provide wages, benefits, and conditions of employment \n     benefits patterned after those provided by Goodyear;\n       (5) hiring permanent replacement workers is illegal under \n     the laws of the parent company's own country; and\n       (6) most of the United States' major trading partners, \n     including, Japan, Germany, France, and Canada recognize that \n     using permanent replacements is bad business and bad public \n     policy.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) Bridgestone/Firestone should reconsider its decision to \n     hire permanent replacement workers and return to the \n     bargaining table and bargain in good faith with the United \n     Rubberworkers of America, the representative of their \n     employees; and\n       (2) the Clinton Administration, working through the \n     appropriate diplomatic channels and using the appropriate \n     trade negotiations, should impress upon the parent company's \n     home government the concern of the United States over this \n     matter and seek their assistance in getting Bridgestone/\n     Firestone to reconsider their decision.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/06/senate-section/article/S566-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n            Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban affairs\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Because of the \ngreat interest shown in the bill, I ask that it be printed in the \nRecord at this point.\n  The bill follows:\n                                 S. 135\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Property Rights Litigation \n     Relief Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the private ownership of property is essential to a \n     free society and is an integral part of the American \n     tradition of liberty and limited government;\n       (2) the framers of the United States Constitution, in order \n     to protect private property and liberty, devised a framework \n     of Government designed to diffuse power and limit Government;\n       (3) to further ensure the protection of private property, \n     the fifth amendment to the United States Constitution was \n     ratified to prevent the taking of private property by the \n     Federal Government, except for public use and with just \n     compensation;\n       (4) the purpose of the takings clause of the fifth \n     amendment of the United States Constitution, as the Supreme \n     Court stated in Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49 \n     (1960), is ``to bar Government from forcing some people alone \n     to bear public burdens, which in all fairness and justice, \n     should be borne by the public as a whole'';\n       (5) the Federal Government, in its haste to ameliorate \n     public harms and environmental abuse, has singled out \n     property holders to shoulder the cost that should be borne by \n     the public, in violation of the just compensation requirement \n     of the takings clause of the fifth amendment of the United \n     States Constitution;\n       (6) there is a need to both restrain the Federal Government \n     in its overzealous regulation of the private sector and to \n     protect private property, which is a fundamental right of the \n     American people;\n       (7) the incremental, fact-specific approach that courts now \n     are required to employ in the absence of adequate statutory \n     language to vindicate property rights under the fifth \n     amendment of the United States Constitution has been \n     ineffective and costly and there is a need for Congress to \n     clarify the law and provide an effective remedy;\n       (8) certain provisions of sections 1346 and 1402 and \n     chapter 91 of title 28, United States Code (commonly known as \n     the Tucker Act), that delineates the jurisdiction of courts \n     hearing property rights claims, complicates the ability of a \n     property owner to vindicate a property owner's right to just \n     compensation for a governmental action that has caused a \n     physical or regulatory taking;\n       (9) current law--\n       (A) forces a property owner to elect between equitable \n     relief in the district court and monetary relief (the value \n     of the property taken) in the United States Court of Federal \n     Claims;\n       (B) is used to urge dismissal in the district court on the \n     ground that the plaintiff should seek just compensation in \n     the Court of Federal Claims; and\n       (C) is used to urge dismissal in the Court of Federal \n     Claims on the ground that plaintiff should seek equitable \n     relief in district court;\n       (10) property owners cannot fully vindicate property rights \n     in one court;\n       (11) property owners should be able to fully recover for a \n     taking of their private property in one court;\n       (12) certain provisions of section 1346 and 1402 and \n     chapter 91 of title 28, United States Code (commonly known as \n     the Tucker Act) should be amended, giving both the district \n     courts of the United States and the Court of Federal Claims \n     jurisdiction to hear all claims relating to property rights; \n     and\n       (13) section 1500 of title 28, United States Code, which \n     denies the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction to entertain \n     a suit which is pending in another court and made by the same \n     plaintiff, should be repealed.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to--\n       (1) encourage, support, and promote the private ownership \n     of property by ensuring the constitutional and legal \n     protection of private property by the United States \n     Government;\n       (2) establish a clear, uniform, and efficient judicial \n     process whereby aggrieved property owners can obtain \n     vindication of property rights guaranteed by the fifth \n     amendment to the United States Constitution and this Act;\n       (3) amend certain provisions of the Tucker Act, including \n     the repeal of section 1500 of title 28, United States Code;\n       (4) rectify the constitutional imbalance between the \n     Federal Government and the States; and\n       (5) require the Federal Government to compensate property \n     owners for the deprivation of property rights that result \n     from State agencies' enforcement of federally mandated \n     programs.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act the term--\n       (1) ``agency'' means a department, agency, independent \n     agency, or instrumentality of the United States, including \n     any military department, Government corporation, Government-\n     controlled corporation, or other establishment in the \n     executive branch of the United States Government;\n       (2) ``agency action'' means any action or decision taken by \n     an agency that--\n       (A) takes a property right; or\n       (B) unreasonably impedes the use of property or the \n     exercise of property interests or significantly interferes \n     with investment-backed expectations;\n       (3) ``just compensation''--\n       (A) means compensation equal to the full extent of a \n     property owner's loss, including the fair market value of the \n     private property taken and business losses arising from a \n     taking, whether the taking is by physical occupation or \n     through regulation, exaction, or other means; and\n       (B) shall include compounded interest calculated from the \n     date of the taking until the date the United States tenders \n     payment;\n       (4) ``owner'' means the owner or possessor of property or \n     rights in property at the time the taking occurs, including \n     when--\n       (A) the statute, regulation, rule, order, guideline, \n     policy, or action is passed or promulgated; or\n       (B) the permit, license, authorization, or governmental \n     permission is denied or suspended;\n       (5) ``private property'' or ``property'' means all property \n     protected under the fifth amendment to the Constitution of \n     the United States, any applicable Federal or State law, or \n     this Act, and includes--\n       (A) real property, whether vested or unvested, including--\n       (i) estates in fee, life estates, estates for years, or \n     otherwise;\n       (ii) inchoate interests in real property such as remainders \n     and future interests;\n       (iii) personalty that is affixed to or appurtenant to real \n     property;\n       (iv) easements;\n       (v) leaseholds;\n       (vi) recorded liens; and\n       (vii) contracts or other security interests in, or related \n     to, real property;\n       (B) the right to use water or the right to receive water, \n     including any recorded lines on such water right;\n     [[Page S568]]   (C) rents, issues, and profits of land, \n     including minerals, timber, fodder, crops, oil and gas, coal, \n     or geothermal energy;\n       (D) property rights provided by, or memorialized in, a \n     contract, except that such rights shall not be construed \n     under this title to prevent the United States from \n     prohibiting the formation of contracts deemed to harm the \n     public welfare or to prevent the execution of contracts for--\n       (i) national security reasons; or\n       (ii) exigencies that present immediate or reasonably \n     foreseeable threats or injuries to life or property;\n       (E) any interest defined as property under State law; or\n       (F) any interest understood to be property based on custom, \n     usage, common law, or mutually reinforcing understandings \n     sufficiently well-grounded in law to back a claim of \n     interest;\n       (6) ``State agency'' means any State department, agency, \n     political subdivision, or instrumentality that--\n       (A) carries out or enforces a regulatory program required \n     under Federal law;\n       (B) is delegated administrative or substantive \n     responsibility under a Federal regulatory program; or\n       (C) receives Federal funds in connection with a regulatory \n     program established by a State,\n\n     if the State enforcement of the regulatory program, or the \n     receipt of Federal funds in connection with a regulatory \n     program established by a state, is directly related to the \n     taking of private property seeking to be vindicated under \n     this Act; and\n       (7) ``taking of private property''--\n       (A) means any action whereby private property is directly \n     taken as to require compensation under the fifth amendment to \n     the United States Constitution or under this Act, including \n     by physical invasion, regulation, exaction, condition, or \n     other means; and\n       (B) shall not include--\n       (i) a condemnation action filed by the United States in an \n     applicable court; or\n       (ii) an action filed by the United States relating to \n     criminal forfeiture.\n\n     SEC. 5. COMPENSATION FOR TAKEN PROPERTY.\n\n       (a) In General.--No agency or State agency, shall take \n     private property except for public purpose and with just \n     compensation to the property owner. A property owner shall \n     receive just compensation if--\n       (1) as a consequence of a decision of any agency, or State \n     agency, private property (whether all or in part) has been \n     physically invaded or taken for public use without the \n     consent of the owner; and\n       (2)(A) such action does not substantially advance the \n     stated governmental interest to be achieved by the \n     legislation or regulation on which the action is based;\n       (B) such action exacts the owner's constitutional or \n     otherwise lawful right to use the property or a portion of \n     such property as a condition for the granting of a permit, \n     license, variance, or any other agency action without a rough \n     proportionality between the stated need for the required \n     dedication and the impact of the proposed use of the \n     property;\n       (C) such action results in the property owner being \n     deprived, either temporarily or permanently, of all or \n     substantially all economically beneficial or productive use \n     of the property or that part of the property affected by the \n     action without a showing that such deprivation inheres in the \n     title itself;\n       (D) such action diminishes the fair market value of the \n     affected portion of the property which is the subject of the \n     action by the lesser of--\n       (i) 20 percent or more with respect to the value \n     immediately prior to the governmental action; or\n       (ii) $10,000, or more with respect to the value immediately \n     prior to the governmental action; or\n       (E) under any other circumstance where a taking has \n     occurred within the meaning of the fifth amendment of the \n     United States Constitution.\n       (b) Burden of Proof.--(1) The Government shall bear the \n     burden of proof in any action described under--\n       (A) subsection (a)(2)(A), with regard to showing the nexus \n     between the stated governmental purpose of the governmental \n     interest and the impact on the proposed use of private \n     property;\n       (B) subsection (a)(2)(B), with regard to showing the \n     proportionality between the exaction and the impact of the \n     proposed use of the property; and\n       (C) subsection (a)(2)(C), with regard to showing that such \n     deprivation of value inheres in the title to the property.\n       (2) The property owner shall have the burden of proof in \n     any action described under subsection (a)(2)(D), with regard \n     to establishing the diminution of value of property.\n       (c) Compensation and Nuisance Exception to Payment of Just \n     Compensation.--(1) No compensation shall be required by this \n     Act if the owner's use or proposed use of the property is a \n     nuisance as commonly understood and defined by background \n     principles of nuisance and property law, as understood within \n     the State in which the property is situated, and to bar an \n     award of damages under this Act, the United States shall have \n     the burden of proof to establish that the use or proposed use \n     of the property is a nuisance.\n       (2) Subject to paragraph (1), if an agency action directly \n     takes property or a portion of property under subsection (a), \n     compensation to the owner of the property that is affected by \n     the action shall be either the greater of an amount equal \n     to--\n       (A) the difference between--\n       (i) the fair market value of the property or portion of the \n     property affected by agency action before such property \n     became the subject of the specific government regulation; and\n       (ii) the fair market value of the property or portion of \n     the property when such property becomes subject to the agency \n     action; or\n       (B) business losses.\n       (d) Transfer of Property Interest.--The United States shall \n     take title to the property interest for which the United \n     States pays a claim under this Act.\n       (e) Source of Compensation.--The compensation referred to \n     in this section shall be paid out of funds made available to \n     the Federal agency or department by appropriation for the \n     fiscal year in which the property deprivation referred to in \n     this section occurred. If no such funds have been made \n     available to the agency, such payment shall be made from the \n     Judgment Fund.\n\n     SEC. 6. JURISDICTION AND JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\n       (a) In General.--A property owner may file a civil action \n     under this Act to challenge the validity of any agency action \n     that adversely affects the owner's interest in private \n     property in either the United States District Court or the \n     United States Court of Federal Claims.

Mr. President, in an unusual publication called \nsimply ``Constitution,'' published by the Foundation for the United \nStates Constitution, there is an article by Professor Harold Hongju Koh \nof Yale University titled, ``Bitter Fruit of the Asian Immigration \nCases.''\n  It interested me because of my long association with the cause of \ncivil rights and because I grew up in the State of Oregon and recall \nthe criticism my father took when, as a Lutheran minister, he objected \nto the 1942 unconstitutional transfer of Japanese American citizens \naway from the West Coast. Another reason for my interest is that I \nserve on the Senate Judiciary's Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee \nAffairs.\n  Our record in the field of immigration has not always been a good \none, and that is particularly true as it applies to the Asian \ncommunity.\n  There is no question that we face problems in the field of \nimmigration, but the answer is not passing things like Proposition 187 \nin California or the other abuses that we have tolerated through the \nhistory of our country.\n  I believe my colleagues will find the article by Professor Koh a \nmatter of more than casual interest.\n  At this point, I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n              Bitter Fruit of the Asian Immigration Cases\n\n                         (By Harold Hongju Koh)\n\n       Schoolchildren everywhere can recite the Statue of \n     Liberty's inspirational message about ``huddled masses, \n     yearning to breathe free.'' Yet history shows that our \n     national attitude toward immigrants has been as hostile as it \n     has been solicitious--especially in hard times. One need only \n     look at today's headlines. As we endure our latest recession, \n     newspapers report polls showing that 60 percent of Americans \n     believe current levels of immigration are too high. News \n     stories tell of the government's harsh policies toward \n     Haitian and Chinese refugees, of public concern over the \n     illicit smuggling of aliens, of anti-immigrant sentiment \n     spurred by the World Trade Center bombing, and of lawsuits \n     brought by California, Texas and Florida against the federal \n     government to recoup costs arising from the influx of \n     undocumented aliens. Politicians, says the New York Times, \n     call for ``a get-tough effort to control immigration . . . \n     prompted by polls showing that the issue is gaining an \n     importance among voters . . . increasingly worried about the \n     economic impact of immigrants and their effect on American \n     culture.''\n       Not only is immigrant bashing as American as apple pie, but \n     bias against immigrants has helped shape our constitutional \n     law. Occasionally, the bias has been overt: a proposed \n     constitutional amendment, for example, (favored, apparently, \n     by 49 percent of Americans) would\n      deny citizenship to the American-born children of \n     undocumented aliens. And ``reforms'' that hurt immigrants \n     have emerged as themes embroidered on Supreme Court \n     decisions. It has been a long time since Justice Harry \n     Blackmun led a unanimous Supreme Court to declare that \n     ``aliens as a class are a prime example of a discrete and \n     insular minority . . . for whom . . . heightened judicial \n     solicitude is appropriate'' Graham v. Richardson, 1971). \n     His last major immigration opinion Sale v. Haitian Centers \n     Council, 1993) was a solitary dissent decrying the summary \n     return of Haitian refugees to a brutal dictatorship \n     without first granting them a hearing. In his dissent, \n     Blackmun laid bare the themes that run through the modern \n     Court's immigration and naturalization jurisprudence: an \n     obsession with sovereignty and governmental power, an \n     unwillingness to scrutinize the immigration decisions of \n     government officials, contempt for international law and \n     indifference to the due process and equal protection \n     claims of foreigners seeking entry to the United States.\n       Where and when did these attitudes originate? The latest \n     volume of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Devise: History of the \n     Supreme Court, Owen Fiss's impressive Troubled Beginnings of \n     the Modern State, 1888-1910, illuminates a source: a series \n     of Asian immigration cases decided by the Court in the late \n     19th century. Before these cases, immigration into the United \n     States went virtually unregulated, driven by the perceived \n     need to remedy underpopulation. Indeed, the Declaration of \n     Independence assailed the King of England for ``endeavor[ing] \n     to prevent the Population of these States; for that Purpose \n     obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; [and] \n     refusing to pass others to encourage their Migrations hither. \n     . . .'' The Constitution's framers responded with the fourth \n     clause of Article I, Section 8, which granted Congress power \n     to ``establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization.'' In 1790 \n     Congress invoked new power to pass a law permitting only \n     ``free white persons'' to naturalize, a right not granted to \n     Asian immigrants until 1952.\n       Significantly, this language did not authorize Congress to \n     regulate the admission of aliens who might seek citizenship. \n     In fact, another clause of Article I forbade Congress to \n     prohibit the ``Migration or Importation of such Persons as \n     any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit'' \n     before 1808. Designed to protect the slave trade, the clause \n     was invoked by Jeffersonians to challenge the \n     constitutionality of the Alien Act of 1798, which authorized \n     the President to expel ``all such aliens as he shall judge \n     dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States.''\n       During the years of free immigration few Asians came to \n     these shores. Between 1820, when immigration records were \n     first kept, and 1849, when the California Gold Rush began, \n     only 43 Chinese were reported to have arrived in America. But \n     once gold was discovered, thousands of Chinese miners flooded \n     into ``Kumshan''--the Golden Moutain--as they called \n     California. In 1850, 4,000 Chinese arrived in California. The \n     next year the Chinese population stood at 25,000; in 1852, \n     45,000. These immigrants--mostly men who had left their \n     families in China--came to work the mines. But by the mid-\n     1860s, thousands had depleted their mining claims or been \n     forced off them. They found work on the western slopes of the \n     Sierra Nevada, building the Central Pacific Railroad; in one \n     year the company procured 15,000 laborers. Other Chinese \n     opened laundries, restaurants and small shops, or worked as \n     gardeners, domestic servants, farmers, fishermen, mechanics \n     and artisans. By the mid-1870s, some 115,000 Chinese lived in \n     the United States, 70 percent in California, where one person \n     in 10 was Chinese.\n       The first Chinese were welcomed with curiosity. In 1852 the \n     governor of California claimed he wanted ``further \n     immigration and settlement of the Chinese--one of the most \n     worthy classes of our newly adopted citizens.'' But by the \n     1860s hospitality had soured. White workers assailed the \n     Chinese for working too hard for too little, while the \n     popular press vilified them as lairs, criminals, prostitutes \n     and opium addicts.\n       Unlike the European immigrants then flooding into the \n     United States, the Chinese were thought unassimilable. In \n     Justice Stephen Field's works, ``they remained strangers in \n     the land, residing apart by themselves, and adhering to the \n     customs and usages of their own country. As they grew in \n     numbers each year, the people of the [West] coast saw, or \n     believed they saw . . . great danger that at no distant day \n     that portion of our country would be overrun by them unless \n     prompt action was taken to restrict their immigration.'' When \n     drought and depression hit California in the early 1860s, the \n     Chinese were scapegoated. ``To an American,'' the 1876 \n     manifesto of the Workingmen's Party of California declared, \n     ``death is preferable to life on a par with the Chinaman.''\n        California and its cities began to enact restrictive laws. \n     The first were revenue measures (such as entry, license and \n     occupation taxes) and other laws neutral on their face but \n     applied harshly against the Chinese. Chinese paid 98 percent \n     of the monies collected under the California Foreign Miner's \n     Tax, for example, and an 1870 law authorizing the state's \n     immigration commissioner to remove ``debauched women'' was \n     quickly applied to Chinese women arriving by ship. Soon the \n     laws became overtly racist; a San Francisco ordinance \n     required all Chinese residents to move to prescribed \n     ghettoes, and another humiliated Chinese prisoners in the \n     county jail by requiring them to cut their queues to one inch \n     in length. Between 1855 and 1870 California passed acts \n     bearing such titles as ``An Act to Discourage the Immigration \n     to This State of Persons Who Cannot Become Citizens,'' ``An \n     Act to Protect Free White Labor Against Competition with \n     Chinese Coolie Labor'' and ``An Act to Prevent the Further \n     Immigration of Chinese or Mongolians to This State.'' Chinese \n     were denied the vote and the rights to own or inherit land, \n     to testify in court, to attend public schools with \n     [[Page S570]] whites or to live in the same neighborhoods as \n     whites. In 1879 California's new constitution asserted that \n     ``the presence of foreigners ineligible to become citizens . \n     . . is dangerous to the well-being of the State, and the \n     Legislature shall discourage their immigration by all means \n     within its power.''\n       Meanwhile, assaults on the Chinese became commonplace. In \n     1871 a Los Angeles race riot killed 19 Chinese. In September \n     1885, 28 Chinese laborers in a settlement near Rock Springs, \n     Wyoming, were brutally murdered, and vigilantes killed \n     several Chinese residents of the Washington territories. The \n     next year mobs invaded the Chinese sections of several West \n     Coast cities and forced residents out. Across Washington, \n     Oregon and California, mass meetings demanded the expulsion \n     of Chinese.\n        California's restrictiveness contrasted sharply with \n     federal immigration policy. An 1868 act of Congress declared \n     that the right to leave the land of one's\n      birth and resettle elsewhere was ``a natural and inherent \n     right of all people,'' in recognition of which the United \n     states ``has freely received emigrants from all nations \n     and invested them with rights of citizenship.'' That year \n     the United States and China concluded the Burlingame \n     Treaty to improve trade with China and encourage the \n     immigration of coolies to build the railroads. The treaty \n     recognized that free migration and an ``inherent and \n     inalienable right of man to change his home and \n     allegiance'' were matters of ``mutual advantage'' for both \n     nations. by its terms, Chinese could become ``permanent \n     residents'' of the United States. Federal receptivity \n     extended not just to immigration but also to citizenship \n     by birth. In 1866, two years before the Burlingame Treaty, \n     Congress passed a civil rights law (designed to overturn \n     the 1857 Dred Scott decision) that reaffirmed the \n     citizenship of native-born blacks. Its language was echoed \n     in the birthright citizenship clause of Section 1 of the \n     14th Amendment, soon to be drafted by Congress: ``All \n     persons born or naturalized in the United States and \n     subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the \n     United States and of the State wherein they reside.'' \n     California Senator John Conness supported this language \n     and declared his desire for equal rights for children of \n     Chinese parentage. By accepting the clause, notes \n     constitutional scholar Gerald Neuman, Congress ``refused \n     the invitation to create an hereditary caste of voteless \n     denizens, vulnerable to expulsion and exploitation.''\n       But the tide soon changed. In 1872 political pressure led \n     President Ulysses S. Grant to call for legislation to \n     counteract the evils associated with Chinese immigration. The \n     resulting Immigration Act of 1875 was the first federal \n     legislation to control immigration. It outlawed contracts to \n     supply coolie labor, barred importation of aliens without \n     their consent and made it illegal to bring in women for \n     purposes of prostitution. As applied against the Chinese, the \n     restrictionist statute seemed inconsistent with the spirit of \n     the Burlingame Treaty. Four years later President Rutherford \n     Hayes invoked the treaty to veto a bill forbidding ships to \n     bring more than 15 Chinese at a time into the country. But in \n     1880, under pressure from Congress, Hayes renegotiated the \n     Burlingame Treaty to recognize America's right to regulate, \n     limit and suspend Chinese immigration. Two years later \n     Congress enacted the first Chinese Exclusion Act, which \n     suspended immigration of Chinese, with minor exceptions, for \n     10 years. That law was amended and reenacted repeatedly and \n     was not finally revoked until 1943. The 1882 act expressly \n     prohibited the naturalization of Chinese as American citizens \n     and denied entry to the wives of Chinese, even permanent U.S. \n     residents--a restriction that continued for the next 60 \n     years. This shortage of women forced many Chinese laborers to \n     return to China simply to marry or have families. In 1884 \n     Congress amended the exclusion law to require returning \n     Chinese laborers to produce certificates of residence signed \n     by two non-Chinese American citizens--a requisite designed to \n     thwart ``the notorious capabilities of the lower classes of \n     Chinese for perjury.''\n       The act was soon challenged. Chae Chan Ping, a Chinese \n     laborer who had entered the United States lawfully in 1875, \n     obtained the required certificate of residence before \n     visiting China in 1887. In 1888, shortly before he was to \n     return, Congress amended the Exclusion Act to revoke all \n     reentry certificates. Chae Chan Ping was denied reentry, and \n     he sued. He challenged the amended Chinese Exclusion Act on \n     the grounds that it violated the Constitution's due process \n     and equal protection clauses and conflicted with the \n     Burlingame Treaty.\n       In other times his case would have seemed easy. But a \n     unanimous Court rejected his claim and in the process laid \n     down the five planks of our modern immigration jurisprudence. \n     Justice Stephen J. Field wrote the opinion.\n       The first plank came with Field's title, the Chinese \n     Exclusion case, an inapt name for a case that actually \n     concerned the reentry of a longtime resident. By framing the \n     case as an analysis of the federal government's supposed \n     power to exclude, Field portrayed Chae Chan Ping's claim as \n     an assault on the Chinese Exclusion Act, which he defined as \n     the statutory expression of an inherent, unenumerated \n     foreign-affairs power that lay beyond substantive \n     constitutional attack. This power, he said, was an essential \n     feature of national sovereignty. That ``the government of the \n     United States. . .can exclude aliens from its territories,'' \n     he declared, ``is a proposition which we do not think open to \n     controversy. . .The power of exclusion of foreigners being an \n     incident of sovereignty belonging to the government of the \n     United States, as a part of those sovereign powers delegated \n     by the Constitution, the right to its exercise at any time, \n     when, in the judgment of the government, the interests of the \n     country require it, cannot be granted away or restrained on \n     behalf of any one.''\n       Justice Field conceded that the 1888 act violated the open \n     terms of the Burlingame Treaty. But, he concluded, the act \n     was ``not on that account invalid,'' since statutes and \n     treaties are equivalent federal laws, and the most recent \n     controls. In effect, he suggested, laying down what became \n     the second plank of the Court's immigration jurisprudence, \n     Congress has the power not just to disregard but also to \n     abrogate solemn treaty obligations.\n       Third, Field noted, a Chinese laborer's right to reenter \n     the United States ``is held at the will of the government, \n     revocable at any time, at its pleasure,'' despite any due \n     process claim. Although the Court did not elaborate on that \n     conclusion, later decisions have construed it as resting on \n     several implicit premises: that perhaps the Constitution does \n     not apply to aliens outside the United States; that a \n     person's right to return home is neither a ``liberty'' nor a \n     ``property'' interest protected by constitutional due \n     process; or that an individual's due process interest can be \n     outweighed by the public's interest in ``preserv[ing] its \n     independence, and giving] security against foreign aggression \n     and encroachment.'' As the constitutional scholar Louis \n     Henkin has noted, ``whatever the Court intended, both its \n     holding and its sweeping dictum have been taken to mean that \n     there are no constitutional limitations on the power of \n     Congress to regulate immigration.''\n       The fourth plank was an omission. In Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n     decided only three years earlier, the Court had held a San \n     Francisco ordinance invalid under the 14th Amendment, based \n     on evidence that it was applied dicriminatorily against \n     Chinese launderers. Here the Court never examined whether, by \n     extension, the federal exclusion laws also offended the \n     constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws.\n       Finally, Justice Field labeled the government's actions a \n     ``political question'' that barred judicial review. ``Whether \n     a proper consideration by our government of its previous \n     laws, or a proper respect for the nation whose subjects are \n     affected by its action, ought to have qualified its \n     inhibition and made it applicable only to persons departing \n     from the country after the passage of the act are not \n     questions for judicial determination,'' he wrote.\n       During the next decade the Court expanded upon each \n     principle in a series of Asian immigration cases. In \n     Nishimura Ekiu v. United States (1892), it backed an \n     immigration official who refused a Japanese woman admission \n     to the United States, relying on a statute authorizing such \n     refusal if in the official's opinion immigrants were likely \n     to become ``public charges.'' Justice Horace Gray delivered \n     the opinion upholding the act, repeating Field's language \n     about a sovereign nation's power to exclude aliens. Since the \n     statute had granted the officer discretionary power, Gray \n     reasoned, ``no other tribunal. . .is at liberty to reexamine \n     or controvert the sufficiency of the evidence on which he \n     acted.''\n       A year later, in Fong Yue Ting v. United States (1893), \n     Gray expanded those claims. At issue was whether a Chinese \n     laborer, a U.S. resident for 14 years and, of course, barred \n     from becoming a citizen, could be arrested and expelled for \n     lacking a certificate of residence. Based on the testimony of \n     a Chinese witness, a federal judge had found that the laborer \n     was a permanent resident of the United States. But Gray \n     extended Field's arguments from the Chinese Exclusion case. \n     He recognized an ``absolute and unqualified'' governmental \n     right not just to exclude aliens who have never entered, but \n     ``to expel or deport foreigners, who have not been \n     naturalized or taken any step toward becoming citizens.'' In \n     an incredible catch-22, Gray turned Fong Yue Ting's \n     acceptance of a legal disability (his inability to become a \n     naturalized American citizen) into a justification for \n     barring him from his adopted home. In so doing he rejected \n     both due process and equal protection claims. In Fiss's \n     words, he left ``Yick Wo on the books but denied it any \n     operative effect.''\n       In 1895 the Court added the last piece of the puzzle. Lem \n     Moon Sing, a Chinese druggist permanently domiciled in San \n     Francisco, visited his native home. Upon being denied reentry \n     in 1894, he provided proof of his prior residence from two \n     credible non-Chinese witnesses, but he was nevertheless \n     restrained and confined. Writing for the Court, the elder \n     Justice John Marshall Harlan upheld the denial of Lem Moon \n     Sing's writ of habeas corpus, reasoning that a decision of an \n     immigration official to deny an alien admission to the United \n     States could not be reexamined in a habeas corpus proceeding \n     (Lem Moon Sing v. United States). The decision had two \n     startling results. First, it transformed the doctrine of \n     plenary federal power over exclusion from a congressional \n     power to an executive authority, once Congress had delegated \n     it to executive officials. Second, the case made clear that \n     courts could not intervene to examine even blatant \n     [[Page S571]] misuses of the exclusion power by immigration \n     officials. Thus, as this century began, the Court viewed \n     Congress's power to control immigration--nowhere specified in \n     the Constitution--as complete, inherent and mandated by \n     sovereignty and international law. That power overrode state \n     law, prior treaties and fundamental constitutional \n     protections, and it could be exercised virtually free from \n     judicial scrutiny.\n       A doctrine so sweeping attracted criticism. The extension \n     of the power to exclude, granted in Chinese Exclusion, to \n     deportation and expulsion proved too much even for Justice \n     Field, who not only dissented but also wrote a letter urging \n     that additional members be added to the Court, reasoning that \n     ``where [a] decision goes to the very essentials of \n     Constitutional Government, the question of an increase of the \n     bench may properly be considered and acted upon.'' But as \n     Fiss reveals, the one consistent and enlightened critic of \n     the Asian immigration decisions was Field's nephew, Justice \n     David Brewer, who dissented in Nishimura Ekiu, Fong Yue Ting \n     and Lem Moon Sing, showing the kind of clarity and inde\n      pendence of mind that marked him as the Blackmun of his day. \n     The son of missionary parents in Asia Minor, Brewer was \n     one of the few Justices who sought to understand the role \n     of aliens in the constitutional community. In his Fong Yue \n     Ting dissent, he highlighted the racist character of the \n     law in question, asking, ``In view of this enactment of \n     the highest legislative body of the foremost Christian \n     nation, may not the thoughtful Chinese disciple of \n     Confucius fairly ask, Why do they send missionaries \n     here?''\n       For all his enlightenment, even Brewer did not argue that \n     the Constitution's protections applied outside the United \n     States. To the contrary, his Fong Yue Ting dissent declared \n     that ``the Constitution has no extraterritorial effect, and \n     those who have not come lawfully within our territory cannot \n     claim any protection from its provisions.'' Years later the \n     Court would exploit that loophole by creating a legal \n     fiction--that even aliens who have physically entered the \n     United States remain legally outside it, thereby \n     intentionally denying even longtime residents of this country \n     meaningful constitutional protection.\n       As the century turned, the question of whether aliens \n     outside the United States have constitutional rights was \n     absorbed by the larger issue of ``whether the Constitution \n     follows the flag''--that is, whether the Constitution extends \n     to the furthest reaches of the emerging American empire. The \n     characteristic executive-branch response to this question, \n     ascribed by Fiss to Secretary of War Elihu Root, was, ``As \n     near as I can make out the Constitution follows the flag--but \n     doesn't quite catch up with it.''\n       Only one decision ran against the anti-Asian tide: United \n     States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898). That case asked whether \n     children born in the United States of Chinese parents became \n     American citizens by virtue of the 14th Amendments birthright \n     citizenship clause. Given the earlier Chinese decisions, the \n     case seemed an uphill struggle. The Chinese Exclusion Act had \n     denied Wong Kim Ark's parents the opportunity for citizenship \n     through naturalization, and Chae Chan Ping and Fong Yue Ting \n     had settled that those parents could have been deported, \n     expelled or forbidden reentry upon leaving the country. \n     Justice Gray began inauspiciously, asserting that ``the \n     inherent right of every independent nation to determine for \n     itself, and according to its own constitution and laws, what \n     classes of persons shall be entitled to its citizenship. \n     ``Yet surprisingly, he went on to hold that the 14th \n     Amendment denied the federal government the power to withhold \n     citizenship from children born in the United States of alien \n     parents.\n       The decision rested on the birthright citizenship clause, \n     which confers citizenship on U.S.-born persons of parents \n     ``subject to [U.S.] jurisdiction.'' The Court's holding that \n     Chinese parents of American-born children were so subject \n     reaffirmed the themes of sovereignty and absolute territorial \n     jurisdiction that ran through the earlier Chinese cases. \n     Ironically, the decision also seems to have been driven by \n     the potential impact of a contrary holding on ethnic groups \n     other than Asians. As Justice Gray noted, ``To hold that the \n     14th Amendment . . . excludes from citizenship the children \n     born in the United States of citizens or subjects of other \n     countries, would be to deny citizenship of thousands of \n     persons of English, Scotch, Irish, German, or other European \n     parentage, who always have been considered a citizens of the \n     United States.\n       All this might seem like ancient history, made irrelevant \n     by the New Deal, the Warren court, the Bill of Rights \n     revolution and the global era of international human rights. \n     Nor does it seem plausible that blatantly racist laws could \n     survive after Brown v. Board of Education, the end of \n     official racial discrimination and the advent of strict \n     judicial scrutiny. But our government's position in recent \n     cases reveals that immigration is caught in a time warp.\n       Chinese refugees, arriving on Long Island's south shore \n     aboard the Golden Venture, fall squarely within the Chinese \n     Exclusion holding. Poor black Haitian boat people, fleeing \n     persecution after a coup d'etat overthrew their first \n     democratically elected government, encounter as obstacles to \n     their entry into the United States claims of inherent \n     sovereignty and plenary congressional power, allegedly \n     delegated to the President and the Coast Guard. Haitians who \n     raise due process and equal protection claims are told that \n     the Constitution does not protect them on the high seas. \n     Their efforts to invoke multilateral and bilateral refugee \n     treaties similarly founder on American claims of \n     territoriality. When Haitians challenge their summary \n     repatriation to Haiti, our government in its defense cites \n     grounds of foreign policy, national security and \n     nonreviewability. Refused admission as public \n     charges and health risks, HIV-positive Haitian asylum seekers \n     are detained for nearly two years in a U.S. government \n     internment camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in an eerie parallel \n     of the government's internment of Japanese-Americans during \n     World War II. At this writing, thousands of Haitians are \n     again detained at Guantanamo. Ironically, the question arises \n     whether Haitian children born in the Guantanamo camp are \n     Haitian, Cuban or perhaps even American citizens.\n       Other infamous decisions from the 19th century, such as \n     Dred Scott and Plessy v. Ferguson (which legalized separate \n     but equal), have been overruled, both at law and in the court \n     of public opinion. But the Asian immigration cases of that \n     era--no less shocking--still bear bitter fruit. Today, no \n     public official would embrace the racism, hatred and nativism \n     that drove those decisions. Yet the legal principles they \n     enunciated still rule our borders.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/06/senate-section/article/S569-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S571-S572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         TRITUTE TO GORO HOKAMA\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I have known Goro Hokama, the \noutgoing chairman of the county council of the County of Maui, for over \n40 years. In the spring of 1954, I recall meeting with him to discuss \nwhether we should consider public service as our life's career. For 40 \nyears, Goro Hokama has served the people of Maui County as a member of \nthe county council and also chairman of that same body.\n  I wish to share with you and my colleagues the following editorial \nfrom the Maui News, dated December 20, 1994, entitled ``Goro Hokama: 40 \nYears of Service.''\n  I believe it expresses the sentiment of many of us who have had the \nprivilege of calling him friend, and the many who have benefited form \nhis leadership. I wish to join the people of Maui County and all of \nHawaii in commending and thanking Goro Hokama for his 40 years of \ndedicated public service.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                  [From the Maui News, Dec. 20, 1994]\n\n                    Goro Hokama: 40 Years of Service\n\n       1994's end will officially bring down the curtain on Goro \n     Hokama's 40 continuous years of public service to Maui \n     County. It's impossible to overstate the contributions he has \n     made to this community, and in fact, to the entire state of \n     Hawaii.\n       The departing Maui County Council chairman was first \n     elected to office in 1954, the year of the great political \n     revolution that saw the Democrats snatch the reins of power \n     from the Republicans and by proxy from the big landowners. \n     Hokama was Hawaii's lone remaining elected county official \n     who had a hand in that historic housecleaning, a staying \n     power made ever more remarkable by his having to face \n     election every two years.\n       U.S. Sen. Daniel Inouye is the only person remaining from \n     the 1954 sweep who has served in elected office as long as \n     Hokama, but even he did not have to win 20 straight times to \n     do so. Hokama did.\n       And Hokama won without ever sacrificing his principles, \n     even when it meant risking the loss of longtime supporters. \n     For all of his 40 years on the County Council, or its \n     predecessor, the Board of Supervisors, Hokama held the Lanai \n     residency seat. In more than one election he trailed his \n     opponent when the ballots on Lanai were counted, but with \n     countywide voting he would prevail anyway because of his \n     broad appeal to residents throughout the county.\n       Seeing himself as more than just a Lanai councilman, Hokama \n     clearly understood his role as a county councilman, and his \n     actions reflected that understanding, even if not always to \n     his benefit back home.\n       He learned early, however, not to be frightened off by the \n     odds, working as a union organizer among the pineapple \n     workers on Lanai in the 1940s when unions were a poison to \n     the ruling political and financial powers. And neither was he \n     frightened off nearly 50 years later when the ILWU shockingly \n     refused to endorse him, one of its own, in the election of \n     1992 because of differences he had with the union leadership \n     over the course of development on Lanai.\n       He won anyway.\n       That was an occasion when he opposed development, and he \n     drew the wrath of labor. On other occasions he supported \n     development, and he drew the wrath of environmentalists. On \n     all of those occasions, however, Hokama acted upon what he \n     believed was right, not on what may have been politically \n     expedient.\n       Maui has repeatedly been cited by economists as the county \n     with the firmest financial footing in the state, and that is \n     due in no small part to Goro Hokama. Fiscally conservative by \n     nature, he nonetheless was a leader in the bold gambles that \n     paid off in the developments of Kaanapali, Wailea and \n     [[Page S572]] Kapalua, bringing the full fruits of tourism to \n     bear on Maui's economy. That economic success story is \n     certainly his chief legacy.\n       His first and only election loss came in November when his \n     bid for mayor was turned back by Linda Crockett Lingle. \n     Hokama again found himself bucking the odds by taking on the \n     popular Republican incumbent, but as always he showed his \n     resolve not to be cowed by the odds. He waged an aggressive \n     and tireless campaign from day one, the only difference being \n     that this time he lost.\n       That he didn't lose in any of the 20 elections before this \n     one is both a tribute to the man Goro Hokama and a profit to \n     the County of Maui.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/06/senate-section/article/S571-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        STAR WARS OR MAGINOT LINE? CONTRACT TO BANKRUPT AMERICA\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the Republican contract calls for \nthe old star wars program--the strategic defense initiative [SDI]--to \nbe retooled, reinvigorated, and deployed ``at the earliest possible \ndate.'' We have spent a fortune on this program since 1983, with next \nto nothing to show for it, except perhaps how wasteful and foolish our \ndefense spending can sometimes be.\n  The following article, written by Robert Wright in the New Republic \nin December 1994, makes a clear case for discontinuing the high levels \nof treasure we spend on missile defense every year. President Clinton, \nwho seems intent on spending far too much on defense over the next few \nyears, must know that the new threats to our national security cannot \nbe parried by building fanciful, expensive, uncertain missile defenses.\n  The President and Congress instead ought to acknowledge that SDI by \nany name remains nothing more than a 1990's version of the old French \nMaginot Line. The Maginot Line didn't work in World War I, and star \nwars can't work today, for reasons made clear over the past 10 years of \ncongressional and public debate. Sadly, we are visiting an issue now \nthat should have gone away in the late 1980's.\n  I commend the New Republic article to my colleagues, and I ask that \nit be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n                              Crazy State\n\n                           (By Robert Wright)\n\n       Gingrich argued that conservatives adopt space exploration \n     and Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, the so-called Star \n     Wars program, as causes for tactical political gain. ``Young \n     people like space,'' he said.--The Washington Post, 1985)\n       The Strategic Defense Initiative is back. It's right there \n     in the Republicans' Contract with America--or, at least, in \n     the exegesis. The National Security Restoration Act, one of \n     ten bills the contract would bring to a vote by spring, \n     demands ``deployment at the earliest possible date'' of an \n     anti-ballistic missile defense. The Republicans haven't said \n     whether that means a space-based defense or a land-based \n     defense. Either way it means trashing the 1972 Anti-Ballistic \n     Missile Treaty, upping Pentagon spending by several billion a \n     year for research and upping it by much more when deployment \n     starts. Why aren't you excited?\n       A surprisingly large number of people are. The new SDI \n     comes with a new post-cold war rationale that has attracted \n     not just Republicans, but some centrist Democrats. Indeed, \n     research for a land-based SDI has stayed alive--if barely, \n     and under another name--during the Clinton administration. \n     Accelerated research and early deployment are thus a real \n     political possibility, even if space-based weapons are a long \n     shot. But before we make that leap, could somebody explain \n     why the post-cold war rationale deserves anything less than \n     the derision that finally overwhelmed the cold war rationale?\n       The cold war derision had two pillars. First, there were \n     firm doubts about technical feasibility. Nothing has since \n     happened to undermine them. The Pentagon's initial claim of a \n     96 percent success rate for the Patriot Missile against Iraqi \n     Scuds turned out to be fantasy.\n       Second, we realized that plain old deterrence worked just \n     fine as a missile defense; so long as Leonid Brezhnev could \n     count on tit for tat, he wouldn't attack. If anything, \n     indeed, a missile defense could weaken the perverse logic \n     behind deterrence by making mutually assured destruction less \n     assured; the ``protected'' nation might feel too nervy and \n     the unprotected nation too nervous.\n       Now, all of a sudden, we're told that deterrence won't \n     work. Why? Because now we face not coolly rational, game-\n     theoretical Soviets, but a different class of enemy: ``rogue \n     states''--Saddam Hussein's Iraq, Kim Jong Il's North Korea, \n     Muammar Qaddafi's Libya. How does one qualify as a ``rogue \n     state''? So far as I can tell, it helps if your leader (a) \n     doesn't have white skin, (b) dislikes the United States and \n     (c) does not behave in genteel fashion (often failing, for \n     example, to wear a necktie during affairs of state). The less \n     polite term for ``rogue state,'' and its real meaning, is \n     ``crazy state.'' But there is zero evidence that any of these \n     leaders is ``crazy'' in the relevant sense: suicidal. Quite \n     the contrary. Ronald Reagan gave Qaddafi the litmus test for \n     sanity and he passed: we bombed his house, and he modified \n     his behavior. Hussein has shown repeatedly that, once he \n     knows where the brink is, he doesn't step over it.\n       Bear in mind that a nuclear attack on the United States \n     would be more suicidal for these men than it would have been \n     for the Soviets. Brezhnev might conceivably have weathered a \n     firestorm and emerged from his bunker to inherit a world \n     destroyed. If Saddam Hussein tried that, he would be squashed \n     like a bug upon emerging. And he knows it.\n       Besides, if any ``crazy'' leader does want to blow up an \n     American city, there are SDI-proof ways: drive a bomb across \n     the Mexican border, sail it up the Potomac on a yacht or mail \n     it. For a seventy-pound package, second-day UPS costs less \n     than a ballistic missile.\n       Neo-SDI advocates also invoke fear of ``accidental \n     launch.'' But, as John Pike of the Federation of American \n     Scientists has written in this magazine, ``Lots of things \n     have to happen for a missile to fire. The chances of its \n     leaping unbidden from its silo are about the same as the \n     chances of a car starting itself up, opening the garage door \n     and backing out into the driveway without human assistance.'' \n     Besides, how many missiles are aimed at America these days? \n     Russia has agreed to point no missiles at us in exchange for \n     our reciprocal pledge. And whether or not you trust the \n     Russians, their own strategic logic argues increasingly for \n     aiming elsewhere (e.g., at other former Soviet states). \n     Similarly, North Korea's top two targets would be South Korea \n     and Japan. That's the way tensions are in the post-cold war \n     world: regionalized. The surest American defense against \n     ``accidental launch'' is to stay on good terms with Brazil.\n       Of course, however slight the chances of nuclear attack, \n     and however real the chances that a missile defense would \n     fail to repel it, a little insurance would be appealing if it \n     were cheap enough. First of all, it isn't cheap ($50 billion \n     assuming meager cost overruns). Moreover, ``insurance'' \n     conduces to solipsism; if we feel (however falsely) safe \n     inside our little shell, waning support for internationalism \n     will wane even faster.\n       I'm not saying the new SDI enthusiasm is driven by nascent \n     Republican isolationism. But the enthusiasm accommodates and \n     nourishes the party's isolationist strain. In the Republican \n     summary of the Security Restoration Act, only one goal gets \n     more prominent billing than SDI: ``to ensure that U.S. troops \n     are only deployed to support missions in the U.S.'s national \n     security interests.''\n       We all care about ``national security interests.'' But some \n     of us think that national security (in various senses) is \n     increasingly tied to global stability. The Republicans' post-\n     election rhetoric, in contrast, fixates on keeping U.S. \n     troops out of peacekeeping roles, keeping U.S. dollars from \n     supporting other peacekeepers and stifling the foreign aid \n     that helps stabilize places like Russia and the Middle East.\n       Also, of course, the Republicans don't favor one-worldish \n     projects like . . . well, like continued adherence to the \n     1972 ABM Treaty. And violating that treaty (which, alas, even \n     the Clinton administration's battlefield missile-defense \n     research program threatens to do) is itself a dangerous \n     retreat from internationalism. What's scarier than an Indian-\n     Pakistani border flanked by nuclear arsenals? An Indian-\n     Pakistani border flanked by destabilizing ABMs as well. We \n     might yet be able to head that prospect off, but not once \n     we've built our own shell.\n       The United States is now uniquely positioned to lead the \n     world in avoiding two bad things: a global race to build \n     destabilizing missile defense systems, and a global race to \n     carry destabilizing weapons into space--not just anti-missile \n     weapons, but anti-satellite weapons. The Republicans are now \n     on record as wanting to start the first of these races, and \n     they are clearly inclined to start the second. It's time for \n     President Clinton to crawl out of his bomb shelter, survey \n     the wreckage and start fighting.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/06/senate-section/article/S572-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S572-S573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         PERES ON DESALINATION\n\n Mr. SIMON.

Unfortunately, it got \ncaught up in the last-minute, partisan wrangling that had nothing to do \nwith the desalination bill, and it did not pass.\n  The need for it becomes more and more clear every day.\n  Recently, I had the chance to read responses of Israeli Foreign \nMinister Simon Peres to questions at the National Press Club Forum on \nOctober 4.\n  In response to a question by Jim Anderson of the German Press Agency, \nForeign Minister Peres said: ``If you want to save your children from \npoverty, pay attention to the water. The rivers do not follow the \nfrontiers and the rain doesn't go through the customs.''\n  Then, in response to another question from a reporter, whose name I \ndo \n[[Page S573]] not have, he said: ``There are projects that cannot be \npostponed.

The unfortunate reality is that desalination research has \nbeen minimal in recent years. When John F. Kennedy was President of the \nUnited States, he pushed it, but since that time, desalination research \nhas been almost on hold. It is critical that we move ahead, and the \nMiddle East is just one area where that is evident.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/06/senate-section/article/S572-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            BRITAIN JOINS AMERICANS IN ATTACKING TV VIOLENCE\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, we are slowly but solidly making \nprogress to reduce television entertainment violence in our country.\n  We still have a long way to go, but I came across an Associated Press \nitem reporting that even in Great Britain, which has much stricter \nstandards on television violence than we do, there is concern about \ntelevision violence.\n  I thought my colleagues might be interested in the Associated Press \nstory about violence on British television and some of the things that \nare happening there.\n  I ask that the Associated Press article be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  The article follows:\n\n            Britain Joins Americans in Attacking TV Violence\n\n       London.--British television concerned over the soaring \n     number of violent crimes in Britain, is moving to cut down on \n     the amount of violence and brutality shown on TV screens \n     here.\n       Both the British Broadcasting Corp. and the Independent \n     Television Commission announced changes last week.\n       The ITC told commercial TV companies to cut the amount of \n     violence they screen and said they will be monitored to \n     ensure they comply.\n       Among competitor BBC's revised guidelines for programmers:\n       Viewers should be given more information about what \n     programs contain before screening, so they can switch off if \n     they wish.\n       Programmers should have sharper awareness of portrayals of \n     sexual violence and violence against women.\n       U.S. programmers face a similar battle. The four U.S. \n     broadcast networks, hoping to head off government \n     intervention, have agreed to air parental warnings before \n     certain shows.\n       The BBC included no enforcement provisions in its \n     guidelines. But as a private network, financed by license \n     fees paid by viewers, it could simply edit out offending \n     segments or censor entire programs.\n       Companies who ignore the ITC guidelines can be reprimanded \n     or fined. The commission, established by Act of Parliament, \n     regulates Britain's Independent Television network.\n       David Glencross, chief executive of the ITC said in \n     announcing ITC guidelines Thursday. ``What we are seeing is a \n     public revulsion against violence in society which is feeding \n     through to a\n      desire for greater sensitivity by TV programmakers and the \n     makers of films and videos.''\n       ITC guidelines tell program-makers to consider carefully in \n     each case whether violent scenes are justified.\n       Programmers should not look at violent scenes in isolation \n     but consider the accumulation of such scenes on viewers.\n       Program-makers should avoid programming which ``appears to \n     promote violence as a solution to problems or difficulties.''\n       In the area of news, the guidelines note that ``violent \n     images are becoming increasingly available to news editors'' \n     and said TV news bulletins should take account of the time \n     they are to be shown.\n       The ITC guidelines say no proof exists that violence on TV \n     encourages violent crime in real life but state:\n       ``Caution is required in the television portrayal of \n     violence, given concern about the level of violence in \n     society and the possibility of behavior or attitudes being \n     influenced by what is shown on television. Broadcasters \n     should therefore be especially vigilant about the amount of \n     violence in their programs.''\n       Will Wyatt, managing director of BBC network TV, said in \n     announcing the BBC guidelines, ``We must ensure that where \n     violent scenes--in fictional programs or in news coverage--\n     are felt to be editorially necessary, they are included only \n     after careful and detailed consideration.\n       ``Although we cannot control what happens in the home, we \n     must ensure that before material is transmitted it is tested \n     for suitability for the time and place of its transmission--\n     or whether it should be transmitted at all.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/06/senate-section/article/S573-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S573-S574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         IN DEFIANCE OF DARWIN\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, no one doubts that the schools in \nour Nation should do better. What is still not widely known is that we \nreally do understand how to do better, but we're not applying the \nknowledge we have.\n  Education simply has not become enough of a priority. Those of us in \npublic life talk a good game, but too few of us do anything about it.\n  An illustration of what can happen is an article that appeared \nseveral weeks ago in Newsweek magazine titled ``In Defiance of \nDarwin,'' written by Lynnell Hancock.\n  I ask that the article be printed in the Record at this point.\n  The article follows:\n\n                     [From Newsweek, Oct. 24, 1994]\n\nIn Defiance of Darwin--How a Public School in the Bronx Turns Dropouts \n                             Into Scholars\n\n                          (By Lynnell Hancock)\n\n       It's a notorious corner in the South Bronx--once a grand \n     address, now the hub of the nation's poorest neighborhood. \n     Today, at 149th Street and the Grand Concourse, a public high \n     school for at-risk children defies Darwin on a daily basis. \n     Inside Hostos-Lincoln Academy of Science, a class of seniors \n     grapples with ``The Seafarer,'' an Old English poem about \n     danger, survival and destiny. None of these teenagers was \n     expected to ever navigate into the treacherous pages of \n     medieval lit. In fact, their eight-grade counselors had \n     written off most of them as probable dropouts, based on low \n     reading scores and spotty attendance. That's how they landed \n     at Hostos. Now, after four years here, more than 80 percent \n     are headed for college. And they engage in a lively \n     discussion about the sailor who believes his imminent death \n     at sea is a stark inevitability, written in foam. ``The \n     Anglo-Saxons thought every person's fate was predetermined,'' \n     the teacher, Vincent Sottile, reminds the class. ``But we \n     know we have to help ourselves.''\n       These 300 black and Latino students provide the basis for a \n     strong retort to ``The Bell Curve.'' Richard Herrnstein and \n     Charles Murray argue that IQ is largely genetic and that low \n     IQ means scant success in society. Therefore, they contend, \n     neither effective schools nor a healthier environment can do \n     much to alter a person's destiny. Yet, at Hostos, reading \n     scores nearly doubled over two years. The dropout rate is \n     low, and attendance is high. About 70 percent of the class of \n     1989 graduated on time, double the city's average. Among last \n     year's graduates, one was accepted at Columbia University's \n     School of Engineering. Others are attending Fordham \n     University and Hamilton College.\n       Hostos was established by the city seven years ago for \n     South Bronx children who live ``stressing lives,'' as one \n     student puts it, in broken families and dangerous neigh\n      borhoods that offer only huge, anonymous public schools. \n     Hostos is small, attentive to individual students, and \n     demanding. To ensure that no child goes astray, one \n     teacher is assigned for four years to the same homeroom \n     class, which combines lessons in rudimentary social skills \n     with those in computer and civics. Most students take \n     honors and even college-level courses. ``We threw out the \n     Mickey Mouse curriculum and introduced [University of the \n     State of New York] Regents-level courses,'' said Dr. \n     Michele Cataldi, Hostos's founder and principal. Where \n     students once had business math, they now have \n     trigonometry. ``At first we felt students couldn't do it, \n     but we were wrong,'' says Cataldi. Teachers worked \n     overtime to provide intensive one-on-one tutoring. The \n     results were impressive. The number of students in each \n     class who passed the state's regents biology test rose \n     from 9 to 50 percent in two years. ``You have to believe \n     in them,'' says Donna Light-Donovan, a biology teacher. \n     ``Most kids don't have anyone at home who does.''\n       Stanley Mustafa is one student who found a haven at Hostos. \n     A few years ago he was stabbed on the street by a \n     neighborhood teen. His life was saved by a trauma surgeon. \n     That's the profession he now expects to enter some day. ``It \n     made me grow up faster,'' says Mustafa, 17, dressed in baggy \n     jeans and an oversize Black Sheep T shirt. ``I don't want to \n     end up on the corner, hanging with the homeboys.'' He takes \n     chemistry and cellular biology at Hostos, studies radiology \n     at a local hospital and hopes to attend Atlanta's Morehouse \n     School of Medicine or the University of Virginia.\n       Nationwide, more and more districts are establishing small \n     ``restructured'' schools like Hostos that stress team \n     teaching, a familylike environment and high expectations. New \n     York City has more than 35 of them, with plans for about 50 \n     more. Herrnstein and Murray argue that 30 years of such \n     experimental schools for disadvantaged children have shown \n     paltry improvements, and that federal money should be \n     funneled away from them, and toward schools for the \n     ``cognitive elite.'' But a new study comparing 820 high \n     schools--some big and traditional, others small and \n     cooperative--proves otherwise. From eighth to 10th grade, \n     students in the restructured schools showed 30 percent higher \n     gains in math and 24 percent higher gains in reading compared \n     with students in traditional schools.\n                    [[Page S574]] high expectations\n\n       The study, commissioned by the Center on Organization and \n     Restructuring of Schools at the University of Wisconsin in \n     Madison, also found that the gap between the poor and those \n     who were not poor shrank in the more nurturing schools. \n     ``When high expectations for student learning are embodied in \n     the formal structure of the school, very positive effects can \n     occur for at-risk youth,'' says Anthony Bryk, director of the \n     University of Chicago's Center for School Improvement, one of \n     the report's analysts.\n       Yet in ``The Bell Curve'' scenario, most Hostos students \n     would give up their goals and find a valued place in \n     society'' back in the South Bronx. ``The idea that people \n     with the most capacity to be educated should become the most \n     educated sounds dangerously elitist,'' they write. In fact, \n     at 149th and the Grand Concourse, it sounds more like \n     ``Beowulf.'' ``Fate is more strong, God more mighty than any \n     man's thought,'' writes the anonymous Anglo-Saxon seafarer. \n     And students like Mustafa know they can help \n     themselves.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/06/senate-section/article/S573-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           DWAYNE O. ANDREAS\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I picked up the fall 1994 issue of \nthe publication, Constitution put out twice a year by the Foundation \nfor the U.S. Constitution in New York City.\n  The chairman of the foundation is Dwayne O. Andreas, the chief \nexecutive officer of Archer Daniels Midland [ADM] and a public-spirited \ncitizen who has been willing to come to the fore on many key national \nconcerns.\n  I opened the magazine to read a preamble by Dwayne Andreas, and it is \nso loaded with common sense that I ask that it be inserted into the \nCongressional Record at the end of my remarks.\n  Democracy can prevail only if citizens exercise self-restraint. We \ncannot see how close to the edge of the cliff we can come in exercising \nour freedoms.\n  What Dwayne Andreas calls civic responsibility is the obligation of \nthose of us in public office and of all American citizens.\n  An item he refers to later in the publication is good but is, \nfrankly, not as pointed as the Dwayne Andreas comment.\n  I urge my colleagues and their staffs to read Dwayne Andreas's \ncomments, which follows. At this point, I ask that Mr. Andreas's \nstatement be printed in the Record.\n  The statement follows:\n       The rights we enjoy as American citizens have been a \n     central focus of Constitution since we began publishing the \n     magazine in 1988. In this issue we present a Special Report \n     in which we consider the other side of the contract: the \n     obligations of citizens to their society.\n       These days, I sometimes wonder whether there is a \n     contract--whether we Americans recognize any limits on our \n     freedom to do as we please. We seem to have forgotten that \n     the Constitution guarantees our rights within society. \n     Increasingly, individuals and groups manifest a kind of ``in \n     your face'' contempt for the rights of their fellow citizens; \n     social obligations take a back seat to personal fulfillment \n     and economic gain.\n       Nowhere is this lack of civility more evident than in the \n     area of social expression protected by the First Amendment to \n     the Constitution. Brutality, obscenity and raw sex have \n     become the common coin of television, film and popular music; \n     all who question the fitness of these materials for a \n     generally youthful audience are derided as prudes or thought \n     controllers. And the purveyors of this destructive effluvium \n     assert their right to sell it; few dare to speak of society's \n     right to resist the tide.\n       But society does have that right, and I fear that those who \n     abuse the First Amendment in this way may be endangering the \n     splendid guarantee that has protected them for so long. Even \n     sober commentators like Irving Kristol worry about whether \n     the First Amendment can survive. Writing for the wall Street \n     Journal not long ago, Kristol labeled television violence a \n     form of child abuse and suggested that ``modest limits on \n     adult liberties ought to be perfectly acceptable if they \n     prevent tens of thousands of children from growing up into \n     criminal adults.''\n       Are such legislated limits truly necessary? I don't think \n     so. Rather what's required is recalling that there is such a \n     thing as civic responsibility--that with the rights of \n     citizenship go some obligations. To remind readers of these \n     obligations, we have prepared the Special Report that begins \n     on page 50. These pages carry a timely reminder. Ignoring it \n     could menace the guarantees about which this magazine has \n     written so much since it was founded six years ago.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/06/senate-section/article/S574-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S574-S575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       SENATORS DOLE AND DASCHLE\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as we all know, the 104th Congress \nconvened Wednesday and before we become too immersed in the legislative \nprocess, I want to take a moment to recognize the two leaders who will \nguide us through the next 2 years.\n  It has been my experience that some of the key qualities of a good \nleader are decisiveness, ability, commitment, integrity, and moral and \nphysical courage. The new majority leader, Senator Robert Dole, posses \nthose attributes and many more, and I am proud to call him my friend.\n  Bob's commitment to public service began in 1943 when he raised his \nright hand and enlisted in the U.S. Army as World War II raged at its \nheight. A natural leader, young G.I. Dole soon earned a commission and \nfound himself commanding a platoon in the famed 10th Mountain Division, \nwhich remains one of the Army's premiere combat units. During bloody \nand vicious fighting against the Germans in the rugged terrain of \nItaly, Bob was severely wounded twice and very nearly lost his life. \nThough decorated for his valorous acts in battle, Senator Dole carries \nwith him to this day a very noticeable reminder of the cost of liberty \nand of warfare. I am sure that each of use recognizes the disability \nthat Bob has overcome as a reminder that war, or the employment of \nmilitary force, is not a matter to be considered lightly, and that \nwhenever young Americans are placed in harm's way, they run the risk of \nbeing killed, wounded, or maimed.\n  In 1951 Bob was elected to the Kansas State legislature, beginning a \ncareer that ultimately brought him to this Chamber. His time in the \nstatehouse was quickly followed by a term as county attorney and then \nfour terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1968, Bob came to \nthe U.S. Senate and it was immediately apparent to me that he was a man \ndestined to go places. In the ensuring 27 years, I have been pleased \nand proud to watch Bob's career progress, as he served as the chairman \nof the Republican National Committee; as he was overwhelmingly \nreelected to the Senate four times; to watch him climb the Senate \nleadership ladder to the position he now holds; and, to see him \nnominated for the Vice Presidency of the United States in 1976. I have \nno doubt that the unbeatable combination of Senator Dole's drive and \nexperience, along with what just might be a strong streak of destiny, \nmay lead him to the White House before his career in public service \ncomes to an end.\n  Senator Dole has been leader of the Senate Republicans when we have \nbeen both the majority and minority party in this body and he has \ndistinguished himself well in both roles. While not everyone may agree \nwith Senator Dole's politics, they do respect the manner in which he \nconducts himself and the business of the Senate. Now that our party has \nonce again regained control of this body, I know that Senator Dole will \nwork closely with Members on the other side of the aisle to ensure that \nthey are treated fairly, and that the 104th Congress will be marked as \na period of progress, accomplishment, and bipartisanship. Bob Dole is a \nman I hold in high esteem and whose find friendship I value greatly.\n  As anyone of us who stood on this side of the aisle for the last 8 \nyears can tell you, being in the minority can be a frustrating \nexperience. With an effective leader, though, the minority party can \nplay an important role in the legislative process, not only \ncontributing to the debate, but strengthening bills passed by Congress. \nThe man whom the Democrats have elected as their leader, Senator Tom \nDaschle of South Dakota, is a person who I believe will be an effective \nvoice for Senate Democrats. Tom is no stranger to public service, as he \nspent time as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Air Force, as a \nvalued aide to a South Dakota State senator, and four terms in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives, where he held several leadership positions. \nAlthough Tom was just recently elected to the position of Democratic \nleader, he has been a distinguished member of this body for the past 9 \nyears. During his tenure, Senator Daschle has demonstrated himself to \nbe an able and effective legislator, working hard for his constituency \nin South Dakota. I have had the pleasure of serving with Tom on the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee and have found him to be a serious minded \nman and one of purpose. It was of little surprise to me that Tom rose \nto the important post he now holds. I have every confidence that he \nwill be an effective leader for our Democratic \n[[Page S575]] colleagues and I am equally confident that he will work \nwell with the Republican majority.\n  While many may believe that politics in the United States is based on \nan adversarial relationship between parties, each of us knows that it \nis a system which encourages and fosters compromise--that to actually \nlegislate, we must seek common ground. Senators Dole and Daschle are \ntwo men who are committed to ensuring that this body functions \nefficiently and effectively by seeking that point where Members can \nvote to pass a bill. I congratulate Bob and Tom on winning their \nleadership elections, and I look forward to working with both of them \nthroughout the duration of the 104th Congress.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/06/senate-section/article/S574-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr President, on Tuesday of this week, Sherry Stetson \nMannix died after a long and valiant battle with cancer. Mrs. Mannix's \ntitle was Foreign Affairs Specialist in the Bureau of Multilateral \nAffairs of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. But that does \nnot begin to describe her fine work or her life-long dedication to her \ncountry.\n  Mrs. Mannix served for 11 years as an officer in the U.S Air Force \nand then for another 9 years in the Air Force Reserve, achieving the \nrank of lieutenant colonel. She joined the Arms Control and Disarmament \nAgency in 1984 and became the Agency's premier expert on the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, which she helped to negotiate. Both before and \nafter the CWC was negotiated, Mrs. Mannix was the principal persons to \nwhom we and others turned when questions arose on how that very \ncomplicated convention would work.\n  During its consideration of the CWC last year, the Select Committee \non Intelligence, of which I was then vice chairman, submitted to the \nexecutive branch over 130 questions for the record regarding the \nChemical Weapons Convention. It was Sherry Mannix who answered many of \nthose questions and edited the others, even though she was already in \ntremendous physical pain due to the illness that she knew would soon \ntake her life. Those answers were so well-written and informative that \nwe actually published 64 of them, as an appendix to our committee's \npublic report, ``U.S. Capability to Monitor Compliance With the \nChemical Weapons Convention.'' Only rarely do we find such executive \nbranch answers so worthy of publishing, and only very rarely does any \nhuman being demonstrate the devotion to duty and country that Mrs. \nMannix did throughout the last year.\n  Sherry Mannix was only 44 when she died. If life were fair, we would \nhave enjoyed her company and her service for many more years. Instead, \nwe today offer our deep condolence to her husband, retired Air Force \nLt. Col. Charles R. Mannix, and to her mother, Albertie Stetson, both \nof whom reside in my State, as well as to her grandmother, Bernal B. \nAllen. And in remembering Sherry Mannix we say, Thank you for a job \nwell done and a life well lived, right to the very end.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/06/senate-section/article/S575-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    COMMENDING CHIEF ROBERT STEWART\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, South Carolina is probably the most \nidyllic place anyone might consider living. The pace of life there is \nrelaxed, the people are friendly, and the weather is temperate. \nUnfortunately, even a State as peaceful as mine is not free from the \nevils and dangers of crime.\n  Leading the fight against illegal activity in the Palmetto State is \nan organization created by me when I served as Governor of South \nCarolina, the State Law Enforcement Division, commonly referred to as \n``SLED.'' At the helm of SLED is a man whom I have had the pleasure of \nknowing for many years, Chief Robert M. Stewart, and whom I am pleased \nto call a friend. The chief has literally dedicated his life to police \nwork and has gained national recognition as an aggressive officer and a \ntrue professional.\n  Chief Stewart, a native of Cheraw, began his career as a teenager \nwhen he signed on as a cadet with his hometown police department and \nworked his way up the leadership ladder, earning the position of \ndirector of public safety before he had even turned 30. In 1975, he \nstepped down as director and joined SLED as a special agent. In the \nfollowing 20 years, his career advanced rapidly while he worked on \ncases ranging from those that were routine and mundane to ones that \nwere international in scope. A veteran of the SWAT team, Robert \nspecialized in white collar and public corruption cases, and worked \nclosely with Federal agencies investigating such crimes in South \nCarolina. In 1988, Gov. Carroll Campbell appointed Robert as the chief \nof SLED, where he has done an unparalleled job of administering the \nagency.\n  When he took over SLED, Chief Stewart's goal was to make it an \norganization that was recognized as being one of the most professional, \nprogressive, and modern law enforcement agencies in the United States. \nOver the past 7 years he has done just that. By regionalizing the \nagency, and streamlining its rank structure, Chief Stewart has ensured \nthat his agents are better able to monitor and address crime trends \nthroughout the State. Additionally, Chief Stewart secured a brand-new \nlab, that is not only used by SLED, but is available to any other \npolice department in the State of South Carolina. Thanks to the chief's \ncommitment and vision, last year SLED became only the second State \ninvestigative agency in the Nation to receive professional \naccreditation by the Committee on Accreditation of Law Enforcement \nAgencies.\n  Mr. President, Chief Stewart celebrates his 50th birthday today, and \nI want to take this opportunity to recognize and commend him for \ndedicating more than half his life to protecting the people and \nproperty of South Carolina. Chief Stewart is a man of great ability, \nintegrity, and courage, and I am proud of his many accomplishments. I \nwish him good health and happiness in the years ahead, and look forward \nto continuing to hear great things about him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/06/senate-section/article/S575-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S575-S576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n          UNITED STATES ARMS EMBARGO ON BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, 2 days ago I introduced legislation together \nwith the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, to \nterminate the United States arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina as of \nMay 1, 1995.\n  As I mentioned in my remarks at the that time, I believed that this \nlegislation was not only consistent with international law in upholding \nBosnia's inherent right to self-defense, but that it would also serve \nto provide some badly needed leverage for the Bosnians on the \ndiplomatic side.\n  I understand that today, Adm. Leighton Smith, commander of NATO \nForces in Southern Europe told reporters that he opposed this \nlegislation. I am not\n surprised that a four-star admiral would not oppose his Commander in \nChief, nor that a NATO commander would not choose to contradict the \nNATO-Secretary General.\n\n  I would note, however, that in addition to candidate Bill Clinton, \nthe following former high-level Government officials, including Cabinet \nmembers, have publicly supported lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia: \nZbigniew Brzezinski; Frank Carlucci; George \n[[Page S576]] Shultz; Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Wolfowitz; Richard Perle; \nand Max Kampelman--quite an impressive list. Moreover, I would \nemphasize that the late Manfred Woerner, the previous Secretary \nGeneral, advocated helping the victims of aggression, especially when \nthe international community does not have the resolve to take action on \nbehalf of that victim. That is surely the case in Bosnia.\n  It seems to me however, that the views that should be given the most \nweight, are those of the Bosnians. It is their country and their future \nwe are talking about.\n  And so, I would like to share two letters with my colleagues which I \nreceived from the President of Bosnia, Alija Izetbegovic, and from the \nBosnian Ambassador to the United Nations, Muhamed Sacirbey. Both \nletters strongly support the Dole/Lieberman bill. First I would like to \nquote from President Izetbegovic's letter to me:\n\n       The leadership of the United States of America is essential \n     in the search for peace in the Republic of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina. The legislation that you and Senator Lieberman \n     have offered is entirely supportive of peace efforts and the \n     continuing leadership of your country in this matter.\n       We wholeheartedly concur that the arms embargo should be \n     terminated ``de facto'' no later than May 1, 1995. By such \n     date the preliminary agreement on the cessation of \n     hostilities would have expired and by then the Serbians would \n     have opted to accept the contract group peace plan or to \n     continue the war. We believe that this legislation would be \n     most pivotal not only in confronting international aggression \n     and acts of genocide against our Republic, but also in \n     encouraging the Serbians to opt for peace.\n\n  The letter from Ambassador Sacirbey states the following, and I \nquote,\n\n       We wish to reiterate our full support for congressional \n     efforts, in particular S. 21, to terminate the application of \n     the U.S. arms embargo on the Government of the Republic of \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina * * * The elements of your proposed \n     legislation are in complete convergence with our views. We \n     are also of the opinion that this legislation is entirely \n     consistent with the search for peace in our country * * *\n\n  We need to keep things in perspective. The strains within NATO have \nnot been caused by congressional efforts to lift the embargo, but the \npresent policy itself. The credibility of the alliance has been damaged \nbecause NATO has allowed itself to become a subcontractor to the United \nNations. The only way to reverse this situation is for the United \nStates to reassert its leadership in support of a better policy. The \nClinton administration was on the right track in May 1993, it is now \ntime to get back on that track.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters I referred to \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Permanent Mission to \n           the United Nations,\n                                        New York, January 4, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader: We wish to reiterate our full support \n     for Congressional efforts, in particular S. 21, to terminate \n     the application of the U.S. arms embargo on the Government of \n     the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We must also express \n     our sincere appreciation for these efforts and our admiration \n     for the thoughtful manner by which this matter has been \n     guided by you. The elements of your proposed legislation are \n     in complete convergence with our views.\n       We also are of the opinion that this legislation is \n     entirely consistent with the search for peace in our country \n     and the congressional intent established during the debate on \n     this issue during the previous Congressional session. The \n     United States delegation to the United Nations, under the \n     capable and faithful direction of Ambassador Madeleine K. \n     Albright, had ``tabled'' a draft resolution within the \n     Security Council to lift the arms embargo on our Government. \n     Unfortunately, this resolution met resistance from some key \n     nations in the Council, although it has never been put to a \n     vote. In fact, our efforts to facilitate a consensus on this \n     matter through flexibility were misconstrued and have not met \n     with a positive response.\n       We believe that U.S. leadership in bringing an end to this \n     unjust arms embargo continues to be an essential element in \n     ending this international aggression and acts of genocide \n     against my country.\n       Once again, thank you for your leadership regarding this \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Muhamed Sacirbey,\n     Ambassador and Permanent Representative.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Office of the \n           President of the Presidency,\n                                                  January 5, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader: The leadership of the United States \n     of America is essential in the search for peace in the \n     Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
