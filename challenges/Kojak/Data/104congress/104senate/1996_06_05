Mr. President, I rise to talk about why I believe every \nMember of this Chamber should support the unconditional extension of \nmost-favored-nation trading status to the People's Republic of China. \nAs we are all aware, Senator Dole declared his support for \nunconditional extension of MFN for China sometime ago. More recently, \nthe President announced he would renew China's MFN status \nunconditionally for another year.\n  Now the matter comes before the Congress. We have to decide whether \nor not Senator Dole's position and the President's decision deserve our \nsupport. The Chinese, of course, have not made this issue easy for us. \nTheir destabilizing nuclear, chemical, and missile sales, their \ncontinued nuclear testing, their assertiveness in the South China Sea, \ntheir growing trade surplus with the United States, their piracy of our \nintellectual property, their military threats against Taiwan, their \nmoves to undermine democratic reforms in Hong Kong, and their abuses of \nhuman rights, these all demand a stern reply.\n  That is why it is tempting to revoke China's MFN status. But it would \nbe a huge mistake to do so. I say this for four reasons.\n\n  First, revoking MFN would put at risk hundreds of thousands of \nAmerican jobs, and billions of dollars worth of American exports and \ninvestments.\n  Second, revoking MFN is an ineffective weapon that would not solve \nany of the problems we have with China. Indeed, revocation may make \nthem worse.\n  Third, more proportional, targeted measures currently available \npermit a more effective response to these problems.\n  Finally, extending MFN is fundamental to developing a coherent China \npolicy--one that sets priorities and provides a strategic framework for \nthe conduct of our relations with that important country. Mr. \nPresident, the United States, East Asia, and the entire world have much \nto gain from a positive relationship between Washington and Beijing and \nmuch to lose from an unnecessarily confrontational one.\n  Before going into more detail about these four points, I believe it \nnecessary to clarify the meaning of the term, ``most-favored-nation \ntrading status.'' That's because the term gives the false impression \nthat MFN is some sort of special privilege or reward.\n  The term even confuses our most prestigious newspapers. In their \nstories on the President's announcement to renew China's MFN status, \nthe Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post,\n\n[[Page S5782]]\n\nthe New York Times, and the Los Angeles Times all incorrectly described \nMFN as a ``privilege'' or in some way preferential or favorable.\n  In fact, MFN is not a special privilege or reward. It designates the \nmost ordinary, most normal trading relationship among countries. \nSpecifically, MFN refers to the uniform tariff treatment that the \nUnited States applies to virtually every country in the world.\n  For example, if the U.S. tariff on imported clock radios is 5 \npercent, all clock radios imported from countries with MFN status are \nsubject to a 5-percent tariff. Imports from countries that do not have \nMFN status--and there are only six countries that fall into this \ncategory--are subject to far higher duty rates.\n  Another important point about MFN is that it is not a one-way street. \nWhen we give MFN status to a particular country, that country, in \nreturn, gives the United States most-favored-nation status.\n  Therefore, because we give Singapore MFN status, the clock radios we \nimport from that country are subject to the same tariff rates as clock \nradios from Thailand, Spain, or any other country to which we extend \nMFN.\n  In return, when Singapore imports our computer chips, it imposes the \nsame tariff on United States chips as those imported from Japan, Korea, \nGreat Britain, or any other country to which it extends MFN.\n  What does the United States get out of all this? American companies \nget to compete on fair and equal terms with their foreign rivals.\n  Let me emphasize again: MFN status does not confer--let alone imply--\nspecial treatment.\n  In fact, when we decide to give special treatment to imports from \nother countries--as Congress has expressly chosen to do for certain \nproducts from over 130 nations--those imports are subject to tariff \nrates substantially below the MFN rate. Sometimes we even allow \nspecified countries to export products to the United States duty free.\n  In short, MFN status denotes the standard, not the exceptional, \ntrading relationship. Ending this standard trading relationship by \nrevoking MFN is an extreme measure. In fact, because MFN is so \nfundamental to trade relations among countries, some correctly liken \nits withdrawal to a declaration of economic war.\n  These are the facts about MFN. Anyone who maintains that we do China \na special favor when we renew its MFN status is either misinformed or \ndisingenuous.\n  Because of the confusion created by the phrase, ``most-favored-nation \ntrading status,'' I am working with Senator Moynihan to replace the \nphrase in U.S. statute with a more suitable term, one that underscores \nthe unexceptional nature of the MFN concept. I believe that if we adopt \nsuch a change in terminology, we will all better understand the issue, \nand our debate will be more constructive.\n  Now, I want to stress that those who favor MFN renewal, such as \nmyself, share most, if not all, of the same goals as those opposed to \nMFN renewal.\n  We, too, want Beijing to cease its destabilizing nuclear, chemical, \nand missile sales. We, too, want China to end its nuclear testing. We, \ntoo, want China to resolve peacefully its territorial disagreements in \nthe South China Sea. We, too, want China to lower barriers to U.S. \nexports and reduce its trade surplus with the United States. We, too, \nwant China to end its piracy of our intellectual property. We, too, \nwant China to end its military threats against Taiwan and resolve its \ndifferences with Taipei peacefully. We, too, want China to follow \nfaithfully the dictates of the Sino-British Declaration on Hong Kong. \nWe also want China to cooperate with us in addressing serious global \nconcerns such as environmental degradation, transnational crime, and \nnarcotics trafficking. And we, too, want China to respect the basic \nhuman rights of its citizens.\n  Where we differ from the opponents of MFN is on how to achieve these \ngoals.\n  The simple fact is that there is absolutely no evidence that the \ndrastic action of withdrawing MFN will force China to satisfy any of \nour objectives. Indeed, sanctioning China by withdrawing MFN runs the \ngreat risk of making that country more belligerent and less cooperative \non these and other issues.\n  Keep in mind that experience shows that unilateral trade sanctions \ngenerally don't work. The chances of success only improve when \nsanctions are applied in cooperation with our major allies. However, \nnot one of these allies--not Canada, not the European Union, not Japan, \nnot Australia--is debating whether to withdraw MFN status from China. \nThat's because they all know withdrawal is neither a constructive nor \neffective option for inducing the Chinese to change their behavior. In \naddition, they understand the tremendous cost of withdrawing MFN \nstatus, a cost we ignore at our peril.\n  Let's be clear on this point. If we revoke MFN for China, Beijing \nwould certainly be hurt, but so, too, would the United States.\n  As a result of withdrawing MFN, United States duties on goods \nimported from China would immediately rise to the tariff rates \nestablished under the highly protectionist, Depression-era Smoot-Hawley \ntariff law. Chinese imports, which currently face an average tariff \nrate of 6 to 8 percent, will be subject to an average tariff rate of 40 \nto 50 percent, with the tariff rates for certain items exceeding 100 \npercent.\n  Because MFN is provided on a reciprocoal basis, China would respond \nto higher tariffs on its goods by slapping higher tariffs on United \nStates goods. Such a move will slam the door shut on United States \nexports to the Chinese market--the fastest growing market in the world. \nThese U.S. exports totaled almost $12 billion in 1995 and supported \napproximately 200,000 high-skilled, high-wage American jobs in critical \nsectors such as the aircraft, telecommunications, and automotive \nequipment industries.\n  Business conducted by United States companies in China will go \ninstead to the Europeans, the Japanese, the Canadians, and firms from \nall the other countries in the world which continue normal commerical \nrelations with China.\n  In addition to severely damaging United States exporters, the small \nand large American firms that have invested billions of dollars to \npenetrate the Chinese market would see their efforts and investments \ngravely jeopardized.\n  Some claim, of course, that in the event China's MFN status is \nwithdrawn, those billions of dollars of United States investments in \nChina will be brought back to the United States. The reality is, \nhowever, that United States companies forced out of China are far more \nlikely to move those investments to other developing countries in Asia \nor Latin America.\n  The economic fallout from withdrawing China's MFN status is not only \ngoing to hit American companies, but also American consumers. Our \nlowest income citizens, in particular, would suffer from the \ndramatically higher prices they will have to pay for a variety of basic \ngoods as a direct result of the imposition of substantially higher \nduties on Chinese imports.\n  Mr. President, some claim that pricing Chinese goods out of our \nmarket through higher duties would be beneficial. They maintain that we \nwould eliminate our trade deficit with Beijing because the products we \nnow import from China would be produced in the United States.\n  Let us be realistic. It is a mistake to think that most of what we \nimport from China would be produced in the United States. The truth is \nthat in most cases imports from other developing countries would be \nsubstituted for imports from China.\n  Moreover, it does not make any sense to try to reduce the trade \ndeficit by ending all trade, as would likely happen if we revoke \nChina's MFN status. You may get a balance of trade--zero imports and \nzero exports--but at a cost of hundreds of thousands of good, high-\npaying U.S. jobs and billions of dollars of U.S. exports.\n  The only way to reduce the trade deficit and retain American jobs and \nexports is to ensure that United States products have the same access \nto the Chinese market that Chinese products have to ours. This is not \nan easy task. But revoking normal trade relations with China would make \nit impossible.\n  While I believe the threat to United States jobs and exports alone \nprovides a convicing reason to support renewal of China's MFN status, \nthere are other\n\n[[Page S5783]]\n\ncompelling arguments for unconditional renewal.\n  In particular, cutting ourselves off from China by withdrawing its \nMFN status will end any ability the United States has to directly \ninfluence developments in China, including how China treats its \ncitizens and whether it permits the development of a freer society and \nmore democratic political system.\n  United States businesses help advance human rights and civil society \nin China by being there, not by leaving or by being shut out. United \nStates companies operating in China observe basic worker rights in \ndealings with their local employees. United States companies provide \nChinese citizens with opportunities unheard of before China began to \nopen its economy and society to the outside world in 1978. United \nStates companies teach their Chinese employees the valuable lessons of \nAmerican business culture, including independent decisionmaking and \nenterpreneurial skills.\n  Among other reasons, that's why Martin Lee, the Hong Kong legislator \nand human rights advocate; Hong Kong Gov. Chris Patten and Wei \nJingsheng, the prominent Chinese dissident who has suffered for so long \nfrom state persecution, all support renewal of MFN for China.\n  Moreover, that is why the Taiwanese--who are not shy about voicing \ntheir opinions on China to Members of Congress--have not advocated \nrevoking MFN. And that's why the countries of the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations, four of whose members have territorial \ndisputes with China, have not come to Capitol Hill to press the United \nStates to revoke China's MFN status.\n  Mr. President, I think that it is the height of arrogance for \nopponents of MFN to assert that they know better than Martin Lee, Wei \nJingsheng, the Taiwanese, and the countries of ASEAN, how to change \nChina's behavior.\n  Indeed, as they know, there is ample evidence that the mere threat of \nrevoking MFN will make China less cooperative and more confrontational.\n  For example, several weeks ago, China announced for the first time \nthat it would buy several billion dollars worth of passenger jets from \nthe European consortium, Airbus. This action was a deliberate \nrepudiation of Boeing, meant to send us the message that revocation of \nMFN will result in costly economic retaliation.\n  Shortly thereafter, in an action designed to send us a signal on the \nsecurity implications of recklessly confronting Beijing, China struck a \ndeal with Russia to develop a long-term strategic partnership.\n  These actions indicate some of the problems and consequences we would \nface if we use the sledge-hammer approach of revoking MFN.\n  Keep in mind that the President already has specific, measured and \ntargeted tools at his disposal that allow him to address our problems \nwith China without resorting to the indiscriminate and destructive \napproach of revoking MFN.\n  For example, we are currently preparing to hit China with trade \nsanctions on $2 billion worth of specified Chinese imports because of \nBeijing's failure to honor its agreement with the United States to \ncrack down on Chinese companies making pirated knock-offs of American \nmusic, movies, and computer software.\n  Similarly, we can invoke targeted section 301 sanctions for other \ndiscrete discriminatory and unreasonable Chinese trade practices.\n  When China illegally sells nuclear technology, we can apply sanctions \nwhich are specified by the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act.\n  We can counter China's threats to Taiwan by considering sales of \nupgraded defensive weaponry to Taipei, as well as by reaffirming our \nunwavering commitment to a peaceful resolution of the dispute between \nTaiwan and China in the context of our one-China policy, a policy which \nhas been supported by each of our last six Presidents.\n  We can rely on international law and the shared interests of the \ncountries of Southeast Asia to counter aggressive Chinese territorial \nclaims.\n  And we can continue to expose and condemn China's repressive human \nrights record in this Chamber and in organizations around the world.\n  The range of tools available to respond to specific problems with \nChina is considerable. At the same time, however, their breadth reveals \na fundamental weakness in our overall approach to our relations with \nBeijing--the absence of an effective, broadly based, clearly \narticulated and carefully coordinated China policy that sets priorities \nand guides our use of these tools.\n  I agree with those who say that the rise of China presents us with a \nserious foreign policy challenge. But it also presents us with enormous \nopportunities. We can only respond to that challenge adequately and \nseize those opportunities through a sensible overall China policy, one \nthat enhances the chance of creating a positive bilateral relationship. \nThe clear objective of that policy should be to encourage China's \nconstructive and responsible behavior and discourage aggressiveness and \nirresponsibility.\n  The absence of a coherent China policy results in large measure from \nshort-sighted political considerations. For example, the 1992 Clinton \ncampaign rhetoric about coddling dictators in Beijing left the Clinton \nadministration little room to maneuver on China policy. Early on, the \nPresident indicated he would link human rights issues to the MFN \ndecision. The following year, however, he was forced to reverse himself \nand announced the two issues would not be linked.\n  Similarly, in 1994, the Clinton administration refused Taiwan \nPresident Li the ability to play a round of golf in Hawaii while in \ntransit to Costa Rica. But in 1995, the administration granted him a \nvisa to visit Cornell University immediately after telling the Chinese \nit would not do so because such an act would violate our one-China \npolicy.\n  These and other mixed signals from the administration, as well as the \ncacophony of voices from Capitol Hill on how to deal with China, have \nleft the United States with a dangerously muddled China policy.\n  Without question, if the United States had a better sense of its \npriorities and aims in the United States-China relationship, and a \nclearly articulated China policy that reflects those priorities, we \nwould be better able to influence Chinese behavior. Moreover, the tools \nwe currently have available to respond to Chinese misconduct would be \nmore effective when used in the context of a coherent China policy.\n  In brief, I believe such a policy must have four central elements. \nFirst, we must expand our economic relationship with Beijing, because a \nChina integrated into the global economy is more likely to behave in \nways more compatible with American interests and international norms. \nThus, we should seek to encourage China's development and participate \nin its economic growth. That's why I assign importance to China gaining \nentry into the World Trade Organization based on commercial \nconsiderations and GATT principles.\n  The more China is integrated into the international economy, the more \nsubject Beijing is to the harsh realities of the marketplace. Should \nChina choose a path toward blatant aggression and destabilizing \ndomestic repression, foreign investment will dry up and firms will move \nto other countries where the risks are lower and the returns are \nhigher.\n  Moreover, we have a better opportunity to influence China to act in \nways we prefer when we enmesh it in the sort of economic relationships \nfostered by most-favored-nation trade status. Renewing MFN thus is \nabsolutely central to an effective China policy.\n  In addition, the economic growth fostered by participation in the \nglobal economy almost inevitably leads to greater demands for \ndemocratic reforms. Other Asian countries, such as South Korea, Taiwan, \nand Thailand, have amply demonstrated the political evolution that \naccompanies economic development.\n  The second element of a coherent China policy is the resumption of \nhigh-level, regular dialog with China. I was delighted to see that in \nhis speech on China 2 weeks ago, Secretary Christopher accepted Senator \nDole's suggestions on this matter. After all it has been 7 years since \nan American President went to Beijing for summit talks, and 8 years \nsince a Chinese leader has been in this country for a summit. Mistrust \nis bound to grow when we do not\n\n[[Page S5784]]\n\nmeet, particularly when the list of critical bilateral, regional, and \nglobal issues requiring discussion is so long.\n  Third, we must nurture aspects of the relationship where we share \ninterests and can cooperate for our common good. For example, China \nplayed a useful role in bringing relative peace and stability to \nCambodia. Moreover, China has the potential to play a key role in \nsettling the serious threat posed by North Korea to the South, as well \nas the 47,000 American troops we have on the ground there. I cannot \nenvision Beijing cooperating with us on North Korea if we revoke \nChina's most-favored-nation trade status. Indeed, I cannot imagine the \nChinese playing a constructive role on any matter of mutual \nimportance--from protecting the environment to controlling \ntransnational crime and narcotics trafficking--if we simply continue to \nthreaten and sanction them.\n\n  The fourth element of any coherent China policy must include \npreparedness to deal with China if its participation in world affairs \nproves disruptive. Strengthening our current array of bilateral \nsecurity ties in Asia is thus essential. In addition, I believe we must \nlook more closely at the possibility of creating effective regional \nsecurity arrangements.\n  Closer cooperation on security and diplomatic initiatives with \nnations in the Asia Pacific that share our interests on China would \nserve to prod Beijing to accept the moderating influence of global \neconomic integration. It would also provide a hedge in the event \nBeijing instead chooses a more aggressive path.\n  In sum, continued economic relations with China, high-level dialog, \ncooperation with China on matters of mutual concern, and strengthened \nsecurity and diplomatic ties with the rest of Asia should, in my \nopinion, form the basis of any effective China policy.\n  Mr. President, some claim that the decision we face on renewing MFN \ncan be reduced to a question of whether ``our lust for trade exceed(s) \nour loathing of tyranny.''\n  This argument is disingenuous and the question is simply wrong. The \nright question is whether taking the draconian step of revoking China's \nMFN status is worth the potentially huge cost to the United States, \nespecially when this action has an extremely remote chance of achieving \nits aims. I await a response to this question from the opponents of \nChina's MFN renewal.\n  Mr. President, I must stress again that the United States, East Asia, \nand the entire world have much to gain from Washington and Beijing \nachieving a positive relationship, and much to lose should bilateral \nrelations further deteriorate unnecessarily. Renewing MFN for China is \nonly a step--but an extraordinarily important one--toward building a \nfruitful bilateral relationship. Therefore, Mr. President, I urge my \ncolleagues in the strongest possible terms to support unconditional \nrenewal of MFN for China.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee has so clearly stated, discussions of American \nforeign trade policy are increasingly bedeviled by the use of an 18th \ncentury term, most favored nation, to describe trade agreements reached \nwith other nations. The most favored nation involved is not the nation \nwith which we are negotiating, but rather a third nation altogether \nwhich happens to have the lowest tariff, or whatever, with respect to \nsome product or other. The United States agrees to give to country X \nwhatever terms are the best terms it gives to some third country. \nWhichever that might be.\n  This issue arises for the simple reason that the last tariff schedule \nenacted by statute was the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, with the \nhighest tariff rates, overall, in American history. In response to the \ndisaster that followed the Roosevelt administration began a series of \ntrade treaties entered into as executive agreements. This arrangement \ncontinues to this day. As a result, nations entering the Western \ntrading regime, which is to say, in the main, former or current \nCommunist nations, must receive the treatment accorded under the GATT \nor the WTO, or else Smoot-Hawley. Granting the former status is no sign \nof favor, simply of normal trade relations.\n  For more than two centuries this has been our practice, but only \nrecently has the term caused public misunderstanding. What we mean is \nthat we will confer on country X normal trading relations. The time has \ncome, then, to say so. We grant country X normal trade relations (NTR) \nin return for country X treating us in the same manner. Which is to \nsay, NTR.\n  Just last month the Finance Committee acted on legislation to grant \npermanent most-favored-nation treatment to Bulgaria and Cambodia. \nYesterday, the Trade Subcommittee held a hearing regarding Romania's \nMFN status, and tomorrow the committee will hear witnesses speak to \nquestions surrounding the granting of most-favored-nation treatment to \nChina. If one read the headlines, one might believe these four \ncountries to be the most important in all of American trade policy.\n  But not at all. As the chairman has just said, MFN treatment is not \nspecial treatment. Countries to which we grant this supposed most \nfavored treatment are not, in fact, the most preferred in our trade \nrelations. When we undertake an obligation to provide most-favored-\nnation treatment to another country, we simply agree to give that \ncountry the same treatment that we give the great majority of our \ntrading partners. The rationale is that, if every country observes this \nprinciple, all countries will benefit in the long run through the \nresulting more efficient use of resources.\n  Indeed, there is no single most favored nation in our trade policy. \nAs noted in a 1919 report to the Congress by the U.S. Tariff \nCommission, now the U.S. International Trade Commission,\n\n       It is neither the purpose nor the effect of the most-\n     favored-nation clause to establish a ``most-favored nation;'' \n     on the contrary its use implies the intention that the \n     maximum of advantages which either of the parties to a treaty \n     has extended or shall extend to any third State--for the \n     moment the ``most-favored''--shall be given or be made \n     accessible to the other party. . . . ``Reciprocity and \n     Commercial Agreements,'' United States Tariff Commission, \n     1919.\n\n  In fact, over time, we have developed a great variety of relations \nwith our trading partners. We have agreed to free trade with Canada, \nIsrael, and Mexico. We offer special benefits to countries of the \nCaribbean and Andean regions. We have a longstanding policy of duty-\nfree treatment for imports from developing countries under the \nGeneralized System of Preferences. If one really wants to identify a \nmost favored country, one certainly must take note of these \nrelationships, which are all more advantageous than general most-\nfavored-nation treatment.\n  MFN is a principle from the past. The concept has been traced to 12th \ncentury arrangements between trading cities of the Mediterranean and \nthe Arab princes of North Africa, although the phrase most-favored-\nnation did not appear until the end of the 17th century. In United \nStates law, the principle was first recognized in the 1778 commercial \ntreaty between the United States and France, stating:\n\n       The Most Christian King and the United States engage \n     mutually not to grant any particular favor to other nations, \n     in respect of commerce and navigation, which shall not \n     immediately become common to the other party. . . .\n\n  Thereafter, an MFN clause became a standard element of treaties of \nfriendship, commerce, and navigation, the early formal bilateral \neconomic treaties of the United States. In essence, this was our \nmechanism for assuring fair and equal treatment for the trade of the \nUnited States. Over time, an ever-lengthening chain of commercial \nagreements, incorporating the MFN obligation, reduced barriers and \nincreased trade. Ultimately, this basic principle was adopted in 1947 \nas the central obligation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and \nTrade--article I, part I of the ``GATT 1947''. It continues central to \nthe World Trade Organization created in 1994--article I, part I of the \n``GATT 1994''.\n  But, as the GATT has been succeeded by the WTO, so it is time to \nconsider a successor term to MFN. A term that recognizes that, in the \nmodern world, it is the norm, not the exception, to treat our trading \npartners equally. Senator Roth and I, along with Senator Chafee, would \npropose for the Senate's consideration a more accurate term--``normal \ntrade relations.'' Shortly, we will introduce legislation changing U.S. \nlaw, as necessary and appropriate.\n\n[[Page S5785]]\n\n\n\n             THE NATO ENLARGEMENT FACILITATION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I have long been a supporter of the \ntransatlantic community of nations and its cornerstone institution, \nNATO. And today I wish to express my support for the NATO Enlargement \nFacilitation Act of 1996--extremely important legislation which I also \ncosponsor.\n  This bill is designed specifically to support and foster the careful, \ngradual extension of NATO membership to the nations of Central and \nEastern Europe. If passed, this bill would direct tangible assistance \nto the efforts of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary to join the \nalliance. These nations are the most prepared of their region for the \nresponsibilities and burdens of NATO membership.\n  Equally important, it is the intent of the authors of this bill to \nassist other Central and Eastern European countries whose economies and \ndemocracies have sufficiently progressed to move forward toward \neventual NATO membership.\n  Such a policy is absolutely necessary to ensure that NATO's \nacceptance of Polish, Czech, and Hungarian applications for membership \nnot create new divisions in Europe, but is instead part of an inclusive \nand on-going process that will extend to the entire community of \nEuropean nations.\n  Extending the alliance's membership to Poland, the Czech Republic and \nHungary, will help transform Central and Eastern Europe into a \ncornerstone of enduring peace and stability in post-cold-war Europe. It \nwould do so for the following reasons:\n  First, the NATO enlargement would project security into a region that \nhas long suffered as a security vacuum in European affairs. History has \nrepeatedly shown us that the strategic vulnerability of Central and \nEastern Europe has produced catastrophic consequences--consequences \nthat drew the United States twice this century into world war.\n  Second, NATO enlargement would help facilitate the economic and \npolitical integration of Central and Eastern Europe into the \ntransatlantic community of nations. Passage of our NATO enlargement \nlegislation would demonstrate America's commitment to consolidating an \nenlarged Europe. This would give more incentive to all the nations of \nthe region to continue their political and economic reforms by \ndemonstrating that these reforms do result in tangible geopolitical \ngains.\n  By projecting stability into Central and Eastern Europe, NATO \nenlargement would reinforce the regional stability necessary for \nnations to focus on internal political and economic reform. Mr. \nPresident, security is not an alternative to reform, but it is \nessential for reform to occur.\n  Third, two great European powers, Germany and Russia, are now \nundergoing very complex and sensitive transformations. Their futures \nwill be significantly shaped by the future of Central and Eastern \nEurope. Extending NATO membership to nations of this region will \nreinforce the positive evolutions of these two great powers.\n  In the case of Germany, NATO enlargement would further lock German \ninterests into a transatlantic security structure and further \nconsolidate the extremely positive role Bonn now plays in European \naffairs.\n  The extension of NATO membership to Central and East European nations \nwould also be of great benefit to Russia. By enhancing and reinforcing \nstability and peace in Central and Eastern Europe, NATO enlargement \nwould make unrealistic calls by Russia's extremists for the \nrevitalization of the former Soviet Union or the westward expansion of \nRussian hegemony. Greater stability along Russia frontiers will enable \nMoscow to direct more of its energy toward the internal challenges of \npolitical and economic reform.\n  This point is too often forgotten in this debate. There has been too \nstrong a tendency in United States policy to overreact to outdated \nRussian sensitivities. This overreaction comes at the expense of \nstrategic realities and objectives central to the interests of the \nalliance, as well as to the United States.\n  I would also like to note that this NATO enlargement legislation \nreflects the attitudes of many of our parliamentary counterparts in \nEurope. The North Atlantic Assembly, a gathering of legislators from \nthe 16 nations of NATO, adopted at the end of 1994, my resolution \ncalling for the extension of membership in the alliance to Poland, the \nCzech Republic, and Hungary.\n  Mr. President, America's defense and security must be structured to \nshape a strategic landscape that enhances economic, political, and \nmilitary stability all across Europe. Careful and gradual extension of \nNATO membership to nations of Central and Eastern Europe is a critical \nstep toward this end. This is in our national interest. It is action \nlong overdue, and it is the intent of the NATO Enlargement Facilitation \nAct of 1996.\n  For these reasons, I call upon my colleagues in the Senate, as well \nas President Clinton and his administration, to embrace this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] is \nrecognized to speak for up to 40 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/05/senate-section/article/S5781-6", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5785-S5788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RACE FOR THE CURE\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I will not take 40 minutes, but I am very \npleased to be joined by colleagues in the Chamber today in recognizing \nthe 1996 national Race for the Cure. The race, which will take place \nthis year on Saturday, June 15, is a unique opportunity to bring \ntogether the many people whose lives have been touched by breast \ncancer.\n  This year, Capitol Hill has an opportunity to play a tremendous role \nin this race. Today is the first on-site Capitol Hill registration, and \ntoday is also the beginning of something very special in this race. For \nevery Capitol Hill participant who registers, the company Eli Lilly has \ngenerously offered to match their registration fee in the form of a \ndonation to Race for the Cure. So for every individual who signs up to \nparticipate, your contribution to the race will be doubled. In other \nwords, one can really make a difference here and have that difference \namplified.\n  For all those who are unfamiliar with Race for the Cure, the race is \na 5-kilometer run or, in my case, walk that raises money for breast \ncancer research and for early screening for underprivileged women in \nunderserved communities in the District, Maryland, and Virginia. The \nrace also allows a new generation of women to be made aware of the \nrisks associated with breast cancer. Although we still do not have a \ncure, we do have screening devices which can increase the early \ndetection that prolongs life. Education and awareness is one of our \nstrongest weapons in the fight against breast cancer.\n\n  Today in America, 500 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. \nMost likely, each will be frightened, uncertain of her future, and in \nsearch of a treatment that, if it cannot cure her, will at least \nprolong her life. Each woman's family and friends, coworkers, and \ncaregivers will worry deeply about her.\n  Today in America, 150 women will die of breast cancer. Their lives \nwill be ended prematurely, their family, friends, coworkers and \ncaregivers will be grief-stricken. Listen to the enormity of the \ndisease: Fully one out of nine women in this country will get breast \ncancer, one out of nine women. Since 1960, nearly 1 million women have \ndied from this disease. With their deaths, millions of their loved \nones, including children and aging parents dependent upon them, have \nsuffered as well. We stagger under these numbers, even as we search for \nthe causes and for a cure.\n  All women are at risk for breast cancer, with the incidence \nincreasing among older women and the mortality rate higher for African \nAmerican women. While other factors that may put a woman at risk are \nbeing thoroughly investigated, we are still, ourselves, at risk for \nfeeling helpless in the face of this killer. I speak about this with \npersonal experience. In 1992, my own wife contracted breast cancer. \nErnestine had a mastectomy and chemotherapy for 6 months. As I sat and \nwatched the devastating impact of chemotherapy on her body, I thought \nto myself, 100 years from now people will look back and maybe consider \nthis treatment like the leeches of the 18th century, it is so \ndevastating. She persevered. It was a trauma for our whole family. It \nwas, for me, the moment\n\n[[Page S5786]]\n\nthat I realized that sometimes catastrophe can overtake the best laid \nplans and that every day has to be lived to its fullest because one \ncannot take tomorrow for granted.\n  That is kind of the secondary benefit of this whole experience, \nlearning that every day must be lived to the fullest extent possible \nbecause one does not know about tomorrow. But one thing my wife feels \nvery strongly, having come out of the treatment with flying colors, \nbeing cancer-free now for over 3 years, is that she does not consider \nherself a victim of breast cancer. She considers that she has triumphed \nover breast cancer. Early detection and more research for a cure will \nallow millions of other women to have that feeling as well; that they, \ntoo, have triumphed over breast cancer.\n  So, remembering that the women who battle this disease are our wives, \nsisters, mothers, daughters, and friends, I am proud to join the \nestimated 30,000 other runners, walkers, rollerbladers and wheelchair \nparticipants, who will participate in the Race for the Cure on June 15. \nToday I ask all of my colleagues and the staff who work on Capitol Hill \nto consider participating in the race on June 15. There are already 55 \nregistrants from the Bradley office. Last year I think we were No. 1. \nRegistration is simple. In-person registration is available for all \nHill participants today. Let me repeat that. Registration is available \ntoday at the Reserve Officers Association Building, which is on the \ncorner of First Street and Constitution, right across from the Hart \nOffice Building.\n  Registering for the race will be one of the easiest tasks you can do \ntoday. Frankly, participating in the race on June 15 will be one of the \nmost rewarding. If you have not done it, I urge you to do it. It will \nbe a morning that you will not forget, and your efforts could really \nmake a difference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from New Jersey \nfor setting aside the time this morning to talk about the issue and the \ncommitment that we have to conquering breast cancer, which is the \nlargest killer of women between the ages of 35 and 54 in this country. \nI thought it was poignant to hear my colleague, Senator Bradley, talk \nabout this issue not only as a women's health issue, which it very much \nis, but as the family issue that it is. He talked about the fact that \nthere was a trauma in his whole family. Of course there was. This is a \ndisease that affects men, it affects children and families as well as \nthe women in this country.\n  Two of the leaders in the Senate on this issue have been Senators \nwhose wives have had breast cancer, Senator Bradley and Senator Mack of \nFlorida. I am pleased they have taken this leadership role and joined \nwith all of the women in the Senate--eight of us, soon to be nine--that \nall have had instances in our families or among our friends of women \nwho have had to battle this terrible disease, one which I think we are \non the cusp of solving. I thank the Senator from New Jersey and the \nSenator from Florida and all the women who have come together to \nunderstand the importance of conquering breast cancer.\n  I want to talk a little bit about my own history with the Komen \nFoundation. The history of the Komen Foundation is written on this \npiece of paper. It says, ``In 1982 Nancy Brinker established the Susan \nG. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation with only a few hundred dollars of \nher own and a shoe box full of friends' names.''\n  Mr. President, my name was in Nancy Brinker's shoe box. I was one of \nthose that Nancy called together to put on the first Race for the Cure \nand the first luncheon in Dallas, TX, in 1983. I was a friend of Nancy \nBrinker, who is one of the most extraordinary people I have ever known. \nI will say that this history of the Komen Foundation grossly \nunderestimates Nancy's monetary commitment, her time commitment, and \nher number of friends. She had friends all over the United States as \nwell as in Dallas, because she was such a giving person.\n  Because she had the experience of sitting with her 36-year-old sister \nwho died of breast cancer before her very eyes, she made the commitment \nto her sister at that time that she would spend her life trying to \neducate and research this issue so this would not happen to other \npeople. So, 13 years later, I never thought I would be standing on the \nSenate floor, talking about the Race for the Cure in Washington, DC, \nbut in fact that is exactly what has happened. This has spread like \nwildfire, because so many families in this country are affected by \nbreast cancer and, frankly, because we have not done enough to \nhighlight and focus on the research that is necessary to beat this \ndisease.\n  In the last 2 years, I want to point out, Congress has been committed \nto promoting women's health care issues. Breast cancer research and \nfunding has increased over 10 percent per year in the last 2 years. The \nNational Institutes of Health funding for breast cancer has increased \nover the last 2 years, and last year Congress directed the National \nCancer Institute to set aside a portion of its budget to be used for \nresearch grants and projects to further the national action plan on \nbreast cancer.\n  We developed the National Women's Health Information Clearinghouse in \n1995 and 1996, and Congress appropriated $2.1 billion for the space \nstation, which is the sole environment possible for studying certain \naspects of breast and ovarian cancer and osteoporosis.\n  A lot of people do not realize that you cannot create the antigravity \nconditions in space on Earth. You cannot do it. So the space station \nhas given us a new outlet to look at breast and ovarian cancer cells \nand to look at the bone loss in osteoporosis, all three of which are \nunique to women.\n  Osteoporosis is not exclusively a woman's disease, but it does hit \nwomen the hardest. These are best able to be studied in the \nmicrogravity conditions in space. That is one of the reasons why I am \nso committed to the space station and the importance of space station \nresearch for getting to these women's health issues that we have not \nbeen able to conquer heretofore.\n  So I commend the Komen Foundation for all they have given to save \nlives in this country. Let's talk about the way that they have saved \nlives. Just by their education efforts, they have told women all over \nour country of the importance of self-examination for early detection, \nbecause we find many times women can detect, before they even go for \ntheir annual mammogram, that they have a lump that they need to have \nchecked out. This is, in fact, what saved Nancy Brinker's life. Because \nshe had been so educated in the need for early detection because of the \ndeath of her sister, Susan G. Komen, it did save her life. But Nancy \nhas gone on with the Komen Foundation to save thousands of women's \nlives because they now know the importance of an annual mammogram after \nthe age of 35 and the importance of self-examination. This is the most \nimportant thing the Komen Foundation has done.\n  But in addition to this, the Komen Foundation has also provided \nmillions of dollars for research through their luncheons and their \nraces for the cure for breast cancer. The research funding goes \ndirectly to the doctors who are trying to discover what causes breast \ncancer so that we can find the cure.\n  So the Susan G. Komen Foundation, which started only 13 years ago, \nand which is going to have its annual Race for the Cure in Washington, \nDC, has done so much, as well as the hundreds of thousands of \nvolunteers who come to the races, who pay their entry fee, who \nvolunteer to help coordinate the races, have really given to this \nproject of trying to find the cure for breast cancer.\n  I want to say that the Vice Presidents of the United States have been \na very big part of this. Vice President Dan Quayle and his wife, Mrs. \nQuayle, started by highlighting and focusing the Washington Race for \nthe Cure. I am proud to say that Vice President Al Gore and his wife, \nTipper, have continued that tradition, and they will be leading this \nyear's Race for the Cure in Washington.\n  This just helps us bring in the 25,000 people who are now going to \nrun in the Race for the Cure, and all of this money goes to heightening \nthe awareness of women about the need for early detection, and it goes \nto the research that will get to the cause of this dreaded disease so \nthat we will be able to find the cure.\n\n[[Page S5787]]\n\n  I am very proud to say that this is a woman's issue upon which all of \nus can agree. We must find the cure, and I commend the thousands of \nvolunteers around this country who have taken up the cause.\n\n  I will just add that I had a wonderful experience this past Saturday \ndoing the start of the Race for the Cure in Plano, TX. It just does \nyour heart good to see the women who wear the pink visors. The women \nwho wear the pink visors are the breast cancer survivors, and they have \nthe number of years since they had detected breast cancer put on their \nvisors. There were a number of those out there, and there were the \npeople who wear the tags on their bags that said, ``I am running in \nmemory of my mother,'' ``my grandmother,'' ``my sister.'' The men and \nwomen who run are generally running with spirit and heart because they \nhave been affected in some way by this disease.\n  I was able to witness the women's 5K, and the men's 5K, and then the \nchildren's 1K. We had toddlers who were still in their strollers. We \nhad toddlers who were barely walking. But we had a spirit out in Plano, \nTX, that is something I see every time I attend a Race for the Cure.\n  So I urge my colleagues to participate on June 15. I urge anyone in \nAmerica who has not been to a Race for the Cure to go to one. If you do \nnot have one in your hometown, start one. This is a cause upon which we \ncan all agree and something that will bring us together and eventually \nsolve this dreaded disease that affects the women, the men, and the \nchildren in families across America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. AKAKA addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise with others of my colleagues in the \nSenate in support of the sixth annual National Race for the Cure, which \nwill be held in Washington, DC, on Saturday, June 15, this year.\n  Race for the Cure, as has been noted, is a breast cancer benefit run \nsponsored by the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. The \nfoundation was established in 1982 by Nancy Brinker in honor of her \nsister who died of breast cancer at the age of 36.\n  Since its creation, the foundation, through events such as Race for \nthe Cure, has raised millions of dollars to promote education, promote \nawareness, promote research, and promote early detection of the \ndisease.\n  Three-fourths of the money raised goes toward local treatment and \nscreening activities, while one-fourth of the funds goes to the Komen \nFoundation to fund national research activities.\n  The statistics on breast cancer remain startling, Mr. President. This \nyear, an estimated 44,000 women in our country will die from breast \ncancer, and another 184,000 will be diagnosed with the disease. I \ncontinue to have great concern over the high incidence and low survival \nrates for this disease among minority and low-income women. I remain \nparticularly concerned that the Native Hawaiian women have the highest \nincidence of breast cancer among all racial and ethnic groups in this \ncountry.\n  While the cause of breast cancer remains unknown and the disease is \nnot fully understood, significant advancements have been made in the \nmanagement of breast cancer. As with many of the life-threatening \nillnesses, early detection of breast cancer, coupled with appropriate \nand timely followup, remains the most effective method to ensure \nsuccessful treatment and improved survivability. However, Mr. \nPresident, much work remains. Many women do not know how to conduct \nself-examinations, and many would benefit from a screening mammogram. \nSome of them do not seek it because of fear, because of cost or even \nbecause of lack of access.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues and their staff \nand families to participate in the 1996 National Race for the Cure. All \nof us have families or friends who have battled breast cancer.\n\n  In particular, this sixth annual race has special meaning for those \nof us in the Senate. This year's race is dedicated to the memory of \nMartha Moloney, a longtime aide to Senator Wendell Ford who lost her \nvaliant fight against breast cancer last November.\n  Continuing the fight against breast cancer is the most appropriate \nway to honor Martha's memory and to recognize the heroic efforts of \nmillions of women and their families confronting this disease.\n  Mr. President, this is one of those dreaded diseases in our country. \nWe all need to support the race 100 percent and participate in all of \nthese activities.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues this morning in \nexpressing support for the National Race for the Cure. I want to \nacknowledge and salute the Senator from New Jersey, Senator Bradley, \nfor encouraging us to take a few moments this morning to focus on this \nvery important issue.\n  It is particularly appropriate for those of us in Congress to \nacknowledge the importance of battling this disease. We represent a \nwide variety of constituencies across this great Nation, and in so \ndoing we bring to this Chamber particular regional beliefs and \nattitudes. But unlike the people that we represent, breast cancer is a \nproblem that knows no geographic boundaries.\n  It does not stop at congressional districts or at State lines. All of \nus, regardless of where in the Nation we hail, need to acknowledge the \ntoll that breast cancer is taking on women throughout the country and \nindeed across the world.\n  A brief look at some statistics should give us all reason to pause. \nBreast cancer is the leading cause of death for women between the ages \nof 35 and 54. One in eight women in the United States will develop \nbreast cancer. Three-fourths of those women have no known risk factors, \nthus making accurate and adequate detection efforts a must for all \nwomen.\n  In Idaho we are fortunate enough to be well below the national age-\nadjusted average for incidences of breast cancer. Despite this, every \nyear approximately 700 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in \nIdaho. In 1994 alone, 155 women lost their lives against this disease, \nagainst this killer.\n  There is, however, some light at the end of the tunnel. The Federal \ninvestment in breast cancer research prevention and treatment has \nincreased dramatically in recent years. This has helped us move closer \ntoward discovering what causes the disease.\n  We are also able to detect breast cancer sooner and thus improve \nsurvival rates for those stricken with the disease. When caught early, \nthanks to the research to date, the prognosis for recovery is very \npositive. Increased education and mammography screenings are just two \nof the things that we can do to make that survival rate even higher in \nthe future.\n  I would like to acknowledge those who are working so diligently to \nmake the National Race for the Cure a success. Those who are \npublicizing the event, those who are registering participants, and \nthose who will take part by either running in the race or by providing \nsupport and services to the runners.\n\n  On a personal note, I would like to thank my wife Patricia for her \nefforts in building Team Idaho's role in the Race for the Cure. \nPatricia and I have been blessed in that our families have not had to \nface breast cancer. But my wife lost both of her parents to various \nforms of cancer, including her mother when Patricia was only 6 months \nold. Because of this, my wife Patricia has committed herself to doing \nwhat she can to see that other children will not face the loss of a \nmother at such a tender age.\n  As we get closer to the actual date of the race, I encourage all \nSenate offices to do their part to help this tremendous cause. Capitol \nHill registrations will be taking place for the next 2 days. The \nregistration fees and donations will play a significant role in our \nwork against breast cancer. At the same time, the heightened awareness \nabout breast cancer generated by the Race for the Cure will hopefully \nencourage earlier detection and treatment.\n  On Saturday, June 15, Team Idaho will be there to do its part to \nfight\n\n[[Page S5788]]\n\nbreast cancer. My wife Patricia, our daughter Heather, son Jeff, \nnumerous dear friends, and great staff will be there as Team Idaho \njoins with so many other participants in our efforts in this Race for \nthe Cure to find the ultimate cure for breast cancer.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/05/senate-section/article/S5785-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL RACE FOR THE CURE\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, first, let me thank all my colleagues that \nhave been on the floor this morning making statements relating to the \nRace for the Cure and the effort that is being made in that interest in \neradication of breast cancer. I also thank the Chair today for his work \nthis morning and his support. We are all very grateful.\n  Mr. President, as many may know, last year a loyal and trusted member \nof my State, Martha Maloney, passed away after a long battle with \ncancer. Martha had been with my office for 18 years, so you will \nunderstand when I say she was like part of the family to me. Over the \nyears, I had the privilege to see her develop her legislative skills, \nhaving a hand in numerous historic legislative achievements and working \non airport projects all across the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  Martha's bravery in fighting breast cancer inspired a 200-member team \nto participate in last year's National Race for the Cure on behalf of \nbreast cancer. They ran and walked the 5K's because they were ``doing \nit for Martha.'' She was able to be there. She was able to see their \neffort and was very pleased.\n  Now, Mr. President, this year's race, to be held on June 15, will be \ndedicated in her honor. That is why I stand here today. Martha had long \nbeen a strong supporter of breast cancer research, and proceeds from \nthe National Race for the Cure will go to the Susan G. Komen \nFoundation, the Nation's largest private funder of breast cancer \nresearch, education, screening, and treatment.\n  Over 26,000 participants and sponsors in last year's event raised \nover $650,000 that went to local hospitals and health care \norganizations. Preliminary figures show this year's run will double, if \nnot triple, that amount. Already, $1.4 million has been collected or \npledged. I, like many with me in this Chamber today, think this is very \nsignificant. For that reason, we introduced a resolution designating \nJune 15, 1996, as ``National Race for the Cure Day.''\n  With over 35,000 runners, walkers, even in-line skaters expected, \nthis year's race will be a resounding success. Many people will \ncontribute to the success of the National Race for the Cure. I would be \nremiss if I did not tip my hat to the U.S. Postal Service for its \ncooperation in releasing 100 million breast cancer stamps nationwide on \nJune 15. The pink ribbon on the new stamp, and the cheers of all those \nwho line the Race for the Cure course, will not only pay tribute to the \nmany who silently suffered in the past, but also serve as a promise to \nstand firmly committed to those battling the disease today and to \ncommend all of our resources so there might be no casualties in the \nfuture.\n  Along with the breast cancer stamp, the Postal Service will launch a \nnationwide effort to make post offices in every community centers of \ninformation and understanding about this disease. Brochures and \nvideotapes explaining the importance of self-examination and annual \nmammograms will be on hand in every post office across this great land. \nPostal employees will be provided with facts about breast cancer they \ncan share nationwide.\n  I also would be remiss if I did not point out that the Commonwealth \nwill host its first Race for the Cure on October 26. Mr. President, \n1,000 Kentuckians are expected to make that run, joining 340,000 \nparticipants in 64 other cities across the country.\n  Mr. President, I attended the State convention of the postmasters in \nKentucky just this past Monday. They have an individual that is in \ncharge of the overall operation. I think this is true in most States. \nHopefully, there will be more than just one race in Kentucky. We are \nhoping for 35 to 40. If other States will do similar events, I can \nalmost feel a tidal wave coming in the amount of money that can be put \ninto research and hopefully expedite the day that the answer to this \ndevastating cancer can be found.\n  I want to encourage my colleagues and their staff to be one of those \nwalkers or runners to support this worthy cause in any way they can. \nThere is a mother or a daughter or sister who will be very thankful you \ndid.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/05/senate-section/article/S5788-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5788-S5789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL RACE FOR THE CURE DAY\n\n  Mr. FORD.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 257) to designate June 15, 1996, as \n     ``National Race for the Cure Day.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I join my distinguished colleagues in \nurging all of our colleagues, their staff, families, and friends, to \njoin the thousands of individuals who will participate in this year's \nRace for the Cure. In years past, my wife and I have eagerly joined the \nthrongs of people of all ages who run or walk, are pushed in strollers \nor push themselves in wheelchairs, who share one common goal: helping \nto raise money so that a cure can be found for the disease that has \ntaken the lives of nearly 1 million of our sisters, daughters, wives, \nand mothers during the past 35 years. This has been one of the most \nimportant events in which we have participated over the years.\n  Since 1992, I have fought for increased funding for breast cancer \nbecause as lawmakers, it is our responsibility to provide the tools \nresearchers need to find a cure. Many of us find ourselves fighting \nthis insidious disease in our daily jobs, as lawmakers, scientists, \nresearchers, doctors, and advocates. But as a husband, father, and \nfriend, this race has been another way for me to show my support of the \nurgent need to stop the spread of breast cancer, of the courageous \nwomen who fought this disease and won, and finally, to honor the strong \nwomen who were simply unable to overcome the power of this disease.\n  I hope that everyone will heed the messages presented on the floor of \nthe Senate and participate in this important event.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am proud to be here again this year, \njoining my colleagues in the Senate to talk about the National Race for \nthe Cure. This important event underscores the critical need to raise \nawareness about breast cancer, and the need to support research and \neducation about this frightening disease.\n  We have heard the numbers and seen the statistics. Each year breast \ncancer strikes 184,000 women, and kills an estimated 45,000. Far too \nmany have died from this disease, and the list includes many of my own \nfriends and relatives. We all can agree that more must be done to \neducate women about the risks, prevention, and treatment of breast \ncancer. I can tell you that, as a woman, the mixed messages we receive \nare frustrating and dangerous.\n  We hear conflicting advice about when to have a mammogram--one year \nit's at age 40 then next it's at age 50--we need consistent, accurate \ninformation or else women will continue to die. Studies show that early \ndetection and proper treatment could save the lives of 9 out of 10 \nwomen with breast cancer--that's 90 percent, Mr. President. These \nnumbers are too serious to ignore.\n  We must do all we can to encourage education and awareness about how \nwe can protect ourselves and our daughters from the tragedy of breast \ncancer. For this reason, the Race for the Cure is so very important; \nthe D.C. race is\n\n[[Page S5789]]\n\nthe largest 5-kilometer race in the country--35,000 participants are \nexpected to run, walk, and roller blade this year. This is a day to \ndraw national attention to this disease; throughout the year races will \nbe taking place in cities across the country to turn the spotlight on \nthis critical women's health issue. Of course 1 day is not enough, but \nit's a good place to start and it's an important reminder for all of \nus.\n  I want to encourage my colleagues to participate, as well as people \nall over the country. As it happens, today and tomorrow are Capitol \nHill registration days. I am proud to say my office has put together a \nteam and will be participating in the race. I urge everyone to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank Senator Bradley \nfor his passionate and personal commitment to addressing women's health \nissues. I appreciate his leadership and dedication to supporting the \nNational Race for the Cure.\n  I also want to briefly thank Senator Ford for submitting the \nresolution to designate June 15 ``National Race for the Cure Day.'' I \nam proud to join him as a cosponsor of this resolution and for \nrecognizing the importance of the Race for the Cure in the battle \nagainst breast cancer.\n  Breast cancer, while predominantly a woman's health issue, does \naffect men and it certainly can devastate an entire family. We must do \nall that we can to protect ourselves and our families from having to \nendure the tragedy of this disease. The National Race for the Cure is \nan ideal way to join the fight against breast cancer. I thank my \ncolleagues for recognizing that.\n\n\n           No Backsliding on Finding a Cure for Breast Cancer\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nexpressing support for an increased effort to find a cure for breast \ncancer and for the Race for the Cure which will take place on June 15.\n  Every 3 minutes an American woman is diagnosed with breast cancer.\n  Every 12 minutes an American woman dies of breast cancer.\n  Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. \nThe incidence is rising each year.\n  This year, 184,300 new cases will be diagnosed and 44,300 women will \ndie from breast cancer. In California this year, 17,100 new cases of \nfemale breast cancer will be diagnosed and 4,100 California women will \ndie.\n  Even though the Federal Government has spent almost $1.5 billion on \nbreast cancer research in the last 20 years and Federal funding has \nquadrupled since 1990, we still do not have a cure. The annual race is \nan important event, bringing public attention to the need to continue \nthe drive. It gives us all a way to keep up the momentum toward a cure.\n  Breast cancer is not just a woman's disease. It also can afflict men. \nIn addition, when a woman has breast cancer, her whole family is \naffected. Everyone must cope with the trauma, physical, and \npsychological.\n  Women today must sort through many confusing messages. There is \nconfusion about who should have a mammogram and how frequently. There \nis confusion about treatment options, like mastectomy versus \nlumpectomy, radiation versus chemotherapy.\n  To help families better understand the disease, their options and \nresearch trends, the Senate Cancer Coalition which I chair with Senator \nMack, is holding a hearing on June 13 from 1 to 4 p.m. in room 106 \nDirksen. Experts will discuss the controversies surrounding frequency \nof mammograms and treatment choices. We will look at what the Federal \nresearch dollar has accomplished and the direction research should now \ntake. We will examine the obstacles families face in getting good \ninformation and making informed decisions.\n  Breast cancer is a devastating disease. I commend my colleagues for \ncoming to the Senate floor today to express their concern and to stress \nthe importance of continuing the Federal research race for the cure. \nThis is an important role the Federal Government can play and one in \nwhich I am proud to participate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the resolution and preamble \nare agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 257) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 257\n\n       Whereas breast cancer strikes an estimated 184,000 women \n     and 1,000 men in the United States annually;\n       Whereas breast cancer will kill 44,300 women in the United \n     States alone this year;\n       Whereas breast cancer is the leading cause of death for \n     women between the ages of 35 and 54;\n       Whereas death rates resulting from breast cancer could be \n     substantially decreased if women were informed about the \n     risks of contracting the cancer and if they receive \n     mammograms on a regular basis;\n       Whereas the Race for the Cure is dedicated to eradicating \n     breast cancer through providing funding for research, \n     education, treatment, and screening for low-income women;\n       Whereas throughout the year, almost 340,000 participants in \n     65 cities across the United States (including the first-time \n     host cities of Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Cheyenne, Sacramento, \n     Battle Creek, Baton Rouge, and Louisville) will join together \n     in Races for the Cure to demonstrate their commitment to \n     fighting breast cancer;\n       Whereas the National Race for the Cure in Washington, D.C., \n     is the largest 5 kilometer race in the country, with over \n     35,000 walkers, runners, and in-line skaters expected to \n     participate this year; and\n       Whereas the Seventh National Race for the Cure is to be \n     held on Saturday, June 15, 1996, in Washington, D.C.: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates Saturday, June 15, \n     1996, as ``National Race for the Cure Day''.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I wanted to take a few minutes here to \nbring the Senate up to date on the severe drought that we are \nexperiencing in all of the Southwest, but particularly in my home State \nof New Mexico, and also to urge action on a bill that I introduced with \n14 cosponsors recently--the Temporary Emergency Livestock Feed \nAssistance Act of 1996.\n  Last week, in Roswell, NM, the newspaper called the Roswell Daily \nRecord contained a joke of sorts. It said that a rancher placed five \ncalves in a pen because he could not afford to feed them. He knew that \nthey would not fetch much if he tried to sell them. He put a sign on \nthere saying ``free calves.'' He came back the next day and found 20 \ncalves in the pen. This a joke, but unfortunately, in New Mexico, the \ndrought is no laughing matter. The precipitation levels in my State, \nthrough the end of May of this year, are 60 to 80 percent below normal.\n  In the Albuquerque Journal on May 26, it profiled a ranch owned by \nShirley Porter. One of the lines of the story summed up the \ncircumstances that she faces and says, ``She does not need to worry \nabout gates anymore. There is nothing here to get loose. Shirley \nPorter, who is a rancher in San Jon, on the east side of New Mexico, \nsold every last one of her 139 cows, calves, and bulls at a livestock \nauction in Clayton, NM. She was given a total of $30,204.63 for all of \nher livestock. She had come to this ranch as a bride right after high \nschool. And now, at the age of 67, she was forced to liquidate. She was \nquoted as saying, ``I am not going to grieve for them''--that is, the \nlivestock--``because if I had kept them, they would have starved to \ndeath.''\n\n[[Page S5790]]\n\n  Every part of New Mexico is affected by this drought, and much of the \nrest of the Southwest as well. In one part of New Mexico, farmers are \npredicting that they will obtain about 1 bushel per acre of wheat. \nUsually the yield is about 45 bushels per acre. To keep the livestock \nalive, ranchers are forced in some cases to burn the thorns off prickly \npear cacti to give their cattle a little food. Ranchers are having to \nsell off cattle just to pay the interest on the loans that they have, \nand, of course, the cattle market is flooded. Calves that would have \nsold for $125 a year ago now are selling for $10 to $20.\n  Fireworks in my State have been banned by our State Corporation \nCommission statewide from now through the 18th of the month. I think \nthey are going to consider extending that ban assuming no rain is \nforthcoming; 22 of 33 counties have been declared disaster drought \nareas.\n  Let me refer to some charts that I have here, Mr. President, to make \nthe point even more graphically. I think these are hard for anyone to \nsee from a distance, but perhaps the coloration of the charts will make \nthe point.\n  As I understand, the Weather Service's main indicator for drought \nareas--severe drought--is the so-called Palmer Index. When you look at \nthe Palmer Index for the country as a whole--this is valid through the \nend of March 1996--you can see that much of my State or the majority of \nmy State even by the end of March was listed in a severe or extreme \ndrought condition. Here again is the drought severity index. This is \nthe long-term Palmer Index, which shows the bright red area, which \nshows most of my State and, of course, most of the Presiding Officer's \nState of Arizona listed again as severe or extreme drought. Much of \nNevada and California as well as much of the Southwestern part of the \ncountry is affected.\n  On U.S. precipitation rankings, again from the Weather Bureau, you \ncan see that extremely dry is the bright orange area through the entire \nState of New Mexico and much of the rest of the Southwest as well. This \nfinal chart is one which tries to show the severity of the fire danger. \nAs of May 3, 1996, again it shows virtually all of New Mexico and all \nof Arizona and much of Texas, Colorado, Utah, California, and Nevada.\n  So this is a serious problem, Mr. President.\n  What I have proposed and what many have joined me in proposing is \nSenate bill 1743, the Temporary Emergency Livestock Feed Assistant Act \nof 1996. The bill would give immediate assistance to ranchers if \npassed. We now have 14 cosponsors of that legislation as of last count. \nWe would be putting the livestock feed program back into effect with \nthis legislation for a 1-year period. The program was suspended in the \nrecently enacted farm bill. This proposed legislation would extend the \nprogram through 1996.\n  Under the bill, producers who have suffered at least a 40-percent \nloss of feed production would be able to apply for assistance through \ntheir local farm service agencies. The livestock eligible would be \ncattle, sheep, and goats. The old program was funded through the \nCommodity Credit Corporation. We do not propose to do that again. S. \n1743 targets $18 million from the Cottonseed and Sunflower Seed Oil \nExport Assistance Program. I am informed that this is money which is \nnot expected to be used this current year. It is money that was \nappropriated but will not be used for that purpose because the need is \nnot there.\n  In addition, the Department of Agriculture has a stockpile of grain. \nThe stockpile, of course, is referred to as the Commodity Reserve \nProgram.\n  I was encouraged to see that there is a resolution that now has \npassed the House and which is expected to be considered here in the \nSenate very shortly to urge the Secretary of Agriculture and the \nPresident to go forward with use of that Commodity Reserve Program. \nThat is another part of the legislation that we introduced calling on \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to report back as to what portion of those \ncommodities could appropriately be used to provide assistance to these \nranchers.\n  Mr. President, this is a serious problem. It is not one that has been \nshort-lived. We have been living with the drought now for many months \nin the Southwest. Unfortunately, the situation seems to continue. Each \nof my calls back to New Mexico, regardless of what subject I call to \ndiscuss with people there, begins with a discussion about the drought \nand the lack of rainfall.\n  I hope very much that the Senate and the Congress as a whole will go \nahead and act on this Temporary Emergency Livestock Feed Assistance \nAct. I have talked to the chairman and ranking member of the \nAgriculture Committee and asked them to give attention to this, and \nhopefully we can take action on this in the next few weeks before we \nadjourn for the Fourth of July recess.\n  This is the kind of constructive act that I think would encourage \npeople in their view of the Congress. There is, of course, a tremendous \namount of politics being played in Washington these days on all sides. \nEveryone knows that. We are looking for things that we can agree upon \nand constructively pursue. In my view, enactment of this Senate bill \n1743 should be one of those actions that we could take on a bipartisan \nbasis which would help the people that we are sent here to represent.\n  Mr. President, I urge consideration of this. I encourage any of the \nother Senators or their staffers who may be watching or hearing the \ndiscussion today who would like to cosponsor the legislation to do so. \nLet me read off a short list of 14 cosponsors before I conclude my \nremarks.\n  On the Democratic side, Senators Daschle, Baucus, Dorgan, Exon, and \nHarkin are cosponsors; on the Republican side, my colleague, Senator \nDomenici, Senator Gramm of Texas, Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, \nSenator Inhofe, Senator Kyl, Senator Pressler, Senator Hutchison, and \nSenator Kassebaum are cosponsors.\n  I think this is clearly a bipartisan effort to deal with a very real-\nlife, immediate situation. I hope very much we can take action on this \nin the next week or two so that relief of some sort at least can be \nprovided before the July 4 recess. I will be looking for opportunities \nto move this legislation forward. We cannot legislate rain, but we can \nlegislate relief to assist those who are suffering because of the \ndrought.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/05/senate-section/article/S5789-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5790-S5791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF OLD STURBRIDGE VILLAGE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this Saturday marks the 50th anniversary \nof Old Sturbridge Village in Sturbridge, MA, where our Nation's past \ncomes alive for large numbers of visitors each year.\n  In 1995, over 500,000 people--including 110,000 schoolchildren--\nvisited Old Sturbridge Village and enjoyed its workshops, performances, \narts and crafts programs, and numerous special events. The American \nAssociation of Museums has described the village as a ``model living \nhistory museum. The historic structures and their interpretation \ncombine to offer visitors an experience that is authentic, instructive, \nand enjoyable. Education programs at Old Sturbridge Village set a very \nhigh standard for others to aspire toward . . . [and] deserve to be \nemulated in our profession.''\n  Old Sturbridge Village has accomplished a great deal since it first \nopened to the public in 1946. It was originally established through the \nphilanthropy of Albert Wells and J. Cheney Wells, two brothers who \nowned and operated the American Optical Company in Southbridge, MA. The \nWells brothers were passionate collectors of American antiques. When \ntheir collections outgrew their homes, they came up with the idea of \ndisplaying them in a working village that would recreate the \noccupations of early 19th century New England for future generations.\n  Today, Old Sturbridge Village stands on a 200-acre tract of farmland \nand meadows donated by the Wells brothers, complete with a Federal-era \nmansion, a working sawmill and gristmill, and over 40 buildings that \nhouse their collections of antiques. Visitors who walk along the \nvillage's unpaved roads,\n\n[[Page S5791]]\n\nor go into the Asa Knight General Store stocked with snuff and tooth \npowder have a genuine sense of stepping back into time and history. I \nhave visited Old Sturbridge Village many times with my family, and I am \nalways greatly impressed with the exhibits and demonstrations.\n  President Kennedy once said that ``we celebrate the past to awaken \nthe future.'' For 50 years, Old Sturbridge Village has accomplished \nthat goal. I commend Alberta Scott George, president of Old Sturbridge \nVillage, and her dedicated staff, past and present, on this auspicious \nanniversary for all they have done so well, and for their skill in \npreserving these fascinating aspects of our Massachusetts heritage and \nhistory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/05/senate-section/article/S5790-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SWISS BANKS, JEWISH DEPOSITS, AND PLUNDERED JEWISH ASSETS\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to speak again on the role \nof Swiss banks during the war in relation to their continued retention \nof Jewish assets as well as looted Jewish assets.\n  During the course of our ongoing inquiry into these important \nsubjects, we continue to find documents which detail the alleged use of \nSwiss banks by the Nazis for illicit purposes. One such declassified \nintelligence document, dated June 12, 1945, from the U.S. Legation in \nBern, Switzerland, entitled ``Interim Report on Johann Wehrli & Co., \nZurich,'' details the use of a special account set up at what was then \ncalled the Wehrli Bank in Zurich under the name of the ``Trustee \nAccount Gustloff Stiftung.''\n  I want to quote the relevant section of this document to further \nexplain this point.\n\n       The payments to the Germans of the Hirtenbergerwerke \n     ([Fritz] Mandl's munitions factory in Austria) assets, which \n     were under Mandl's control in 1938, were effected through the \n     Wehrli Bank to an account known as Trustee Account Gustloff \n     Stiftung. The examiner, who has a personal knowledge \n     concerning the background of this trust as a result of his \n     many years residence in Germany before the war, described the \n     Gustloff Stiftung as a ``fund'' in which were placed the \n     assets and titles of property taken by the Nazis from Jewish \n     businessmen in Germany and the occupied countries. Gustloff, \n     the head of the Nazi party in Switzerland, was murdered in \n     1935 by one Frankfurter. In accordance with the prevailing \n     practice at the time, Gustloff was selected by the Nazis as \n     one of their ``martyrs'' and many statues were erected to \n     perpetuate his name. The name of the trust, therefore, seems \n     to have no further significance. The only record of Gustloff \n     Stiftung on the books of Wehrli is in connection with the \n     sale of the Hirtenbergerwerke properties.\n\n  This revelation, if true, seems very disturbing, in that a Swiss bank \nhad a specific account set up to hold plundered assets of European \nJews. From other documents, we have information that leads us to \nbelieve that the Wehrli Bank was also used to transfer assets of \nGermans to Argentina, near the end of World War II and after. This begs \nthe question, were assets from the Gustloff Stiftung also transferred \nto South America or other locations.\n  Of particular concern is the further question of whether there were \nother accounts like the Gustloff Stiftung in other Swiss banks. While \nwe cannot yet verify this, it is entirely possible that if one such \naccount existed, others did also.\n  On the topic of Jewish assets in Swiss banks, I would like to comment \nthat the answers that we are receiving to questions we are asking the \nSwiss Bankers Association are wholly insufficient. They are evasive and \nthey continue to deny any knowledge of impropriety. They continue to \ndodge questions as to where these assets might be, or if they even \nexisted.\n  We have very clear information that suggests that Swiss banks have \ncontinued to maintain this myth now for over one-half of a century. In \nthis vein, I would like to submit for the record, evidence of this \nclaim.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, at \nthis point, three documents detailing a request for information on \ntheir account in the Swiss Bank Corporation, from July 1939, made on \nbehalf of an Austrian Jewish couple by the names of Anny and Kurt \nKadisch. One is a letter to the State Department from Congressman \nRobert L. Rodgers regarding this request, the second is a letter to the \nSwiss Bank Corporation from the Kadisch's attorney to the bank, and the \nthird is the answer from the Swiss Bank Corporation to the Kadisch's \nattorney.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 7, 1939.\n     Office of the Adviser on International Economic Affairs,\n     Department of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Livesey: On June 27th my office contacted you \n     relative to the proper procedure to be followed to ascertain \n     the status of an account in a bank in Switzerland. The \n     information which was given to me by the constituent making \n     the inquiry was not sufficient to enable the Department of \n     State to give any difinite instructions, and your office \n     suggested we make further inquiry of my correspondent.\n       In today's mail my constituent, Mr. Roberts, advised me \n     further in the matter--as will be noted in the inclosed \n     letters (copies).\n       What Anny and Kurt Kadisch really desire is to effect the \n     transfer of the funds to the credit of Account 61879 to this \n     country. They also want to know the status of the account at \n     the persent time and the best course to follow to have these \n     funds transferred to the United States.\n       Any information your office can furnish, or advice as to \n     procedure for Mr. Roberts or his clients, Anny and Kurt \n     Kadisch, will be personally appreciated.

Mr. President, as one can read, the Kadisch's attorney \nrequested help for them from Congressman Rodgers, who then wrote to the \nState Department on their behalf. Their attorney also wrote on their \nbehalf to the bank in question. The Kadisch's were checking on the \nstatus of their account, of which unlike other claimants, they had the \naccount number.\n  As we have found to be the case after the war, the Swiss bank denied \nthem any information about the account. As of yet, we do not know what \nwas the fate of this account. This is, however, disturbing, especially \nsince the Kadisch's had the bank's name as well as the account number. \nThis document only brings up more questions for the Swiss banks to \nanswer.\n  I hope that we will be able to obtain answers to these and other \nquestions in the coming months. Right now, however, I am very \ndisappointed in the lack of cooperation by the Swiss Bankers \nAssociation and their continued denial of knowledge regarding these \naccounts as well as the fate of plundered Jewish assets.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/05/senate-section/article/S5791-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5791-S5792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  The 1996 NATIONAL RACE FOR THE CURE\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, along with several of my colleagues, I \nrise today to commend the many people helping to conduct our fight \nagainst breast cancer and to promote participation in an event that has \nincreased\n\n[[Page S5792]]\n\nin stature each year it has been held: the National Race for the Cure.\n  Saturday morning, June 15, several thousand people will gather down \non the mall near the Washington Monument to compete in the 1996 \nNational Race for the Cure, either by participating in a 5 kilometer \nrun or a one mile walk. The purpose of this race is to help raise money \nfor and focus attention on breast cancer, one of the major threats to \nthe lives and health of women in this country. Numerous corporations \nhave made financial and in-kind contributions to help support this \nevent--including several Michigan corporations such as Kelloggs, \nGeneral Motors and Ford--and they are to be commended for their \ngenerosity and dedication. Also, the U.S. Postal Service will be \nunveiling a stamp promoting early detection and treatment of breast \ncancer.\n  The race is put together by the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer \nFoundation, the largest private funder of research dedicated solely to \nbreast cancer in the U.S. Efforts such as the Race for the Cure and \nother events held in 67 cities in 35 States and the District of \nColumbia enable the Susan G. Komen Foundation to fight breast cancer \nthrough a combination of research advocacy, education, screening and \ntreatment.\n  We are on the edge of crucial breakthroughs in the area of breast \ncancer research and treatment. For instance, researchers at the Human \nGenome Project at the National Institutes of Health have located the \nsection of the gene that they believe dictates the genetic and \nhereditary nature of breast cancer. The efforts of private \norganizations such as the Komen Foundation, when combined with the work \ndone through Federal agencies such as NIH, increase the real likelihood \nthat a cure for breast cancer will be discovered in the foreseeable \nfuture.\n  Breast cancer education and activism are not new to the Abraham \nfamily. Ever since my Mother's death back in 1982 from breast cancer, \nour family has been involved in efforts to heighten awareness and \npromote early detection of this devastating disease. Among our recent \nactivities, just last month, my wife Jane and I participated in the \nMichigan Race for the Cure. Jane is also serving on the Congressional \nCommittee for the National Race for the Cure being held next Saturday.\n  Too often it takes the loss of someone close and dear to one's heart \nto properly focus our attention and energy on spreading the word about \nsilent killers like breast cancer. That is why it is critical for those \nof us who have experienced the tragedy of breast cancer to speak out \nand inform women--and men--of the dangers of ignorance and \nprocrastination.\n  And it is vital that men become involved in this issue as well, \nreminding their mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters of the \nimportance of early detection and treatment. It is only through such \nefforts that we can see to it that people no longer have to lose a \nloved one before learning the bitter truth about this devastating and \ndeadly illness.\n  Once again, I want to commend everyone involved in putting together \nthis year's race. I urge Members and their staff to participate in the \nrace itself and to provide support to the broader cause of increasing \neducation, treatment and research in the battle against breast cancer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/05/senate-section/article/S5791-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5792-S5818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will now proceed to debate House \nJoint Resolution 1, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 1) proposing a balanced \n     budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the joint resolution.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to call on the Senate to send \nthe Dole-Hatch-Simon balanced budget amendment to the States for \nratification. The time for decision has arrived. We will be voting on \nit either today or tomorrow. I suspect the vote is set for noon \ntomorrow. I hope that the Senate will respond to the needs of the \nAmerican people and pass the balanced budget amendment.\n  Let me initially pay tribute to some of my colleagues who have fought \nfor the passage of this crucial measure. First, let me mention the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Illinois, Paul Simon, the primary \nDemocrat sponsor of this bipartisan amendment. Senator Simon has been a \ntireless and courageous, active worker on behalf of this amendment in \nhis efforts over the years to secure passage of this amendment. His \nefforts on this matter, I think, are going to be missed in future \nCongresses. I have certainly enjoyed working with him. He is sincere. \nHe is dedicated. He knows, unless we put the fiscal discipline into the \nConstitution, that we are not going to be able to balance this budget \nwithin 7 years or at any time in the immediate future.\n\n  I also have to mention another veteran of the battle for the balanced \nbudget amendment, Senator Strom Thurmond. The senior Senator from South \nCarolina has been a consistent voice for fiscal responsibility and a \nstaunch supporter of the balanced budget amendment over many years of \nhis service here. We look forward to his continued work on this and \nother matters in the future. Senator Heflin from Alabama has also been \na long-time supporter of this bipartisan measure, who will certainly be \nmissed in future Congresses. I will miss both of these senior \nDemocrats, who have done so much to try to pass the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Let me also mention on our side--there are so many that should be \nmentioned on both sides--but let me mention Senator Larry Craig, of \nIdaho, who has been a forceful advocate of the amendment and has done \nthe best within his power to try to get the amendment up and of course \ndo everything he can to pass it. And I might also add Senator Paul \nCoverdell of Georgia, who has been a key leader on the team in moving \nthis idea forward.\n  I would also like to especially thank the 11 freshman Republican \nSenators who joined us at the beginning of this Congress. All of them \nleapt immediately into this fray in support of the balanced budget \namendment when it came up in the very first month of the 104th \nCongress. They deserve a lot of credit. We only lost this by one vote. \nWe will hear from each of them later, as we did in the first round of \ndebates last year. It is heartening to see new Members so strongly \ndedicated to the fiscal soundness of our country.\n  These and so many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle have \nbeen valiant servants of their country in fighting for a constitutional \nprovision which will protect future generations from the profligacy of \nthe current and past generations. But one stands above them all in his \ntirelessness, his dedication, in his commitment to providing a better \nfuture for our children and grandchildren, an America like the one that \nhe grew up in, fought for, and of course an America that he has served \nall of his life. He will be leaving us soon and he will be sorely \nmissed in this body, but he will be going on to greater challenges and \nhigher offices in the service of our country. I am, of course, \nreferring to our majority leader, and our leader in this effort on the \nbalanced budget amendment, Senator Robert Dole. Bob Dole has made this \na priority and has worked to make a balanced budget amendment the 28th \namendment to the Constitution. His efforts on this amendment happen to \nbe consistent with his decades of service on behalf of all Americans \nand on behalf of future generations. The contrast of his record with \nthat of President Clinton is very clear.\n  President Clinton has fought the balanced budget amendment every step \nof the way. I would ask, why? The President now says he is for a \nbalanced budget, yet I suggest the opponents of the balanced budget \namendment are simply not ready to impose the kind of fiscal discipline \non themselves that a constitutional amendment would require. It is \ntough to stop spending other people's money.\n  Last year, President Clinton succeeded in blocking the balanced \nbudget amendment. He used all the tools at his disposal. He sent out \nCabinet officials to argue against the amendment and even against \nbalancing the budget per se. He used the resources of the Federal \nGovernment and all the persuasive power of the Presidency to defeat the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n\n[[Page S5793]]\n\n  Last year, President Clinton won and, in my opinion, the American \npeople lost. The American people will lose again if President Clinton \nhas his way again this year, unless he changes his mind and makes clear \nhis support for this balanced budget amendment, the only one that has a \npossibility of passing because it already has passed the House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n  The subject matter of the amendment goes to the heart of our Founding \nFathers' hope for our constitutional system, a system that would \nprotect individual freedom through limited government. In the later \nhalf of this century, however, the intention of the Framers of the \nConstitution has been betrayed by Congress' inability to control its \nown spending habits. The size of the Federal leviathan has grown to \nsuch an extent that the very liberties of the American people and our \nfuture generations are threatened.\n  Since the other body has already given its approval to the amendment \nit is up to the Senate to follow suit to meet the needs of the American \npeople, 85 percent of whom favor a balanced budget amendment. We need \nto relegate the spendthrift and tax-happy policies of the past to the \ndustbin of history.\n  This amendment has broad support in the country and among Democrats \nand Republicans who believe we need to get the Nation's fiscal house in \norder so that we can leave a legacy of a strong national economy and a \nresponsible national Government to our children and grandchildren.\n  The problem is our worsening debt crisis. Our Nation is faced with \nthe worsening problem of rising national debt and deficits and the \nincreased Government use of capital that would otherwise be available \nto the private sector to create jobs and invest in our future. This \nproblem presents risks to our long-term economic growth and endangers \nthe well-being of our elderly, our working people, and especially our \nchildren and grandchildren. The debt burden is a mortgage on their \nfuture. The debt is fiscal child abuse and it must end.\n  The total national debt now stands at more than $5.1 trillion. That \nmeans that every man, woman and child in Utah, and all of our States, \nhas an individual debt burden of more than $19,600. While it took us \nmore than 200 years to acquire our first trillion dollars of debt, we \nhave recently been adding another $1 trillion to our debt about every 5 \nyears.\n  Yet opponents of the balanced budget amendment claim that there is no \nproblem. They point to the marginal slowdown in the growth of the debt \nin the last year or so as if it suggested that all our problems are \nsolved. Only inside this beltway, in Washington, DC, can people claim \nthat we are on the right track while we add to a debt of more than $5.1 \ntrillion.\n  The President's own 1997 budget predicts that in the year 2000, total \nFederal debt will be more than $6 trillion. That means a Federal debt \nof about $23,700 per person. Everybody in this country will have jumped \nfrom $19,600 per person that we owe now to $23,700 per person. This \nwould be nearly a tenfold increase in per-capita debt since 1975.\n  When we last debated the balanced budget amendment I gave a daily \nupdate on the debt increase as we debated. By the end of the debate my \n``debt tracker'' was becoming unwieldy, so I brought down sort of a \nsummary debt tracker to bring us up to date on the debt since we began \ndebate on this amendment in January of last year.\n  As my chart here shows, when we last began our debate in January \n1995, we were in debt, as a national debt, $4.81 trillion. Since \nJanuary 30, 1995 to June 3, 1996, a little over a year, we are now at \n$5.13 trillion in national debt. We have gone up $320 billion while \nthis President is claiming we are getting the national debt under \ncontrol and that he is really solving the deficit problems. That is a \nfalse claim and there is no question about it.\n  Translated in more understandable terms this means that the cost of \ndelay in passing this important amendment has been more than $1,200 for \nevery man, woman and child in our country. Put another way, over the 15 \nmonths that have elapsed since President Clinton helped defeat the \nbalanced budget amendment, the debt has increased on average over $650 \nmillion a day; over $27 million an hour, over $450,000 a minute, over \n$7,500 every second. This is the price of the delay by President \nClinton and his allies.\n  That increasing debt is not just numbers on a chart. Over time, the \ndisproportionate burdens imposed on today's children and their children \nby the continuing pattern of deficits could include some combination of \nthe following: Increased taxes, reduced public welfare benefits, \nreduced public pensions, reduced expenditures on infrastructure and \nother public investments, diminished capital formation, decreased job \ncreation, weaker productivity enhancement, and stagnating real wage \ngrowth in the private economy, higher interest rates, higher inflation, \nincreased indebtedness to and economic dependence on foreign creditors, \nincreased risk of default on the Federal debt, and, I might add, I \nthink a very strong hit on Social Security--a very strong hit. Because, \nwhile we have done nothing to pass a balanced budget amendment, the \ndebt has gone up $320 billion in just the last 15 months, and every \ntime that goes up it reduces the value of every dollar and hits people \non Social Security more than anybody else.\n  So, while some are arguing that we have to protect Social Security in \nthe balanced budget amendment, something that should not be written \ninto a constitutional amendment, Social Security is endangered because \nwe are not putting this fiscal discipline into the Constitution and we \nhave now gone 15 months with more danger to Social Security than ever \nbefore, where, had we passed this amendment, we would be on the way to \nbalancing the budget by the year 2002 without any obfuscation, without \nthe phony budgets that we commonly see around here, without the smoke \nand mirrors. We would have to do it. That, in the end, is what will \nprotect Social Security and other pensions of people who are counting \non them in our society.\n\n  Mr. President, one thing became clear during our recent experience in \ntrying to enact the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. It is that we need a \nconstitutional amendment. Some Senators argued during our debate last \nyear on Senate Joint Resolution 1 that ``we did not need a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget; we know what needs to \nbe done; we should just do it.'' In fact, the President said that in a \nnews clip I saw. He pointed to the media and said, ``Let's just do \nit.''\n  That is what they have been saying for 60 years now and why \neverything is being put in jeopardy as this debt continues to \nskyrocket, while we continue not to have a balanced budget amendment \nwhich would protect us. The trouble with ``just do it,'' is that \nCongress did it and the President did not. But under a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, the words ``just do it,'' would have \nauthority for both of the elected branches of Government.\n  In the year that has gone by since President Clinton helped defeat \nthe balanced budget amendment, the country has witnessed one of the \nmost contentious budget battles in the history of our Nation. President \nClinton was willing to let the Government shut down not once but twice \nbefore he finally agreed to work seriously toward balancing the budget.\n  But really what guarantee is there the Federal Government will \nachieve a balanced budget? And it is not just balancing the budget; it \nis reducing the national debt as well.\n  When the other side of the aisle controlled Congress, we never even \nhad a serious consideration of this budget plan, we never even looked \nat it seriously. President Clinton never proposed a balanced budget \nuntil he was forced to. The budget that he submitted, when we first \ndebated this amendment last year, had $200 billion deficits as far as \nthe eye can see. Even our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nrecognized this as an entirely inadequate approach and rejected it. In \nfact, the President submitted no fewer than 10 budgets in 1 year in a \nseries of attempts to avoid the tough, but responsible, decision to \nbalance the budget.\n  Can the country afford the risk of having this fight every year? \nNothing shows more clearly how difficult it is to move in the right \ndirection than just the last 9 months. Mr. President, we need the \nbalanced budget amendment to lock in the balanced budget\n\n[[Page S5794]]\n\nrule, or the future of our children will become bleaker and bleaker.\n  This constitutional amendment will help us end Congress' dangerous \ndeficit habit in the way past efforts have not. It will do this by \ncorrecting a bias in the present process, which favors ever-increasing \nlevels of Government spending. The balanced budget amendment reduces \nthe spending bias in our present system by ensuring that, under normal \ncircumstances, votes by Congress for increased spending will be \naccompanied by votes either to reduce other spending programs or to \nincrease taxes to pay for our programs. For the first time since the \nabandonment of our historical norm of balanced budgets, Congress would \nbe required to cast a politically difficult vote as a precondition to \ncasting a politically attractive vote to increase spending.\n  Mr. President, the Senate should approve the balanced budget \namendment. A vote against the amendment is a vote for the old status \nquo of irresponsible drift into more insurmountable debt than we \nalready have. Sending the balanced budget amendment to the States is \nthe right thing to do for ourselves, our children and our \ngrandchildren, and it will give us back responsible and accountable \nconstitutional Government.\n  I just want to say one more word about Social Security. I do not know \nof one Senator on either side of the aisle who does not want to protect \nSocial Security. You do not write a protection for any particular item \nin the budget into the Constitution because that would lock it in and \nmake it very difficult to ever make any changes or reforms that must be \nmade.\n\n  The fact of the matter is, though, that if we do not pass a balanced \nbudget amendment, Social Security will suffer, because we know by the \nyear 2014, Social Security will start going bankrupt. In fact, many \nthink it is going to start going bankrupt well before then. If we pass \na balanced budget amendment, we will have to face these problems, and \nwe will have to face them in a way that will protect those who are on \nSocial Security in ways that, if we do not pass a balanced budget \namendment, they will never be protected.\n  People need to know that is what it is. We have had 15 months of our \ndebt going up $320 billion and that cannot help but have an effect on \nthe financial viability of our country, on the financial viability of \nSocial Security, on the financial viability of the whole world. We have \nto get it under control. The only methodology that I know of that will \nget us there, and I think most people will agree will get us there, is \na balanced budget amendment locked into the Constitution which all of \nus revere and worship, which all of us will pay attention to, which all \nof us will honor and are sworn to uphold that will help us to get these \nspending practices under control.\n  I hope we can pass this balanced budget amendment. I do not have any \nillusions about it, but we are going to have this vote, and if it does \ngo down again, which everybody expects it to, it will not be the last \ntime we vote on this, we will be back next year and the year after, if \nthat is what it takes, until this amendment is locked in the \nConstitution and people have to face the music here in Congress. It is \nabout time we did.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nExon be recognized at 1 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDorgan be recognized at 3:30 p.m. today to use whatever time he \nutilizes under the time he controls and that I be recognized after \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I find it hard to believe my ears. What \nthis really involves is the determined effort by the proponents of \nSenate Joint Resolution 1 to balance the budget with a constitutional \namendment that devastates Social Security over the next 7 years by over \n$600 billion.\n  Let me read section 7 of the joint resolution:\n\n       Total receipts shall include all receipts of the United \n     States Government, except those derived from borrowing. Total \n     outlays shall include all outlays of the United States \n     Government, except for those for repayment of debt principal.\n\n  We suggested when this came up last year, and again earlier this \nyear, that we were readily prepared to vote for a balanced budget \namendment--we are waiting on the majority leader, of course, to make \nhis motion to reconsider--if we add to the existing exclusion in \nsection 7 that ignores those funds derived from borrowing and similarly \nexclude the Social Security trust fund surpluses.\n  The distinguished Senator from Utah says, ``Oh, it's so fine, we're \ngoing to finally lock it in,'' and he shows a chart with a horrendous \ndebt. He says, ``Now we're going to finally really fix it so we can \nbalance the budget.'' Then in the same breath, he says that ``we're \ngoing to protect Social Security.''\n  Social Security has long been protected. I intend to talk a little \nlater about the history of our efforts to save it in 1983 with the \nNational Commission on Social Security Reform on which the \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Dole of Kansas, served.\n  But more to the point at hand: I made a motion as a member of the \nBudget Committee on July 10, 1990, that we put in a provision for \nSocial Security protection. The reason being that we were beginning to \nrob the Social Security trust fund.\n  When the National Commission on Social Security Reform, the Greenspan \ncommission, issued its report in 1983, they mandated that Social \nSecurity would be put off-budget in 1992. But when we saw what was \nreally going on, I worked in bipartisan fashion with Senator Heinz and \nput into the law section 13301, signed on November 5, 1990, by \nPresident George Bush, which reads as follows:\n\n       Exclusion of Social Security from all budgets. \n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Federal Old Age and Survivors Insurance \n     trust fund, the Federal Disability Insurance trust fund, \n     shall not be counted as new budget authority outlays, \n     receipts or deficit or surplus for purposes of the budget of \n     the U.S. Government as submitted by the President, two, the \n     congressional budget or, three, the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Exclusion of Social \n     Security from the congressional budget, section 301(a) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended, by adding at \n     the end the following: ``The concurrent resolution shall not \n     include the outlays and revenue totals of the Old Age \n     Survivors and Disability Insurance Program established under \n     title II of the Social Security Act or the related provisions \n     of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in the surplus or \n     deficit totals required by this subsection or in any other \n     surplus or deficit totals required by this title.''\n\n  That is the law of the land. The Congressional Research Service and \nall others reading it who understand the English language know that \nsection 7 of House Joint Resolution 1 repeals that law.\n  They dutifully praise the Senator from Illinois who stood for long \nperiods of time here with me trying to balance the budget. He has come \nto me and other Senators on this side of the aisle and said, ``Let's \nsee if we can't compromise.'' I replied, ``I don't mind being \nrealistic, if you want to extend the date or any other wording.'' But \nSocial Security has to be protected. We demonstrated the seriousness of \nour convictions with Senator Dole's vote and Senator Hollings' vote, \njust last year.\n  Mr. President, just November of last year, on the 16th of November, I \nput an forth an amendment:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this joint \n     resolution, the 7-year balanced budget passed by the Congress \n     to the President shall not include the use of Social Security \n     trust funds to reflect a balanced budget.\n\n  In other words, that put the Congress on record against any kind of \nunified budget that included Social Security trust funds. That was \npassed with Senator Dole's and Senator Hollings' vote, 97-2, and in the \noriginal instance, back 5 years ago, in 1990, it was 98-2.\n  Yes, we talk about protecting Social Security, but in this \nconstitutional amendment, we avoid that particular protection that is \nalready in the law. Why are they so adamant to do so? Because they \ncannot present a balanced budget, Mr. President, over that 7-year \nperiod without using Social Security trust funds and without other \nsmoke and mirrors.\n  I have put it into the Record many a time. I will put it in again and \nshow\n\n[[Page S5795]]\n\nyou the particular budget that I submitted. And I said that if you \ncould give me a 7-year balanced budget without an increase in taxes, a \nrealistic budget without the smoke and mirrors, I would jump off the \nCapitol dome. I tried to convince them. They all said, ``Well, \nHollings--what's he for?''\n  I will put it in here right now in this Record. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Truth-in-Budgeting Act schedules, dated \nJanuary 23, 1995, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Hollings Releases Realities on Truth in Budgeting\n\n       Reality #1: $1.2 trillion in spending cuts is necessary.\n       Reality #2: There aren't enough savings in entitlements.\n       *Have welfare reform, but a jobs program will cost; savings \n     are questionable.\n       *Health reform can and should save some, but slowing growth \n     from 10 to 5 percent doesn't offer enough savings.\n       *Social security won't be cut and will be off-budget again.\n       Reality #3: We should hold the line on the budget on \n     Defense; that would be no savings.\n       Reality #4: Savings must come from freezes and cuts in \n     domestic discretionary spending but that's not enough to stop \n     hemorrhaging interest costs.\n       Reality #5: Taxes are necessary to stop hemorrhage in \n     interest costs.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  1996    1997     1998     1999      2000      2001      2002  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDeficit CBO Jan. 95 (using trust funds).......      207     224      225      253       284       297       322 \n                                               =================================================================\nFreeze discretionary outlays after 1998.......        0       0        0      -19       -38       -58       -78 \nSpending cuts.................................      -37     -74     -111     -128      -146      -163      -180 \nInterest savings..............................       -1      -5      -11      -20       -32       -46       -64 \n                                               -----------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total savings ($1.2 trillion)...........      -38     -79     -122     -167      -216      -267      -322 \n                                               =================================================================\nRemaining deficit using trust funds...........      169     145      103       86        68        30         0 \n                                               =================================================================\nRemaining defict excluding trust funds........      287     264      222      202       185       149       121 \n5% VAT........................................       96     155      172      184       190       196       200 \nNet deficit excluding trust funds.............      187      97       27      (17)      (54)     (111)     (159)\nGross debt....................................    5,142   5,257    5,300    5,305     5,272     5,200     5,091 \nAvg. interest rate on debt (in percent).......      7.0     7.1      6.9      6.8       6.7       6.7       6.7 \nInterest cost on the debt.....................      367     370      368      368       366       360       354 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Figures are in billions.

I included that to show how you could do it, how many \ncuts would be necessary in discretionary spending, with taxes and \nwithout taxes at that particular time. I did that because I had heard \nmy colleagues on national TV. On ``Meet the Press,'' I heard the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, on \nthe House side Mr. Kasich, and others say they are going to present a \nbalanced budget.\n  I got together with the best of minds on the Budget Committee, the \nstaff. We worked all through the month of January. Then we just put it \ninto the Record that we had tried. I should note that the spending cuts \nI included were rather harsh --harsh, harsh. I was not prepared to vote \nfor those unless we got a consensus to go along and really do the job.\n  But let me not get off my major point here with respect to this \nresolution. The reason they will not exclude Social Security trust \nfunds and pick up the votes on this side--and they could pick up easily \n5 and probably 10 votes, and they know it--is that if they include the \nexclusion, they will rob their plan of some $600 billion over the 6- to \n7-year period.\n  You know, this is all about the Presidential election. I mean, after \nall, why have 7 years? It gets us by the election here in November and \nit gets us by the November election in the year 2000. So anytime you \ncan get past two Presidential elections--and there were high hopes at \none time that they were going to have the White House--you would not \nhave any real responsibility to do anything under the constitutional \namendment until after you were elected and reelected.\n  They certainly did not want to go along, even though they could get \nthe balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, for which the \nSenator from South Carolina has previously voted. I do not mind a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution, but the reason they do \nnot call up a balanced budget amendment that protects Social Security \nis because they know that they could not then vote for the fraud that \nis in their recent budget proposal.\n  I have categorically made this statement again and again for the past \n15 years. No real balanced budget has been submitted in that 15-year \nperiod, no balanced budget has been submitted by this Congress or the \nPresident in the last 15 years. And to have the unmitigated gall to get \nup here and bring charts to the crowd--I do not know how long the \ndistinguished Senator\n\n[[Page S5796]]\n\nfrom Utah has been in the U.S. Senate, but he has been here a long \ntime. I do not know how long the Senator from Kansas has been here, our \ndistinguished majority leader, but I know he voted with us in 1968 when \nwe balanced the budget. I think the exact date was some time in June \n1968. He was in the House and I was in the Senate.\n  June 20, 1968, was the date of the adoption of the conference report \non H.R. 15414 imposing--listen to this, Mr. President, hear ye, all \nears take heed--imposing a 10-percent surcharge on personal and \ncorporate income taxes. It required the Federal Government to cut \nfiscal 1969 expenditures by $6 billion, and to reduce new obligational \nauthority by $10 billion. It required a reduction in the number of \nFederal employees, extending certain existing excise taxes, \naccelerating payments of corporation taxes, revising or extending the \neffective date of certain welfare and medical assistance laws, and \nincluding provisions on various other subjects adopted by a vote in the \nHouse of Representatives of 268-150. It shows the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kansas voting ``aye.''\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the voting record be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Excerpt From House Votes 109 Through 112\n\n       112. HR 15414. Adoption of the conference report (H. Rept. \n     1533) on HR 15414 imposing a 10-percent surcharge on personal \n     and corporate income taxes, requiring the Federal Government \n     to cut fiscal 1969 expenditures by $6 billion and to reduce \n     new obligational authority by $10 billion, requiring a \n     reduction in the number of federal employees, extending \n     certain existing excise taxes, accelerating payment of \n     corporation taxes, revising or extending the effective date \n     of certain welfare and medical assistance laws, and including \n     provisions on various other subjects.

He was increasing taxes. He was cutting spending. He was \ngetting rid of Federal employees, and right on down through his record \nas chairman of the Finance Committee--yes, we might as well bring it \nout categorically--he proposed the largest tax increase in the history \nof the U.S. Government.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed an article by \nJudy Mann, entitled ``Fiddling With the Numbers.''\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n                       Fiddling With the Numbers\n\n                             (By Judy Mann)\n\n       Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican meteor from New \n     Jersey, had the unusual honor for a first-term governor of \n     being asked to deliver her party's response to President \n     Clinton's State of the Union message last week.\n       And she delivered a whopper of what can most kindly be \n     called a glaring inaccuracy.\n       Sandwiched into her Republican sales pitch was the kind of \n     line that does serious political damage: Clinton, she \n     intoned, ``imposed the biggest tax increase in American \n     history.''\n       And millions of Americans sat in front of their television \n     sets, perhaps believing that Clinton and the Democrat-\n     controlled Congress had done a real number on them.\n       The trouble is that this poster lady for tax cuts was not \n     letting any facts get in her way. But don't hold your breath \n     waiting for the talk show hosts to set the record straight.\n       The biggest tax increase in history did not occur in the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The biggest tax \n     increase in post-World War II history occurred in 1982 under \n     President Ronald Reagan.\n       Here is how the two compare, according to Bill Gale, a \n     specialist on tax policy and senior fellow at the Brookings \n     Institution. The 1993 act raised taxes for the next 5 years \n     by a gross total of $268 billion, but with the expansion of \n     the earned income tax credit to more working poor families, \n     the net increase comes to $240.4 billion in 1993. The Tax \n     Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, by comparison, \n     increased taxes by a net of $217.5 billion over 5 years. \n     Nominally, then, it is true that the 1993 tax bill was the \n     biggest in history.\n       But things don't work nominally. ``A dollar now is worth \n     less than a dollar was back then, so that a tax increase of, \n     say $10 billion in 1982 would be a tax increase of $15 \n     billion now,'' says Gale. In fact, if you adjust for the 48 \n     percent change in price level, the 1982 tax increase becomes \n     a $325.6 billion increase in 1993 dollars. And that makes it \n     the biggest tax increase in history by $85 billion.\n       Moreover, says Gale, the population of the country \n     increased, so that, on a per person basis, the 1993 tax \n     increase is lower than the one in 1982, and the gross \n     domestic product increased over the decade, which means that \n     personal income rose. ``Once you adjust for price \n     translation, it's not the biggest, and when you account for \n     population and GDP, it gets even smaller.''\n       He raises another point that makes this whole business of \n     tax policy just a bit more complex than the heroic tax \n     slashers would have us believe. ``The question is whether \n     [the 1993 tax increase] was a good idea or a bad idea, not \n     whether it was the biggest tax increase. Suppose it was the \n     biggest? I find it frustrating that the level of the debate \n     about stuff like this as carried on by politicians is \n     generally so low.''\n       So was it a good idea? ``We needed to reduce the deficit,'' \n     he says, ``we still need to reduce the deficit. The bond \n     market responded positively. Interest rates fell. There may \n     be a longer term benefit in that it shows Congress and the \n     president are capable of cutting the deficit even without a \n     balanced budget amendment.''\n       Other long-term benefits, he says, are that ``more capital \n     is freed up for private investment, and ultimately that can \n     result in more productive and highly paid workers.''\n       How bad was the hit for those few who did have to pay more \n     taxes? One tax attorney says that his increased taxes were \n     more than offset by savings he was able to generate by \n     refinancing the mortgage on his house at the lower interest \n     rates we've had as a result. The 1993 tax increase did \n     include a 4.3-cent-a-gallon rise in gasoline tax, which hits \n     the middle class. But most of us did not have to endure an \n     income tax increase. In 1992, the top tax rate was 31 percent \n     of the taxable income over $51,900 for single taxpayers and \n     $86,500 for married couples filing jointly. Two new tax \n     brackets were added in 1993: 36 percent for singles with \n     taxable incomes over $115,000 and married couples with \n     incomes over $140,000; and 39.6 percent for singles and \n     married couples with taxable incomes over $250,000.\n       Not exactly your working poor or even your average family.\n       The rising GOP stars are finding out that when they say or \n     do something stupid or mendacious, folks notice. The jury \n     ought to be out on Whitman's performance as governor until we \n     see the effects of supply side economics on New Jersey. But \n     in her first nationally televised performance as a \n     spokeswoman for her party, she should have known better than \n     to give the country only half the story. In the process, she \n     left a lot to be desired in one quality Americans are looking \n     for in politicians: honesty.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I will read one sentence. The entire \narticle is in the Record so we know there is no misuse of this \nparticular instrument here: ``The biggest tax increase in post-World \nWar II history occurred in 1982 under President Ronald Reagan.''\n  Now, Mr. President, we also have the statements from the other media. \nThat statement was in the Washington Post on January 1 of last year. \nEverybody knows about that quote from the Wall Street Journal dated \nOctober 26, 1994: ``Contrary to Republican claims, the 1993 package is \nnot the largest tax increase in history. The 1982 deficit reduction \npackage of President Reagan and Senator Robert Dole in a GOP-controlled \nSenate was a bigger tax bill, both in 1993 adjusted dollars and as a \npercentage of the overall economy.'' That was in the Wall Street \nJournal, October 26, 1994.\n  Further, from the Washington Post of February 1, 1995: ``The biggest \ntax increase in history did not occur in the Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1993. The biggest tax increase in post-World War \nII history occurred in 1982 under President Ronald Reagan.''\n  Now, from the New York Times, November 3, 1995: ``It is not true that \nthe $240 billion tax increase approved by Congress in 1993 at Mr. \nClinton's behest is the largest in American history, When adjusted for \ninflation, the only way to make comparison for dollar amounts in \ndifferent years, a tax increase engineered by Mr. Dole in 1982, when he \nwas chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, was larger.'' That was \nthe New York Times, November 3, 1995. That is the Senator from Kansas \nthat we know and love.\n  I voted, this Senator from South Carolina, with the Senator from \nKansas back in 1968 when we had the last balanced budget. I voted \nagainst Reaganomics in 1981 and went along the legislation in 1982 \nbecause we could see the disaster coming; deficits were exploding, we \nneeded more revenues, and the budget was getting entirely out of hand. \nNow, Mr. President, you cannot believe your ears. You cannot believe \nyour ears. Having increased spending over the 15-year period, $250 \nbillion more than we have taken in, on\n\n[[Page S5797]]\n\nan average each year, we have run the national deficit--I do not need a \nchart; all you need is the facts--from less than $1 trillion.\n  From the beginning of this Nation, in 1776 with the cost of the \nRevolution, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, \nWorld War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the cost of all the wars, we \nstill had not run up a debt of $1 trillion. I know we had Desert Storm, \nbut the others are supposed to have paid for it. In a 15-year period, \nwithout the cost of a war, we have run amok. We have gone from less \nthan $1 trillion to over $5 trillion.\n  What is the interest cost? The interest cost now is estimated to be \n353 billion bucks next year; that is the April 30 figure by the CBO. \nMr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this table printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Gross interest\n                                    U.S. budget                                    Gross Federal      (Budget   \n       President and year           (outlays in     Trust funds    Real deficit        debt         realities,  \n                                     billions)                                      (billions)    Sen.

``1995 Economic and Budget    \n  Outlook.''                                                                                                    \n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator is running for \nPresident and he is getting the praises. He also ought to get the \nfacts. He is running on his record. ``He gets results, results, \nresults.'' Well, heavens above, what is the result? We are spending $1 \nbillion a day for nothing. Now, they could perhaps assess the blame to \nthe Senator from South Carolina, or the Senator from Kansas, or any of \nthe other Senators that have been around the last 15 years, but you can \nlook at your books--Mr. President, they cannot blame President William \nJefferson Clinton. He is the only President who has come to town since \nLyndon Johnson that has cut the deficit.\n  The Republicans have the unmitigated gall, totally shameless, to \nsingle out the one individual that came in and said we are going to cut \nthe deficit $500 billion, we are going to tax gasoline, we are going to \ntax Social Security and in return get the finest result to the economy \nthat you could possibly imagine. Meanwhile, Senators on the other side \nof the aisle said they would be hunting us in the street and shooting \nus down like dogs and all that nonsense. We could not get a single \nRepublican vote in the U.S. Senate. We could not get a single \nRepublican vote in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  But President Clinton stuck to his guns. We stuck to our guns. Yes, \nwe were responsible for those spending cuts. We are responsible for \nthose tax increases and we are responsible for the wonderful economy, \nthe low inflation rate, the creation of over 8 million jobs and \neverything else. Yet they have come out to point fingers, when they are \nthe ones who caused this waste of $1 billion a day for nothing. \nInterest costs have gone up from $75 billion in 1980-81 to $353 \nbillion. Just in round figures that is a $275 billion increase in \nspending for nothing--no Government, no schools, no highways, no law \nenforcement, no foreign aid, no welfare, no nothing.\n  The crowd that caused this waste has now come around in this \nPresidential race and are trying to throw a long\n\n[[Page S5798]]\n\npass. Please. I never heard of such foolishness--here we are dead \nbroke, we are spending $1 billion a day. Nobody has proposed that kind \nof spending cut or tax increase. Now we have the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kansas who wants to repeal the gas tax, $30 billion. He wants to \nhave a missile defense of $60 billion. He now is going to propose an \nacross-the-board cut of $600 billion. Anything to get elected. Come on. \nI have a hard time when I wake up every morning and come to the office \nto face this problem. That is why I asked for this extra time on this \nmeasure.\n\n  They should not get the votes for this disaster. Coming around here \nwith a constitutional amendment, like a crowd at a football game up in \nthe grandstand hollering, ``We want a touchdown, we want a touchdown.'' \nHeck, we are the team. We are on the field. What have they done, other \nthan procedure--to pass it on to the States, and after two or three \nelections, 7 years from now, with the State's ratification--or 2, 3 \nyears, whatever--pass it to the States and let them ratify and come \nback and let the Congress then go along with the ratification. Anything \nto push off our responsibility and act like we are not here. They bring \nin charts and blame the one individual that has cut the deficit since \nhe took office. Down in Arkansas he had a track record of 10 years of \nbalancing budgets. He comes to town with these interest costs and a \nhorrendous debt. What does he do? He submits a realistic budget that \nwould have the economy in good shape, and we can not get a single vote. \nAnd they have the unmitigated gall to come up here and say they are \nleading the way, and that President Clinton does not want a balanced \nbudget while they do. They are the ones who caused these horrendous \ndeficits.\n  Then I look at the screen from the Republican TV channel, channel 2, \nand here is what it has on there. It says: ``Interest costs on the \nnational debt account for 15 percent of all Federal spending.'' False. \nInterest costs on the debt are 27 percent of all Federal spending. Mark \nit down. I have to correct this myself. I cannot get the newspapers to \ndo it.\n  Republican statement on the TV channel: ``40 cents of every Federal \nincome dollar goes to pay interest on the national debt.'' Fact: 54 \ncents of every Federal income tax dollar goes to pay interest on the \nnational debt.\n  Republican statement: ``Annual interest cost on the national debt \nalmost equals annual discretionary spending.'' Fact: Annual interest \ncosts far exceed discretionary spending. Discretionary spending--which \nis inclusive of international affairs--for 1996 is $267 billion. The \n1996 interest on the debt is $344 billion.\n  Another Republican statement--they just put out--you talk about truth \nand who has character, come on. ``Annual interest costs on the national \ndebt almost equals the cost of national defense.'' That is on the \nRepublican screen right now, so all the Republican Senators can glean \nthese quick misinformations and run out on the Senate floor and act \nlike they have studied the problem and know what they are talking \nabout. False. The fact is, annual interest costs far exceed the cost of \nnational defense. The 1996 defense spending is $265 billion. Interest \ncosts on the debt are $344 billion.\n  Now, Mr. President, I hardly know how you are supposed to make sense \nout of this ``non-sense''. All that these plans accomplish is to move \nthe deficit from the general Government over to Social Security. And \nthey talk like it is a given: ``Unified budget, unified budget, unified \nbudget.'' That is my distinguished colleague from New Mexico, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee. I know he is a brilliant Senator, and \nI know he knows differently.\n  I want to go now to the Social Security record because, Mr. \nPresident, we have had a difficult time zeroing in on how we got to \nwhere we are. I hold the report of the National Commission on Social \nSecurity Reform, dated January 1983--right on page 23 it says: ``The \nNational Commission was able to reach a consensus for meeting the \nshort-range and long-range financial requirements by a vote of 12-3.''\n  The distinguished Senator from Kansas was included in that vote, Mr. \nPresident, and he bragged openly to the Catholic Conference on May 26--\njust this past month--that he helped save Social Security in 1983. In \nthe short term, he did. He was a member of the commission. And one of \ntheir conclusions, point 21 on page 224, was: ``A majority of the \nmembers of the national commission recommends that the operation of \nOASI, DI, HI, and SSI trust funds should be removed from the unified \nbudget. Some of those who do not support this recommendation believe \nthat the situation would be adequately handled if the operations of the \nSocial Security Program were displayed within the present unified \nFederal budget as a separate budget function, apart from the other \nincome security programs.''\n\n  Now, Mr. President, there is no question that the distinguished \nSenator from Kansas supported that. And Senator Dole referred, in his \nadditional views along with Congressman Conable, who was chairman then \non the House side, in statement 5, page 2, to the short and long-term \ndeficits in Social Security: ``In our judgment, $150 billion to $200 \nbillion is the amount required to keep the system solvent through 1990, \nand over the very long-term, the next 75 years, the needs of the system \namount to about $25 billion a year.'' Thus, there was an understanding \nthat we were making necessary changes to ensure the integrity of the \nSocial Security system.\n  Now, moving on, to save time, Mr. President, again, on statement 5, \npage 7: ``Accumulating considerably larger reserves is desirable,'' \nsaid the Senator from Kansas. But now those reserves are what he is \ntrying to eliminate--eliminate about $600 billion to get this farcical \nconstitutional amendment. We have never written a farce into the \nConstitution. I hope we do not put a farce in it now, because we know \nwhat the farce is. ``Accumulating considerably larger reserves is \ndesirable.'' And then the Senator said later on, ``Trust fund reserves \nhave been on a downhill coast for years.'' So he was very concerned as \nchairman of the Finance Committee at that particular time. He stated so \nin his submission of the particular bill on March 16, 1983, as the \nchairman when he said, ``OASI, DI in the particular bill actually \ngenerates a surplus.'' Again, a particular caveat or catchall to make \nsure it does not go below. On page 22, on March 16, Senator Dole says, \n``If the reserves fall below 20 percent of the annual outgo, the annual \nCOLA would be based on the lower increase in wages and prices.''\n  So they put in the 20-percent cushion, and constantly throughout \nreferred to the effect on the trust funds. Now, the only reason I \nemphasize that is to show that in 1983 the distinguished Senator wanted \nto have trust funds. But they also wanted to ensure that the trust fund \nwas off budget.\n  Let me read from the actual Congressional Record of March 24, 1983, \non the House side.\n  It says:\n\n       D. Separate treatment of trust fund operations under \n     unified budget. Beginning with 1969, the financial operations \n     of the Social Security trust funds have been included in the \n     unified budget of the Federal Government. House bill: House \n     bill provides for the display of OASI, SI and DI fund \n     operations as a separate function within the budget. \n     Beginning with the fiscal year 1989, these trust fund \n     operations would be removed from the unified budget--Senate \n     amendment, no provision.\n\n  The conference agreement, here is what they agreed to:\n\n       The conference agreement follows the House bill except that \n     the trust fund operations would not be removed from the \n     unified budget until the fiscal year 1992.\n\n  So the conference committee chose to follow the recommendation in the \nGreenspan commission report and adopted into law that by 1992 you would \ntake Social Security off-budget as a true trust fund.\n  When we started to see these surpluses being used to make the deficit \nlook smaller, we decided we couldn't wait until 1992. On July 10th, \n1990, in the Budget Committee, by a vote of 20 to 1, we put Social \nSecurity trust funds off budget and abolished the unified budget, \nincluding inclusion of Social Security. In that vote, 20 to 1, the one \ndissenting vote was the distinguished Senator from Texas, Senator \nGramm.\n  Let me say what we did when we adopted the law in 1983 and go back to \nwhat Mr. Heinz said, the former distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania, our great colleague, John Heinz, and I quote:\n\n       Mr. President, unless we separate Social Security from the \n     budget, it is absolutely inconceivable to me that we are \n     going to be\n\n[[Page S5799]]\n\n     able to finance Social Security in any kind of rational way \n     in the long run. Left in the unified budget, there does not \n     seem to be anything we are going to be able to do except \n     spend Social Security surpluses on other programs in the \n     surplus years and our Social Security in the deficit years. \n     Without some assurance that this program will be treated like \n     the Social Security insurance program that it is, how can we \n     expect young workers who are paying millions to pay anything \n     into Social Security today, nearly 100 million of them, to \n     trust that the benefits that they pay in taxes are going to \n     be in when they retire 30 years from now? The answer is, \n     unless we separate Social Security, as I provided, I do not \n     think we can.\n\n  So it was Senator Heinz on the Republican side, in a bipartisan \ninitiative in 1990, by a vote of 98 to 2--who worked with me to do just \nexactly that by law. It is the law today. It was signed by a Republican \nPresident, George Bush, but now under this constitutional amendment is \nabout to be repealed.\n  They talk about protecting Social Security. But they are trying to \ndisregard the protection we already have. We owe Social Security $520 \nbillion as of the end of April. That is how much has been borrowed from \nSocial Security. Tack on under this particular constitutional amendment \nanother $600 billion as planned in the Republican budget by the year \n2002. In the end, we may pass a constitutional amendment, but even if \nit was adhered to and things fell into place under a best-case \nscenario, we would end up saying, Yes, we balanced the budget, but we \ndevastated Social Security. We would owe Social Security $1.14 \ntrillion. And who is going to raise taxes for that? Yet, they sit up \nhere in solemn dignity talking about who is for balanced budgets, the \nvery crowd that devastated us, devastated the plan.\n  I do not know how you make sense out of this crowd. I do not know how \nyou make sense out of the media.\n  James Fallows wrote a very interesting volume entitled ``Breaking the \nNews.'' In there he discussed the dichotomy between Walter Lippmann and \nJohn Dewey. Lippmann and Dewey both agreed that we should have an \noutstanding press and an expert press, and to a great extent, we do. \nThey know these things. Unfortunately, they have gotten into the habit \nof taking polls, because they want to be ahead of the news. So they \ngather news and then they find the stories to support the polls. That \nis an incestuous kind of thing and consequently, the press ends up \nmaking the news rather than reporting the news.\n\n  But Dewey went further, by saying that the American public should be \nengaged. It is Fallows' position that the public has not been engaged, \nnor have they been made to feel a part of the process so that they \ncould understand hard facts. He states in his book that the press has a \nduty to report the truth even if they have to go against public \nopinion. We as a society are not getting those truths reported.\n  Unfortunately, this particular Senator takes issue with the idea \nabout the public being engaged. The public knows, and they want to be \ndisengaged. They get this all ``spew time'' on the 7 o'clock news, they \nget this all spew time in the magazines, the daily press, and the \nmedia. It is a deluge. All they hear from us is this preelection off-\nBroadway show on the floor of the national Congress complete with \ncharts.\n  The little tidbit of the moment this morning is that Medicare is \ngoing broke in the year 2001. So what has changed? That was the report \nwhen President Clinton took office. It was going broke in the year \n2001. He extended--oh, they do not want to say that--he extended it \ninto 2002; 1993 was his first assault on Medicare spending, because, \nyes, we not only cut spending $500 billion, we not only increased taxes \nsome $240 billion, but we cut Medicare $57 billion without a Republican \nvote.\n  They came in here with these tremendous tax cuts, which, \nunfortunately, my friend, Stevie Forbes, has the Republican nominee \ntalking about now. I hope he does not go overboard with that nonsense. \nBecause I can report to you exactly where that nonsense started. Here \nit goes again.\n  I want to include, Mr. President, an article from the New \nPerspectives Quarterly of March 22, 1993, by none other than David A. \nStockman, the daddy rabbit of Reaganomics.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From New Perspectives Quarterly, Mar. 22, 1993]\n\n    America Is Not Overspending; North America: The Big Engine That \n                                Couldn't\n\n                         (By David A. Stockman)\n\n       David A. Stockman Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget from 1981 to 1985, during the first years of the \n     ``Reagan Revolution,'' David Stockman left office amid the \n     lingering controversy caused by his revelations in the \n     Atlantic magazine about the internal Administration politics \n     which, Stockman said, would result in untenable deficits.\n       Stockman's memoirs of those years are entitled A Triumph of \n     Politics: How the Reagan Revolution Failed. He is currently a \n     General Partner at the Blackstone Group, a New York \n     investment house.\n       President Clinton's economic plan deserves heavy-duty \n     criticism--particularly the $190 billion worth of new \n     boondoggles through FY1998 that are euphemistically labelled \n     ``stimulus'' and ``investment'' programs. But on one thing he \n     has told the unvarnished truth. There is no way out of the \n     elephantine budget deficits which have plagued the nation \n     since 1981 without major tax increases.\n       In this regard, the full-throated anti-tax war cries \n     emanating from the GOP since February 17 amount to no more \n     than deceptive gibberish. Indeed, if Congressman Newt \n     Gingrich and his playmates had the parental supervision they \n     deserve, they would be sent to the nearest corner wherein to \n     lodge their Pinocchio-sized noses until this adult task of \n     raising taxes is finished.\n       The fact is, we have no other viable choice. According to \n     the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecast, by FY1998 we \n     will have practical full employment and, also, nearly a $400 \n     billion budget deficit if nothing is done. The projected red \n     ink would amount to five percent of GNP, and would mean \n     continuing Treasury absorption of most of our meager net \n     national savings through the end of the century. This is \n     hardly a formula for sustaining a competitive and growing \n     economy.\n       The root problem goes back to the July 1981 frenzy of \n     excessive and imprudent tax-cutting that shattered the \n     nation's fiscal stability. A noisy faction of Republicans \n     have willfully denied this giant mistake of fiscal \n     governance, and their own culpability in it, ever since. \n     Instead, they have incessantly poisoned the political debate \n     with a mindless stream of anti-tax venom, while pretending \n     that economic growth and spending cuts alone could cure \n     the deficit.\n       It ought to be obvious by now that we can't grow our way \n     out. If we should happen to realize CBO's economic forecast \n     by 1998, wouldn't a nearly $400 billion deficit in a full \n     employment economy 17 years after the event finally \n     constitute the smoking gun?\n       To be sure, aversion to higher taxes is usually a \n     necessary, healthy impulse in a political democracy. But when \n     the alternative becomes as self-evidently threadbare and \n     groundless as has the ``growth'' argument, we are no longer \n     dealing with legitimate skepticism but with what amounts to a \n     demagogic fetish.\n       Unfortunately, as a matter of hard-core political realism, \n     the ritualized spending cut mantra of the GOP anti-taxers is \n     equally vapid. Again, the historical facts are overwhelming.\n       Ronald Reagan's original across-the-board income tax cut \n     would have permanently reduced the federal revenue base by \n     three percent of GNP. At a time when defense spending was \n     being rapidly pumped up, and in a context in which the then \n     ``conservative'' congressional majority had already decided \n     to leave 90 percent of domestic spending untouched, the \n     Reagan tax rate cut alone would have strained the nation's \n     fiscal equation beyond the breaking point. But no one blew \n     the whistle. Instead, both parties succumbed to a shameless \n     tax-bidding war that ended up doubling the tax cut to six \n     percent of GNP--or slashing to nearly one-third the permanent \n     revenue base of the United States government.\n       While delayed effective dates and phase-ins postponed the \n     full day of reckoning until the late 1980s, there is no \n     gainsaying the fiscal carnage. As of August, 1981, Uncle Sam \n     had been left to finance a 1980s-sized domestic welfare state \n     and defense build-up from a general revenue base that was now \n     smaller relative to GNP than at any time since 1940!\n       In subsequent years, several ``mini'' tax increase bills \n     did slowly restore the Federal revenue base to nearly its \n     post-war average share of GNP. The $2.5 trillion in \n     cumulative deficits since 1981, however, is not a product of \n     ``over-spending'' in any meaningful sense of the term. In \n     fact, we have had a rolling legislative referendum for 12 \n     years on ``appropriate'' Federal spending in today's \n     society--and by now the overwhelming bi-partisan consensus is \n     crystal clear.\n       Cash benefits for Social Security recipients, government \n     retirees and veterans will cost about $500 billion in 1998--\n     or six percent of prospective GNP. The fact is they also cost \n     six percent of GNP when Jimmy Carter came to town in 1977, as \n     they did when Ronald Reagan arrived in 1981, Bush in 1989 and \n     Clinton in 1993.\n       The explanation for this remarkable 25 years of actual and \n     prospective fiscal cost stability is simple. Since the mid-\n     1970s there has been no legislative action to increase \n     benefits, while a deep political consensus has steadily \n     congealed on not cutting them, either. Ronald Reagan pledged \n     not to touch Social Security in his 1984 debate with Mondale; \n     on this issue Bush never did move his\n\n[[Page S5800]]\n\n     lips; and Rep. Gingrich can readily wax as eloquently on the \n     ``sanctity'' of the nation's social contract with the old \n     folks as the late Senator Claude Pepper ever did.\n       The political and policy fundamentals of the $375 billion \n     prospective 1998 cost of Medicare and Medicaid are exactly \n     the same. If every amendment relating to these medical \n     entitlements which increased or decreased eligibility and \n     benefit coverage since Jimmy Carter's inauguration were laid \n     end-to-end, the net impact by 1998 would hardly amount to one \n     to two percent of currently projected costs.\n       Thus, in the case of the big medical entitlements, there \n     has been no legislatively driven ``overspending'' surge in \n     the last two decades. And since 1981, no elected Republican \n     has even dared think out loud about the kind of big changes \n     in beneficiary premium costs and co-payments that could \n     actually save meaningful budget dollars.\n       To be sure, budget costs of the medical entitlements have \n     skyrocketed--but that is because our underlying health \n     delivery system is ridden with inflationary growth. Perhaps \n     Hillary will fix this huge, systemic economic problem. But \n     until that silver bullet is discovered, there is no way to \n     save meaningful budget dollars in these programs except to \n     impose higher participation costs on middle and upper income \n     beneficiaries--a move for which the GOP has absolutely no \n     stomach.\n       Likewise, the ``safety net'' for the poor and price and \n     credit supports for rural America cost the same in real \n     terms--about $100 billion--as they did in January, 1981. That \n     is because Republicans and Democrats have gone to the well \n     year after year only to add nickels, subtract pennies, and, \n     in effect, validate over and over the same ``appropriate'' \n     level of spending.\n       On the vast expanse of the domestic budget, then, \n     ``overspending'' is an absolute myth. Our post-1981 mega-\n     deficits are not attributable to it; and the GOP has neither \n     a coherent program nor the political courage to attack \n     anything but the most microscopic spending marginalia.\n       It is unfortunate that having summoned the courage to face \n     the tax issue squarely, President Clinton has clouded the \n     debate with an excess of bashing the wealthy and an utterly \n     unnecessary grab-bag of new tax and spending giveaways. But \n     that can be corrected in the legislative process--and it in \n     no way lets the Republicans off the hook. They led the \n     Congress into a giant fiscal mistake 12 years ago, and they \n     now have the responsibility to work with a President who is \n     at least brave enough to attempt to correct it.\n\n  (Mr. ASHCROFT assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Chair. The \nentire article is there, but let me just read this paragraph. How did \nthis all get started, that chart of yours--if you want to know where \nthat chart started, it did not start under President Clinton. He has \nreduced the deficit.\n  He has reduced the deficit. The debt they show on that chart that \ngoes from less than $1 trillion on up to over $5 trillion occurred \nunder you and me. And I quote:\n\n       The root problem goes back to the July 1981 frenzy of \n     excessive and imprudent tax cutting that shattered the \n     Nation's fiscal stability. A noisy faction of Republicans \n     have willfully denied this giant mistake of fiscal governance \n     and their own culpability in it ever since. Instead they have \n     incessantly poisoned the political debate with a mindless \n     stream of antitax venom while pretending that economic growth \n     and spending cuts alone could cure the deficit. It ought to \n     be obvious by now that we can't grow our way out.\n\n  So much for growth, so much for tax cuts, so much for the ying-yang \nof entitlements. They had in the Atlantic Monthly this past issue an \narticle by my friend Peter Peterson, former Secretary of the Treasury \nas well as in the Department of Commerce, and eminent fiscal expert. \nBut he says the father of all unfunded mandates is Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  It's absolutely ridiculous when you get the best of the best talking \nthat nonsense. Social Security has a surplus of $520 billion. Medicare \nhas a surplus of $130 billion according to the April 30 Treasury \nreport. So we have surpluses that they would call unfunded mandates. \nThis misconception is followed by Time Magazine saying that the biggest \nthing causing the deficit is these runaway entitlements. All absolutely \nfalse.\n  What is in deficit, Mr. President, is the general Government. There \nis one big sham, one big fraud that is going on here in the National \nGovernment. And the people are enraged because they know about it. They \nare paying more and getting less Government. And, of course, the \npollsters are off on that bit about get rid of the Government, get rid \nof the Government, get rid of the Government. The Government is not the \nsolution; the Government is the enemy.\n  The fact is that we can spend money and save money, but these \ninterest costs on the debt keep going up and away. Payment is required \njust like taxes. They say two things you cannot avoid are death and \ntaxes. The third thing is interest costs on the debt. They are interest \ntaxes going up on automatic pilot. As we talk today, while we talk, it \nwill go up another billion bucks. And what is broke today is the \nGovernment, not the entitlements.\n  Now, I commend my distinguished friend from Nebraska, Bob Kerrey, and \nthe former Senator from Missouri, Jack Danforth. I voted for the Kerrey \namendment to the budget resolution because, yes, I agree we have to get \na bridle on this animal. We are going to have to gradually raise the \nretirement age. We are going to have to consider other changes such as \nholding up on the COLA's.\n  I have voted for a COLA freeze in the past. I have proposed budget \nfreezes. I have proposed automatic spending cuts across the board. I \nhave even proposed increasing taxes to reduce the deficit. But, Mr. \nPresident, you cannot get it now from this group. They are the ones who \ndo not want to pay for Government. And they have the audacity to come \nhere with these runaway spending programs and ridiculous allegations \nthat the President is against defense. It is all a political act. They \nknow he is oversensitive about defense and that he is going along with \nwhat the Joint Chiefs want.\n  I was with Danny Graham. I got the first SDI award. Do not tell me \nabout SDI and its support. I still support it. But after spending \nalmost 90 billion bucks and having nothing to show for it, now is the \ntime to stop, look, and listen and move in a measured way, as the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia, Sam Nunn, says to do and the Joint \nChiefs say to do. But instead of being practical, they give us \npolitical theatre. And this particular constitutional amendment is \nanother act where they try to make the President look bad for not being \nable to get the Democrats' vote.\n  Come on. The President did not get my vote on GATT. He did get my \nvote on NAFTA. I have a lot of things on which he is not going to get \nmy vote. What are you talking about, get the vote.\n  But the Republicans can get Hollings' vote in a flash if they protect \nSocial Security. Just put in section 7 that Social Security funds are \nexcluded. Why not write what the law requires and what we all say \nshould be done to give the children and grandchildren a sense of trust, \nreliance, and respect for Government. There is no such thing as a \nunified budget with Social Security. By law Social Security is off-\nbudget. But now they put in the constitutional amendment these \ndifferent statements here.\n  Some may ask, what does the Senator from South Carolina want? \nEverybody knows, or should know, that the Senator from South Carolina \nworks in a bipartisan fashion. This Senator, you are looking at him, \ngot the only bipartisan thing done in the last 2 years, the \ntelecommunications bill. I know it. The public knows it. I worked for 4 \nyears on that. We worked with the Republicans and Democrats and we got \n91 votes, 91 of the Senators on the floor. So I know how to work in a \nbipartisan way.\n  In fact, I worked with President Johnson to balance the budget in a \nbipartisan way. But when President Reagan came to town with the so-\ncalled Kemp-Roth tax cut, I knew we were headed for the pits. I knew \nit. Senator Dole knew it. I can show you his statements critical of \nKemp-Roth. He was not any supply-side chairman of Finance. He knew \nbetter. Senator Howard Baker, the majority leader, sat right down there \nat that first desk and he shrugged his shoulders and said this is a \nriverboat gamble. You did not get elected to come up here and gamble \nlike a riverboat gambler. And I will not go along with it.\n\n  Vice President George Herbert Walker Bush called it ``voodoo.'' How \nin Heaven's name can you cut your revenues, increase all your spending \nfor defense, as elicited by Warren Rudman in his recent book, and \nexpect a balanced budget? Who is that stupid? We continue to practice \npollster-driven politics and focus on hot-button issues. But the public \nknows better.\n  So I voted against Reaganomics. I voted for the spending cuts. I \nvoted for the tax increases. And I want to correct the record in that \nRudman book,\n\n[[Page S5801]]\n\nwhich I have a little time to do. The inference is, in that first \nchapter, that Senator Hollings had some doubts about Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings and later asked for a divorce. It implies that I acted like I \nwas just along for the ride.\n  Let me tell you now, the Senator from South Carolina worked in a \nbipartisan fashion like a dirty dog, over the objection of the \nDemocratic majority leader, over the objection of the Democratic \nchairman of the Budget Committee. On 14 votes, up or down, we got a \nmajority of Democrats to vote for across-the-board spending cuts of \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings: $36 billion a year.\n  Incidentally, I helped write Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. I used this \nbudget tool as Governor. I got a balanced budget. I got the first \ntriple-A credit rating. The distinguished former Governor and occupant \nof the Chair knows what I mean. We do not have a triple-A credit rating \nin the great State of South Carolina now. I got it. It has been lost. \nSo I know how hard it is to work and get from Standard & Poor's a \ntriple-A credit rating. I did it with a rule we had in the legislature \nof automatic cuts across the board, and that is all Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings was. If you did not meet the target of spending cuts, then the \nlaw did it for you.\n  You could see the maneuvering and extension of a year and extension \nagain of another year. So, 1987 we were still serious, eight of us, in \na bipartisan fashion. I am qualifying myself as a witness. With six \nDemocrats and two Republicans, Senator Boschwitz and Senator Danforth, \nmyself and others, we voted for a value-added tax of 5 percent to \neliminate the deficit and the debt. We knew we needed spending cuts. We \nknew we wanted Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. We knew we had to cut the size of \nthe Federal Government. We knew we had to have spending freezes. But we \nalso realized in that vote--and it was after a very serious, studied \ndebate in the Budget Committee--that balancing the budget also required \nincreasing revenues.\n  I appeared before the Finance Committee. I have testified twice. I \nmet with the expert, Dr. Cnossen, who knows all about VAT's. I later \nmet with the then-chairman, Senator Moynihan of New York, of the \nFinance Committee, and I am willing to appear again. I have introduced \nmy legislation again in this Congress because I know you cannot \npossibly get a balanced budget without also raising revenues.\n  The way they have been doing it is, No. 1, rob the trust funds, not \njust Social Security to the tune of $1.2 trillion. They have the \nhighway trust funds, and the House crowd just acted to take the \ntransportation trust funds off-budget. They said, ``Wait a minute, you \nare taking our highway funds.'' They said, ``Wait a minute, you are \ntaking our airport improvement moneys,'' to make the airports safe and \neverything else of that kind, ``and using it on foreign aid, or \nwelfare, or defense, or whatever. You are not spending it for its \npurpose.''\n  So the House is has acted on that measure. But there are still other \ntrust funds: They are using military pension surpluses, they are using \ncivil service pensions, and everything else of that kind, to the tune \nright now of $1.2 trillion. So, we put forth, in a bipartisan fashion, \na value-added tax. Then, in a bipartisan fashion, we enacted section \n13301 to protect Social Security.\n  Thereafter, in April 1991, we wanted to answer the catcall that we \nheard from some Members on this side and on the other side of the aisle \nabout the annual surpluses in Social Security. The distinguished \nSenator from New York, Senator Moynihan, Senator Kasten of Wisconsin, \nand myself, we offered an amendment to cut--what; taxes? Social \nSecurity payroll taxes.\n\n  We had the argument about the payroll taxes. I do not know why they \nare talking about cutting taxes again, just in time for the 1996 \nelection. Why don't they look at how the distinguished Senator from \nKansas voted back in 1991. He could have cut Social Security taxes, and \nsupported truth in budgeting. We offered that amendment in April 1991, \nin a bipartisan fashion, and we got voted down.\n  Now, they have the audacity to come here, at this particular time, \nand talk on and on and on about who is for deficits. Let me be \ncategorical about this. I know what President Reagan did, because I put \ninto the Record the statement made by none other than the Director of \nhis Office of Management and Budget, David Stockman. I was there and I \nsaw it. I said, man, if this thing works, we can all go back home. \nEvery Governor will start cutting his revenues. Go to the mayor of the \ncity. I wish you would go back to your mayor wherever you live and say \nwe have a new way of doing things. What we ought to do is cut your \nrevenues. But cut your revenues 25 percent and see what your bond \nrating is then. You will have to lay off your firemen and policemen and \neverything else like that, and you will get run out of the mayor's \noffice.\n  Try that on as a Governor. They try to give these tired arguments a \nkind of dignity and bring out charts and everything else. They claim \nthey need a $500 or $600 billion cut to get the economy moving, but \nthen they have Greenspan trying to hold growth down to 2.5 percent.\n  We could take care of a lot of deficits here if we had more growth, \nbut that is another debate. The fact of the matter is, they come out \nwith all of these things about tax cuts, getting rid of the 4.3-cent \ngasoline tax added in 1993, $30 billion over those years. I voted for \nit. It is working. In fact, we know the price of gasoline went down \nafter we put on the tax.\n  It is the fourth quarter in the Presidential race. They are throwing \nthe bomb, anything to bring the candidate alive, anything to bring the \ncandidate alive--actually changing his entire congressional record of \nfiscal responsibility. You have him now for growth where he was not \nbefore. You have now for tax cuts when he was for tax increases and \nvoted for and supported them and led the way for fiscal responsibility. \nYou have him going along with any kind of thing to satisfy some small \ngroup that they have there--even assault weapons, I think.\n  Anybody knows you cannot let assault weapons be used around this \ncountry. Come on. But now they want to court another particular group \nin the polls, so they pick another hot-button item, and try to complete \na long pass play.\n  Welfare reform--let it be shown that on welfare, we have worked and \nworked hard and had a good record. But then they wanted to abandon the \nchildren. I think it is on course again now, so I will not say any \nmore, but I would be glad to get into that debate, because you cannot \nimmediately save money by putting people to work, instituting an \nemployment program, instituting day care, transportation and all these \nother things.\n  In the outyears you might, hopefully, get them off welfare, and I \nwould go along with that and want to support it. But in the meantime, \nlet us not continue to attack children's programs to the tune of $60 \nbillion and then in the same breath say, Let's have $60 billion for \nSDI, because we've put ``Defend America'' in the title of the bill.\n  The time is now, Mr. President, to rebuild the strength of our \neconomy. Our Nation's strength is like a three-legged stool. We have \nthe one leg of values as a nation. That is strong. We feed the hungry \nin Somalia. We help develop democracy in Haiti. We commit troops for \npeace in Bosnia. We stand for freedom around the world and for this \nAmericans are willing to sacrifice. The values leg is strong.\n  The second leg of military is unquestioned.\n  The third leg that is fractured and almost causes us to topple is the \neconomic leg, and that is easily understood. For 50 years now, in \ntrying to spread capitalism, defeat communism, spread democracy the \nworld around, we sacrificed our economy. I have had many a debate on \ntextiles. Others have had it on steel and iron and different \nmanufacturing. The truth is that Japan is a larger manufacturing nation \nthan the United States of America. The truth is, we have been \nblindsided. Read ``Blindside'' by Eamon Fingleton.\n  Now is the time to start rebuilding our Nation's health. Let's start \nwith those on welfare and, more than anything else, yes, let's continue \nthis initiative for children because in the long run, it will save us \nmoney. I wrote a book on hunger. I worked to establish the women, \ninfants and children feeding program or WIC. You cannot rebuild a \nstrong America by denying the infants and expectant mothers access\n\n[[Page S5802]]\n\nto nutritional programs. For every dollar we spend in WIC, we save $3.\n  You are not going to build a strong America by denying Head Start to \n5- and 6-year-olds. For every dollar we put in to Head Start, we save \n$4.25.\n  We are not going to build a strong America by denying school lunches \nto the 6- and 7-year-olds.\n  We are not going to build a strong America by denying title I to the \ndisadvantaged 9- and 10-year-olds.\n  You are not going to build a strong America by denying summertime \njobs.\n  You are not going to build a strong America by denying student loans \nfor youngsters, 16-year-olds, to go to college.\n  These are the programs we are cutting, and meanwhile we are all \ntalking about who is really telling the truth, who is really for \nreducing the deficit, who is really for a balanced budget, and we go \nthrough this silly act. People blame both sides, and they should blame \nboth sides. That is why the American public does not turn out in force \nfor national elections.\n  Now is the time to get real. Cut out the balanced budget amendments \nand let's balance the budget. Give it to us, and I will support it, I \nwill go to conference. As a former chairman of the Budget Committee, I \nwill work in a bipartisan fashion. We can balance this budget. It is \ngoing to be tough, but we will all have to work together to do it. We \ncan't afford to keep turning it into Presidential political headlines.\n  It goes without saying that these particular budgets have never been \nbalanced.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a letter from June O'Neill of \nOctober 18 to the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                                 October 18, 1995.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     reviewed the legislation submitted to the Senate Committee on \n     the Budget by eleven Senate committees pursuant to the \n     reconciliation directives included in the budget resolution \n     for fiscal year 1996 (H. Con. Res. 67). CBO's estimates of \n     the budgetary effects of each of those submissions have been \n     provided to the relevant committees and to the Budget \n     Committee. Based on those estimates, using the economic and \n     technical assumptions underlying the budget resolution, and \n     assuming the level of discretionary spending specified in \n     that resolution, CBO projects that enactment of the \n     reconciliation legislation submitted to the Budget Committee \n     would produce a small budget surplus in 2002. The effects of \n     the proposed package of savings on the projected deficit are \n     summarized in Table 1, which includes the adjustments to \n     CBO's April 1995 baseline assumed by the budget resolution. \n     The estimated savings that would result from enactment of \n     each committee's reconciliation proposal is shown in Table 2.\n       As you noted in your letter of October 6, CBO published in \n     August an estimate of the fiscal dividend that could result \n     from balancing the budget in 2002. CBO estimated that \n     instituting credible budget policies to eliminate the deficit \n     by 2002 could reduce interest rates by 150 basis points over \n     six years (based on a weighted average of long-term and \n     short-term interest rates) and increase the real rate of \n     economic growth by 0.1 percentage point a year on average, \n     compared with CBO's economic projections under current \n     policies. CBO projected that the resulting reductions in \n     federal interest payments and increases in federal revenues \n     would total $50 billion in 2002 and $170 billion over the \n     1996-2002 period. Those projections were based on a \n     hypothetical deficit reduction path developed by CBO. The \n     deficit reductions estimated to result from the \n     reconciliation legislation submitted to the Budget Committee, \n     together with the constraints on discretionary spending \n     proposed in the budget resolution, would likely yield a \n     fiscal dividend similar to that discussed in the August \n     report.\n       If you wish further details on this projection, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, that letter of October 18, 1995, said \nthat we produce a small budget surplus with this 1996 budget we are \nunder. But, Mr. President, when reminded of the law--do you think you \nhave to remind a trust officer in a bank of the law? Do you think a \ndirector of the Congressional Budget Office has to be reminded of the \nBudget Act on Social Security?\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: Pursuant to Section 205(a) of the budget \n     resolution for fiscal year 1996 (H. Con. Res. 67), the \n     Congressional Budget Office provided the Chairman of the \n     Senate Budget Committee on October 18 with a projection of \n     the budget deficits or surpluses that would result from \n     enactment of the reconciliation legislation submitted to the \n     Budget Committee. As specified in section 205(a), CBO \n     provided projections (using the economic and technical \n     assumptions underlying the budget resolution and assuming the \n     level of discretionary spending specified in that resolution) \n     of the deficit or surplus of the total budget--that is, the \n     deficit or surplus resulting from all budgetary transactions \n     of the federal government, including Social Security and \n     Postal Service spending and receipts that are designated as \n     off-budget transactions. As stated in the letter to Chairman \n     Domenici, CBO projected that there will be a total-budget \n     surplus of $10 billion in 2002. Excluding an estimated off-\n     budget surplus of $115 billion in 2002 from the calculation, \n     CBO would project an on-budget deficit of $105 billion in \n     2002. (The letter you received yesterday incorrectly stated \n     these two figures.)\n       If you wish further details on this projection, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The staff contact is Jim Horney, who \n     can be reached at 226-2880.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. October 20, 1995, to the Honorable Kent Conrad.\n\n       Dear Senator: After taking Social Security off budget--\n       Actually, the budget projected would have a deficit of $105 \n     billion. We might get that truth out. We fought to get \n     adherence to that law. We put up an amendment, and we cannot \n     get support for it. But we continue to put up that amendment \n     and everything else to say we want a balanced budget.\n\n  I have worked in the vineyards for 30 years for a balanced budget up \nhere. I got one back when I was Governor of my State, and I will go \nalong with you, but just do not move deficits. Let's eliminate \ndeficits. Let's not move the deficits from general Government over to \nSocial Security putting it in debt $1.100 trillion by the year 2002. \nAll you have to do is add ``Social Security trust fund'' where you say, \n``except for borrowed funds.'' ``Except for borrowed funds from the \nSocial Security trust fund.''\n  That is all it is, a little language. They do not want to do it, \nbecause the truth hits them in the face when they go around the corner. \nIf they put that in a constitutional amendment, there is no way in the \nworld that they can produce a balanced budget without increasing taxes.\n  Their political singsong is, ``We can just balance the budget. We're \nconservatives, and they're spending us blind, and the liberals there, \nthey want to continue spending and all we need is spending cuts and you \ncan eliminate the Government.''\n  Mr. President, with $267 billion in domestic spending eliminated and \nwith the $344 interest cost increase, you would still have a deficit. \nDo not just cut--eliminate. Eliminate Commerce or housing or energy or \neducation. Eliminate Interior, eliminate the Justice Department, get \nrid of the FBI, the DEA, the Border Patrol and just eliminate it all, \nand you still have a deficit.\n  That is the dilemma we are in. Today's problems are not entitlements. \nIt is not Social Security and AARP. My distinguished friend from \nWyoming comes in here and says there is no trust fund. Well, that is \nhis view. But in the view of the Congress and under his vote, there is \na trust fund. Under the recommendation of the Greenspan commission, we \nput it off budget. Since 1990, we have had it formally in the law and \nthey now want to repeal the law with section 7 of this particular \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Mr. President, thank heavens for the sobriety of the Members on this \nside who have dutifully written a letter saying, Dear Mr. Dole: Just go \nalong with the protection under the law that we have in section 13301 \nof the statutory laws of the United States of America and you've got us \nfive and you can pass a constitutional amendment in a flash.\n  They do not want a constitutional amendment. They want to get the \ncredit, but they do not want to get the duty and responsibility. It is \nan absolute fraud, and they know it.\n\n[[Page S5803]]\n\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I thank the able Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the motion to \nreconsider House Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment. \nLast year, the House acted with wide bipartisan support as it adopted \nthe balanced budget amendment by a vote of 300 to 132. Unfortunately, \nlast year in the Senate, we fell 1 vote short of the 67 votes needed \nfor final passage. Now, we have an opportunity to do the right thing \nand adopt this proposal.\n  Mr. President, mandating balanced Federal budgets is not a new idea. \nThe first constitutional amendment to balance the budget was proposed \nin 1936 by Minnesota Representative Harold Knutson. During World War II \nthe attention of the Nation was distracted from efforts to secure \nannual balanced budgets, although Senator Tydings and Representative \nDisney introduced several balanced budget amendments during that \nperiod.\n  Following World War II, a Senate joint resolution on balanced budgets \nwas introduced by Senators Tydings and Bridges and reported out by the \nCommittee on Appropriations in 1947 but received no further action. \nDuring the 1950's, an increasing number of constitutional initiatives \nfor balanced budgets came to be introduced regularly in Congress. It \nwas during that time that I supported legislation such as that offered \nby Senators Bridges, Curtis, and Harry Byrd to require the submission \nby the President of an annual balanced budget and to prevent Congress \nfrom adjourning without having enacted such a budget. No action was \ntaken on these measures. Yet, since the beginning of the 84th Congress \nin 1955, an average of four constitutional amendments to require a \nbalanced Federal budget have been proposed during each Congress. There \nwas little substantive action in the 1960's and 1970's on our \nproposals. But finally, in 1982 while I was chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, the Senate passed a balanced budget amendment which I \nauthored. Our victory was short-lived, however, because the Speaker and \nthe majority leader at that time led the movement to kill it in the \nDemocrat-controlled House of Representatives. That was our high water \nmark as we fell one vote short in 1986, four votes short in 1994, and \none vote short last year. This is our final opportunity this year to \ndeliver to the American people a balanced budget amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, simply stated, this legislation calls for a \nconstitutional amendment requiring that outlays not exceed receipts \nduring any fiscal year. Also, the Congress would be allowed by a three-\nfifths vote to adopt a specific level of deficit spending. Further, \nthere is language to allow the Congress to waive the amendment during \ntime of war or imminent military threat. Finally, the amendment \nrequires that any bill to increase taxes be approved by a majority of \nthe whole number of both Houses.\n  This legislation would provide an important step to reduce and \nultimately eliminate the Federal deficit. The American people have \nexpressed their strong opinion that we focus our efforts on reducing \nthe deficit. Making a balanced budget amendment part of the \nConstitution is appropriate action for addressing our Nation's runaway \nfiscal policy.\n  Over the past half-century, the Federal Government has become \njeopardized by an irrational and irresponsible pattern of spending. As \na result, this firmly entrenched fiscal policy is a threat to the \nliberties and opportunities of our present and future citizens.\n  The national debt is over $5.1 trillion. Today, the payment of \ninterest on the debt is the second largest item in the budget. That \naccounts for the estimate that this year it will take over 40 percent \nof all personal income tax receipts to pay the interest on the debt.\n  Mr. President, the tax dollars that go to pay interest on the debt \nare purely to service a voracious Federal appetite for spending. \nPayment of interest on the debt does not build roads, it does not fund \nmedical research, it does not provide educational opportunities, it \ndoes not provide job opportunities, and it does not speak well for the \nFederal Government. Payment of interest on the debt merely allows the \nFederal Government to carry a debt which has been growing at an \nalarming rate. It is deficit spending which has brought us to these \ncrossroads. Congress has balanced the Federal budget only once--I \nrepeat, only once--in the last 36 years and only 8 times in the last 64 \nyears. A balanced budget amendment as part of the Constitution will \nmandate the Congress to adhere to a responsible fiscal policy.\n  The American businessmen and businesswomen have become incredulous as \nthey witness year in and year out the spending habits of the Congress. \nAnyone who runs a business clearly understands that they cannot survive \nby continuing to spend more money than they take in. It is time the \nFederal Government abides by this simple yet compelling principle.\n\n  For many years, I have believed, as have many Members of Congress, \nthat the way to reverse this misguided direction of the Federal \nGovernment's fiscal policy is by amending the Constitution to mandate, \nexcept in extraordinary circumstances, balanced Federal budgets. The \nCongress should adopt this proposal and send it to the American people \nfor ratification. The balanced budget amendment is a much needed \naddition to the Constitution and it would establish balanced budgets as \na fiscal norm, rather than a fiscal abnormality.\n  Mr. President, the tax burdens which today's deficits will place on \nfuture generations of American workers is staggering. Future American \nworkers are our children and our children's children. We are mortgaging \nthe future for generations yet unborn. This is a terrible injustice we \nare imposing on America's future and it has been appropriately referred \nto as fiscal child abuse.\n  Our third president, Thomas Jefferson, stated, and I quote:\n\n       The question whether one generation has the right to bind \n     another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay \n     them ourselves.\n\n  That is a quote of Mr. Thomas Jefferson.\n  Mr. President, it is time we show the fiscal discipline advocated by \nThomas Jefferson and adopt a balanced budget amendment. Mr. President, \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I, of course, rise in support of \npassage of the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I enjoyed \nvery much listening to the remarks of the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom South Carolina as he outlined the benefits and the necessities of \npassing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  You know, one of the things that leaves me perplexed about this \nentire debate is the fact that what we are talking about here is having \nthe Congress ratify and send to the States the opportunity to engage in \na broad national debate with regard to the passage of a balanced budget \namendment. Those who rise in opposition seem to want to prevent the \nseveral States from engaging in this very valid, very important \nnational debate. For myself, I have total confidence that the States \ndeserve and need and will appropriately manage this debate.\n  Remember, for it to become a true amendment to the Constitution it \nwill require that three-fourths of those States ratify this concept. So \nthis concept will not come into place without massive public attention \nin all of the 50 States.\n  Surely, if three-fourths of the States conclude this is the right \nthing to do, then, indeed, it is the right thing to do. Yet those on \nthe other side do not want it to get to the States. They want to lock \nit down here, very repeatedly, in Washington, whereas we have just \nheard in the last 36 years we have had 35 budgets that were not \nbalanced, and one that was, which is, of course, why\n\n[[Page S5804]]\n\nthe vast majority of Americans understand and know that we need this \ndiscipline, that the wise founder Thomas Jefferson warned us about. We \nneed this provision of discipline in the Constitution.\n  I do not know how much evidence it takes. You count them off, 36 \nyears, and we balanced the budget once, and 35 times we failed to do \nso, might suggest to the average American that something is a little \nbit out of whack, a little bit out of whack, and they are paying, oh, \nare they paying the price for it.\n  I see my colleague from Indiana is on the floor and I will yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, once again we are debating the balanced \nbudget. We should not, any longer, be debating the balanced budget. We \nshould be living by a balanced budget. Americans have lost their \npatience with this endless, fruitless process of debating the issue and \nour failure to achieve the issue. The question now before us, again, is \nsimple: How do we finally make this commitment real, make it lasting, \nand make it binding?\n  The Democrats have argued--and I am not referring to the 13 Democrats \nthat supported this effort in that close, almost historic vote that \ntook place over a year ago; I am referring to Democrats because no \nRepublicans are arguing against a balanced budget in this debate--\nDemocrats have argued in the past that a balanced budget amendment is \nunnecessary. ``Let's not amend the Constitution,'' they say, ``just \nsimply balance the books ourselves.'' Last year, during debate on this \namendment, the minority leader stated, ``The budget is not going to be \nbalanced in 2002 unless the responsible people in 1995 start to focus \non their share of the work.'' Senator Kerrey added, ``Let Senators get \nto work to show Americans we have the courage this amendment presumes \nthat we lack.''\n  Now, that argument had some credibility when we made this debate in \n1995, although it has been argued now for more than a decade, but it \ndid have some credibility at the time. It is our responsibility. It is \nour job to keep the Nation's fiscal house in order and to not spend \nmore than we take in. Of course, we fail in that job year after year \nafter year and there is always another excuse, there is always another \nprogram that needs to be preserved. There is always an argument why we \ncannot do it now.\n  Today, that argument does not have credibility. Democrats, both the \nPresident and Members of Congress, have shown little courage and have \nnot lived up to their share of the work. Every tough question, every \ntough vote we have had, especially on entitlements, has been exploited \nfor partisan advantage. Democrats have talked of balanced budgets, \nwhile refusing to pay the cost of courage. It is a cynical display. It \nis a hypocritical display to say we must go forward on our own, and \nthen put every roadblock in the way to accomplishing what they say we \nmust do.\n  What lessons have we learned in this past year? If you make hard, \nnecessary choices, the President and Democrat leaders will undermine \nyou. If you carefully and responsibly confront runaway entitlements, \nthey will vilify you. The President and his party are trying to create \na Washington culture that rewards cowardice and compromises our future.\n\n  What do we do about it? How can we change that culture? How can we \nrequire Washington to make the difficult choices and turn our easy \nwords into reliable results? The answer, Mr. President, is a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution. We have simply exhausted all \nother avenues in arriving at this goal.\n  We are back where we started. Congress must be mandated to do what it \nhas consistently refused to do. No argument could be more clear and \nmore compelling than our experience of this last few months. If \nbalancing the budget is not a matter of constitutional principle, it \nwill not be accomplished. It must no longer be subject to shifting and \ncynical political tactics. Our first duty as legislators, to preserve a \nstrong and solvent Nation for the next generation, that commitment \nshould be burned into our conscience and written into our most basic \nlaw, the Constitution of the United States or it will not happen.\n  Once again, we are here and we have the choice to make that happen. \nThe success of this effort will depend on one thing: The President \nneeds to persuade just 2 Democrat Senators to join 13 of their \ncolleagues who voted for the balanced budget last year, to support this \nattempt at balancing the budget. The outcome is pretty much in his \nhands. If he refuses to act, he, then, is going to have to share the \nresponsibility of the failure of this Congress to address what I \nbelieve is one of the most fundamental issues of our time. This is not \na normal, everyday political debate we are engaged in. It concerns the \nvery first principles of American Government and one of the most basic \nprinciples of morality. Endless debt is not just a drag on our economy, \nit is a burden on our national conscious.\n  I have quoted Thomas Jefferson on this topic before but his argument \nis worth hearing again:\n\n       The question of whether one generation has the right to \n     bend another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts, and be morally bound to pay \n     them ourselves.\n\n  Let me repeat that: Thomas Jefferson said, a long time ago, but it \nholds true today in a way that it never has before.\n\n       We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle \n     posterity with our debts, and be morally bound to pay them \n     ourselves.\n\n  What we are debating here is one of the most important and one of the \nmost basic moral commitments between generations. It has always been \none of our highest ethical traditions for parents to sacrifice for the \nsake of their children. It is the depth of selfishness to call on \nchildren to sacrifice for the sake of their parents. It violates a \ntrust and it betrays a duty. When Americans view our actions, they see \npast the numbers to a set of principles. They see more than a matter of \nright and left. They see a matter of right and wrong.\n  One thing is increasingly obvious: We will not reliably consistently \nbalance our budget until the Constitution requires it. The tug of quick \npolitical benefit is still too strong. The voice of vested interests is \ntoo loud. Buying votes by placing burdens on the future is still too \neasy. This amendment will force us, as a Congress, to make a choice. \nWill we preserve our ability to run up deficits or will we part with \nthis destructive power once and for all?\n  Never has the choice been more stark or more important. It is the \ndifference between false promises and real commitments. It is the \ndifference between public relations and public accountability. We will \nnever be restrained until we formally and forcefully restrain \nourselves.\n  President Clinton's current budget is example No. 1, a case in point. \nIt is a political charade, not a serious budget plan. It increases \ndiscretionary spending every year until 2001 and 2002--conveniently \nbeyond the time when President Clinton will no longer be President. \nThat is when he proposes to cut his spending level by $67 billion. \nEverybody knows this is absurd. It is an absurd proposal to say we will \nnot make the hard choices, but we will force them onto the next \nPresident.\n  Such cuts in those outyears, after Bill Clinton has retired to Hope, \nAR, will be impossible. They will be too sudden and too steep--in \neducation, the environmental, and veterans programs. But President \nClinton does not mind, because all the tough decisions would be made on \nsomeone else's watch. It is another shining example of the Washington \nculture of cowardice.\n  The time for these kinds of gimmicks and maneuvers is over. Americans \nhave been disappointed too often. We have the ability to clear away \ndecades of decision with one clear, sincere, moral commitment--that is, \nthat we will no longer steal from the future, that we will pass a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution, we will leave a legacy \nto our children other than a monumental debt. We will leave them a \nlegacy of courage and responsibility.\n  What Member wants to serve in this body and leave here looking back, \nhaving had the opportunity, but failed, to rectify this extraordinary \nimbalance in our Nation's fiscal affairs? What Member wants to think \nback on their time, as they have been privileged to serve in the U.S. \nSenate, and say, well, I was\n\n[[Page S5805]]\n\nthere, I had an opportunity to deal with one of the most fundamental, \nimportant issues this Nation has ever faced, to set a legacy for the \nfuture that will determine the prosperity and posterity for our \nchildren and grandchildren and generations to follow; yet, I passed on \nthat opportunity because, you see, I did not want to make that a \nmandatory effort. I did not want to make us bound to fulfill that \npromise because the situation might change, or a program that I really \nfavored might be impacted. And so, therefore, we put it off until the \nfuture, and we will ask the next Congress, or the next President to \ndeal with that problem, and we forfeited our ability to deal with it \nnow.\n  I do not want to have that as my legacy. But we have been talking \nabout this ever since I have been here. There has always been an excuse \nnot to go forward. There has always been some reason. As soon as we \naddress the reason of the moment that is put up, then another one is \nraised. There is always a reason why we cannot go forward. We are just \na few votes away from beginning that legacy.\n  The President, in his rhetoric, has supported balanced budgets again \nand again. Now he can prove himself a partner or partisan. It is his \nchoice. I hope he will pressure his own party to support a \nconstitutional amendment that nearly 83 percent of the American public \nsupports. I hope he will abandon unfair attacks on the people making \nthe hard, necessary, and courageous budget choices. I hope he will \nbegin to bargain in good faith for a change. I hope for all these \nthings, Mr. President. Unfortunately, I am not confident that we will \nsee any of them, and that is a shame because it is a missed opportunity \nthat may not come again. and I expect the American public, in just 5 \nmonths, will remember.\n\n  The moment has come to send a balanced budget amendment to the \nStates. Let us begin a national debate, in every State legislature in \nthis country. Americans have waited decades for this opportunity. And \nthey have waited long enough.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. COATS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator has very eloquently described the \nresponsibility, through the Thomas Jefferson quote, that each \ngeneration has for the future, and that any time a generation consumes \nthe future's resources for their own satisfaction, they are abrogating \nthe freedom of the future.\n  My question is this: Is it not true that if we were successful in \npassing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution requiring \nbalanced budgets, there would be immense benefits for the present, that \ninterest rates would drop, job lines would be shorter, there would be \nnew businesses, and that the net effect would be that an average family \nin my State and yours would have the equivalent of making $3,000 to \n$5,000 of immediate new income in their checking accounts in the form \nof reduced home mortgages and loans, so that they could get about the \nbusiness of getting America up, getting it housed and fed and ready to \nbe the leaders of the future?\n  Mr. COATS. The Senator makes an excellent point and one that has not \nbeen made enough. We have a responsibility to future generations. \nClearly, the one thing we can do that would most benefit the future of \nthis country, our children and grandchildren, and succeeding \ngenerations of Americans, is to enact within the Constitution a \nresponsibility that each of us ought to take on, but we have been \nunable to take on as a majority. But it will have immense benefits for \nthe present, as the Senator has suggested.\n  The Federal Reserve Chairman has indicated that if we could put a \nreal balanced budget in place, we can pretty much count on an interest \nrate reduction of 2 percentage points. And 2 percentage points is an \nimmense economic benefit to the present generation. For all those \nseeking to buy a new home, it means, over the lifetime of mortgage \npayments on that home, tens of thousands, if not more, of dollars in \ntheir pockets that otherwise would be paid in interest. It means, for \nthose who own a home now and have a mortgage, the opportunity to \nrefinance that home and put money right directly into their \npocketbooks, into education for their children, into meeting the needs \nof their families.\n  So there is an immediate benefit for all Americans and for American \nbusinesses that have to go out and raise the capital to expand, which \nprovides jobs for Americans, and on and on it goes. A number of figures \nhave been thrown out in terms of what this means. A balanced budget \nover the next 6 years, according to some who have studied this, \nindicates that it would add to the United States economy $32 billion in \nreal disposable income, $66 billion in new purchases, $88 billion in \nnew investment, and over 100,000 new housing starts. That translates \ninto jobs, jobs, and jobs--real jobs, not minimum wage jobs.\n  The best thing we can do for people looking for work or seeking to \nimprove their position and their jobs is to jump-start this economy in \na way in which we can expand opportunities for Americans to work. \nAverage Americans will save, it is estimated, $2,388 a year on mortgage \npayments on a house with a $75,000, 30-year mortgage. Those of us who \nlive in urban areas, or occupy areas where housing costs are much \nhigher, obviously, are going to save much more than that. And it would \nbe $1,026 saved over the life of a 4-year car loan. Every 3 or 4 years, \nwe go out to buy a new car. Most Americans do not have the cash to \npurchase those cars and, therefore, put a 4- to 5-year car loan on it. \nWe are talking about $1,000 or more in the pocket of every American who \nbuys a new car back into their wallet to spend for other purposes, or \nto save, that they otherwise would pay in interest. And $1,891 interest \nover the life of a 10-year student loan, for all those parents and \nfamilies--and I am one of them, as my third child will go off to \ncollege in a month and a half--those of us that need to borrow money to \nhelp finance that education are going to be borrowing it at lower \ninterest costs, and it will save us the average, over a 10-year student \nloan, of nearly $2,000.\n\n  Add all that up, and it amounts to nearly $75,000 of savings for the \naverage family--that is, raising kids, paying for transportation, \nputting a mortgage on their house, trying to save some money to send \ntheir kids to college to get an education beyond high school. We are \ntalking about real dollars. So the appeal to the American public is not \njust our moral responsibility and the legacy we leave for future \ngenerations for this country, but also direct economic benefits that \ncan flow directly to this economy and to Americans in this generation.\n  So, Mr. President, the question from the Senator from Georgia is a \npertinent and relevant question to this discussion which I want to just \nbriefly address.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield so I can find out \nwhat the time parameters are? As I understand it, at 1 o'clock Senator \nExon gets the floor. I ask him if I could have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. I am happy to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I will honor that and wrap up my remarks so \nwe can keep some semblance of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNebraska is to be recognized at 1 o'clock.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Chair for the time.\n  I thank my friend from Georgia for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized \nunder the time of the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank my friend \nfrom Nebraska. I am delighted to speak for a brief period of time. I \ngreatly appreciate his yielding me that 5 minutes.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Boxer pertaining to the introduction of S. 1837 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think we are going along the same path \non which we have already gone. Do we want to really balance the budget, \nor do we want a figleaf? Clearly a discussion and vote on a \nconstitutional amendment debate is a figleaf when we can have the real \nthing. The President\n\n[[Page S5806]]\n\nwas very clear. He said to the Republican leadership, ``Please, come \ninto to my office and let us get it done.''\n  Every single Member of this body has voted for a balanced budget, a \nreal one, not a figleaf. I voted for two. I voted for the Democratic \nplan, and I voted for a bipartisan plan. If those Republicans who were \nso anxious to have a balanced budget would come over and support the \nbipartisan plan, we would have a balanced budget. We would not have to \nhave a figleaf. We could have the real thing.\n  That is important. That is what it would take. It is not up to the \nPresident. It is up to this body to come together either around their \nown plan and get enough votes to do it or around a bipartisan plan. I \nthink that is the issue. The issue is not about a figleaf; it is about \nreality.\n  Sometimes I think the public is confused about this because they are \ntold that people oppose an amendment to the Constitution because they \ndo not want to balance the budget. In fact we have had very, very tough \nvotes to do it. You do not need an amendment to the Constitution to \nbalance the budget.\n  Mr. President, in my remaining time, I hope we get back to the issues \nthat matter to people. No. 1, agreement on a real balanced budget; No. \n2, the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill which will protect people who need health \ncare; No. 3, the minimum wage. Then I would like to see us take up \npension security, and in the few minutes I have remaining I want to \ncall my colleagues' attention to a front page story in the Wall Street \nJournal today entitled ``Frittered Away--Some workers find retirement \nnest eggs full of strange assets. Losses can be serious.'' It goes very \npainstakingly through a tragedy that has befallen employees of a \ncompany headquartered in Texas with many stores in my home State of \nCalifornia which invested about 85 percent of its 401(k) plan assets, \nwhich belong to employees. Employees put their hard-earned money into \nthat particular company plan. The employees now find out that the \ncompany has gone bankrupt, hundreds of them have lost their jobs, and \nthey may have lost their retirement.\n  If you want to do something on the floor of the U.S. Senate that \nimpacts the lives of people, get a real balanced budget through, get \nthe Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation through so employees can have health \ncare, so it can be portable, get the pension bill I introduced today \nthrough so employees know that the same rules that apply to defined \nbenefit pension plans apply to their 401(k)'s.\n  The Wall Street Journal article talks about how some employers have \ntaken the hard-earned pension contributions of their employees and put \nthem into worthless investments. Some of them have decorated their \noffices with these so-called investments. The investments are worth \nnothing, and the employees are left holding the bag. We can make a very \neasy change here by applying the same protections to 401(k) plans as we \nalready apply to other plans.\n  When we are here for 3 days talking about a constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget, I know the Senator from Nebraska has supported \nit in the past, but I think he will explain his frustration with this \nmeasure. We on the other side want to balance the budget. But the first \nthing they do is repeal the gas tax and put that money into the pockets \nof the oil companies. Then they talk about a huge tax cut.\n  It gets a little frustrating. If we really care about the people of \nthis country, start debating a real balanced budget. Start debating the \nissues that matter to people.\n  I hope my colleagues will support my pension bill because it would \nprotect workers from losing their 401(k) plans that they worked so hard \nto put their money into.\n  I say to my friend, I thank you very much for yielding. I look \nforward to his remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from California for \nher kind remarks.\n  Mr. President, I am very disappointed by this constitutional balanced \nbudget amendment charade staged by the majority. My colleagues know \nthat I am a staunch and dogged supporter of a balanced Federal budget \nand a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I have not changed \nin my resolve but quite obviously others have. There is something to be \nsaid for consistency and political honesty even during a political \ncampaign. Up until very recently, I thought that if you favored one, \nyou had to support the other. They clearly go hand-in-hand. But that \nwas before the political shenanigans evidently brought about by \nelection-year politics.\n  But watching the majority leader and the majority party become the \nnew high priests of what George Bush called voodoo economics has caused \nme to question whether the Republicans sincerely want a balanced budget \nat all or just a meaningless campaign issue. Advocating a balanced \nbudget amendment while advocating fiscal policy that makes it \nimpossible to function is ludicrous.\n  One minute, the majority leader calls for passage of a balanced \nbudget amendment. But in nearly the same breath, he simultaneously \npushes massive tax deductions that would reduce revenues by \nmultibillions of dollars such as deductibility of Social Security \npayroll taxes, repeal of the gas tax, and a laundry list of other tax \nbreaks too numerous to mention. On the spending side, he calls for a \n$50 billion plus revival of star wars that would additionally worsen \nthe deficit. All of this fiscal nonsense--it is fiscal nonsense, Mr. \nPresident--has caused me to conclude that I will not be a party to this \nhypocritical enterprise that falsely promises to balance the budget \ndown the road, but avoids every hard vote to cut the deficit here and \nnow and actually reach balance by 2002 when supposedly the \nconstitutional amendment would kick in.\n  I find the about-face by the majority puzzling, to say the least. The \nNational Review once quoted Bob Dole calling supply-side economics a \n``magic formula that would give us lower taxes, all the benefits voters \nclamor for, and every weapons system on the military's wish list.''\n  Doesn't that sound rather familiar now?\n  The majority leader was known for many years as downright hostile to \nsupply siders, including his former nemesis, Jack Kemp. He once chided \nthat Mr. Kemp liked to preach painless ways to reduce the deficit, and \nI quote Mr. Dole, ``while some of us do all of the dirty work.'' \nPerhaps the majority leader does not want to get his hands dirty \nanymore. Why do you suppose that is so?\n  During one of his previous Presidential runs, the majority leader \nsaid that the American people ``are ready for bitter medicine'' to \nreduce the deficit, but now he has become the tax cut candy man.\n  The majority leader also liked to joke that he had good news and the \nbad news. Once again I quote the majority leader. ``The good news was \nthat a busload of supply side economists had plunged off the cliff. The \nbad news was that there were three empty seats.''\n  Mr. President, no one is laughing today, not the American people who \nwill be stuck with a new deficit bill because of the Senator's 11th \nhour conversion to supply side economics.\n  Jokes aside, I cannot fathom how anyone who had a perch so close to \nthe unholy economic mess that supply siders created could now become \ntheir standard bearer.\n  Former OMB Director David Stockman recanted, at least, from the \ndeficits that he helped create. He wrote:\n\n       The real root problem goes back to the July 1981 frenzy of \n     excessive and imprudent tax cutting that shattered the \n     Nation's fiscal stability. A noisy faction of Republicans \n     have willfully denied this giant mistake of fiscal governance \n     and their own culpability in it ever since. Instead they have \n     incessantly poisoned the political debate with a mindless \n     stream of anti-tax venom while pretending that economic \n     growth and spending cuts alone could cure the deficit.\n\n  Mr. Stockman was right and everyone in this Chamber, including the \nmajority leader, knows it. But the majority leader was already agreeing \nwith this assessment years ago. In January 1982, he told the Washington \nPost:\n\n       I do not subscribe to the fantasy that if we do nothing, \n     deficits will disappear. Some of those in Congress who are \n     the most vocally leading the fight against tax increases \n     propose nothing to bring spending under control. It is hard \n     to conceive a worse economic or political path to follow.\n\n\n[[Page S5807]]\n\n\n  There is another revealing quote of the majority leader in the New \nRepublic of January 7, 1985: ``I never thought growth would deal with \nthe deficit.'' To continue the quote from Dole, ``Mondale's view of it \nwas all right. He was the wrong salesman.'' At least now we know \nwhere's the beef.\n  The majority leader also told the New York Economic Club in January \n1984:\n\n       Unlike some who believe we can sit on the sidelines and \n     allow economic growth to balance the Federal budget, I \n     believe that Congress and the administration must earn its \n     redemption.\n\n  I say to the distinguished majority leader, so do I. We can earn some \nredemption today by pulling this travesty off the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I have spent many an hour advocating a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. No one has been more intent on this \nendeavor. I went even further than some of my colleagues would dare. I \ntook the debate from a philosophical discussion to a level where it \nreally counts. I tried to get Congress to abide by the very policy \nstatement set out in the balanced budget amendment.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, I offered an amendment that would \nhave created a point of order against considering any budget resolution \nthat fails to comply with the requirements set out in the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  But my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who were white hot \nin their passion for a balanced budget amendment, were curiously cool \nto that amendment.\n  You hear all of these pious speeches about how we want to balance the \nFederal budget, but if we had a dollar for every Senate speech in favor \nof a balanced budget we would have had a budget surplus long ago.\n\n  Then comes along a Presidential election, and all of a sudden \nSenators are falling all over themselves to cut taxes. I heard one \nSenator say, well, this was not the first tax that he would have cut, \nbut it was an opportunity to cut taxes, and he was not going to miss \nit. It is a transparent political ploy, and this Senator, for one, has \nhad enough of it.\n  Last year, the Senate had a thoughtful and measured debate on the \nbalanced budget amendment. I did not particularly savor the outcome, \nbut I was proud of the manner in which the Senate conducted the \npeople's business. We were thorough, we were thoughtful, we were fair, \nand we acquitted ourselves with repute.\n  But today's action by the majority wreaks of partisanship and \nelection year politics. It is not serious or sound public policy. It is \nmore like a sound bite. This is a crass and appalling public relations \nstunt concocted and orchestrated by the Republican majority and the \nRepublican National Committee. Their motives are as obvious as their \ntactics are unseemly. Mr. President, I will not dance to their piper. I \ndeplore their tactics.\n  Using Congress as a backdrop, the majority will do their very best to \nembarrass the President and divert attention away from their 15 months \nof failed leadership. They will grasp at every thin reed to win back \nthe White House, even this trumped up attempt to pass a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution that everyone knows in advance will fail.\n  I suppose they feel they have no choice. The majority needs and wants \nto shift the attention of the public away from their flash-in-the-pan \nagenda and their inability to produce a fair balanced budget behind \nwhich the American people can rally.\n  Mr. President, that reminds me of an article I once read. In August \n1985, David Stockman, President Reagan's OMB Director, presented \nSenator Bob Dole with a supply side birthday cake. According to the \npress, the Senator chortled with glee to find that under the icing the \ncake was hollow. I say to the majority leader, so is this attempt to \nwin votes in November.\n  The Senate majority leader, 20 points or so behind in the race for \nthe Presidency, has come up with a gimmick to reduce the gas tax by 4.3 \ncents, which, if maintained until the magical year of 2002, could cost \nthe Treasury $34 billion in revenues when we are already far short of \nany attainable goal to meet the constitutional guaranteed balance by \nthat date. No matter the fact that the price of crude oil has fallen \nback to its low late in February.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, the majority leader is also \nadvocating of a $500 a child tax credit and a $500 annual credit for \nindividuals contributing to charities. His key advisers are urging a \n15-percent across-the-board tax cut. Billionaire Steve Forbes and \nadviser Jack Kemp are pushing a flat tax reduction. Meanwhile, \nPresident Clinton is inching toward more tax cuts as well. Where will \nit end? When will the tax bidding stop? When are we all going to \nrecognize that we are on the road to bankruptcy?\n\n  I have criticized President Clinton for his tax cut proposals as \nwell. But, by comparison, he is a piker. One thing is certain, \nPresident Clinton will not be around when the heavy lifting starts \nafter the year 2000. At best, Bob Dole would be approaching 80 years of \nage, in his second term as President. What an exciting prospect for \nkeeping promises.\n  I ask my colleagues on both sides, how on Earth can we debate a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget and then have a host of \ntax cuts in the wings that will worsen the deficit? And, yes, I say \nworsen the deficit, because the offset that the majority cobbles \ntogether or attempts to cobble together to pay for the tax cut will, in \nall likelihood, be something we are already counting on to help balance \nthe budget. You cannot spend the same dollar two or three times.\n  So, if Senators want to cut taxes and then ask me to join them to \nsupport a balanced budget amendment, they will soon find this Senator \nunwilling to go with them down that crooked road of no return. It is \nmadness. It is unconscionable. It is the biggest flimflam in history.\n  The American people should understand that if a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget by 2002 is followed by the tax cuts \nproposed or waiting in the wings by the majority, including a huge $180 \nbillion tax giveaway in the reconciliation bill, then future Congresses \nwill face by far the largest tax increase ever imagined. Such a \nhappening would be the height of fiscal and budget irresponsibility, \nand would saddle future Presidents and future Congresses with an \nunworkable fiscal dilemma.\n  In conclusion, if the distinguished majority leader is indeed earnest \nabout reopening a serious debate on a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, he will find a strong and willing ally in this Senator, \nas he has in the past. He knows that. I will not, however, be a party \nto this partisan charade. The numbers simply do not add up. We must \nrepudiate this partisan sham. The honest, fiscally conservative vote on \nthe Dole initiative is no.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have listened with some interest while \nmy colleague from Nebraska has spoken. I am sure it will come as no \nsurprise that I disagree with just about everything he has had to say, \nparticularly with respect to the majority leader and his position. But \nI will not speak for the majority leader. He is more than capable of \nspeaking for himself. I would like to get a few facts on the record \nthat I think need to be part of this debate.\n  Fact No. 1: Money does not come from the budget. I know that comes as \na great surprise to this body, but money comes from the economy, and if \nthe economy is growing and vibrant, there is lots of money in the \nTreasury. If the economy is shrinking or depressed it does not matter \nhow much the budget projected would be there, it will not be there. So \nthe one thing that frustrates me the most, coming from the business \nworld into the Congress, is this insistence upon making projections, \nall neat and balanced down to the last dollar, and then assuming that \nis the way things will turn out.\n\n  It is like a businessman who says at the beginning of the year, ``I \nproject we will have so much revenue from our business this year. \nAccordingly, I will adopt a budget for x amount to spend that much \nrevenue.'' I have been in that circumstance. We made projections for a \nbusiness that I was CEO of. As it turned out, we fell 10 percent short \nof our projections.\n\n[[Page S5808]]\n\n  That should not bother too many people. Ten percent is not that much \nmoney. The problem is, our spending was based on the projection of \nrevenue, and we had to change the spending pattern midyear, indeed \nmidmonth, when it became clear to us we were not going to make as much \nas we thought we were going to make. We had projected a 100-percent \nincrease in that business, and we had been doing that every year up to \nthat point. As it turned out, we only had a 90-percent increase. As I \nsay, we missed it by 10 percent. We had to adjust immediately or we \nwere headed for a loss year. We do not do that around here. We say oh, \nno, the budget projects such and such, so we will spend such and such, \nregardless of what happens in the real economy. Let me give the Senate \nan example.\n  We stood here, my first Congress, the 103d Congress, and heard \nprojections of how much money would come from the tax increase that \nPresident Clinton proposed. We heard numbers, hundreds of billions of \ndollars will come if this is done and we need to do this to balance the \nbudget. The deficit is so much, we are going to get so much, this is \nhow this is all going to work out. I put in the Record before, so I \nwill not do it again, an article by Marty Feldstein, one of the more \ndistinguished economists of this country, who, looking back after 2 \nyears, said, in terms of actual revenue, the Clinton tax increase \nproduced only one-third as much money as was projected.\n  Why? Simply because the economy reacted. People were faced with tax \nincreases in one category of their investments so they switched \ninvestments to someplace else to avoid taxes. You do not have to be, \nreally, very smart to figure out how that happens.\n  So President Clinton proposed a tax increase. It was passed by the \nprevious Congress, and then the results came in and the results were \nthat we only got one-third as much revenue as the President had \nprojected we would. People changed their behavior.\n  It is very hard to convince a computer that is what is going to \nhappen. The computers are programmed around here to assume the static \nanalysis, on and on and on. The Senator from Nebraska heaped great \nscorn upon the supply-siders and carried on with the kind of rhetoric \nwe have heard before in this Chamber about how it was the terrible tax \ncuts under Ronald Reagan that produced the runaway deficits we are all \nliving with. That has been repeated so many times that people are \nbeginning to believe it.\n  Mr. President, I do not have the time to give this argument again. I \nhave given it before, but I have discovered in the Senate there is no \nsuch thing as repetition. But I will do my best to summarize it.\n  In 1989, which was the last fiscal year we operated under the tax \nstructure that was created by Ronald Reagan, income taxes produced 8.6 \npercent of gross domestic product coming back to the Government. So, \nhowever big the economy was, 8.6 percent of that came back to the \nGovernment in revenue. Then said those: ``Oh, no, the terrible Reagan \ntax cuts have caused us to not have enough revenue. Tell you what we \nare going to do, we are going to have first the tax increase that \noccurred at Andrews Air Force base and then the Clinton tax increase \nthat came in the 103d Congress.''\n\n  And with those two successive tax increases, what did we get in \nfiscal 1995? The tax increase hit in 1993. What did we get in fiscal \n1995? If we got only 8.6 percent of gross domestic product under the \ndisastrous Reagan proposals, should we not be expecting 9, 9\\1/2\\, \nmaybe even 10 percent? The fact is, instead of going up, revenues went \ndown. Yes, down. In fiscal 1995, income taxes produced 8 percent of \ngross domestic product, almost 10 percent less of gross domestic \nproduct than was the case before.\n  It is very clear that the tremendous deficits that we have heard \nabout and we have talked about and we spend time on did not come as a \nresult of the Reagan tax cuts. Federal revenues went up every single \nyear under President Reagan. The economy grew rapidly. Once we came out \nof the recession that occurred at the beginning of Reagan's term, we \nhad the longest period of economic expansion peacetime in our history.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto continue for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, money does not come from the budget. Money comes from \nthe economy, and we have to learn in this body and the other body and \nin the White House to pay attention to the results from the economy \ninstead of spending all of our time reviewing the numbers of the budget \nand listening to the computers of the budget who project blindly into \nthe future without making the midcourse adjustments.\n  The record is very clear. The tax program that was followed during \nthe Reagan years produced record revenues--not reduced revenues, record \nhigh revenues. The problem of the deficit occurred on the spending \nside, and it occurred on the spending side because of the changing \ndemographics in the country and the growing spending on entitlements.\n  Nobody is to blame for that except the elderly who do not have the \ncourtesy to die with the same regularity that they used to, and I, for \none, do not want to call upon them to start doing that now just to \nbalance the budget.\n  But that is the new reality of the marketplace, that is the new \nreality of the economy, and we must adjust our rhetoric to that reality \ninstead of trying to go back and fuzz the factors of the past and say, \nsomehow, President Reagan is responsible for all of our difficulties.\n  No, our difficulties are rooted in the changes that are occurring in \nthe country. We must recognize that fact, and we must put in place the \nstructural discipline that will force us to recognize that fact in the \nform of the balanced budget amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I did not want to leave the statements made by the \nSenator from Nebraska unresponded to, responding to in my own name, \nrecognizing, as I said, that the majority leader is more than capable \nof responding in his own behalf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time from 1:30 \np.m. to 3:30 p.m. will be under the control of the Senator from \nWyoming, Senator Thomas.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for 5 minutes out of the time of the Senator from \nNebraska [Mr. Exon].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I rise to oppose this balanced budget \namendment, recognizing that some of the people in this Chamber, for \nwhom I have the most respect, are for it. But I oppose it to a large \nextent because of what I call the dilemma of enforceability.\n  My colleagues will recall that when this amendment was up earlier in \nthis Congress, we had tremendous amounts of debates on whether the \ncourts ought to be able to enforce this amendment. I made speeches \nagainst the difficulties that courts would have, the constitutional \ncrisis that it would put this country in, and how terrible it would be \nin a democracy to have nonelected, appointed-for-life judges who are \nnot available to the public making decisions about increasing taxes or \ncutting Social Security or cutting Medicare or cutting programs across \nthe board, judges who have no feel for these programs, who have no \nbackground in the programs, no staff to understand the programs coming \nin and making an order and saying, ``We're going to increase your \nincome tax,'' or ``We're going to cut your Social Security,'' or cut \nyour Medicare programs, or name a thousand other different Federal \nprograms.\n\n  I think it would be terrible, Mr. President. I think it would just be \nterrible. I think it would be the stuff of revolution, as people would \nsay, ``How did we get in this situation?''\n  Indeed, as we outlined these difficulties of this bill earlier when \nit was being discussed, finally the sponsors of the resolution agreed, \nat least they agreed to the extent they accepted an amendment. Some \nwould say they accepted the amendment just to get the necessary votes; \nothers would say they accepted the amendment because they knew it was \nthe right thing. But in any event, the amendment, as I understand it--\nthe Nunn amendment which is now part of this--states as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S5809]]\n\n\n       The judicial power of the United States shall not extend to \n     any case or controversy arising under this article, except as \n     may be specifically authorized by legislation adopted \n     pursuant to this section.\n\n  I suppose that is the present state of the amendment. What does that \nmean, Mr. President? It means this whole thing is a sham. It is either \nenforceable, and enforceable by the courts, so that the Supreme Court \ntells you what the size of your taxes are or what the amount of your \nSocial Security payment is, or else it is not enforceable, and it is a \nsham.\n  People say, ``Well, make your choice, Senator. You can't argue on the \none hand against the courts enforcing it and on the other hand argue \nthat if they don't enforce it, it's a sham.'' The fact of the matter \nis, that is the truth. Either horn of that dilemma is not breachable by \nthis amendment.\n  There is really only one way to balance this budget and to do so in a \nway that makes sense to the American people, and that is for the \nCongress to do it. That is because the Congress, in every district in \nAmerica, has an elected Representative who can come and represent the \npeople, go back home in town meetings and communicate with the people, \nbe on television, receive letters, respond to letters, communicate with \nthe public and, in fact, represent the people in the most fundamental \ndecisions that this country is made of; that is, what is the size of \nyour taxes, what are the amounts of your benefits, and what are the \nfunctions of Government.\n  That is central to a democracy, that is central to our country, Mr. \nPresident, and the public ought to be entitled to be heard on that. \nThat is why I think to try to get this automatic pilot, this \nconstitutional amendment just will not work.\n  We tried it before. We tried it with Gramm-Rudman. I voted against \nthe Gramm-Rudman because there is no magic automatic pilot. There is no \nsubstitute for elected Representatives making decisions in the interest \nof the public.\n  I remember when we passed Gramm-Rudman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, may I be allowed 3 additional minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 additional minutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. We had a provision in Gramm-Rudman called \nsequestration. My colleagues will remember that well. If the budget was \nnot balanced, or if we did not meet the target provided in Gramm-\nRudman, there was to be this automatic guillotine that fell. There was \ngoing to be a chopped-off spending by a prearranged formula, and it was \nall going to be arranged and that was going to substitute for the \nbackbone of Congress.\n  Of course, what happened, we got right up to look at that gleaming \nguillotine which was going to cut off spending, and the Congress, \npredictably, said, at least the opponents of Gramm-Rudman said, it was \ngoing to be this. We said, ``No, stay the guillotine, stay the \nsequestration, don't do it.''\n  Here we are with a different kind of guillotine. Either we are going \nto have a permanent block in the guillotine, which is what the Nunn \namendment says, nonenforceability, or we are going to go back to the \nold guillotine.\n  Mr. President, can you imagine what the American public would say if \nthe Supreme Court made an order that said, ``We're going to increase \nyour income tax by 50 percent?'' Why, there would be rioting in the \nstreets. You say, ``Oh, the Supreme Court wouldn't do that.'' Oh, no?\n  How is the Supreme Court supposed to balance this budget? You know, \nthey have to do it quickly. Do you think they can go through every one \nof these little programs, thousands of programs, and snip each one? \nThey cannot do that. They do not have that knowledge.\n  Can they cut them across the board? You cannot cut programs across \nthe board, Mr. President. There are contractual arrangements. You take \none of the budgets I have something to do with, the Corps of Engineers, \nthey go out and make contracts. You cannot come in and say, ``Well, \nwe're going to pay you 95 percent or 80 percent of that which you're \nentitled to under the contract.'' You cannot do that constitutionally. \nYou cannot do it in good sense. So you cannot cut things across the \nboard. You have to have big amounts of money. So where do those big \namounts of money come from? Two places--taxes or entitlements. You \nspell entitlements ``Social Security'' or ``Medicare.''\n  So, Mr. President, if anybody around here thinks that you can easily \ngive the Supreme Court of the United States the power to raise your \ntaxes and raise them big time, or to cut your Medicare and to cut your \nMedicare big time and raise these costs for our senior citizens, or do \nthe same thing with Social Security, you have to be kidding, Mr. \nPresident. People have not thought this through if they think the \nAmerican people would accept that or if they think that is sound \nGovernment or good policy.\n  The other horn of the dilemma is, if you make it nonenforceable, it \ndoes not mean a thing except for a campaign speech. It is a good \nsubstitute for real policy, which means that you really frustrate the \ngoal of the balanced budget. I mean, if you have this thing where you \nsay, ``Look, don't ask me to cut these programs. I have already voted \nfor the balanced budget amendment,'' then that is a good substitute for \nreal policy. The only thing we need to do, Mr. President, is exercise \nreal backbone, exercise real representation.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who yield \ntime?\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming Mr. [Thomas], is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to continue this discussion on the \nbalanced budget amendment. It has been a long discussion. It is not a \nnew discussion. It is one that has gone on for years. Unfortunately, it \nis one that is going to go on for a number of more years.\n  Let me comment for a moment on the presentation of the gentleman from \nLouisiana. I respect him very much. Certainly he is one of the most \npolished and dependable Members of this body.\n  I disagree with him in this instance. I disagree on the notion that \nsomehow the courts will inject themselves into this and this will not \nwork. I cite the fact that some 35 States, mine included, has it in \ntheir constitution. We have not had the problem with the involvement of \nthe courts.\n\n  The courts in some instances can come to the legislature, can come to \nthe Congress and say, ``What you have done is unconstitutional, and you \nneed to redo it.'' That is a legitimate function of the court. They may \ndo that, I suspect, in the spending area, but not to establish what you \nare going to spend. ``What you're doing is not right, and you have to \ndo it again.'' There is a substantial amount of evidence that that does \nwork.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Sure.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Is the Senator aware of the huge amount of experience \nin the States where they have either constitutional provisions \nrequiring a balanced budget or prohibiting the incurment of debt, or \nother constitutional provisions with respect to the raising of money \nunder which legislatures, by clever schemes, get around these \nprovisions?\n  I cite, as one of those, legislation that I was involved in, I mean, \nboth legislation and litigation--I hate to make this question too \nlong--involving the dome stadium in Louisiana where the law said, ``No \nbond issued under this amendment may bear the faith or credit of the \nState,'' and where the legislature and the Governor came in with a \nclever artifice and got around that, and you ended up with bonds which \nbore the faith and credit of the State. Or, more recently, where the \nLouisiana Constitution said it takes a two-thirds vote to raise taxes, \nand they created a special taxing district by majority vote which \nraised the money and raised the taxes and got around the constitutional \nprovision.\n  I cite those two examples as being typical of what has happened all \nacross this Nation in avoiding the effect of those. Is the Senator \naware of those?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Yes, of course. Let me give you an example. The Senator \nhas been here for 20 years, or whatever, and we have not balanced the \nbudget in the time the Senator has been here.\n\n[[Page S5810]]\n\n  The Senator points to some areas--I do not mean this personally--but \nthis has not been done. The Senator points to some possibilities that \nmight happen under a constitutional amendment. Look at what has \nhappened without one.\n  So I say to the Senator that--he talks about a sham. The sham is that \nwe have gone on for 25 years here and we have spent more than we have \ntaken in. Every time we talk about it, everyone who gets up in this \nplace says, ``I'm for balancing the budget. I'm going to balance the \nbudget.'' What is the evidence? The evidence is you have not.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The last 4 years we have cut down the deficit by more \nthan 50 percent.\n  Mr. THOMAS. By raising taxes, the largest tax increase in history, I \nagree. I did not vote for it. The Senator did, did he not?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I am sorry. I do not think that is the way to do it. I \nthink we are looking for some sort of discipline. We just have an \nhonest disagreement about this. I think that the constitutional \namendment provides the discipline within which this body or other \nlegislative bodies can work.\n  Obviously, the Senator mentioned Gramm-Rudman. It did not work \nbecause there was not the discipline. This body found its way to go \naround that, did they not? They said this is an appropriations but did \nnot score it under Gramm-Rudman.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Well, if the Senator will further yield?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Sure.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Should it be enforceable or not enforceable?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Of course, enforceable.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Of course, enforceable?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The Nunn amendment is part of it at this time.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I am not sure.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I am advised it is part of this, which makes it \nnonenforceable, save for an act of Congress. Then you have the Supreme \nCourt. I mean, should the Supreme Court be able to raise your taxes?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I claim my time back here. We can stand here, as we do, \nand as has been going on now since I have been here, in the House for 5 \nor 6 years, and particularly this year, and think of all these reasons \nwhy it cannot be done. ``Oh, so Social Security is there.'' ``Oh, it's \nnot enforceable.'' ``Oh, the courts are going to get into it.''\n  But, you know, you really come down to the bottom line. And the \nbottom line is this year, for the first time in 25 years, the Congress \nsent to the President a balanced budget. The President promptly vetoed \nit. So I think you have to ask yourself, is it morally and fiscally \nresponsible to balance the budget? Do we have a responsibility as \nrepresentatives of our constituency to say, ``Look, we're not going to \nspend more than we take in except in an emergency?'' I think that is \nreasonable. I know the Senator would agree to that. But that has not \nhappened. So we go into all these reasons and all these excuses why we \ncannot do that.\n  First of all, all we are doing is we are sending a constitutional \namendment to the States. The folks will have another chance to look at \nthis, which I think makes some sense. But I feel very strongly that we \nhave tried the other things.\n  Some say, ``Well, you shouldn't tamper with the Constitution. The \nFramers didn't put that in there.'' I do not think the Framers also \nexpected that you would have the largest line item in the budget being \ninterest on a debt that has been built up because we do not balance the \nbudget.\n  I think we are making some progress. I have to tell you that part of \nthe largest tax increase in history helps do that. I think on the other \nside of the aisle you found, for the first time, some people willing to \nreduce spending, cut that back some. The combination of those two \nthings are moving us in the right direction. There are two different \npoints of view on it. That is why we are going to vote one of these \ntimes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I will not prevail upon my friend to yield further. I \nthank him for yielding. I appreciate his courtesy.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Senator very much.\n  In any event, I just think it is time we have to take a look at what \nwe are doing. Certainly a balanced budget amendment is something most \npeople have thought was a good idea. A number of people on that side of \nthe aisle thought it was a good idea a couple years ago; now, in the \nlast time we voted, did not. Of course it takes two-thirds. It is a \ndifficult thing to do.\n\n  Mr. President, one of the things that we ought to talk about a little \nbit, and I think about a great deal, is, why is it important to me as a \ncitizen in Casper, WY, why is it important to anyone who pays their \ntaxes, and is part of this Government? It seems to me that is where we \nought to start.\n  First of all, I think a balanced budget has a great deal of impact on \nour lives. We have gone for a very long time with an unbalanced budget \nand we did not think much about it. There were no great discussions \nabout it until fairly recently. Why? Because the debt has gotten so \nlarge that very likely next year the largest line item in the budget \nwill be for interest of $260-some billion, which will not be available \nto spend in other areas.\n  People have made the good point that if we did not have the interest \npayment, the budget would be balanced. But we do. I have heard others \nsay, ``Let's get rid of the debt. It is just Government debt.'' That is \nnot true. You and I own Treasury notes. It belongs to people. It is a \nreal debt. We have to pay that interest. That is part of it.\n  Another is, if you did not take all that money out of the economy, we \nwould have, I think, a strengthened economy. We would have more jobs. \nInterest rates will be lower with a balanced budget. We have seen that \nhappen fairly recently as we move toward that. Those are things that \naffect you and me as we live at home and work.\n  This is not some esoteric exercise about budgets, about legislation. \nIt is a very real thing. Interest rates are lower on your home, on your \nschool costs for your kids, on your car. It is very real. It makes a \ngreat deal of difference for the economy to be stronger, and jobs make \na great deal of difference.\n  Furthermore, and maybe just as important to most of us, is that there \nis a moral and fiscal obligation with our Government to not spend more \nthan we take in. That applies to everyone else. But we say, ``Well, if \nwe want something and we do not have the money, we will charge it to \nour kids, our grandkids.'' That is what we have done.\n  This business of reducing the deficit, which is terribly important, \nhas nothing to do with the corpus of the debt. We still have $5 \ntrillion out there that we have not even started to do anything about. \nWe are still trying to reduce it. Over this 6-year period, as we move \ntoward a balanced budget, the debt continues to grow, the interest \ncontinues to grow.\n  Mr. President, I think it is fairly easy to get up here politically \nand go into great economic ideas and so on, but the facts are pretty \nbasic. That is, that it strengthens this country. It strengthens \nfamilies. It is responsible. It is morally right. We have not done it. \nWe need to do something different. The idea that you continue to do the \nsame thing and expect different results is simply not a realistic \nexpectation.\n  Mr. President, we have asked for some time--``we'' being the freshman \nclass--for the next 1\\1/2\\ to talk about this issue. I suppose some of \nus take a little different view than others in this body in that we all \ncame through the last election. We are very conscious of what our \nvoters said to us 2 years ago. Most of us would agree that one of the \nstrong messages was the Federal Government is too large and costs too \nmuch and we need to do something about that. If you talk about \nbalancing the budget in my State, it is one of the highest priorities \nof anyone there. I think those of us who have just been here now for \nless than a year and a half have a little bit of special interest in \nit. That is why we have asked for some time as freshmen, to have a \nspecial order on balancing the budget.\n\n  I yield to my friend and associate from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] \nis recognized for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank my friend from Wyoming, I thank the Presiding \nOfficer, and I thank my friend from Minnesota, who is ready to talk.\n\n[[Page S5811]]\n\n  This is an important debate. It almost is anticlimatic. The fact is \nthat it is widely reported in the press that we do not have enough \nvotes to pass the balanced budget amendment, an amendment that passed \nthe House of Representatives, that this is just an exercise. \nUnfortunately, it has been minimized as a result of that.\n  I think it is important. I am glad the Senator from Wyoming has been \nour leader on the floor on these issues, has taken the time to get the \nfreshman on the Republican side--the freshmen Members are all \nRepublicans; I guess that would be the Republican side--to get up and \ntalk about why we think this is important and why the public should be, \nagain, focused on this issue.\n  I do not think there is anything more fundamental for the Government \nto do than to run an operation that is balanced. Almost every State \ngovernment runs an operation that balances the budget every year. It is \nincumbent upon Government to act in a responsible fashion with the \ntaxpayers' dollars and do so in setting priorities. It is hard to do. \nYou have heard a lot about all the money that needs to be spent on a \nlot of different programs. There are a lot of things we need to do.\n  I see the pages down here and young people up in the gallery. I \nvisited high schools and colleges just over the last week during the \nbreak, and it is hard to look into the faces of the young people in \nthis country and say to them, ``Look, it is much more important for us \nto get reelected. It is more important for us to have an issue to scare \npeople on things like Medicare and education spending. It is more \nimportant for us to play politics, for our political career, than it is \nto solve the problems that face this country that are going to be \nburdening you to even a greater degree than it is burdening this \ngeneration of Americans.''\n  I think we need to do a little soul searching at this point. One \nthing I found when I got in the Congress, you can always find a reason \nto vote no. There is always something in every piece of legislation, \neven if it is one sentence, you can always find a reason, an excuse, to \nbe opposed to something and walk away from taking the responsibility.\n  I remember when I was in the minority in the House, it was very easy \nto walk away and say, ``I am in the minority. It is not really my job \nto move legislation here. Yes, it is a good bill, but maybe I will take \na pass on this because I am afraid of one little political twist.'' \nThat is what we have done here on the balanced budget amendment. We \nfound there are several Members who have found a reason to vote ``no''. \nThat is the Social Security issue. That is the reason to vote ``no'' on \nsomething they say they are for. And they protest, ``We want a balanced \nbudget,'' but it is the Social Security issue holding us back.\n  I think that balancing the Federal budget is bigger than any one \nsingle program in Washington. A lot of great programs have passed here, \na lot of not so good programs have passed here, but nothing rises to \nthe level of doing the basic fundamental requirement of any government, \nand that is to balance its books.\n\n  For those who hide behind Social Security, I say to them: Where were \nyou and where are you when it comes to doing something for these young \npeople on Social Security? Where are the brave souls who stride to the \nwell and say, ``We need to do Social Security reform because these \nyoung people who are paying taxes right now have absolutely no hope of \nseeing Social Security payments when they retire.'' Where are the brave \npeople who want to preserve Social Security, not as a political issue \nfor their next election, but as a real issue for the next generation?\n  I ask everyone who is hiding behind that issue, and I ask all the \npeople who are listening right now, to examine those Members and \nexamine the people who are using this issue and find out how truly they \nwant to protect Social Security. I believe this is just a political \nissue they can hide behind so they can vote no on something they really \ndo not want to do, which is the bottom line, balance our books, \nconstrain Government spending.\n  I am hopeful at some point we will pass this. I have a lot of faith \nin the American public that when elections come around in November, \nthey will send more Members to the U.S. Senate and Members of the House \nof Representatives, who will support a balanced budget--hopefully, from \nboth parties. They will send a clear message that, yes, we understand \nthat tough decisions have to be made, but that is why we sent you to \nWashington--to make the tough decisions to move this country forward.\n\n  So I am not discouraged at all. This is something that is going to \nhappen. We are going to balance this budget. We have passed one \nbalanced budget, which was not signed by the President. We passed major \nentitlement reform. Twice we passed welfare. We passed Medicare reform \nand Medicaid reform. We have done the heavy lifting to balance the \nbudget. People say that we can do it today. We have done it today. We \npassed the balanced budget. So do not talk to me about we do not need \nthis balanced budget because we can do it already. We did it already, \nand the same people who said we do not need the balanced budget \namendment voted against the balanced budget proposal we sent to the \nPresident. The same President who says we do not need a balanced budget \namendment vetoed the balanced budget resolution that we sent to him, \nwhich was the act to do that.\n  So, again, if you look at the Social Security issue, you know, it is \njust, we are for it, but we are going to hide behind Social Security. \nThe other argument is that we do not need the balanced budget amendment \nbecause we can do it ourselves. We did it ourselves, and they were \nagainst that, too.\n  So I think we just have to question what the real motive is here. Do \nthese people really want to balance the budget, or do they just want to \ntell you they want to balance the budget? I think the answer is pretty \nclear. When the rubber hits the road, when it is either ``yes'' or \n``no'' on a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, the answer \nis ``no,'' and their excuse is Social Security. When it comes to \nreforming Social Security, the answer to reform is, ``No, we cannot do \nthat, we cannot touch it.'' The other excuse is that we do not need \nthis because we can balance it ourselves. When we put one on the floor \nspecifying where the changes need to be made in order to put the budget \nin balance, the answer was ``no.''\n  So it is ``no'' to a constitutional amendment, ``no'' to Social \nSecurity reform, ``no'' to a balanced budget act. But, ``Yes, we are \nfor it. In general, we are all for this.''\n  Well, you cannot be for it and vote ``no,'' ``no,'' ``no'' when it \ncomes time to put your words into actions. I hope that at some point we \ndo put the words into actions and that we do it soon.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I also may \nproceed under the time set aside for Senator Thompson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am proud to be here today and to join \nwith my freshman colleagues as we stand firmly together in our support \nfor a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Sixteen \nmonths in the Senate have not dulled our enthusiasm for its enactment. \nWe are more committed today than ever before.\n  Mr. President, it is a rare occasion in life when a person is granted \na second chance, an opportunity to right a wrong. When those moments \ncome along, we hope that we have learned from our mistakes and that \nwhen we are given that chance to approach things differently, we will \nstep forward and do the right thing.\n  My colleagues and I have an opportunity this week to do that right \nthing and repair a wrong made within this Chamber a year ago when we \ndenied the American people, by a single vote, the balanced budget \namendment that they have repeatedly called upon us to pass.\n  The balanced budget amendment lies at the heart of what I believe to \nbe the defining issue of the 104th Congress: deciding the priorities of \nthe Federal Government and its budget.\n  Naturally, there have been disagreements over where these priorities \nlay. Each of us have different ideas about how the Government should--\nand, more importantly, should not--spend the taxpayers' money. But even \nwith\n\n[[Page S5812]]\n\nthese disagreements, there are several basic principles on which we \nshould all agree. The balanced budget amendment embodies these common \nareas of agreement because it deals with the future of our children and \ngrandchildren, and, therefore, it deals with America's future.\n  After all, that future is what our efforts to ensure a balanced \nbudget are all about. In order for our children to enjoy the same \neconomic security that we inherited from our parents, we must begin the \nprocess of controlling our Federal spending. Our parents and \ngrandparents did not leave us a debt to pay--even after financing such \nmajor undertakings as World War II. They paid those bills and did not \npass that debt on to us. But this generation has compiled a $5 \ntrillion-plus debt that we are now going to be asking our children and \ngrandchildren to pay, and we cannot even reach an agreement on \nbalancing the budget so we do not continue to do that.\n  With a balanced budget, then and only then, can we hope to pass on to \nour kids an inheritance of prosperity rather than a lasting legacy of \ndebt. Right now, that future does not look so bright if we do not \nchange our ways.\n  This year, the national debt has surpassed the astounding figure of \n$5 trillion. It is increasing at an average of $650 million every day. \nEven today, we are spending more on our interest payments than we are \nspending to defend this Nation.\n  By the way, as of 12 o'clock this afternoon, every child born in this \ncountry today already owes $19,357.86 as their share of the national \ndebt. The moment they are born, they are $19,000-plus in debt. Over his \nor her lifetime, that child can expect to pay over $187,000 in taxes \njust to cover the interest on that debt. That is about $4,700 a year, \nor more than $400 a month that they are going to pay just to cover the \ninterest on that debt.\n\n  To meet its annual interest obligations, Congress has repeatedly \nraised the taxes of working Americans. As a result of an overwhelming \nburden of taxes, families now are having a tough time raising their \nchildren, paying their bills, and trying to make ends meet.\n  The Congressional Budget Office projects that spending on mandatory \nexpenses, such as interest on the debt, will exceed 70 percent of total \nFederal outlays by the year 2003--meaning that less than 30 cents of \nevery tax dollar will be available for education, environmental \nprotection, crime prevention, and highways.\n  Is that the legacy that we want to leave to our children? For that \nreason, we should all agree that balancing the budget without raising \ntaxes must be the foremost goal of this Congress.\n  It is our responsibility and duty to ensure the American children of \nthis generation and the next a strong economy, a good education, a \nclean environment, and a debt-free future, but also that they have the \nability to have their own dollars in the future to continue the efforts \nand not just to pay interest again on this Congress' mistakes.\n  A constitutional amendment mandating a balanced budget is perhaps our \nbest hope. There are those who question the need for an amendment \nrequiring a budget that is balanced. After all, they argue, should a \nresponsible Congress not be able to balance the budget without the need \nfor a constitutional requirement? Yes, we certainly should. Congress \nshould have the backbone to limit its spending and set priorities, just \nas every Main Street American family has to do.\n  If a family in my State of Minnesota wants to buy a house, it works \nout a mortgage and a payment schedule that fits the family budget. \nEventually, that debt is paid; it is not passed on to the next \ngeneration. That is what the vast majority of Americans do when they \nmake a major purchase. But that is not how the Federal Government \noperates. It borrows the money, without any kind of schedule for paying \nit back, except to go and raise taxes, or borrow it in the name of our \nchildren, and that debt continues to build, and the payments keep being \ndeferred. And the debt, again, is passed down to our kids.\n  We often hear the argument of the need for borrowing and spending \ntoday to help our kids. Those short-term arguments will, in fact, in \nthe long-term, harm the very people that those arguments say they want \nto protect.\n  If that family in Minnesota decides it needs to tighten its belt, it \ndoes. Congress simply punches another notch or two in the leather. \nCongress simply does not have the backbone to restrain itself; it never \nhas and maybe never will.\n  Look at the facts. Congress has spent more than it has taken in for \n55 of the last 64 years. We have not bothered to balance the budget \nsince 1969. But for my colleagues who sometimes get lost in statistics, \nhere is the reality of what our fiscal irresponsibility means to \naverage Americans. Today, every family of four owes $3,500 on the \ninterest on the national debt. That means $3,500 less to care for our \nkids, $3,500 less to keep our families fed and clothed.\n\n  A balanced Federal budget would actually put those dollars back into \nthe family budget. Economists have universally predicted the positive \neffects achieved with a balanced Federal budget. By the time 6 years \nhave passed and the budget is brought into balance:\n  GDP will grow by an additional $10.8 billion than it would under \ncurrent law, interest rates will drop, and Americans will boost their \nspending power through an additional $32.1 billion in real disposable \nincome.\n  A decrease of just four-tenths of a percent in the mortgage rate \nwould save the buyer of a $100,000 home some $10,000 over the life of a \n30-year mortgage, and there are estimates that interest rates could \nfall a full 2 percentage points, which would create even greater \nsavings.\n  An additional 104,000 family homes would be built, and 600,000 more \nautomobiles would be sold. That is good for the economy, that is good \nfor jobs, and that is good for everyone.\n  Job providers would be empowered to create new jobs and pay higher \nsalaries for those jobs, as many as an additional 6.1 million new jobs, \nby some estimates.\n  Makes the minimum wage increase look petty, does it not? So what does \nall this really mean on Main Street? Well, for an average American \nfamily with two kids, a mortgage payment, car and student loans, a \ncouple of pets and lot of monthly bills, a balanced Federal budget \nwould put nearly $1,800 a year back into the family bank account by the \nsavings that we would reap from a balanced budget. Let people earn \nmore, and then let them keep more of that money. There are those in \nthis Congress on this Senate floor who say no, that Americans need to \ngive Washington their money, and then come ``hat in hand'' begging for \nour compassion as Washington then sits in judgment of who gets what. \nAnd who are they going to take that money from to pass it out?\n\n  Coupled with the $500-per-child tax credit that makes up the \ncornerstone of our balanced budget legislation, a typical family of \nfour would reap a balanced budget bonus of $2,791 every year.\n  Yes, the concept is simple enough, and those practical statistics \nshould be all it takes to convince anyone of the need for a balanced \nbudget. But our internal battles over the past year have demonstrated \njust how difficult it is to carry out such a seemingly simple idea. We \nhave proven, more than ever before, the need for a balanced budget \namendment.\n  Through the commitment of this Congress to eliminating the deficit \nand erasing our debt without raising taxes on middle-class families, we \nwere able to move $40 billion closer to a balanced budget last year by \ncontrolling the growth of government spending and rooting out a great \ndeal of waste and inefficiency. But as each of my colleagues will \nremember, it was a battle that took every ounce of our energy.\n  Because of the opposition of the President and my colleagues across \nthe aisle to even these modest, sensible spending reductions, we \nendured 2 protracted Government shutdowns, 14 temporary spending \nmeasures to keep the Government from running out of money, 3 \nPresidential vetoes of our appropriations bills, and a final veto of \nour actual balanced budget legislation. At the end of the day, we had \nmoved closer to a balanced budget. I am proud of our efforts. We must \nnot stop working for a balanced budget amendment, however.\n  Under the leadership of a Republican Congress, each and every person \nis\n\n[[Page S5813]]\n\ndedicated to achieving a balanced budget by the year 2002. If this \nCongress could not force the big spenders in this body and the White \nHouse to mend their money-hungry ways and balance the budget through \nsimple legislation--just as past Congresses could not do in 1964, 1976, \n1978, 1979, 1980, 1985, 1987, and 1990--what chance do future \nCongresses have without the moral authority of the U.S. Constitution to \nback them up?\n  The American people know it will never happen without a balanced \nbudget amendment, and they are calling on us--overwhelmingly--to pass \nit. Again, if we pass this balanced budget amendment, all we are doing \nis going to give the States and the voters of those States the \nopportunity to say yes or no. We do not make that decision on this \nfloor. We are saying we are going to give the American people the \nopportunity to say yes or no to a balanced budget. But there are some \nthat do not believe the American people can make that decision.\n\n  A Gallup Poll published just 2 weeks ago in USA Today showed that an \nastounding 83 percent of the American people support this amendment. It \nwas the most popular item surveyed, and why should it not be? It makes \nperfect sense.\n  In Minnesota last year, just days before the Senate voted on the \nbalanced budget amendment, I was joined at the capitol in St. Paul by \nmembers of my State's House and Senate delegations, elected officials \nfrom both sides of the aisle who were less interested in party labels \nthan ensuring America's economic security. On behalf of working \nfamilies who cannot understand why Washington refuses to get its \nfinances under control, on behalf of families who are terrified by the \nlegacy of debt we are building for our children and grandchildren, we \nsigned a petition urging Congress to immediately pass the balanced \nbudget amendment and send it to the States for ratification.\n  Together, we sent a strong, unqualified message to all Minnesota \ntaxpayers that we heard their message and were no longer willing to \naccept business as usual from the Congress.\n  Today, we are all a year older, a year wiser, and just as committed \nto our purpose as we were 1 year ago.\n  Unlike the Federal Government, which has managed to amass a $5 \ntrillion debt, Minnesota does not rack up debt year after year.\n  Unlike the Federal Government, Minnesota does not spend beyond its \nmeans, building deficits that will take years to wipe away.\n  Unlike the Federal Government, Minnesota does not promise the Moon, \nwhile mortgaging the stars in order to deliver.\n  Why is it that Minnesota has succeeded where the Federal Government \nhas failed? Why have 48 States abided by a balanced budget every year? \nBecause the Minnesota State Constitution requires that we balance our \nbudget, as do 48 other States.\n  Not only does Minnesota and 48 other States have to balance their \nbudgets, but families and individuals have to balance their budgets, \ntoo. Businesses that cannot balance their budgets soon find themselves \nout of business. The only place where a balanced budget is not the rule \nis in Washington. That is what we are here to change.\n  As support for a balanced budget amendment grows among the public, \nthe fear of what it will mean to those who have built their careers so \nrecklessly spending the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars have \nintensified. As we move closer and closer to enacting this critical \nlegislation, they see the writing on the wall, and frankly, they are \nscared, so scared, I have been told there may be colleagues of mine who \nwould change a vote they made on behalf of this legislation a year ago \nto vote ``no'' this time around.\n\n  Well, the public should be outraged that there are those to whom a \npiece of legislation so vital as the balanced budget amendment is \nnothing more than a game, and their vote nothing more than a political \npoker chip, to be traded at will when the stakes begin to rise.\n  I would remind those colleagues of mine who speak out against this \namendment that we would not be having this debate were it not for 30 \nyears of deficit spending by this body. If we let the American public \ndown again--as we did on March 2 of last year, when this Chamber turned \nback the balanced budget amendment--we will feel the anger of the \npeople at the polls in November, and I believe they will speak with an \neven louder, more unified voice than they ever have before.\n  As I conclude, I turn to the words of President Thomas Jefferson, a \nleader who understood the importance of economic freedom in a free \nsociety, and the dangers of imposing our fiscal burdens onto our \nchildren.\n  He wrote:\n\n       The question of whether one generation has the right to \n     bind another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts, morally bound to pay them \n     ourselves.\n\n  Mr. President, those words are just as relevant today as they were \nwhen penned by Jefferson nearly 200 years ago, during the founding days \nof this Republic.\n  For all our differences--in beliefs and purposes--we should all share \nthe common goals of building a better economic future for the coming \ngenerations, and giving them the freedom to seek success unfettered by \nany constraints we may impose. As we debate the merits of the balanced \nbudget amendment, let us not lose sight of that goal. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment, and to do it for the sake of our \nchildren and our grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, we continue down the road toward \nbankrupting our country. The fact that I keep repeating this, and that \nothers keep repeating this and perhaps we get used to hearing this, \ndoes not make it any less true. It cannot be repeated often enough. And \nbehind closed doors Democrats, Republicans, people in the Congress, \npeople in the White House, all admit what has to be done to keep from \nturning this country into one that is second rate when we leave it to \nour kids.\n  The most frustrating part of the last year and a half that I have \nspent in the U.S. Senate is witnessing close up the fact that we do not \nhave the ability or the willpower to do what we all know is necessary \nand what we all know is the right thing to do. That is why I believe \nthat our last clear chance to do so is undoubtedly a constitutional \namendment to require us to balance the budget.\n  We all know that Medicare is on its way to insolvency. We all know \nthat Social Security is on its way to insolvency. We claim to have \nreached a consensus in this country that we need a balanced budget--not \nonly that but that we need to balance it with real numbers and not \nphony numbers; and, not only that, that we need to do it in 7 years.\n  But with all of this knowledge and all of this consensus and \nagreement behind closed doors and all of this coming together in terms \nof what needs to be done, we cannot take the first step. We have spent \nthe last year to year and a half proving to the American people that we \ncannot really take the first step toward doing what we know has to be \ndone. And yet there are those among us who continue to say we do not \nneed a balanced budget amendment. Of course, we need to balance the \nbudget, but we do not need a balanced budget amendment to require us to \ndo so. All we have to do is to do the right thing.\n  I challenge anyone to give any evidence over the last year, year and \na half that we have shown any ability or will to do the right thing. It \ndoes not exist.\n  We talk about a 7-year balanced budget. The President has a proposal. \nWe have a proposal. Under the best of circumstances, even if either of \nthese proposals were adopted, it is doubtful that it would be carried \nout; the proposals are back-end loaded. The President has some 60 \nsomething billion of cuts in the last 2 years of that 7-year time \nperiod. It is extremely doubtful, to say the least, that those cuts \nwould actually be made when the time came. It is a matter of rolling \nour sins forward for yet a few more years when most of us are out of \noffice and do not have to face the consequences and under the \nassumption that future Congresses will have the courage that we do not \nhave except we are making their\n\n[[Page S5814]]\n\njob tougher than the one we have today.\n  Even if it does happen, even if we get everything we want, for \nexample, on this side of the aisle, we are looking at the end of that \nroad at a $6 trillion debt. We are looking at the end of that road at \nthe imminent retirement of the baby boomers. And the people who keep up \nwith the demographics point out to us what that is going to mean.\n  By the year 2030, there will be twice as many people over the age of \n65 as there were in 1990 and only 20 percent more workers, so those \npeople paying in those FICA taxes for those retirement programs are \ngoing to be dwindling in number while the retirees are expanding. We \nall know what the results of that are going to be.\n  We all know we cannot continue down this road, and yet it is another \nelection year and so the President vetoes our attempt to balance the \nbudget. He opposes our attempt to pass a constitutional amendment, and \nour friends on the other side of the aisle fall in in lockstep.\n  Mr. President, this is not an esoteric economic issue. It is about \nthe future of this country and the kind of America we are going to \nleave and what it is going to look like to our kids. What it is going \nto look like is astronomical tax rates they are going to be paying if \nwe continue the spending pattern that we have had. It is going to mean \nastronomical interest rates that they are going to be paying. It is \ngoing to mean more and more reliance on foreign money and foreign \ninvestment coming into this country to help us pay the interest on the \ndebt.\n  It is going to mean diminished savings. We already have the lowest \nsavings rate in the industrialized world, the United States of America \ndoes, one of the lowest investment rates in the industrialized world in \nthe United States of America. That is why we are looking at such low \ngrowth rates. You add to that the taxes that are going to be necessary \nto finance this astronomical debt as it goes out here, the interest \nrates that are going to come from that, and you are talking about \neconomic disaster that is facing us. There is really not any serious \ndebate about that. And all those people who complain about any kind of \neffort to balance the budget because they are looking out for the kids, \nthey are looking out for the elderly, they are looking out for the \nyoung folks, what are you going to say to those young folks then when \nthey cannot even go out and buy their first home when they start their \nfamilies? What are you going to say when they cannot even buy a car \nbecause of the interest rates? And the tax rates they are going to pay. \nIt will not make sense to work any more under those circumstances.\n\n  Yet we heard in the last couple days now the latest bid in the tax \ncut game from the President is to finance 2 years of college for \npeople. I can only say we can debate that issue later, but we better be \nfinancing maybe 10 or 15 years of college for people because they \nbetter stay in college. There are not going to be any jobs out there \nfor them at the rate we are going. Everybody cannot go to college and \nstay forever. There has to be a work force out there, and they have to \nhave reasonable interest rates to pay when they go to buy the items to \nbuild their family. They will have no need to buy a home. We are making \nit so they will not be able to do that.\n  We are the first generation in our history that even considered \nborrowing against our kids and those yet unborn to finance our own \nconsumption. That is shameful. That is what we are doing. And yet we \ncontinue to say we do not need a constitutional amendment; we just need \nto do the right thing, when today, even today, every man, woman, and \nchild is paying $1,000 a year just to finance the interest on the debt.\n  Some say, well, we are making progress. We passed the largest tax \nincrease in the history of the world, and we temporarily reduced the \ndeficit, knowing that when the baby boomers start retiring in the next \nfew years, it looks as if a rate that is slowing down is going to go \noff the charts in an upward direction.\n  We say, well, look at what we did last year: We cut $23 billion from \nthe budget from the year before. A drop in the bucket, Mr. President. \nWe did not touch any of those areas that are increasing, some at the \nrate of 10 percent a year, that are going to have to be reformed if \nthere is any hope of saving them.\n  Yet now we hear all of the same old arguments against the balanced \nbudget amendment--we should not be tinkering with the Constitution. And \nI certainly think we should not be tinkering with the Constitution. But \nthe Founding Fathers assumed that changed circumstances required us to \nseriously address our Constitution from time to time.\n  I would say the circumstances have changed. Thomas Jefferson and \nGeorge Washington never thought about the possibility of bankrupting \nthe next generation before they were even born. Those are the changed \ncircumstances we are looking at today.\n  I would also say, Mr. President, if we have an economic meltdown in \nthis country, there are going to be changes in regulations, there are \ngoing to be changes in statutory law, and, yes, there are going to be \nchanges in the Constitution that are worse than our worst nightmares \nright now about what those changes might be. So the answer to that is \nto make some reasonable changes to get us on a flight path that shows \nsome possibility of saving ourselves from ourselves.\n\n  Is that a pitiful situation or not? Of course it is. It should not be \nthat way. But we have given ourselves now ample opportunity under all \nkinds of circumstances to so-called do the right thing, and yet here we \nare a year, a year and a half later. Every time somebody makes a \nproposal, the other side goes on television with 30-second attack ads \nto make sure we do not do anything responsible, because this is an \nelection year. And yet they say we do not need a constitutional \namendment. I say we need to do whatever is necessary to keep from \nhanding this country over to our kids in a way that we would certainly \nnot want our parents to have handed it over to us, and they, in fact, \ndid not.\n  The other argument we hear, of course, is one that the opponents of \nthe balanced budget amendment want to protect Social Security. Mr. \nPresident, in my brief time here I have learned that if you want to \nstop something, if you want to throw a roadblock in the way of \nsomething being accomplished, you run out the old Social Security red \nherring and try your best to scare the elderly, because if you can \nscare the elderly, you can create enough temporary political confusion \nthat you can prevent any kind of reform.\n  This is, of course, what has happened again. Six of my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle in 1994, when there was no chance of a \nconstitutional amendment for a balanced budget passing, voted for the \namendment. Last year, when we had a real good shot at getting it \npassed, we fell one vote short. One Senator switched back and voted \nagainst the constitutional amendment. And the reason for that is they \ndiscovered that it might have endangered Social Security in some way.\n  The argument goes that because we include the receipts that go into \nSocial Security and the expenditures that go out of Social Security in \nthe entire budget, in some way that is endangering that program, and if \nwe somehow pulled it out and set it over here to the side, that in some \nway would protect it. Of course, it is an appeal to fear. It is an \nappeal to ignorance. It has no relationship to reality.\n  It has been pointed out on this floor by my Republican and Democratic \ncolleagues alike. Senator Simon of Illinois just the other day, of \ncourse, pointed it out as a fig leaf that some will try to hide behind \nbecause they do not want a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget. Time magazine called that argument ``mendacious nonsense,'' the \nidea that the constitutional amendment to balance the budget would \nsomehow endanger Social Security.\n  The fact of the matter is, only if we get the reforms necessary to \nkeep from bankrupting this country can we protect and preserve Social \nSecurity. So the contrary of that argument is the case. Not to mention \nthe fact that all we are doing is treating it the way that we have been \ntreating it for three decades in this country, Democrat and Republican \nadministrations alike.\n  President Clinton's last budget kept it all together, just the way we \nhave always done. We did not hear any cries from our friends on the \nother side of the aisle when that happened. They voted for it. They \nvoted for that budget, to keep all Government revenues\n\n[[Page S5815]]\n\nand all Government expenditures together. You are not looking at a \nrealistic situation if you do not consider them together. We all agreed \non that. So the Johnny-come-lately argument.\n  Not to mention the fact that if, in some way, Social Security was \nsequestered from the entire budgetary process, that would make, of \ncourse, balancing the budget impossible because it would require $360 \nbillion more cuts than what we have to make now. We have shown we \ncannot do what is necessary now, but if the income and the outflow of \nSocial Security were taken out of it, we would have to cut programs \nanother $360 billion. The opponents of the balanced budget amendment \nknow this. They know it would make it absolutely impossible to be \nworkable under those circumstances. We strained and fought for a year \nand a half. We got $23 billion in cuts--not $360 billion, but $23 \nbillion.\n  But the point they make is that Social Security is now in surplus, so \nif you put it all together in the general budget, the general budget is \ngetting the benefit of Social Security because it is in surplus and it \nmakes the deficit look smaller. And it is true. It is true. That is the \nway the books are kept, and that is true, when you talk about for the \nnext 15 years, for the general budget.\n  You know, those are Americans, too, getting the benefit of the \ngeneral budget. Many of the same people who get the benefit of Social \nSecurity get the benefit of the programs in the general budget. But for \nthe next 15 years, the numbers on the Social Security side will assist \non the general budget side. And that is true.\n  But typical of the way that we think in Washington, DC--which is, if \nwe are lucky, a couple of inches past our nose--we are not looking down \nthe road. We are not caring about anybody but ourselves. We are not \neven caring about our own children. Because look at 16 years out. \nSocial Security is in surplus now, but along about 2011, Social \nSecurity goes into the red, and we will be paying out more in Social \nSecurity, at a steeper and steeper rate, than we are taking in. So, by \nbeing a part of the general budget, under those circumstances Social \nSecurity gets the benefit of that, because where is the money going to \ncome from to make the Social Security payments if not from the general \nbudget?\n  Nobody, no opponent of this measure, is coming here and saying we \nneed more Social Security taxes. Nobody wants to advocate this. So \nwhere is the money going to come from?\n  The point is, approximately $850 billion annually will be needed by \nthe year 2030 to fund Social Security, to pay current the liability \nover and above payroll tax receipts. So, by the year 2030, Social \nSecurity is going to need $850 billion from somewhere. We are in \nsurplus now, but here is what it is going to look like starting about \n2011. But by 2030, we have dug a real big deep ditch for ourselves. \nNobody wants to talk about that.\n\n  Mr. President, just to repeat, the so-called saving Social Security \nby not going along with the bookkeeping entry that we have done for \nthree decades, Democrats and Republicans, is a total red herring, a \nfigleaf to hide behind by those who do not want to stop the culture of \nspend, spend, spend, and hopefully elect, elect, elect in a campaign \nyear.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I urge we take what I referred to \nearlier as this last clear chance that I believe we have this year to \ntake that first step--it is not a solution; goodness knows we are a \nlong, long way from a solution--but to take this first step toward \ndoing something responsible so we can hand this country over to our \nkids and to our grandkids in halfway decent shape, the way our parents \nand forefathers did for us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes from Senator \nThomas' time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the question I fear most as a Senator \nis not a question from a news reporter, it is not a question from a \nconstituent visiting my office, it is not a question from a constituent \nat home; it is the question that I fear my grandchildren will ask me, \nand it is this. ``If you were a Senator back then, why didn't you do \nsomething? Why didn't you balance our budget, so my family would be \nable to have jobs and afford an education?'' Mr. President, that is the \nquestion I fear the most.\n  A great-grandparent, born in 1900, paid about 24 percent of the \nfamily income in Federal, State, and local taxes. That is after the \nbenefits were taken out. A 26-year-old mother today, who may be working \nin an office or raising her children at home, will pay at least 34 \npercent of the family income in taxes after benefits. That is already \none of the highest levels in our country's history. But if we do not \nchange our ways, the real bad news comes for her children. Her young \nbaby will pay 84 percent of lifetime income in taxes if we do not \nbalance the budget in this country. That is what it will take to \ncontinue our current policies for Government spending. Our \ngrandchildren cannot support such a burden of spending, debt and \ninterest. At 84 percent, they will not be able to find jobs at all, \nmuch less pay their bills.\n  I do not ever want to be asked why I did not change the course of \nthis country. I did not come to Washington to support the status quo. I \ncame to change the way they do business in Washington, DC. I came to \nget Washington off the backs of the hard-working American people so \nthey can earn more and keep more of what they earn. That is the \nAmerican dream.\n  With a balanced Federal budget, the Joint Economic Committee \nforecasts that interest rates will fall by 2 percent. Let us look at \nwhat that means for the American family.\n  Senator Phil Gramm came up with this chart to talk about what it will \nmean to each family to have interest rates lowered by 2 percent. Our \nchildren's education? We would save $1,369 on a 10-year student loan \nbecause interest rates would be 2 percent less. There would be a $680 \nsaving on a car loan over 4 years. For a small business, it would mean \na savings of $4,716 on a 8-year loan.\n  Farms that are struggling right now, especially in my home State of \nTexas, where we have a terrible drought, nevertheless have loans to \npay. A 2-percent drop in interest rates would save the farmer $2,067 on \na 6-month loan.\n  What most Americans pay the most interest on is homes. On a home \nmortgage, 30 years, a 2-percent drop in interest rates would create \n$1,880 per year in savings--almost $2,000. That is like saying we are \ngoing to cut your taxes $2,000 just by balancing the budget. So, with \nmore interest kept in our pockets instead of paid to the bank, we will \nbe able to send more of our children to college, give more of our \nchildren jobs in small businesses, and earn enough to pay for our homes \nand cars.\n  Yesterday, my office got a letter addressed to all Senators signed by \n91 interest groups asking us to oppose the balanced budget amendment. \nIt was signed by all sorts of groups: Labor unions representing \nteachers, postal workers, Government employees and auto workers; the \nAmerican Association of Retired Persons; the League of Women Voters; \nthe Americans for Democratic Action, several environmental groups; and \nseveral churches of many different faiths.\n  Why did 91 of these groups come together? What is their common bond? \nThey are asking the hard-working people of America to work for their \npriorities. Many of these groups balance their budgets every year on \nthe backs of the American taxpayer, the same taxpayer who goes to work \nevery day hoping to earn enough money to do a little bit better for \ntheir children.\n  These groups had the nerve to say, ``The American public has a right \nto know how a balanced budget will be achieved before a balanced budget \namendment is enacted. Which important programs--education, health care, \nSocial Security, transportation, job training--will either be \ndramatically cut or eliminated threatening America's vital interests?''\n  That was the question asked by these 91 groups. Where have they been? \nWhere have they been for the last 2 years? For the first time since \nGovernment careened out of control, we have done exactly that. We have \ntold the American people exactly how we will balance the budget over 7 \nyears, and we are asking for a constitutional amendment that will \nassure that once we do\n\n[[Page S5816]]\n\nthe work to balance it, that never again will a Congress be able to rob \nfrom our future generations to pay for what we are going to do today.\n  This Republican Congress has passed a balanced budget twice. It \nbalanced a budget last year that did not touch Social Security, that \nallowed for increases in Medicare and Medicaid, that funded education, \nthe environment, job training and transportation, and protected our \nchildren by cutting taxes on their parents and providing their futures \nwill be deficit free.\n  But, what happened? President Clinton vetoed the balanced budget. So \nwe have delivered a balanced budget in writing, and if they are looking \nfor the details, they can look in President Clinton's wastebasket. And \nwhile they are there, maybe they will look at some of the promises that \nhave been made by the President, because 4 years ago yesterday, June 4, \n1992, President Clinton told the American people on television that if \nhe was elected, he would present a 5-year balanced budget plan. He went \nback and forth on that over the last few years, but then when he did \nsubmit what he called a balanced budget to Congress, he did it by \nsaying that all the tough cuts would come after the year 2000 when he \nwould be gone, if he is elected to a second term.\n  I think that is the difference between the President and the \nCongress. The President has said one thing and made those promises and \nhe has done something entirely different. Congress said what they would \ndo in 1994, and they have kept their promises to the American people. \nWe have set our priorities, and we have kept our promises.\n  So when the interest groups line up to oppose change, I think they \nshould really consider what they are doing to their own members. Do the \nauto workers want to lower interest rates so they can build and sell \nmore cars? Do the Government employees want lower prices on their homes \nso they can afford their part of the American dream? Do retirees want \nto leave a better world to their grandchildren? I know they do, because \nthey contact my office all the time saying that they do.\n  To make this happen, we must change the way we do business in \nWashington. We must stop the deficit spending and make sure that no \nfuture Congress does it again.\n  To stop the deficit spending, we need a permanent constitutional \nprotection so that we will not be able to go out and borrow money on \nour children's future. The more the population ages, the more economic \ngrowth stagnates from high tax, slow growth policies the more urgent \nour problem will become.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote with me to take action now to protect \nour country's future for our children by passing the balanced budget \namendment and sending it to the States for ratification. We will be \nbetter remembered by our grandchildren if they have the same kind of \nAmerica that we have been privileged to grow up in. And, Mr. President, \nI do not want to face my grandchildren 20 years from now and have them \nask the most dreaded question: ``If you were a Senator back then, why \ndidn't you do something?''\n  We can take action on the balanced budget amendment this week, and we \ncan set the future course for our country and for our children and for \nour grandchildren.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am authorized to yield such time from \nSenator Thomas' time as I may need.\n  Mr. President, in a free country, some questions are never answered \nfinally and definitively but must be addressed anew by each generation. \nIt is, I think, for that reason that the words of Thomas Jefferson at \nthe beginning of our Nation's history are so apposite today. Thomas \nJefferson said:\n\n       To question whether one generation has the right to bind \n     another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of Government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts and morally bound to pay them \n     ourselves.\n\n  That method of phrasing the question in Thomas Jefferson's time is \nevery bit, if not more, applicable today during the course of this \ndebate as it was almost two centuries ago.\n  This debate is most fundamentally about a moral question, about our \nright as Members of Congress, as representatives of the people of the \nUnited States to spend money, to advance programs--however well-\nintentioned, however successful--for which we are not willing to pay \nand to send the bills to our children and our grandchildren.\n  The question is practical as well as moral: Constant deficits, the \nincrease in the burden of debt, the increase in the rate of interest \nwhich the Federal Government must pay on that debt and, equally \nsignificant, the interest rates individuals must pay when they purchase \nhomes or automobiles, that businesses must pay when they wish to expand \nand give more opportunity.\n  Burdens--the burdens of regulation, the burdens of a large \nGovernment--are enhanced by unbalanced budgets, by the creation of \nbureaucracies, agencies, rules and regulations for which we are \nunwilling to pay but are willing to undertake only because we can send \nthe bill to someone else.\n  Mr. President, there are a series of objections to this proposal. I \nhope it is not oversimplifying it by saying in some connections, they \ncome from those organizations and those individuals who simply fear for \nthe survival of their programs if present-day taxpayers are required to \npay for those programs. Those fears are perhaps well-founded.\n\n  Clearly, if this amendment were a part of the Constitution of the \nUnited States, we would spend less on today's programs. We would be \nrequired to set priorities to determine which are the most important \nprograms to a far greater extent than we do at the present time.\n  A second objection which I have heard is, ``Oh, it won't be \nenforceable anyway. People will find escape valves, ways to get out \nfrom under the requirements of this constitutional amendment.''\n  A third is that we are turning the entire proposition over to the \ncourts of the land, that courts will be able to impose taxes or cut \nspending if the Congress does not do it itself.\n  These are just some of the parade of horrible theories with which \nopponents regale us during the course of this debate. Some of them may \nor may not to a certain extent have a degree of validity.\n  But the other half is reality, Mr. President. For all of the fine \nwords about our balancing the budget without a constitutional \namendment, no Congress and administration has done so in 30 years. Yet, \nthere has hardly been a Member of this body or the other body during \nthat three decades who has not given lip service to the proposition \nthat a balanced budget is a good idea. It has just not been quite so \nimportant as some other idea which each of those hundreds, perhaps \nthousands at this point, of Members of Congress have had. Reality, in \nother words, Mr. President, speaks far louder than any words we can \npossibly state.\n  I must admit that I was persuaded by some of those arguments a decade \nago. I voted against a predecessor to this constitutional amendment \nbased on the proposition that Congress ought to do the job itself. \nWell, Mr. President, fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame \non me. It had not happened before I came to this body; it has not \nhappened since I came to this body.\n  I simply leave off with the proposition that if we do not change the \nstructure in which we operate, the same excuses, the same reasons will \nbe presented a decade from now that are being presented here today, and \nit is very likely that we will be no closer to that balance, that we \nwill continue to pile unjust burdens on our successors, that we will \ncontinue to fail the moral duty that Thomas Jefferson outlined for us.\n  Just last year this constitutional amendment was defeated, largely by \nthe votes of Members of this body who said, ``We don't need a \nconstitutional amendment. We simply need the moral courage to pass a \nbalanced budget ourselves.''\n  We took up that challenge, Mr. President. The Presiding Officer was a \npart of it. I was a part of it. We did, in fact, in this body and in \nthe House of Representatives pass a balanced budget plan that would \nhave met the requirements of the constitutional amendment had it been a \npart of the Constitution. We did that for the first time\n\n[[Page S5817]]\n\nin 30 years. And we were faced with a veto by the President of the \nUnited States.\n  In turn, the President of the United States then presented what he \nclaimed to be a balanced budget, though all of the heavy lifting, all \nof the significant spending cuts would not take place until after the \nnext President's full term had expired. That has not been accepted.\n  As recently as 2 weeks ago, Mr. President, for the first time in \nseveral decades, a group of Members from both parties in this body, \nDemocrats and Republicans, came together and came up with an \nalternative proposal for a balanced budget that significantly impacted \nthe entitlement spending programs which are at the heart of our deficit \nchallenge. But, Mr. President, they failed, even though they got 46 \nvotes out of 100 in this body. They failed. And they failed, among \nother reasons, because of the deafening silence from the President of \nthe United States, a silence which communicated disagreement, \ndisagreement based on the proposition that the President of the United \nStates would no more have signed that bipartisan proposal than he would \nthe Republican proposal of last December.\n\n  So, Mr. President, why should anyone listening to this debate believe \nthat what has not taken place for 30 years will take place if this \nconstitutional amendment is defeated? Every element in our history \ntells us that it will not. Each individual Member is more committed to \nsomething that he or she considers more important than the balanced \nbudget, absent the discipline this constitutional amendment will impose \non us.\n  So, Mr. President, I think this debate comes down to our own \nindividual answers to a series of questions.\n  Do we really want a better economic future for our children and \ngrandchildren?\n  Do we want them to be able to live in better homes because mortgage \ninterest rates are lower?\n  Do we want them to have greater opportunities and more choices of \njobs in a more prosperous economy?\n  Do we want their incomes to be higher because their Governmental \nburdens are less?\n  The answer to each of these questions, of course, from everyone here \nis in the affirmative.\n  But the fundamental question, Mr. President, is, do we want those \ngoals for the future badly enough to do something about it, badly \nenough to take a difficult vote at this particular time?\n  Do we, Mr. President, want to live up to the advice of Thomas \nJefferson? Do we care enough about our ethical and moral \nresponsibilities to those who come after us to say, ``The present \nsystem has not worked. We need a new system''?\n  Only if we pass this constitutional amendment, only if we allow this \ndebate to take place in 50 State legislatures, as they debate the \nconfirmation of such a constitutional amendment, will we carry out our \nduties.\n  History tells us, Mr. President, that we will not do it on our own. \nThis constitutional amendment is needed. We hope for the endorsement of \nthe President, which we are almost certain not to get. But we hope, \neven more significantly, for the courage, the concern for the future, \nthe concern for our economy, the concern for our moral duties that can, \nin my opinion, only be carried out if this constitutional amendment is \npassed and submitted to the States for their ratification.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I yield myself such time from the time of \nSenator Thomas as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, we are talking today about the balanced budget \namendment that we will soon be voting on again. There have been several \ndifferent kinds of comments made about the need for the balanced \nbudget, probably the two most prominent being, No. 1, the fact that in \nthe short-term we will all be financially better off if the Federal \nbudget is in balance interest rates will immediately begin to come \ndown. All economists agree that interest rates will drop once the \nmarket understands that we are going to balance the Federal budget. \nThat 1-, 2-, or 2.7-percent drop in interest rates, depending on which \neconomist you believe, means Americans will have more money to put in \ntheir pockets immediately.\n  In my home State of Arizona, the average home mortgage is just under \n$100,000. The interest that would be saved as a result of balancing the \nbudget for every Arizonan with that average home mortgage would amount \nto $2,655 every year--$2,655. This is real money. For the average \nstudent loan it is $547. So, if we here in the Congress can pass a \nbalanced budget amendment and send that to the States for ratification, \nthe markets will adjust, will lower interest rates, and all of us will \nbenefit as a result of that, through immediate financial savings.\n  There are many other ways this occurs. The Federal Government has \nborrowing costs which I will discuss here in a moment. Those borrowing \ncosts are reduced. As a result, we do not have to pay as much in taxes \nto cover those borrowing costs. It applies all throughout the economy, \nboth the private sector and the Government sector. Balancing the budget \nwill reduce interest rates, and that will mean money in our pockets. \nThat is an immediate benefit for all Americans, regardless of income \nstatus, regardless of where they live. It is very, very important.\n  Second, Mr. President, the other primary argument about the balanced \nbudget has been the valid observation that we owe our children and our \ngrandchildren the promise of a future that will be as good for them as \nour lives have been for us. We want them to have as much opportunity as \nwe have had. That will not be the case if we continue to run up the \ndebt and then ask them to pay it in the future. It is very much like \nyoung people getting in over their heads with their credit cards. We \nknow that credit card interest rates are pretty high. Soon after you \nhave loaded up your credit card, you can hardly make the monthly \npayments. You have to sell one of the two cars you own. You have to \nmaybe take out a second mortgage on the home, or in a case I know, \nsomeone had to sell their home to pay the interest accumulating on this \ndebt. That is what we are asking our children and grandchildren to do \nif we keep increasing the Federal debt with annual Federal deficits.\n  Until there is a balanced budget amendment this is not going to stop. \nHow do we know that? Some of our colleagues who opposed the balanced \nbudget amendment last year made the argument, ``If you just let us do \nit, we will do it. That is what we were elected to come here to do, to \nmake the tough decisions.'' We said, ``All right, let's do it.'' For \nthe first time in 26 years, Mr. President, we passed a balanced budget, \non November 17, 1995. The problem is on December 7, 1995, President \nClinton vetoed that balanced budget. Because of the impossibility of \noverriding his veto, we have not been able to agree upon a budget that \nwould achieve balance. That is, until just 2 weeks ago, at which time \nthe Republican Senate again passed a new budget that would be in \nbalance after 6 years.\n  This effort to ensure that our children and grandchildren have the \nsame kind of future that we have had also has very real monetary \nconsequences. I have a brandnew grandson, whose name is Jonathan. He \nowes the Federal Government $187,000. He is a year old. This is kind of \na tough burden for him. That $187,000 is just to pay the interest on \nthe Federal debt during his lifetime. That does not pay anything else. \nIt does not pay for defense, for education, for health care, or for \nanything else; it just pays the interest on the debt. But that is how \nmuch he owes. It is unfair.\n  One of the reasons that I ran for the U.S. Congress when I did was to \ntry to ensure that when I finally left this world, I left it better off \nthan I inherited it. I have now acquired a position of great honor and \nopportunity to try to do something about that commitment that I made. \nAll of us have said the same thing in one way or another. If we are not \ncommitted enough to do something for these young children and \ngrandchildren that we have, to guarantee that they have as good a \nfuture as we have had, then we are not doing our job. We understand \nthat, without the\n\n[[Page S5818]]\n\nconstraints that are required to comply with the Constitution, we are \nnot going to balance the Federal budget, and those kinds of obligations \nare going to continue to be imposed upon our children.\n  I said in the beginning that those were the two primary arguments for \nthe balanced budget amendment. I do not see how anybody can argue that \nthey should not call for the adoption of the amendment. I wanted to \nfocus on a different aspect of it that still relates to this question \nof interest payments because I think it puts into perspective how far \nout of whack this has become.\n  I want to relate some figures on how much in the way of interest we \nare paying. What is the interest we are talking about again? This is \ninterest on the accumulated $5 trillion-plus in Federal debt. Each \nyear, we have a Federal budget deficit that adds to that debt and, \ntherefore, adds to the interest. Here is what the interest payments now \namount to. Compare this first with 1965, 30 years ago. The Federal \nGovernment in that year paid $8.6 billion in interest. I remember a \ncouple of days ago when I was presiding, and the Senator from Illinois, \nSenator Simon, who has been a very strong advocate of the balanced \nbudget amendment and who, unfortunately, is going to be leaving the \nSenate at the end of this year, said--talking about the figure of $9 \nbillion--``Back then, $9 billion was a lot of money.'' It reminded me \nof one of his predecessors who represented the State of Illinois, \nEverett Dirksen, who was famous for saying, ``A billion here, a billion \nthere, pretty soon you are talking big money.'' Here is what this $9 \nbillion in 1965 has come to. In 1995, 30 years later, instead of $9 \nbillion in interest, the Government paid $232 billion in interest. In \njust 30 years, it went from $9 billion to $232 billion.\n  What does that mean in terms of the obligation of the average family? \nIn 1965, that interest cost of a little under $9 billion amounted to \n17.6 percent of all individual income taxes paid. In 1995, the $232 \nbillion in interest cost was over 30 percent of income taxes. In other \nwords, just think about April 15 when you paid your tax bill. Almost \none-third of that was interest on the Federal debt. What did the \nFederal Government get for that? What did we get for that? Absolutely \nnothing. That is just interest on the debt. It did not buy a single \nairplane for defense, it did not buy anything regarding health care or \neducation or support for the elderly, or any other Government program \nthat is of interest to the people of this country. It just paid the \ninterest on the debt.\n  Now, let us compare it to a couple items in the Federal budget. Let \nus compare it to national defense. In 1965, 30 years ago, interest \ncosts were 16.9 percent of the outlays for defense in that year. But, \nin 1995, this $232 billion in interest costs was almost 85 percent of \nall outlays for defense. In other words, here is the defense budget. \nThirty years ago, we paid, in interest, about 17 percent of what we \nwere paying for defense. Today, we pay, in interest, 85 percent of what \nwe are paying for defense. In other words, it is almost getting up to \nthe same amount that we pay for defense, which is the single largest \ncomponent of our discretionary budget.\n  So let us compare it to our discretionary spending. In 1965, interest \ncosts were equal to 38.9 percent of all domestic discretionary \nspending. Domestic discretionary spending is the money we spend for \nagriculture, for subsidies, for health care, for defense, and all of \nthe other things. But, in 1995, that interest cost was 92 percent of \ndomestic discretionary spending. In other words, Mr. President, we paid \nalmost as much in interest costs as we did for all of the domestic \nprograms that were funded by the Federal Government.\n  So, Mr. President, it is clear that this interest cost is huge, it is \ngrowing, it is not productive, and it takes money that could be spent \nfor other things. As a result of reducing this interest expense, we \nwould all be far better off, and it will not happen unless we pass an \namendment to the Constitution to require a balanced budget.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Instead of going bankrupt in the year 2002, as they had \npreviously forecasted, the trustees now conclude that Medicare will go \nbankrupt in the year 2001--just 5 years from now.\n  For the past year and a half, this Republican Congress has attempted \nto deal honestly and forthrightly with the impending Medicare meltdown. \nWe have put forward a budget that would protect, preserve, and \nstrengthen Medicare by reducing the unsustainable rate of growth, while \nstill allowing for a healthy growth rate.\n  We did not claim that our plan was perfect or that it solved a long-\nterm problem. But it was a real attempt to alleviate a crisis that will \nimmediately impact 37 million Americans and will have repercussions on \ntens of millions more.\n  Along with our proposals to provide for short-term solvency in the \nMedicare trust funds, I also suggested, on numerous occasions, that \nPresident Clinton appoint a blue ribbon, bipartisan advisory committee, \nsimilar to the one I served on in 1983 that rescued Social Security, to \nhelp deal with this long-term crisis in Medicare. I was interested to \nsee that Secretary Shalala made a similar recommendation today.\n  My response to the initial report of the Medicare trustees was based \non my belief that leadership means more than just talking about the \nproblem; it also means doing something to solve it. It is also clear to \nme that if we are to be successful, we must put politics aside and work \non a bipartisan basis.\n  Unfortunately, President Clinton has been unwilling to do that. Ever \nsince the trustees--three of whom are members of the President's \nadministration--issued their original report, the administration has \nchosen to either ignore the warning of Medicare's impending bankruptcy, \nor to engage in a very sad campaign to frighten America's senior \ncitizens.\n  It is an undeniable fact that the Republican proposal allowed \nspending for Medicare beneficiaries to increase from $4,800 to $7,200 \nper person over 7 years. It is also an undeniable fact that in their \nill-fated health care reform proposal the Clinton administration \nadvocated slowing Medicare's rate of growth. Despite that fact, \nhowever, the President vetoed our Medicare proposal. We have heard \nnothing--nothing at all--but attacks on Republicans for ``slashing and \ncutting'' Medicare. When the President was asked not long ago why he \ncontinued to use these terms even though they are not true--and I \nhappened to be listening to the press conference--he said that the \nmedia made him do it. Maybe they did. But he has been doing it.\n  With the release of today's report, the inescapable conclusion is \nthat, while the rhetoric flew, Medicare was put at further risk. Those \nwho say that talk is cheap should now know that 18 months of misleading \nrhetoric may have gained points in the opinion polls, but it also put \nMedicare another $90 billion-plus in the red.\n  The bottom line is that the 37 million Americans who depend on \nMedicare deserve better. Future generations of Americans who will need \nMedicare deserve better.\n  The choice is clear. America's leaders can spend the next 5 months \nfocusing on the next election, thereby allow Medicare to grow ever \ncloser to bankruptcy; or we can focus on the next generation, and do \nwhat we must to save Medicare.\n  It will not be easy nor simple. The solution cannot be a shell game, \nmoving money from one part of Medicare to another. A tax increase is \nalso not the answer.\n  I call on the President to come forward with real initiatives so we \ncan preserve the Medicare Program and to join with Republicans on a \nbipartisan basis, as I have proposed before, to address this very \nserious problem.\n  So we have 37 million Americans who depend on Medicare. That is the \nbottom line. Future generations are looking to whether or not there \nwill be any Medicare trust fund or any Medicare benefits. I think we \nneed to fix Medicare just as we fixed Social Security in 1983 on a \nbipartisan, nonpartisan basis.\n\n[[Page S5819]]\n\n  I remember walking onto the Senate floor in 1983 right in that \naisleway when we thought everything had evaporated--collapsed. I met \nSenator Moynihan coming in the door. And we stood here and talked for 2 \nor 3 minutes about we could not let this happen; there were too many \nmillions of Americans who depended on Social Security. So together we \ngot it back on track. And the end result is we did in effect rescue \nSocial Security.\n  Now someone is going to be asked to do the same with Medicare. I \nwould call on the President to stop running the TV commercials, to stop \ntrying to scare senior citizens, to stop trying to frighten seniors \nwith some of the ads paid for by union dues. Millions and millions and \nmillions of dollars have been spent on political attacks and TV attacks \non Republicans who want to fix, preserve, and strengthen Medicare.\n  Today is the day of reckoning. Today even the administration says, \n``Oh, well. We ought to fix this.'' We are going to fix it, or it is \ngoing to be bankrupt. And I believe it will be fixed.\n  So the President now I understand would like to work it out. He has \nhad a whole year to bash Republicans, a whole year to scare senior \ncitizens, and now he understands--at least the people around him \nunderstand--the seriousness of this shell game.\n  So I call on the President to come forward with real initiative so we \ncan preserve the Medicare Program and join with us. As I said, our plan \nis not perfect either. Maybe we can come together. This is a very \nserious problem. It is not going to go away. It is not going to go \naway. The trustees' report is very clear on that particular area. It is \nnot going to go away. We have to fix it. We have to stand up and be \ncounted.\n  We cannot have it both ways. We cannot scare seniors on the one hand \nand fix it on the other. It is time to tell the American people the \ntruth. It is time to tell the American people--to give the American \npeople the facts.\n  So I would be prepared--I am certain my colleagues will be prepared--\nto work with the administration if in fact they want to work on a \nbipartisan basis. This is serious business--37 million Americans who \nwant us to make progress to do it the right way--to preserve and \nstrengthen Medicare.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I referred earlier to the Bob Dole we know and love. I \nearlier remarked because he and I have worked to try to balance this \nbudget over the years. More particularly I put in the Record a \nstatement, and the vote and record made of the Greenspan commission \nupon which the Senator served where they recommended that Social \nSecurity after a period of years be off budget. Of course, the vote the \nSenator and I both joined in doing just that. In 1990 we put it off \nbudget. The law was signed by President Bush. Now we have the Senator's \namendment, and he got my vote. If we just do exactly what he intends, I \nthink here in section 7, ``total receipts shall include all receipts of \nthe U.S. Government except those derived from borrowing.'' That has \nbeen interpreted as borrowing from the public. Why borrow from Social \nSecurity? In other words, we owe Social Security $530 billion. These \nbudgets which have been put out by both sides all use Social Security. \nSo by the year 2002 we will owe $1.1 trillion.\n\n  So you can pick up not only my vote. By the letter we sent --I have \ntalked to these Members; five of us, and at least more--pass this \nconstitutional amendment by just protecting borrowing from the public \nbut in conformance with the law which the Senator and I support; not \nborrow from Social Security. In other words really eliminate the \ndeficit rather than move the deficit from the general Government over \nto the Social Security fund.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me indicate first that I acknowledge the Senator's \nefforts over the years to face up to the budget problem. He has \ndemonstrated it with his votes. I think in this case though--I do not \nhave the amendment before me. I know what it says. I think if we do \nthat over a period of years, others would like to do it right now--we \nphase it out. I think the Senator is saying he would prefer we do it \nimmediately. We have been doing it the way proposed here for some time. \nEven in the 7-year budget plan we proposed, of course, we did not use \nSocial Security.\n  So our view is--my view on this balanced budget which I will discuss \ntomorrow--is that we need to make it very clear precisely what we are \ndoing because we need this discipline. We need to send this to the \nStates, and give the States a chance to ratify it. If Kansas does not \nwant to ratify it, or South Carolina, or Arizona, or Idaho, that is \ntheir right. But if three-fourths of the States do not ratify the \namendment it does not became part of the Constitution.\n  I think the Senator from South Carolina also shares our views on \nMedicare. He is one Senator who will not stand here and let Medicare go \nbelly up. I hope that there will be enough bipartisan support that \nwhatever the problem is can be remedied and remedied very quickly.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If the distinguished Senator will yield, we would not \ndo it immediately. In other words it would be part of the Senator's \njoint resolution, or balanced budget amendment, to the Constitution, \nand as the Senator's comments just indicated it would go back to the \nStates for several years to be ratified. In the meantime, it would be \nin there and protected but it would not control immediately. And while \nthey are ratifying we could be working, as the Senator indicated, to \nbring it into line without using Social Security funds.\n  So I do not see the harm done if we could just include that. We can \npass the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  Mr. DOLE. I would be pleased to look at anything the Senator \nsuggests. The Senator from Idaho, I believe, has about the same \napproach. At least it might be the same result obtained by the Senator \nfrom South Carolina. He will be our next speaker.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/05/senate-section/article/S5818-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5819-S5830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the joint resolution.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I yield such time from the time of the Senator from \nWyoming as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, as we listen to this critically \nimportant debate on the balanced budget amendment, we hear all of the \ndifferent figures. The fact that $19,000 is owed by every man, woman, \nand child currently in America; the fact that we spend almost $300 \nbillion in interest on the debt--all of these numbers. But I have a \nhard time understanding this. How do you put that in perspective--how \nbig is that--in the few moments that I am going to speak? Because I am \ngoing to make the formal part of my speech a part of the Record. But in \nthe few moments that I am going to speak--that is 5 minutes--we will \nhave $5.5 million in interest payments.\n  So what does that equate to? That means that instead of paying that \ninterest we could put 100 police officers on the street. It means that \nduring those 5 minutes that I will be speaking we could instead use \nthat $5.5 million to immunize more than 45,000 kids in America. It \nmeans that we could provide a year of Head Start for almost 1,500 kids \nin America. That is what we are consuming just in the few moments that \nI will be speaking.\n  Today, as I walked over here, I saw all the Americans that are \nvisiting this Nation's Capitol today. I think it is tremendous to see \nthe citizens coming and seeing this Nation's Capitol. Just outside the \ndoor are the rich portraits that we have of George Washington and the \nFounding Fathers. We think about our history and what this country is \nfounded upon. George Washington said in his farewell address to the \nNation that he warned Congress to ``cherish public credit and to use it \nas sparingly as possible avoiding occasions of expense.'' And Thomas \nJefferson, who believed so strongly in a balanced budget, said that it \nwas so important ``as to place it among the fundamental principles of \ngovernment. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle \nposterity with our debts and morally bound to pay them ourselves.''\n  Those are the principles upon which this Nation was founded.\n  So how have we abided by those words? Are we paying our debts as we\n\n[[Page S5820]]\n\ngo? No. The last time that we had a balanced budget in the United \nStates of America I was 17 years old. I now am the father of a 17-year-\nold daughter.\n  It has been a generation since we have had a balanced budget. We do \nnot have the discipline, so we need to make it part of the \nConstitution.\n  Now I want to just step back, Mr. President, and address the big \npicture. Again, we mention all these numbers. But I just hope all \nAmericans realize that while we try to get a two-thirds vote in the \nSenate of the United States, because it has passed in the House \nalready, the balanced budget amendment, that does not mean we have \naccomplished a balanced budget for the country.\n  That simply means Congress is saying we will now put the question to \nthe 50 States of the Union because we are the United States of America. \nWe are not the Federal Government of America, so we place that question \nbefore the 50 States so that the people of America can affirm whether \nor not they feel we should have a balanced budget amendment.\n  It is hard for me to understand how this body can come to the \nconclusion that for some reason we must not ask that question of the \nAmerican public. It is inconceivable especially when you look at the \ntrack record of how we have so poorly spent those finite resources, the \ndollars of the citizens of America, because it is not the Government's \nmoney. It is the people's money, and they should be brought into this \nprocess.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota has the floor. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 1 hour.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to yield time to the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, [Mr. Bumpers] as soon as Senator Bumpers comes to the \nChamber. Following that, I intend to make some remarks about this \nsubject.\n  I see Senator Hollings from South Carolina is in the Chamber. I \nlistened intently to Senator Hollings and always enjoy his \npresentations. He knows this subject. As the former Chairman of the \nBudget Committee he has been involved in this subject for a long, long \ntime. And I think if one looks at the record of Senator Hollings on \ntaxing and spending issues, no one in this Chamber could credibly argue \nhe does not want a balanced budget. No one has been a more vigorous \nfighter for a balanced budget in the Senate than Senator Hollings from \nSouth Carolina. The point Senator Hollings has made is there is a right \nway to do this and a wrong way to do this.\n  This is a copy of the Constitution. This copy is a little small \nbooklet, the kind that Senator Byrd, our distinguished colleague from \nWest Virginia, carries with him. He is fond of saying this is his \ncontract with America, the Constitution of the United States.\n  This, incidentally, was written over 200 years ago by 55 men--55 \nwhite men, to be exact--who convened in a small room in a place called \nConstitution Hall, the assembly room of Constitution Hall in \nPhiladelphia, PA. Those 55 men spent the summer writing a Constitution \nfor our country. I was selected to be one of 55 people who on the 200th \nbirthday of the writing of the Constitution went back into the same \nroom and held a celebration, a 200th birthday celebration of the \nwriting of this remarkable document, the Constitution of the United \nStates. And on the 200th anniversary, 55 of us went into that room, 55 \nmen, women, minorities--a wonderfully diverse group of Americans \nconvened in that room.\n  That little room up in Philadelphia has at the front of the room the \nchair where George Washington sat--yes, the very chair sat in by George \nWashington as he convened and chaired, presided over, the \nconstitutional convention.\n  If you read the accounts of the deliberations, Ben Franklin sat over \non this side, Mason, Madison. Thomas Jefferson was not there; he was in \nEurope. But he contributed through his writings enormously to the Bill \nof Rights of the Constitution. But you could not help, while sitting in \nthat room celebrating two centuries of the Constitution of the United \nStates, you could not help getting some goose bumps about what all of \nthis is about.\n\n  This is the longest surviving, most successful democracy in the \nhistory of humankind. This democracy survives because the Constitution \ngives the power to the people. It is a country that belongs to the \npeople.\n  The Constitution starts:\n\n       We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more \n     perfect Union, establish Justice, ensure domestic \n     Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the \n     general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to \n     ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this \n     Constitution for the United States of America.\n\n  ``We the people.'' This is quite a remarkable document in the history \nof humankind.\n  Some in this Chamber view this as a mere rough draft. We have had \nover 140 proposals in this Congress alone to change the U.S. \nConstitution. I do not see many people walking around here who look \nmuch like Ben Franklin or Thomas Jefferson. And I worry that this \nCongress on a dozen different initiatives believes it can improve on \nthe work of our Founding Fathers, who created a document that provides \ntimeless truths about how democracy can work to serve the interests of \nthe people.\n  I am going to talk about that in the context of this debate, a debate \ntoday about how to change, or whether to change, the Constitution in \norder to deal with this issue of deficits and fiscal policy. But before \nI begin that discussion, I want to call on my colleague from Arkansas, \nSenator Bumpers.\n  Senator Bumpers, like a lot of Senators in this Chamber on both sides \nof the political aisle, is someone for whom I have deep respect. No one \nhas served this country more honorably and provided better service in \nthe cause of democracy than my colleague from Arkansas, Senator \nBumpers. He not only is, I think, probably one of the best orators of \nthe Senate in many decades; he is a person with a remarkable depth of \nknowledge about these budget issues. He sees where we have been, where \nwe are heading, what is important, what we ought to be doing for the \nfuture of this country.\n  So I am just delighted to yield whatever time he may consume. Let me \nyield 20 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas, [Mr. Bumpers].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Arkansas, \n[Mr. Bumpers], is recognized for up to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, first, I thank my distinguished friend \nfrom North Dakota for yielding. Second, I especially thank him for his \nvery generous laudatory comments, all of which are true, of course, and \nto thank him for his very valiant, noble efforts in the cause of \nconstitutional government.\n  He made an observation which I have made many, many times but frankly \nacross the Nation seems to fall on deaf ears, and that is we are the \noldest democracy on Earth. Our Constitution, which should be sacred to \nall of us, is the oldest organic, existing law in the world, and yet \nmany of my colleagues want to treat it as an unfinished, rough draft. \nEvery time we have a politically popular thing crop up in this country, \neveryone wants to amend the Constitution. Without denigrating specific \ncolleagues, nor really denigrating the Senate as a body, I do not know \na single person in the Senate that I want to defer to instead of James \nMadison, defer to instead of Benjamin Franklin, defer to instead of \nJohn Adams or John Jay.\n  Arthur Schlesinger, one of the preeminent historians of this country, \nhas said, and I think with a great deal of acumen and accuracy, in 1787 \nthe greatest gathering of minds ever assembled under one roof met in \nPhiladelphia to craft this document which we solemnly swear, when we \nare sworn into the Senate, we will support and defend--the Constitution \nof the United States.\n  Is that a sacred, solemn oath we take, or is it something we do just \nfor political reasons, because we have to, or because of legal reasons? \nI have heard it said in this body that 83 percent of the people in this \ncountry when asked, ``Would you favor a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget,'' 83 percent of the people say yes. What they do \nnot tell you is that 83 percent of the people of this country also say \nthey are contemptuous of politicians who have to look at a poll in \norder to find out what they think.\n\n[[Page S5821]]\n\n  The Senator from South Carolina, from Oregon, the rest of us, have a \nsolemn duty to be educators as well as legislators. The people of my \nState did not all attend law school and study constitutional law. They \nhave not all read ``The Federalist Papers.''\n  I am chagrined, irritated, and angry because in this body we want a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. We want a \nconstitutional amendment to limit terms of Senators, as though the \npeople of your State do not have enough sense to know who they want to \nvote for; or a constitutional amendment that would ban flag burning; a \nconstitutional amendment that would require our children to recite \ncertain prayers in school, and on and on it goes. This is just a snipe \nhunt. As a matter of fact, this amendment gives snipe hunting a bad \nname.\n  What does this amendment do? Sam Nunn, our distinguished colleague \nfrom Georgia, when we considered this before, very thoughtfully added \nan amendment saying the courts will not have any jurisdiction over \nthis. I am not sure we can legislatively make that decision here, but \nassume we can; that answers the question ``Will all Federal courts have \njurisdiction?'' Under the Nunn amendment, they would not. But let us \njust assume that, as my good friend from South Carolina is wont to say \nvery often in this Chamber, we pass a budget resolution to say this \nbalances the budget, pat ourselves on the back, give ourselves the good \nGovernment award, head on home and tell the constituents how great we \nare.\n  But, wait, some person that is aggrieved says, ``Look, that budget \nresolution is based on flawed assumptions about revenues and \nexpenditures. You have it all out of kilter.'' Would he have a right to \ngo to court and demand that Congress do this thing right, the way the \npeople of this country told them to do it? I do not know the answer to \nthat.\n  Will the Congress be required to raise taxes and cut spending to \nachieve it? Can they do it all one way or the other? I suppose they \ncould, but I am not at all sure. Numerous questions remain unanswered. \nHow does this amendment force Congress to reach an agreement about \nwhich specific spending cuts or which tax hikes we should adopt?\n  Finally, if you go to court, do you have standing? And what if the \nSupreme Court says this is a political question, which they often do \nwhere politicians are involved; where does that leave it? High and dry, \njust like we were last fall.\n  Mr. President, I have listened to a good portion of this debate from \nmy office on C-SPAN. I cannot believe people come to the floor and they \nsay, ``I do not have the courage to make the tough choices, to vote for \na balanced budget; therefore, please vote for this constitutional \namendment so the courts or the law will make me do it.''\n  Frankly, I do not want to get too strident or partisan about this, \nbut if I were sitting on the other side of the aisle, that is exactly \nwhat I would be saying.\n  In 1993, every Member in this body, every single Senator, had a \nchance to vote for a meaningful deficit reduction package. It has been \nsaid over and over, but it bears repeating, that when we adopted that \npackage in, I think, August 1993, not one Republican could find it in \nhis heart to vote to reduce the deficit by $500 billion. The Vice \nPresident sat in the Presiding Officer's chair and cast the tie-\nbreaking vote. Two-hundred and fifty billion dollars in tax increases, \n$250 billion in spending cuts. You cannot find a better way to start \nreducing the deficit. And OMB said, if you pass this, over the next 5 \nyears the deficit will be $500 billion less than it would otherwise be.\n\n  Mr. President, that turned out to be grossly wrong. The figure now, \naccording to OMB, is $846 billion.\n  Bill Clinton, to his eternal credit, I do not care whether you like \nhim or do not like him, but I can tell you one of the reasons he is \ngoing to be reelected President is because he did not sit around \nwaiting for a constitutional amendment to do something. He submitted a \npackage of deficit reduction proposals to this body and we adopted it \nwithout one single Republican vote.\n  I inform my Republican friends who are all so enthusiastic about this \namendment today, that deficit reduction package we adopted constitutes \na reduction not of $500 billion, but $846 billion. So, my Republican \nfriends, my question is this: Why not repeal it? You did not like it \nthen. You are trying to kill the gas tax part of it now, which has to \nbe the silliest thing I have ever heard. But I want to ask you, why not \nrepeal it if it was that bad?\n  We lost two of the finest U.S. Senators ever to sit in this body \nbecause they voted for that package, and their opponents took advantage \nof it and said, ``He is a taxer and spender.'' They lost their seats \nfor doing the most courageous thing any Senator could do. People sit in \ntheir seats today who are spineless, who did not have the courage to \nvote for it.\n  So I say to my Republican friends, repeal it and then tell us where \nare you going to find $846 billion, because that is what you have to \nfind.\n  When Bill Clinton ran for President he made a promise to the American \npeople and I thought it was fair. It was a political promise, of \ncourse. Any promise a politician makes is political. But he said: You \nelect me President and in the first 4 years I will reduce the deficit \nby 50 percent. We were looking at a $290-billion-to-$300-billion \ndeficit that year, 1993, which turned out to be $264 billion, and which \nhas been going down every year.\n  Because of that bill in 1993, the deficit this year is not going to \nbe 50 percent of the projected $292 billion. The projection was that \nthe deficit would be $292 billion in 1996. Current figures place the \ndeficit at $125 billion, not a cut of 50 percent, a cut of almost 60 \npercent.\n  I can tell you, this fall, if I were President Clinton, I would keep \na chart, about twice the size of these I am using, with me every minute \nof every day to show the American people why they should be dancing in \nthe streets, because a few courageous Senators screwed up their nerve \nand did what they were supposed to do.\n  What else does this constitutional amendment require? Nothing, in the \nyear 2002.\n  It gives the States 7 years to ratify it. We do not have to do \nanything for 7 years.\n  You know, I think if I were a Republican, I would probably be taking \nthe same tact they are. I would be so embarrassed about a lack of \ncourage, a lack of responsibility in refusing to vote for something \nresponsible, to bring the deficit down when the chance finally emerged.\n  So, what is their solution? Well, I do not know what kind of a tax \ncut Senator Dole will propose. I have heard figures up to $600, $700 \nbillion. I do not know what it is going to be. But here is their method \nof balancing the budget: build a ballistic missile defense system which \nwill cost American taxpayers $50 billion to $60 billion and deploy it \nby the year 2003.\n  ``What kind of a system is that going to be?''\n  The Republicans respond, ``Don't know. Don't have any technology yet, \nbut we can start spending the $50 billion.''\n  The people ask, ``Where's the money coming from without raising the \ndeficit?''\n  The Republicans reply, ``Don't know. Find it somewhere.''\n  What else? The gas tax, repeal of that 4.3-cent gasoline tax we \npassed in 1993. It will accommodate the big sport utility vehicles and \nthe vans and the big trucks. It will encourage people to drive more and \nfurther pollute the environment, as well as losing about $2 billion.\n  The people want to know, ``Where is that $2 billion coming from?''\n  Again, the Republican response is, ``Don't know.''\n  What else? Airline ticket tax. We conveniently let that lapse on \nDecember 31 of this year, and we have already lost about $3 billion \nthis year on the airline ticket tax.\n  ``Why haven't we reinstated it?''\n  ``Don't know.''\n  What does it do? That loss of revenue raises the deficit by $3 \nbillion.\n  What other proposals do the Republicans have for balancing the \nbudget? Well, there is a $7 billion cut for small business. I can tell \nyou, I yield to no one in my commitment to small business. I used to be \na small businessman, and it was a struggle. I can tell you, they hurt \nme every time they raised the minimum wage. It did not hurt for very \nlong. Back in those days, you had to do $250,000 a year in order to \nqualify,\n\n[[Page S5822]]\n\nand I was not doing that much business.\n  So what are the Republicans going to do here? They propose $7 billion \nin additional tax cuts for small business. It is tough for anyone to \nvote against that.\n  What else? Well, we are going to continue selling Federal lands that \nbelong to the taxpayers for $2.50 or $5 an acre, beneath which lies \nbillions and billions of dollars worth of gold; sell it to them for \n$2.50 or $5 an acre and not require them to pay the taxpayers 1 cent of \nroyalty. This has been going on since 1872, and you cannot stop it. I \nknow, because I have tried desperately for 7 years.\n  It is shameless and unbelievable. Republicans who do not have a mine \nwithin 500 miles of their States vote to defend this practice for the \nbenefit of the biggest mining companies in America.\n  What else? Continue the shameless way we let our parks concessions. I \nurge my colleagues to listen to this story. Matsushita Electric Co. \nbought Universal. Universal, among other things, owned the Curry Co., \nwhich had the right to all the concessions in Yosemite, National Park. \nIt is a beautiful, beautiful park. Everyone here has visited it.\n  As you know, since the memory of man runneth not, as we lawyers like \nto say, the people who own the parks concessions in Yellowstone, \nYosemite, and Grand Canyon took in around $500 million to $600 million \na year in revenue, and they returned about $18 million to the \nGovernment.\n  I say to my colleagues, when we go home and tell the chamber of \ncommerce, ``Please reelect me, and if you do, I will treat your money \njust like it is my own,'' that we should consider this example. I want \neveryone in the U.S. Senate who would let a contract that produces for \nthe person you contracted with $500 million to $600 million and you \nreceived $18 million to stand up. I want everyone in the U.S. Senate \nwho would sell his land that had $11 billion worth of gold under it for \n$2.50 or $5 an acre and not receive a dime of royalty to stand up. I \nwant all those Senators to stand up. You told the Chamber of Commerce \nyou would treat their money and the public lands as if it were your \nown.\n\n  Finally, Matsushita bought Universal. There was a hue and cry in this \ncountry about a Japanese company owning the concessions at Yosemite. \nAnd $100 million a year, I say to my colleagues, is what that one \nproduces. And so the Japanese said, ``Look, we don't need all this \nflack. We'll just return it to you.''\n  So the Parks Foundation said, ``Well, why don't we take it and we \nwill relet the contract.''\n  So they took it and they relet the contract and the company they \nselected last year returned $20 million to the U.S. Treasury, more than \nall the others combined have been returning, because we negotiated a \ndecent contract. But if you tried to do that on all the national parks, \nwe have a half a dozen on this side and about 50 on that side who will \nsqueal like a pig under a gate: ``Oh, you can't do this, you can't do \nthat, that's jobs in my State.''\n  So we tried cutting taxes and balancing the budget in 1981, Mr. \nPresident. Do you know what we got out of it? We went from a $1 \ntrillion debt to a $3 trillion debt in 8 years. It was hogwash in the \nbeginning and it still is. You cannot do it. We did not do it. You \ncannot cut taxes massively like we did in 1981 and hope to balance the \nbudget. So what are we paying for? If we did not have to pay interest \njust on the debt that was accumulated in the 8 years of Ronald Reagan's \nPresidency--let me repeat this. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the Senator 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. If we did not have to pay interest on just the increased \ndeficit that was accumulated when Ronald Reagan was President, we would \nnot be standing here debating today because we would have a nice \nhealthy surplus.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Amen.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, ``thems the facts,'' and that is what \nbrings us here today: using a constitutional amendment as a figleaf, a \npolitical ploy to keep from making the hard decisions just as they did \nin 1993, just as they will in 1996.\n  Finally, I am not voting to tinker with what James Madison did 207 \nyears ago that has made us the strongest, longest living democracy in \nthe world. I am not voting for something that nobody in this body can \nexplain how it will work. It is nothing but utter chaos.\n  I plead with my colleagues, don't snap on this one. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota controls 32 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas has spoken \neloquently about this issue. I will try to add some to the debate.\n  I began the discussion talking about the Constitution of the United \nStates, the constitutional convention that produced the framework for \nour democracy.\n  I will discuss what this attempt is here on the floor of the Senate. \nIs it an attempt to balance the budget, as is being alleged, or it is \nan attempt to simply change the Constitution? The reason I ask the \nquestion is there are plenty of people here in the Senate who seem to \nwant to support every single proposed constitutional amendment that is \noffered. We have had thousands of proposed changes to this \nConstitution. We have changed it very, very rarely, and we have made it \ndifficult to change.\n  One reason for doing that, as the Senator from Arkansas suggests, is \nit is hard to see people walking in this Chamber who resemble in \nphilosophy and in spirit Thomas Jefferson, or James Madison, or George \nMason, or George Washington. So we have made it difficult to change \nthis document.\n  This country has taken on too much debt. That is clear. It is not the \ncase, as some stand up daily in the Senate and say, ``Well, the \nAmerican people must pay their bills every day. They don't have any \ndebt.'' That is not the case. This country has $21 trillion in debt, \n$21 trillion in debt. There is just over $5 trillion is U.S. Government \ndebt, over $4 trillion of consumer debt, and $4 trillion-plus, nearly \n$5 trillion of corporate debt, business debt. It totals $21 trillion in \ndebt: mortgages for houses, lines of credit for businesses, Government \ndebt, bonds, Federal debt. There is too much Federal debt. That is not \nbeing debated today.\n  The Senator from Arkansas pointed out that in 1993 we had a vote here \nin this Chamber about debt and deficits. The Senator asked the \nquestion: Who is willing to stand up and cast a hard vote, a really \ntough vote to reduce the Federal deficit? Who is willing to cast an \nhonest vote, a vote that says to the constituents, ``I'm standing here \nand I'm willing to cast a vote to cut Federal spending now; I'm willing \nto cast a vote to increase some taxes now because that must be done in \norder to reduce the Federal deficit?''\n  It was not popular. The political and popular thing would have been \nto say, ``Well, if this is heavy lifting, if this is about really \nreducing the deficit, if this is about really increasing some taxes and \nreally cutting some spending, count me out. I don't want to be part of \nanything that requires some political risk. Just count me out.''\n  But there were a lot of people in this Chamber who said, ``Count me \nin. Let me stand up for that. This isn't about rhetoric or changing the \nConstitution. This is about reducing the Federal deficit.''\n  Do you know that we passed that bill by one vote, as the Senator from \nArkansas said? We did not get one vote from the other side of aisle, \nnot even one by accident. You would think occasionally someone would \nmake a mistake in this Chamber. We did not get one accidental vote in \nthis Chamber. I understand that as well. We had the majority and we had \nthe ability and the responsibility to advance the legislation.\n  I said it before, and I will say it again, I am pleased I voted for \nthat. It has substantially reduced the deficit. It is not easy to do. \nIt is not popular to do. But it is the right thing to do.\n  The job is far from over. We have to continue the effort.\n  But I find it fascinating that folks come to this Chamber day after \nday, hold up the Constitution, and point their fingers across the aisle \nand say, ``We demand you support us to amend\n\n[[Page S5823]]\n\nthe U.S. Constitution to require a balanced budget, and if you don't, \nyou don't support balanced budgets.'' I find it fascinating that those \nsame people come to the Chamber in the very next breath and say, ``By \nthe way, we want to balance the budget, and we also want to build a new \nstar wars program for $60 billion.'' The question is, how are you going \nto pay for it? They say, ``We don't know. We want to balance the \nbudget, but we want to build star wars.''\n\n  The majority leader was asked recently at a press conference when \nthey said they wanted to build star wars--the question from the press \nwas, ``Senator, how much do you think this is going to cost? And where \nis that money going to come from?''\n  The answer from the majority leader of the Senate was, ``Well, I'll \nleave that up to the experts.'' Translated: ``I don't know. I don't \ncare.'' Defend America, build a new star wars program. CBO says it will \ncost up to $60 billion just to build it, let alone operate it; $60 \nbillion just to build it, from the same people who come here and say \nthey want to balance the budget. You ask, ``What is this going to \ncost?'' They say, ``I don't know. We'll leave it up to somebody else.''\n  Can you imagine them shopping for a car. They look in a showroom and \nsay, ``I want that yellow one.'' Someone says, ``Aren't you going to \nask how much it costs?'' They say, ``I don't care. Leave it to the \nexperts.'' They do not care about how much it costs. The same people \nthat demand of us that we accept their prescription for the U.S. \nconstitution because they say they want a balanced budget, those same \npeople trot on the floor of the U.S. Senate with schemes to increase \nspending by up to $60 billion for a star wars program, schemes to enact \nall sorts of tax breaks, most of which will benefit the upper income \npeople in this country, and then they tell us, ``Believe us. We really \nwant a balanced budget.'' Nonsense.\n  What they want to do is amend the Constitution. If they wanted a \nbalanced budget, they have had plenty of opportunities. They could have \nvoted with us in 1993 in a proposal that honestly does the things that \nbalance the budget. It will not be the Constitution that balances the \nbudget. It will be the acts of men and women in the Senate to deal with \nspending and revenue issues that will balance the budget.\n  I will address a couple of issues that have been raised. Some say, \n``Well, this is the same amendment that has been voted on before. Some \nof you voted for it before and did not vote for it this time. What on \nEarth is going on?''\n  There is a pretty fundamental difference between this and what was \nvoted on before. We have voted on constitutional amendments before in \nthe Senate. I have voted for a constitutional amendment. I voted \nagainst a constitutional amendment, as has the Senator from South \nCarolina. I voted for the constitutional amendment that says, let us \nbalance the budget honestly and not misuse the Social Security trust \nfunds to do it. I have voted against the constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget that would take into the Social Security trust funds \na giant scoop and take the money and shovel it over here into the \noperating budget of the United States and misuse the money.\n  How would you feel about a business, any business in your town or any \ntown, that says, ``I'll tell you what. You're asking me about my \nfinancial performance this year. I'll tell you what. It's actually \npretty good. I had to take my employees' pension money to bring it over \non to the operating statement to make it income. I made it pretty good \nbecause I took my employees' pension fund. All in all, this year did I \ndo pretty well? Yeah, I did, with the employees' pension funds being \nused.''\n  Show me a businessperson who stands up and says that, and I will show \nyou someone who is doing 2 years of hard tennis in a minimum security \nprison in this country. You cannot do that in this country. You cannot \nmisuse pension funds.\n  Interesting. I was on a television program last night that I shall \nnot name: ``Crossfire.'' Mr. Novak asked the first question about the \nissue of the Social Security funds. And he says, as others have said, \n``Oh, that's a bunch of nonsense. What a hoax.'' Let us talk about the \nhoax.\n\n  Lots of folks out there today are working, and working hard. They got \nup early, they went to work, they worked all day, and they finished. \nMaybe at the end of the day today they got a paycheck. They looked at \nthat paycheck, and it shows that some money was taken out of that \npaycheck to put in the Social Security trust fund--it is called FICA \ntaxes--put in the Social Security trust fund. The promise of the \nFederal Government is very simple--this is not rocket science--the \npromise of the Federal Government is, ``We'll take the money from your \npaycheck, and we promise you it goes into a trust fund--ergo the word \n``trust'' is used--and the trust fund will be used when we need it, \nwhen the baby-boom generation retires.''\n  I said yesterday that my colleagues will remember what the baby \nboomers are--the war babies. The war babies were the largest baby crop \nin American history. I am told that when folks came back from the \nSecond World War, there was an enormous outpouring of love and \naffection. As a result, we had the largest baby crop in America.\n  When that largest baby crop in America retires after the turn of the \ncentury, we will have a maximum strain on the Social Security system. \nOne of the sober things that was done in the 1980's in this Congress \nwas to say, we will accrue more money in the Social Security trust \nfunds each and every year in order to save for the time we will need it \nwhen the war babies retire.\n  The result is this year $69 billion will come in in excess of what is \nneeded this year in the Social Security system. That is forced national \nsavings, to be available when the war babies hit the retirement rolls.\n  Regrettably, the majority party says in their budgeting scheme--and I \nshould say also it has happened under Democrats; and it is wrong under \neither party--that we want to use that money and use it as an offset to \nshow it as revenue in order to balance the Federal budget. We are not \ngoing to have the trust fund; we are going to put it over here under \noperating revenues and use it to balance the Federal budget.\n  Now, it is interesting. Senator Hollings changed the law and he \nprohibited them from actually putting in writing what they are doing. \nSo the result is this. I have here the budget that was passed by the \nmajority party that they claim was a balanced budget. It, of course, is \nnot in balance.\n  Here is a page from their budget resolution that they wrote--we did \nnot write, they wrote. It says ``Deficits,'' in the year 2002: $108 \nbillion. Why would they put a bill on our desk that says ``Deficits,'' \n$108 billion in the year 2002, and stand up and crow that they balanced \nthe budget? Why is that the case? Because they intend to use $108 \nbillion in trust fund money, almost all from the Social Security trust \nfund, in the year 2002 to show this as a zero balance.\n  The Senator from South Carolina prevents them from doing that by law, \nso they cannot really put it in writing. All they can do is intend to \ndo it. You misuse the money and put in writing that there is still a \n$108 billion deficit. I do not know how that goes over in your town, \nbut I come from a town of 300 people and they tend to look at the fine \nprint and they tend to understand what is happening. You cannot misuse \nthe Social Security trust fund like that and claim you balance the \nbudget by taking money out of trust funds. That is not the right thing \nto do.\n  I have said that there have been three stages of denial on the floor \nof the Senate about this issue. I am still trying to figure out who \nclaims to be right. Three Senators--and I will not name them--three \nseparate Senators have stood up on different occasions and said the \nfollowing three things. First, there is no Social Security trust fund. \nIt does not exist. Second, there is a Social Security trust fund, and \nwe are not misusing it. We promise. And third, there is a Social \nSecurity trust fund. We are misusing it. We promise to stop by the year \n2008. Those are the three stages of denial on the Social Security \nissue.\n  I think the three of them ought to have a meeting with the rest of \ntheir caucus and figure out, which is it? Is there no trust fund? Are \nyou not misusing it? Are you misusing it and promise to stop later?\n\n[[Page S5824]]\n\n  Of course, we all understand the real answer. I was part of a group \nin 1983 that constructed the 1983 reform package for Social Security. \nIt was one of the sober things we did in that decade. We decided to \ncreate savings in the Social Security system to be available when we \nneed them at the turn of the century. Well, we will not have saved \nanything if we stay on this road. And we certainly will not have saved \nanything if we allow the majority party to convince enough people in \nthe Senate to enshrine in the Constitution a requirement that the \nSocial Security funds be used to balance the budget.\n  Now, we have had, essentially, the same vote on similar documents on \ntwo different years. In 1994 Senator Simon, whom I admire greatly, who \nhas been a proponent of this amendment, said on the floor of the \nSenate, ``We guarantee we are not going to use the Social Security \ntrust funds.''\n  I said to him that I happen to know that the constitutional amendment \nthat you originally offered included a provision to prevent the use of \nSocial Security trust funds. I said, ``Is that right?'' And he said \nyes. That was his original position, but he changed it because it had \nto be bipartisan and the other side would not accept that provision. He \nsaid: We will guarantee we will provide a statutory remedy to prevent \nthe Social Security trust funds from being used. We had a vote. I \nthought that was fine. We will have a guarantee.\n  The next year, in 1995, a similar resolution comes up, not identical, \nbut similar. Instead of providing a guarantee that they will not use \nthe Social Security trust funds, we had a vote that guaranteed they \nwould use the Social Security trust funds and would enshrine that in \nthe U.S. Constitution.\n  What a charade. I would not vote for that in 100 years. What a total \ncharade. Then people say, ``Well, it was the same.'' It was not the \nsame. The difference between promising not to use it and guaranteeing \nyou will use it is a difference of about a $600 billion misuse of \nSocial Security trust funds.\n\n  I want to finish these comments by talking just for a moment about \nsomething Abraham Lincoln said. When they were dedicating the \nbattlefield cemetery at Gettysburg in November 1863, there were going \nto be two speakers. Of the two speakers they invited, one was Dr. \nEdward Everett, known to be one of the greatest orators of his day. He \nhad been president of Harvard University. He had been a U.S. Senator, \nhad been a Secretary of State, and was known to be one of the greatest \norators of his time. He was invited to speak at this dedication of this \nbattlefield cemetery. Of course, Abraham Lincoln was invited to speak \nat this battlefield cemetery dedication too.\n  Dr. Edward Everett was introduced and he stood up, and the history \nbook records he spoke 2\\1/2\\ hours. After 2\\1/2\\ hours he sat down. \nThen the President of the United States was recognized, and he spoke \nfor 2 minutes. After he sat down and was on his way back to Washington, \nhe wondered to his aide whether what he said would be long remembered. \nHe felt Dr. Edward Everett, one of the great orators of his time, had \nspoken at great length for 2\\1/2\\ hours, and he had gotten up and given \njust a couple of minutes.\n  Of course, the result of that day is that Lincoln's address, the \nGettysburg Address, as brief as it was, has become perhaps the best \nknown and most admired statement given in the history of our Nation. At \nthe end of his statement, as brief as it was, was the following:\n\n       The world will little note nor long remember what we say \n     here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for \n     us, the living, rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished \n     work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly \n     advanced. It is rather for us to be dedicated to the great \n     task remaining before us--that from these honored dead we \n     take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the \n     last full measure of devotion; that we here highly resolve \n     that all these dead will not have died in vain; that this \n     nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom; and \n     that government of the people, by the people, and for the \n     people, shall not perish from the earth.\n\n  This is truly government of, by, and for the people. This document, a \ndocument we debate today, a document that some propose we change now, \nthis document provides the framework by which self-government works in \nAmerica. This is not an idle debate. This is not a vote anyone dare \ntake lightly.\n  I stand with my colleagues today to say I stand second to no one in \nthis country who believes that we need to set this country back on \ncourse, fix the things that are wrong, celebrate the things that are \nright, and believe in America's promise. But I will not be one of those \nwho blithely follow the windsock, who need to know the direction of \nyesterday's poll or today's poll or tomorrow's poll to figure out what \nI shall do next in proposing changing America's basic document, the \nU.S. Constitution.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I was particularly taken by the \nobservation of the Senator from North Dakota about the Gettysburg \nAddress, because Dr. Edward Everett was considered the greatest orator \nin America. After he spoke for 2, 2\\1/2\\ hours on a very hot, steamy \nday, Lincoln found it very difficult to stand up and follow a man of \nsuch oratorical skills and national renown. On the train on the way \nback to Washington, he thought that he had been an abominable failure. \nHe could not imagine people taking his words very seriously after that \noration. Of course, the rest is history. But I just want to point out \nto the Senator from North Dakota that Garry Wills has written a great \nbook, just on the Gettysburg Address, really more than I want to know \nabout the Gettysburg Address, but it is a fabulous book which goes into \ngreat detail about the events of that day.\n  I would like to share one final observation--and I know the Senator \nfrom North Dakota is as well acquainted with these figures as I am--\nwhen you stop to consider that there have been 83 or 84 resolutions to \namend the Constitution introduced in the U.S. Congress since January \n1995, 83 proposals by Members of this Congress to tinker with that \nsacred document. There have been 2,300 proposed constitutional \namendments since I came to the Senate. They were like snowflakes \nfalling when I began serving during the days of busing and the \nsegregation fight was still raging. And since the Nation adopted the \nConstitution, 17,000 have been proposed. I say that to my distinguished \ncolleague to simply point out the contempt with which so many of my \ncolleagues hold that sacred document.\n\n  Well, I have voted for one constitutional amendment since I came to \nthe Senate 22 years ago. I regret that. But I can tell you, my record \nwill be intact when the roll is called on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from North Dakota and I thank the \nChair.\n  Mr. President, on May 23--13 days ago--there were three votes on \nbudgets. There was one for the Republican budget, which received a \nparty vote; there was one for the President's budget, which received a \nparty vote; and there was one more on a budget put forward by the \ncentrist coalition.\n  Now, one of the things that became very clear in budget balancing in \nthis body is that there are different points of view on both sides of \nthe aisle. Republicans do not tend to support a Democratic budget, and \nDemocrats do not tend to support a Republican budget. This was borne \nout.\n  Well, for some 6 months, under the leadership of Senator Chafee and \nSenator Breaux, 11 Republicans and 11 Democrats sat down around a table \nand said, ``look, we know we have to balance the budget. How are we \ngoing to do it, and what does each party need to do?''\n  Believe it or not, we produced a document that came five votes short \nof being adopted by this body. With five more votes, we would not have \nneeded a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, and we would \nhave balanced the budget within 7 years. I believe it is still possible \nto do succeed.\n  I support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I even \nsponsored one, with a number of my colleagues, last year. But, in my \nview, if Congress does not have the will to\n\n[[Page S5825]]\n\nactually balance the budget, it may, at some point, need castor oil. \nAnd that is all this amendment is. I heard people on the floor this \nmorning make the statement that now is the time to bite the bullet. Now \nis the time to make the hard choices.\n  Does this constitutional amendment restructure Medicare? No.\n  Does it restructure Medicaid? No.\n  Does it bring on welfare reform? No.\n  Does it provide for ballistic missile defense? No.\n  Does it have the tax increases to pay for one? No.\n  Does it have a tax cut in it, which so many want? No.\n  Does it solve any problem at all? No, it does not.\n  It does one thing. It says that the people of three-quarters of the \nState legislatures will vote and decide whether there will be a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget by the year 2003.\n  The bill before us today is the same bill rejected by this body last \nyear. I voted against it then because I do not believe it is the right \namendment for this country, and I will vote against it today for these \nsame reasons.\n  Let me give you a couple of these reasons. A constitutional amendment \ncannot possibly be ratified right now in time to do any good. It would \ntake the 3-year period that I described. The Medicare trustees \nannounced yesterday the Medicare trust fund will actually reach \ninsolvency in 2001--a year earlier than originally projected. This is a \nloud and clear message--or should be--that we do not have the luxury of \nwaiting any longer to balance the budget.\n  Additionally, the amendment before us says that, for all time, the \nSocial Security trust fund will be stolen to balance the budget. This \nbody would send to the States a constitutional amendment that would \nutilize the Social Security trust fund, for all time, to balance the \nbudget.\n  I think it is painfully clear to all of us that there is no way to \nachieve the goal of balancing the budget in 7 years without using, to \nsome degree, funds that really should, by law, be set aside for Social \nSecurity. Our earlier speakers, including Senator Dorgan, Senator \nHollings, and others know it as well as anyone in this body. Every plan \nput forward to balance the budget this year includes Social Security \nfunds to some degree or another.\n  However, today we are considering a constitutional amendment. The \namendment would permanently use Social Security trust funds to balance \nthe budget. It allows absolutely no flexibility to protect the solvency \nof the trust fund for future generations who will depend on it. That is \nnot right because, all during this period, Americans will be working \nand paying payroll taxes for their Social Security retirement. Workers \nwill pay their 6.2-percent FICA tax to contribute to their retirement \nand employers will match that 6.2 percent. People have a right to know \nthat this trust fund will be there when they retire.\n  This amendment, by locking into the Constitution the requirement that \nSocial Security funds are used to balance the Federal budget, in \nperpetuity, abrogates that contract with American taxpayers.\n  Under this amendment, Social Security funds could wind up being used \nto pay for general governmental programs, just as Senator Dorgan \nspelled out. It is like taking the pension fund, if you operate a \ncompany, and putting it on your operating budget. You just would not do \nit.\n  Furthermore, I mentioned earlier that this constitutional amendment \nwould have to pass muster with three-fourths of the States. If you \nthink the debate in Congress has been difficult on this issue for the \nlast few years, just wait until the voters of 50 States, or the \nlegislatures of 50 States, start debating the permanent inclusion of \nthe Social Security trust funds in the Federal budget under this \nbalanced budget amendment. I venture to say that the likelihood of its \nratification is dim, at best.\n  Well, what is the upshot of all of this? The upshot is that we have \nthe vehicle to balance the budget, without altering the Constitution, \nand we should just do it.\n  I want to read this list. This is the first time I have ever seen \nthis in the time I have been here. Forty-six Members--22 Republicans \nand 24 Democrats--voted for a centrist budget. The Republican \nsupporters are: Bennett, Brown, Campbell, Chafee, Coats, Cochran, \nCohen, D'Amato, DeWine, Faircloth, Frist, Gorton, Gregg, Hatch, \nHatfield, Jeffords, Kassebaum, Lugar, Santorum, Simpson, Snowe, and \nSpecter.\n  These 24 Democrats voted with the 22 Republicans: Akaka, Bingaman, \nBoxer, Bradley, Breaux, Bryan, Conrad, Feinstein, Graham, Inouye, \nJohnston, Kerrey, Kohl, Leahy, Levin, Lieberman, Moynihan, Murray, \nNunn, Pell, Pryor, Reid, Robb, and Simon.\n  With the centrist budget amendment, we were five votes short of \nachieving the tax cut Republicans wanted, and minimizing the cuts in \nvital programs that Democrats wanted. We came within five votes of \nachieving significant savings for a wide variety of Federal program. In \nMedicare, we made enough changes to assure the solvency of the trust \nfund until 2007, and made some necessary changes in part B, as well. We \ntook steps to meet the needs of Medicaid, restructuring the program, \nand provide welfare reform while retaining a Federal safety net. We \nalso adopted a balanced tax cut, for individuals and businesses, \nincluding education, capital gains reform, research and development tax \ncredits--all put together in a package that both parties could buy \ninto.\n  I was really very disappointed that there were not five other Members \nof this body who could stand up and we could get the job done.\n  I do not believe that a constitutional amendment, particularly one \nthat includes the Social Security trust fund, is ever realistically \ngoing to be ratified by three-quarters of the States. There are enough \npeople in this Nation who pay those FICA taxes who do not want to see \ntheir FICA taxes used for anything other than their retirement.\n  Therefore, I respectfully submit to this body that the centrist \ncoalition, which balances the budget in 7 years, uses the Congressional \nBudget Office numbers, does not make unnecessary and precipitously deep \ncuts in important programs, represents the Nation's best interests and \nis really the way to go.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time is available?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has one-half minute remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time is remaining to the Senator from South \nCarolina?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-seven minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield whatever time I have to the Senator from Oregon, \nand I believe the Senator from South Carolina would like to yield as \nwell.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from South Carolina \nand North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, colleagues, as of now everyone knows what is going to \nhappen when the Senate votes on this measure. The script on this issue \nhas been published. It is played, and it is almost like yesterday's \nnews. There probably is more likelihood that Michael Jordan is not \ngoing to show up for the playoffs than there is going to be a surprise \non this issue.\n  I am here today to say that it does not have to be this way, my \ncolleagues. I have introduced along with Senator Hollings, Senator \nDorgan, and Senator Daschle a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget that is identical to the measure introduced by Senator Dole, \nsave for one change. Our measure simply says that you cannot go out and \nraid the Social Security trust fund. You cannot go out and take $600 \nbillion, money that belongs to working people, to young people, to \nseniors, and use it to balance the budget.\n  I call our effort--and it has really been led by Senator Hollings for \nall these years. I think that we are the straight bookkeeping crowd. We \nare the crowd that wants some truth in budgeting. We are the folks who \nare saying it is time to end this accounting fiction which has been \nperpetrated, as Senator Hollings has said, in direct contravention of \nsection 13301 of the Budget Act.\n  The Budget Act is clear. There is no ambiguity about it. It says that \nyou cannot use Social Security funds to mask the overall Federal \ndeficit. You cannot do it. Both political parties unfortunately have \ndone it.\n\n[[Page S5826]]\n\n  So what we want to do in our straight bookkeeping kind of effort is \nto try to make sure in the interest of both the cause of balancing the \nbudget and protecting the Social Security program that we do what the \nlaw requires, and we do what is in the public interest.\n  I happen to think that, if you do it as we propose, what is going to \nhappen is you are going to have to make tough choices on both the \nbudget and Social Security more quickly.\n  I have come from a round of town meetings--and I am sure all of our \ncolleagues have--at home. One of the things I heard consistently is \nthat lots of folks feel that the Congress has put off the tough \nchoices--put them off until after the election, put them off for years. \nIf you do what we propose, you bet you have to make some tough choices, \nand you have to make them earlier. Maybe we are going to have to say no \nto some pork barrel spending programs.\n  I believe that if you wall off the Social Security program, as we \npropose, that you do not let the surplus be used for balancing the \nbudget, and you are going to see when the Social Security stands, as it \nshould, separate from the Federal budget that we have to make some \nchanges there too. We have a Social Security advisory commission that \nis going to report fairly shortly. They have a number of \nrecommendations. They are going to be tough for people to swallow. But \nlet me say that at a time when more young people think that they are \ngoing to see Elvis than think they are going to get a Social Security \ncheck that we are going to have to make some tough choices with respect \nto Social Security.\n  So with our proposal--by making sure that the overall deficit is \ntackled responsibly and tackled more quickly--by walling off the Social \nSecurity program, as the Congress intended in the Budget Act, we \nbelieve that the country will get the discipline and tough choices that \nare needed, and get them earlier.\n  I want to announce also this afternoon that it is my intention, after \nfurther consultation with the minority leader, Senator Daschle, and \nSenator Dorgan, to ask unanimous consent after the Senate has voted on \nthe measure of the majority leader--it is my desire and my intention--\nto ask unanimous consent that our measure, a constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget without raiding Social Security, be considered \nimmediately after the vote on the measure offered by the majority \nleader.\n  I think it is time to talk about a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget that has some legs. I think that we have had enough \nof this exercise in failure. The script has been written. We do not \nhave to conclude this debate with a debate that fails. We can conclude \nit in a manner that will bring us real truth in budgeting, will ensure \nthat the books are kept, and will allow us to have a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget.\n  So let me be clear on this. I and those that support this measure are \nwilling to write into law that there would be a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. This is not a statute. This is a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. And it is identical to \nthe measure offered by the majority leader save for one respect.\n  It is my intent to ask unanimous consent to have that measure \nconsidered immediately after the vote on this measure offered by the \nmajority leader. I hope that measure will be considered. I believe \nthat, if it is considered, we will get a minimum of 70 votes on that \nparticular measure.\n  My source for that appraisal is that on February 10, 1995--Senator \nHollings was here, I was not--but on February 10, 1995, on a measure \nthat in effect recommitted a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget to committee to do exactly what Senator Hollings and I propose \nnow--that particular measure got more than 80 votes.\n  I would like to conclude my remarks in really a bipartisan kind of \nfashion by picking up on what the majority leader said early this week.\n  The majority leader said early this week, ``If the President wants a \nbalanced budget, we will have a balanced budget.'' I am here to say \nthat, if the majority leader wants a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget, we will have a constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget. It is a measure that will get a minimum of 70 votes on this \nfloor. It is a measure that will write into law a specific \nconstitutional amendment to bring about the discipline the American \npeople want, and it will be bipartisan. But it also will be one that \nwill keep faith with our working people and with our seniors who are \npaying those whopper payroll taxes--15.3 percent between the worker and \nthe employer. Millions of Americans pay more in payroll taxes than they \npay in income taxes. They want a balanced budget, but they do not think \nwe ought to do it by raiding the Social Security Program. The measure \nwe hope to get a recorded vote on after the measure proposed by the \nmajority leader would give us a chance to meet the desires of the \nAmerican people for a balanced budget but one that also ensures that \ntheir Social Security is protected.\n\n  I thank my good friend from South Carolina for yielding me this time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Oregon. First, I will surprise him by thanking him for the \ntelecommunications bill. I welcome him to the Senate and thank him for \nintroducing a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget that does \nnot move the Government's deficit over to the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  But more particularly, with respect to the telecommunications bill, I \nwish to thank him for his work. We passed that bill by an overwhelming \nmajority here in the House and in the Senate. It came out of the \nconference committee and we reconciled the differences--which was a \nvery difficult job. And, just before Christmas the distinguished Vice \nPresident appeared on NBC News, where he was being interviewed, and \nproclaimed, ``We now have the information superhighway, and I got \neverything I want.''\n  Well, that really put the Speaker of the House into a tizzy, and we, \nthe conferees, were told that our telecommunications bill was dead. \nBetween that time, some 10 days before Christmas, and the first week of \nFebruary, Congressman Bliley and I had to hold the fort, but we worked \nin a bipartisan fashion. We did not change a single word.\n  What really occurred is that our colleague, Senator Wyden, won the \nspecial election out in Oregon, causing the Speaker of the House to \nsay, ``Heavens, we have to show we can do something.'' I said we have \nan overwhelming majority ready for the telecommunications bill in the \nHouse and in the Senate, and that is how we got it.\n  So I think it ought to be stated for the record that the Senator from \nOregon was instrumental in ensuring passage of the telecommunications \nbill. And perhaps tomorrow if the Republicans really want a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution, we will obtain one. All that is \nrequired is a specific language in section 7 of the resolution \nexcluding Social Security funds from deficit calculations. The present \nlanguage includes Social Security funds. So there is no argument about \nthe form, the present language already has exceptions in section 7: \n``Total receipts shall include all receipts of the U.S. Government \nexcept those derived from borrowing.''\n  That has been interpreted as borrowing from the public. But how about \nborrowing from yourself, borrowing from the Social Security trust fund. \nAll they have to do is change ``from borrowing'' to ``from the public \nand Social Security trust fund.'' That is all we have to add. I and \nseveral Senators on this side of the aisle formally informed the \ndistinguished majority leader in a letter last year that we would \nsupport a balanced budget amendment that protected Social Security. I \nwaited all year long for a joint resolution that I could amend. We in \nthe Senate are used to putting an amendment on anything so you can get \na vote. But oh, no. A constitutional amendment can only be offered as \nan amendment to another joint resolution. So, I waited and then the \nflag burning joint resolution came up in December.\n\n[[Page S5827]]\n\n  And so I said I have an amendment. In fact, I had two. I had one \nconstitutional amendment that would have allowed the Congress of the \nUnited States to control expenditures in Federal elections. It would \nhave overturned the flawed decision of Buckley versus Valeo.\n  My other amendment was a real balanced budget amendment that \nprotected Social Security, identical to the balanced budget amendment \nthat the Senator from Oregon will ask unanimous consent to consider \ntomorrow. I will be in there supporting the Senator, and I hope we can \nwork it out. I hope it is not true that they want to pass up this \nopportunity, because it is right here.\n\n  I am tired of the media saying the balanced budget amendment failed \nby one vote, when they know differently. That is technical reporting, \nbecause the truth of the matter is that they could easily have picked \nup at least five votes if they had agreed to add language excluding \nSocial Security.\n  So I will be working with the Senator, and I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Oregon on his leadership. I thank publicly, of course, the \nSenator from Arkansas, for coming to the floor. I also want to thank \nSenator Dorgan of North Dakota. He understands all these particular \nproblems and issues, and he is the most eloquent, I know, in the Senate \non all of them. He gives categorical leadership and very common-sense \nobservations, and you can follow his rationale. I happen to agree with \nmost of it all the time. The Senator from California, Senator \nFeinstein, has been a leader in trying to do something about a balanced \nbudget.\n  But let me go, Mr. President, to statements made earlier before I \nforget them. The distinguished Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, \ngot right to the point saying, why don't we do something. She kept \ntalking about generations in the future and everything else like that.\n  We tried to do something, not pass it off in a 7-year passing of the \nbuck. This constitutional amendment is really putting off the tough \ndecisions. It is not biting the bullet or making any hard decisions. \nHeck, you can say anything in rhetoric, in language. But should know \nfrom hard experience that actions speak louder than words.\n  I came in as a Governor of a State, where the budget I inherited was \ntotally in the red. We had in the constitution of 1895, still do in the \nconstitution of the State of South Carolina in 1895, ``thou budget \nshall be balanced.'' But that didn't mean anything. There a number of \naccounting gimmicks that they employ like borrowing and moving trust \nfunds.\n  And so at this particular point, Mr. President, I want to ask \nunanimous consent to list the 48 States with a balanced budget \nrequirement, the type of requirement, whether it is constitutional or \nstatutory. They are all supposed to be balanced at the end of year. The \nchart lists the balances in the general funds and in the transfer \nfunds. So the States, even with the constitutional requirement, do not \na balanced budget give.\n  I can tell you here and now, if I say it once--I have the time, \nfortunately--I say it again: A constitutional amendment requiring a \nbalanced budget does not a balanced budget give. They play the \ngamesmanship.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record, so we \nwill have those documents in there to show the game that the States are \nplaying.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    STATES WITH BALANCED BUDGET REQUIREMENTS                                    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                              Ending            \n                                                                                  Balanced   general            \n                                                                                   budget      fund     Transfer\n                    State                             Type of requirement          for FY    balance    fund (in\n                                                                                    1995       (in     millions)\n                                                                                            millions)           \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama......................................

Vermont has no balanced budget requirement and reported a $15 million deficit.                               \n2. Wyoming has no balanced budget requirement and reported a $26 million surplus.                               \n3. 35 states have constitutional requirements; 13 States have statutory requirements.                           \n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Senator Coats of Indiana said the amendment will \nenforce the discipline, force us to meet our responsibilities. Of \ncourse, that is not the case at all. On the contrary, I have been \ntrying to do that. I tried freezing, I say to the Senator. He is nice \nto stay around so I have someone to talk to. Usually they just go ahead \nsomewhere else. At least I can talk to C-Span. And now I see the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n  I want to read an article. I will not read the whole article, I will \njust read from this, referring to ``Ace in the Hole'' in the New \nYorker, in the June 10 issue that has just come out. This is an \narticle, ``Ace in the Hole,'' by John Cassidy. I commend it to my \ncolleagues for their reading.\n\n       Despite some suggestions to the contrary--notably by the \n     Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank--this year \n     cannot be compared with 1992, let alone 1980 or 1932. In the \n     first quarter of 1996, inflation-adjusted growth in national \n     output, which is the broadest index of economic performance, \n     2.3 per cent on an annualized basis; over the full course of \n     the Clinton Administration, such growth has averaged around \n     2.5 per cent a year. This record is about average for the \n     post-1973 era but well above the growth rate of 1.6 percent \n     eked out during the Bush Presidency. A number of other \n     measures also suggest that the economy is doing significantly \n     better than it was four years ago: two of the most widely \n     followed are the ``misery index,'' which is the rate of \n     inflation added to the rate of unemployment, and the size of \n     the federal budget deficit.\n       At the moment, the unemployment rate is 5.4 per cent, and \n     the inflation rate is 2.9 per cent. Added together, these \n     numbers produce a misery index of 8.3, which is an extremely \n     low number. The last year it was lower was 1968, when the \n     unemployment rate was 3.6 per cent and the inflation rate \n     averaged 4.2 per cent. For much of the nineteen-seventies and \n     eighties, the misery index well into double digits. As \n     recently as 1992, it stood at 10.4.\n       Perhaps the most important, and least heralded, achievement \n     of the Clinton Administration is the improvement it has \n     wrought in the national finances. According to the \n     Congressional Budget Office, the federal budget deficit for \n     the 1996 fiscal year, which began last October, will be about \n     $145 billion. This is a large number, but it is only half the \n     size of the deficit that the federal government recorded in \n     1992, which was $290 billion. And these raw numbers don't \n     tell the full story. In ranking budget deficits, economists \n     usually look at them in relation to the size of the economy. \n     Measured in this way, the federal deficit this year will be \n     about 1.9 per cent of the gross domestic product, according \n     to the C.B.O. This figure is down from 4.9 per cent in 1992; \n     indeed, it is the lowest such figure recorded since 1979, the \n     year before Ronald Reagan was elected, when the budget \n     deficit was just 1.7 percent of G.D.P.\n\n  That takes us to our distinguished friend, Senator Muskie, who was \nchairman. We had a Democratic House and Senate. Senator Muskie was \nchairman of our Budget Committee, and I was right in there behind him. \nI took over in 1980. So we were working and had more or less succeeded, \nunder President Carter, in reducing the deficit from what we had \ninherited from President Ford. However, in came President Reagan with \nReaganomics and the fiscal disaster that we are now experiencing.\n  I tried, during the early 1980's, what they called the Fritz freeze. \nThey gave it a name because I was so intent. I said every Governor \nwould come in and he would say let us just take spending the way it is \nnow and let us just take this year's budget for next year. There would \nbe no cuts, there would be no increases. That way we would save $50 \nbillion at the Federal level.\n  We tried the freeze. We tried to hold the line. We could not get it \ndone. I tried with Gramm-Rudman-Hollings.\n\n[[Page S5828]]\n\n And then I came with a value-added tax in 1987. There is no question \nthat I have been trying to head off annual deficits with about $180 \nbillion in revenues from a 5 percent VAT.\n  I went to Darman in 1989, after we could not get it past the Budget \nCommittee in 1987. In 1989, when President Bush took office, I met with \nDick Darman. I had been a close friend of his father's, Mr. Morton \nDarman. We had a good, heart-to-heart talk.\n  I said, ``By 1992, if President Bush doesn't get on top of this \nmonster, it is growing so, he is going to need the Secret Service.'' I \nsaid that in a jocular fashion, but politically that is what happened \nto him. ``It's the Economy, Stupid.'' I will put in the chart. There \nhave been intermittent figures, but the real deficit then was $403.6 \nbillion. That is without using those trust funds, $403. So we were up, \nup and away.\n  I got a nice note from the President, President Bush, that he just \ndid not think it was timely and he wanted to get himself more \nstabilized in office.\n  Again, when President Clinton took office, I went. I will never \nforget the conference that we had. When I suggested a VAT for the \ndeficit and the debt, President Clinton said, ``I got a call last night \nfrom Lane Kirkland. The AFL-CIO has its annual meeting at Bal Harbour, \nin Florida. He said that he would go along with a VAT for the deficit \nand the debt.'' And I said, ``Heavens above, Mr. President, that's who \nopposed me.''\n  I came before the Finance Committee and testified for a value-added \ntax. I had the experts there and everything else to answer all the \neconometric issues and questions. It was the AFL that said, ``Wait a \nminute, this is regressive, regressive, a heavy burden, and everything \nelse.'' Of course, every industrialized country has a value-added tax. \nOur competition in Europe has a VAT. You cannot be a member of the \nEuropean Economic Community unless you have a value-added tax. Out in \nthe Pacific rim, every country there has a value-added tax. In Korea, \nfor example, it is 25 percent. So the competition is economically \nsucceeding. They have 5 percent in Japan. They will be the largest \neconomy, according to Eamon Fingleton in ``Blindside,'' by the year \n2000. They are presently a larger manufacturing nation than we are here \nin the United States.\n  So I said it would solve our deficit in the balance of trade because \nit is rebatable at the bottom, at the border. So if you produce \nsomething here today in Washington, this desk and chair, for $500, you \nwill pay all the corporate taxes, all the income taxes, all the sales \ntaxes and everything else. If you ship it to Paris, France, they will \nadd on a 17 percent VAT and sell it. But, if you produce that same \nchair and desk in Paris, France, they add a 17 percent value-added tax, \na VAT at the time of manufacture, but when it leaves the port at Le \nHavre to come to Washington, DC, they subtract or rebate the 17 \npercent.\n  So you can see the tremendous advantage to move the industry \noffshore. We have been talking about slave labor, about child labor, \nabout 27-cents-an-hour labor down. But let's talk about the advantage \nthey have in Europe and in the Pacific rim where they employ value \nadded taxes.\n  I have introduced this legislation again in this Congress. That \nparticular bill now, Mr. President, is S. 237. It is in the Finance \nCommittee.\n  When the distinguished Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, says, \n``Let's do something now,'' let's go to the Finance Committee that the \nmajority of the Republicans control. I will testify. We will get the \nexpert witnesses, and we will get something done. We do not have to \nwait 7 years on States to find out whether or not we are going to meet \nour responsibilities.\n  I really resent the idea of us like a crowd up in the grandstand \nhollering, ``We want a touchdown, we want a touchdown, we want a \ntouchdown,'' when we are the team, we are on the field.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield just for a question?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. It seems to me that what you are saying is this is just \nabout budget discipline.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. This is about making tough choices, and you can make them \nin a variety of ways. I said the other day that I thought some of what \nwas going on in this town was like a hot-fudge-sundae approach to \ndieting. You can have tax cuts, you can have new weapons systems and \nthen somehow say the books are going to balance. It is like having six \nor seven hot fudge sundaes a day and still lose weight.\n  I think what you offer in your important remarks is, this is about \nbudget discipline, and you are going to suggest a variety of ways to do \nit.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Exactly. I thank the distinguished Senator. Let's make \nthe record on the hot fudge sundae.\n  At the present time, the Dole agenda--and I repeat this and I got \ninto it this morning--was the repeal of the 4.3-cent gas tax. That is \n$30 billion. The missile defense system is $60 billion. The across-the-\nboard tax cuts, $600 billion.\n  So that is what we are up against; $690 billion that is in the \nPresidential campaign and, whoopee, ``I have to get elected because I \ncan cut the revenues another $690 billion. And, incidentally, I get \nanother $600 billion from the Social Security trust fund.'' When the \nsmoke has cleared, we are down well over a trillion bucks.\n  What a charade. What a fraud. How can anybody be serious and stand up \nhere? But they all have the same singsong. Let me go quickly, because \nwe are going to run out of time.\n  They all come in here with the same stock phrases--Thomas Jefferson, \nchildren and grandchildren, first balanced budget in 30 years, largest \ntax increase in history. The largest tax increase in history, one more \ntime--I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record ``Fiddling \nwith the Numbers,'' by Judy Mann.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n                       Fiddling With the Numbers\n\n                             (By Judy Mann)\n\n       Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican meteor from New \n     Jersey, had the unusual honor for a first-term governor of \n     being asked to deliver her party's response to President \n     Clinton's State of the Union message last week.\n       And she delivered a whopper of what can most kindly be \n     called a glaring inaccuracy.\n       Sandwiched into her Republican sales pitch was the kind of \n     line that does serious political damage: Clinton, she \n     intoned, ``imposed the biggest tax increase in American \n     history.''\n       And millions of Americans sat in front of their television \n     sets, perhaps believing that Clinton and the Democrat-\n     controlled Congress had done a real number on them.\n       The trouble is that this poster lady for tax cuts was not \n     letting any facts get in her way. But don't hold your breath \n     waiting for the talk show hosts to set the record straight.\n       The biggest tax increase in history did not occur in the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The biggest tax \n     increase in post-World War II history occurred in 1982 under \n     President Ronald Reagan.\n       Here is how the two compare, according to Bill Gale, a \n     specialist on tax policy and senior fellow at the Brookings \n     Institution. The 1993 act raised taxes for the next 5 years \n     by a gross total of $268 billion, but with the expansion of \n     the earned income tax credit to more working poor families, \n     the net increase comes to $240.4 billion in 1993. The Tax \n     Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, by comparison, \n     increased taxes by a net of $217.5 billion over 5 years. \n     Nominally, then, it is true that the 1993 tax bill was the \n     biggest in history.\n       But things don't work nominally. ``A dollar now is worth \n     less than a dollar was back then, so that a tax increase of, \n     say $10 billion in 1982 would be a tax increase of $15 \n     billion now,'' says Gale. In fact, if you adjust for the 48 \n     percent change in price level, the 1982 tax increase becomes \n     a $325.6 billion increase in 1993 dollars. And that makes it \n     the biggest tax increase in history by $85 billion.\n       Moreover, says Gale, the population of the country \n     increased, so that, on a per person basis, the 1993 tax \n     increase is lower than the one in 1982, and the gross \n     domestic product increased over the decade, which means that \n     personal income rose. ``Once you adjust for price \n     translation, it's not the biggest, and when you account for \n     population and GDP, it gets even smaller.''\n       He raises another point that makes this whole business of \n     tax policy just a bit more complex than the heroic tax \n     slashers would have us believe. ``The question is whether \n     [the 1993 tax increase] was a good idea or a bad idea, not \n     whether it was the biggest tax increase. Suppose it was the \n     biggest? I find it frustrating that the level of the debate \n     about stuff like this as carried on by politicians is \n     generally so low.''\n       So was it a good idea? ``We needed to reduce the deficit,'' \n     he says, ``we still need to reduce the deficit. The bond \n     market responded positively. Interest rates fell. There may \n     be a longer term benefit in that it\n\n[[Page S5829]]\n\n     shows Congress and the president are capable of cutting the \n     deficit even without a balanced budget amendment.''\n       Other long-term benefits, he says, are that ``more capital \n     is freed up for private investment, and ultimately that can \n     result in more productive and highly paid workers.''\n       How bad was the hit for those few who did have to pay more \n     taxes? One tax attorney says that his increased taxes were \n     more than offset by savings he was able to generate by \n     refinancing the mortgage on his house at the lower interest \n     rates we've had as a result. The 1993 tax increase did \n     include a 4.3-cent-a-gallon rise in gasoline tax, which hits \n     the middle class. But most of us did not have to endure an \n     income tax increase. In 1992, the top tax rate was 31 percent \n     of the taxable income over $51,900 for single taxpayers and \n     $86,500 for married couples filing jointly. Two new tax \n     brackets were added in 1993: 36 percent for singles with \n     taxable incomes over $115,000 and married couples with \n     incomes over $140,000; and 39.6 percent for singles and \n     married couples with taxable incomes over $250,000.\n       Not exactly your working poor or even your average family.\n       The rising GOP stars are finding out that when they say or \n     do something stupid or mendacious, folks notice. The jury \n     ought to be out on Whitman's performance as governor until we \n     see the effects of supply side economics on New Jersey. But \n     in her first nationally televised performance as a \n     spokeswoman for her party, she should have known better than \n     to give the country only half the story. In the process, she \n     left a lot to be desired in one quality Americans are looking \n     for in politicians: honesty.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair. So we know from all \nthe quotes from the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and \neverything else that the largest tax increase was back in 1982 under \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee, the Senator from Kansas.\n  The first balanced budget in 30 years--I showed the two letters that \nwe put in from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, June \nO'Neill. One day in October of last year on the present 1996 budget, \nshe had a slight surplus, and then 2 days later when we reminded her of \nsection 13301, she said it is a $105 billion deficit.\n  The distinguished Senator from North Dakota did it in more dramatic \nterms. Here, again, my colleagues should look at this year's budget \nresolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution 57. Turn to page 5: Fiscal \nyear 2002, deficits, $108.3 billion.\n  Come on, how can you keep on saying the first balanced budget when \nthe document itself shows a deficit. You talk about backloading. The \nPresident had a backloaded budget. Almost two-thirds of the cuts in \nthat particular phony budget was to occur after the second Presidential \nelection, the last 2 years. Two-thirds of it. It ought to be ashes in \ntheir mouths.\n  So there they are with their first balanced budget in 30 years. All \nthe children and grandchildren--come on, it is us.\n  You can look at these particular charts and you can see at a glance, \neven with the President halving the deficit--and he is the only \nPresident who has--spending on interest costs continue to rise. The \ninterest costs during the last 4 years has gone up $50 billion. That is \njust interest costs; that is spending on automatic pilot.\n  We have increased these costs, forcing the American people to pay \nmore and get less. We are getting hit now; I cannot fully fund women, \ninfants, and children feeding and Head Start and title I for the \ndisadvantaged and student loans and get the economy rebuilt, do the \nbridges, the highways, expand the airports, and strengthen our economy. \nI talked about that early this morning. Why can I not do it? Because my \nmoney is going to interest costs on the national debt.\n  President Reagan promised a balanced budget in 1 year. He came in and \nsaid, ``Whoops, this problem is way worse. I'll do it in 3 years.'' \nBut, Mr. President, instead he added almost $270 billion in forced \nspending for nothing.\n  The interest cost on the national debt after 217 years of history in \n1981 was $74.8 billion. Let's call it $75 billion. Now it is projected \nat $344 billion.\n  He has added almost $270 billion in unnecessary spending that we get \nnothing for. We cannot get funds for prisons or the environment. In \nfact, it just was pointed out, if he had done what he promised--and \nthey all say ``President Clinton promised; President Clinton promised; \nPresident Clinton promised''--if Reagan had carried out his particular \npromises, what would we have done? We would be talking about a surplus \naround here.\n  So the unmitigated gall of this crowd that comes aboard--the \nfreshmen. It reminds me of a saying in the Navy during World War II, \n``When in danger, when in doubt, run in circles, scream and shout.''\n  And they come down and get their 2-hour session. I do not know if I \nhave all the time to go down through, because I was making notes. We \nneed to focus on the problem at hand. It is not Social Security which \nis presently in surplus. It is not Medicare that the distinguished \nmajority leader saw fit to come in and talk about. Medicare is in \nsurplus until 2001, they say, which is what it was when President \nClinton came to office.\n  So we have not gone backward. We had gotten it up to 2002 when \nSenator Exon and I voted for the 1993 $57 billion cut in Medicare. That \nis what we did in 1993.\n  So we have been cutting spending and making progress. As Senator \nHutchison says, we ought to really do something. They all come in with \n``children and grandchildren, children and grandchildren,'' that is on \nsome silly pollster's chart; it is like parrots at a pet store. Then \nquoting Thomas Jefferson. Ha. They ought to quote Lyndon Baines \nJohnson. He was conscientious. He was being blamed for the Great \nSociety, the War on Poverty, and the war in Vietnam.\n\n  I pointed out how Senator Dole voted back in 1968 as a House Member \nfor, what, a 10-percent surcharge on income tax for individuals and \ncorporations, $6 billion in spending cuts, $200,000 in employees' cuts, \nextended excise taxes, and everything else. But we did it. We balanced \nthe budget.\n  We do not have to go to what Thomas Jefferson said and a \nconstitutional amendment that puts off everything, passing the buck to \nthe legislatures, and the people generally arguing again for another 7 \nyears with interest costs of $353 billion. I can tell you now the \ninterest cost will be over $500 billion by the time they get their so-\ncalled constitutional amendment if they can get it.\n  Mr. President, right to the point, do not quote Jefferson on that. \nQuote Jefferson on what he said: If between a free press and a free \ngovernment, I would choose the former. Jefferson's point was, you can \nhave a free government, but unless you have a free press to keep the \npoliticians honest, it is not going to stay free long. That is what is \noccurring. The free press has joined in the conspiracy with the \npoliticians in making the news, getting polls, reporting ahead of time, \nmaking more news. You cannot get them to report the true deficits that \nwe have, the true interest costs that we have, the true initiatives \nthat we make and have made.\n  There is the ``Balance the budget. Who stands for a balanced \nbudget?'' when the only gentleman in this city that has done something \nabout it, and cannot be blamed, is President William Jefferson Clinton. \nYou can blame me. I have been here. I am in my 30th year. You can blame \nthe Senator from Nebraska or some of the Senators that have been here \nbefore 1992.\n  January 1993 is when President Clinton came to town. We are the ones \nwho gave him the spending on automatic pilot, this horrendous debt, the \nhorrendous interest costs. What does he do? He faces up to the task. He \nbrings in his Vice President and he gets every Democrat to vote for \n$500 billion in spending cuts, increasing taxes on liquor, beer, \ncigarettes, and increasing taxes on gasoline, increasing taxes on \nSocial Security.\n  Who is really serious about Social Security? The Senator from \nPennsylvania came here and said, ``You are trying to hide. You're \ntrying to hide,'' he said, ``hide behind Social Security.'' Who is \nhiding? Old Joe Louis said, ``You can run, but you can't hide.'' The \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  We made it crystal clear. We have it written in the law. What you are \ntrying to do is hide, in section 7, the repeal of that law. You are the \none that is hiding. You are the one that wants to move the deficit from \nyour political accounting in the Government over to the Social Security \ntrust fund and decimate the program. That is exactly what has been \ngoing on.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 6 minutes.\n\n[[Page S5830]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I would gladly yield to the distinguished ranking \nmember of our Budget Committee. I thought he was eloquent. I thought he \nmade a masterful statement that was common sense. Out in the Midwest \nthey think that way. I would be glad to yield to the distinguished \nSenator from Nebraska if he would like a little bit of time in the \nremaining few minutes I have.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank very much my great friend and colleague from South \nCarolina, whom I have admired ever since I came here 18 years ago. I \nserved under him on the Budget Committee, and I served under him in his \nchairmanship of the Commerce Committee. We have worked together for so \nvery long on the budget problems of the United States of America. But I \nsimply say that I wish everybody who serves in Congress had his head \nscrewed on as correctly as does the Senator from South Carolina.\n\n  During all of this rancorous debate about who is to blame, I am \nreminded once again of that time--it must have been in 1979--when Jimmy \nCarter was President of the United States. I believe the Senator was on \nthe Budget Committee and Senator Muskie served as chairman. I remember \nwell the statement that the Senator made when the President of the \nUnited States called us down to the White House. The President was very \nalarmed by the fact that the deficit for that particular fiscal year \nwas likely to go over $100 billion, and if we did not arrest what we \nwere doing, we were going to exceed in the next year or two $1 \ntrillion--the horrible $1 trillion figure--on the national debt. I do \nnot know what the interest on the debt was at that time, but obviously \nit was small compared to what we are now paying.\n  So the Senator from South Carolina is accurate in explaining what he \ndid with regard to the remarks that have been made on the floor of this \nSenate today.\n  We are not here to find fault. We are here trying to solve a problem. \nBut the problem we have been sinking into over the years goes back to \nthe time when supply-side economics was ushered into this body, when \nRonald Reagan became President of the United States.\n  As the Senator from South Carolina just said, President Ronald \nReagan, who is an honorable man, said when he came into office that he \nwas going to balance the budget in 4 years. The facts of the matter \nwere that the budget went out of balance in those 4 years faster than \nit has gone out of balance any time in the whole history of the United \nStates of America.\n  The facts of the matter are, while there has been so much criticism \nof the President of the United States today, it should be remembered \nand written indelibly, so it will not be forgotten, that under this \nPresident we have had 3 successive years of deficit reduction, from a \nfigure of about a $300 billion shortfall in the budget each year, down \nto about $130 billion. That is what Bill Clinton has done.\n  So Bill Clinton is the one who has accomplished reducing the deficit \nfaster than any President, probably going back to Harry Truman or \nLyndon Johnson. We still have a major problem on our hands. It goes \nback, and all of this crying and moaning today goes back to that period \nin the early 1980's when the United States of America was under $1 \ntrillion in national debt and was under $100 billion a year in the \nannual deficit.\n  That rose appreciably. And as the Senator from South Carolina has \nsaid time and time again, if we had not run up those deficits that were \nrun up under Ronald Reagan, the budget would be balanced today, would \nbe in surplus today, and we would not have all the concerns that we do \nhave about future solvency of Social Security and Medicare.\n  So I simply say that the reason I am not going to vote for the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, as I elaborated on to \nsome extent earlier today, is the fact, Mr. President, that this is a \nsham. This is a political sham where the U.S. Senate is being used as a \ntool in the Presidential race. Unfortunately, that is not the way to \nrun the Government and that certainly is not the way to run our budget. \nI do appreciate very much the Senator yielding me time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. According to the timekeeper, Senator Exon had \n2 minutes reserved for him; so using those 2 minutes, there would still \nbe 2 minutes left.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield the balance of my 2 minutes to my \nfriend from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  In the 2 minutes I will read from the daddy rabbit of Reaganomics \nwhere they start talking about growth now, David Stockman:\n\n       The root problem goes back to the July 1981 frenzy of \n     excessive and imprudent tax cutting that shattered the \n     Nation's fiscal stability. A noisy faction of Republicans \n     have willfully denied this giant mistake for fiscal \n     governance and their own culpability in it ever since. \n     Instead, they have incessantly poisoned the political debate \n     with a mindless stream of antitax venom while pretending that \n     economic growth and spending cuts alone could cure the \n     deficit. It ought to be obvious by now that we can't grow our \n     way out.\n\n  With the time left I see the distinguished colleague from Texas, the \nsenior colleague from Texas. I know we will hear a lecture about who is \nin the wagon. It is the contention of the Senator from South Carolina \nthat it is the Senators and Congressmen in this wagon. We have been in \nthe wagon for 15 years, spending $270 billion for nothing, having a \nwonderful time, and now with this so-called balanced budget amendment \nwe will get from a wagon into a limousine to ride around the \ncountryside and tell them how we bit the bullet and something will \nhappen two Presidential elections from now.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield the senior Senator from Texas 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me say to my dear colleague from South Carolina that I \ndo not want to talk about who is in the White House. I want to change \nwho is in the White House. Today I want to talk about drought.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/05/senate-section/article/S5819-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE DROUGHT\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have 45 million bushels of feed grain in \nemergency reserve in the United States. We pay $10 million a year in \nrent to store that feed grain. We have a major drought in many parts of \nthe country. Obviously, much of it is centered in my part of the \ncountry. I thought last night we had worked out an agreement whereby we \ncould pass a resolution calling on the Secretary of Agriculture to \nrelease this emergency feed grain to let it flow into the market and \nflow to people who are being forced to liquidate their livestock herds \nbecause they cannot obtain food.\n  It is my understanding that we have now worked that out. I think it \nis very important this resolution pass tonight. This is not going to \nmake it rain in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. It is not a solution for \nthe kind of divine intervention that we need in eliminating the \ndrought, but it is a small step in the right direction. I hope this \nresolution tonight will pass. I was disappointed the Democratic leader \nobjected to it yesterday. We could have sent good news out last night. \nI hope we can do that tonight.\n  In addition, Senator Hutchison and I hope, tonight, to pass a \nresolution on haying on conservation reserve land. If you will \nremember, the President wisely, in an action that I applauded, allowed \npeople to put livestock on conservation reserve land. We want to let \nthem hay it in drought areas. I think that is also a step in the right \ndirection.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/05/senate-section/article/S5830-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5830-S5851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the resolution.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amount of time \nthe Senator from Texas used not count against the total remaining time \nRepublicans have on the balanced budget debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for a good number of hours today the Senate \nhas been involved in what is an important debate, the issue of a \nbalanced budget amendment to our Constitution.\n\n[[Page S5831]]\n\n  Before I begin, I want to acknowledge the hard work and leadership of \nseveral Members of the Senate and the House who have devoted many years \nof effort on behalf of this legislation. These have included Senator \nThurmond, Senator Hatch, and of course the distinguished majority \nleader, Senator Dole, on our side of the aisle; Senator Simon, who is a \ntrue statesman and friend, and Senator Heflin, on the other side; and \nCongressmen Stenholm and Schaefer, the House authors of this amendment.\n  This legislation has come a long way. In 1982, the Senate voted 69 to \n31 to pass a balanced budget amendment. It fell 46 votes short in the \nHouse. Last year, the House passed it by 300 votes to 132. It lost here \nin the Senate by a single vote. Of course, we know that Senator Dole \nchanged his vote to preserve the right to move for reconsideration.\n  We are now in reconsideration of House Joint Resolution 1. That was \nafter six Democrat Senators switched their vote and opposed the same \nlanguage that they had voted for 1 year earlier. This is an issue, Mr. \nPresident, that is not going to go away. If it is not going to be this \nCongress, it certainly is going to be the next Congress or another \nCongress very soon that has to deal with this issue.\n\n  There is a very simple reason why it will not go away, because we are \nnot here to decide whether there will be a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution, we are here to decide whether the American people \nought to have a right to express their will on this issue. In other \nwords, under article V of the Constitution, we in Congress may only \npropose amendments to the States for ratification.\n  That is what we are here to do. The reason I think, Mr. President, \nthis will not go away is because in 1982, 63 percent of the American \npublic said this was an issue that ought to be addressed by Congress \npassing a balanced budget amendment and sending it to the States. In a \nGallup Poll just within the last week, by 83 percent to 14 percent--a 6 \nto 1 margin--they said they support the balanced budget amendment and \nit is time we deal with this issue. In other words, the American \npeople, by a very large majority now, say to the Congress of the United \nStates, ``Give us the right to choose.''\n  Tomorrow when we vote on this, it will be Democrats on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate that will refuse the American people the right to \nchoose whether to ratify this amendment. Those who oppose the \namendment, those who seek to postpone the day of reckoning when this \nGovernment must deal with this issue are simply not recognizing their \nmoral obligation to respond as they should to this issue.\n  Why is it happening now, that the Senate will not pass this \namendment? Why will some in the opposition not stay true to where they \nwere on this issue over the last good many years? By that, I mean, Mr. \nPresident, acting in a bipartisan way. Why does this issue appear to \nhave become so partisan?\n  The balanced budget amendment to our Constitution has always been a \nbipartisan issue. It is now clearly partisan. The President put \ntremendous pressure on Democrats in 1995. That is why six Senators \nswitched to ``no'' votes from their previous history of ``yes'' votes. \nWe know that. The record ought to be awfully clear that is what \nhappened. Up until that time, we always had that strong bipartisan \nmajority in support of the amendment. Last year, for example, 72 \nDemocrats in the House voted for it; 14 Democrats in the Senate voted \nfor it.\n  I think, Mr. President, it is truly sad and certainly frustrating \nwhen you think you have agreement on such a fundamental principle of \ngovernment, only to see Senators change their votes. This is not a \npartisan issue but, I think, a moral issue, a moral imperative, a \nresponsibility of this Senate, to at least allow the American people to \nexpress their will. Now we find the only response is that the welfare \nstate mentality of this administration, and tragically enough, those \nwho now oppose this amendment, now want to politicize it. I am afraid \nthat is how the vote will come out.\n  There are two reasons why the balanced budget amendment was defeated \nin this past year. In this 104th Congress, the party whose majority and \nleadership opposed the balanced budget amendment no longer had control \nof the Congress. They could always manipulate the vote in the past. \nThey could always assure it would not pass. This year, by a change in \nthe electorate, the American people, and most importantly, the \nCongress, and always the interest groups involved, knew the Congress \nwas firing with real bullets. The liberal special interest groups who \nare feeding off big Government spending and sending the bill to our \nchildren realized we were the closest ever to sending a balanced budget \namendment to the States.\n  That is when the President said to his friends here on the other \nside, ``You have to block this. You have to stop this.'' That is why \nsix Senators who had been with us before backed off, changed their \ntune, found an excuse to say something different, switched their vote \nfrom a yes to a no. This President, who had never really been for a \nbalanced budget, was able to call the tune. Tragically enough, he and \nhis colleagues denied the American people an opportunity to choose. The \nPresident who sent us a so-called balanced budget with an $81 billion \ndeficit in the year 2002 is the one that is now denying the American \npeople their constitutional right to decide this issue.\n  I simply call on President Clinton to release his hostages, if you \nwill, to release the ``BBA 6'' that once were with us, the Balanced \nBudget Amendment Six, who once sat on the other side, proud to vote for \na balanced budget amendment.\n  I say, Mr. President, let our colleagues go. Let the American people \nhave a chance to decide. That is really what this effort is all about. \nCongresses do not enact constitutional amendments; they only propose.\n  But you would think, from the debate you heard today, that the vote \nto be cast on the floor of this Senate tomorrow will be the deciding \nfactor that crumbles the Government, destroys the budget.\n  No, it will not be that at all, Mr. President. What passing this \namendment would do is launch one of the most important national debates \nin the history of our country--a debate that would occur in every \ncapital city in every State in our Nation among the legislators of that \nState, as to whether this Government balances its budget, and whether \nthe people have a right to tell us to do so--as I think they ought to \nhave.\n  Those six flip-floppers--those who voted against the amendment when \nthey previously had all been for it--used a very interesting word, a \nneat little three-letter word, the ``but\" word. They used that three-\nletter word something like this: ``I am for balancing the budget, but \nnot this way.'' ``I am for a balanced budget amendment, but not this \none.'' ``I was for a balanced budget amendment last year, but''--but--\n``I discovered a new reason to be against it this year.''\n  Mr. President, the amendment was not any different in March 1995 from \nwhat it was in March 1994. Why did they change?\n  The politics changed. The politics changed dramatically in the fall \nof 1994, and, as I said, they knew that we were now firing with real \nbullets, and the chance to send a balanced budget to the American \npeople was, for the first time, truly a real likelihood.\n  Members of this body may have read a book written a few years ago by \na former staffer of the Democrat Speaker of the House, a book on \n``Inside-the-Beltway Political Gamesmanship.'' It had an entire chapter \ndevoted to the following rule, Mr. President:\n  When you are losing the argument, concede on the principle and \ncontinue to fight over the details.\n  The balanced budget amendment opponents, obviously, have read the \nbook, memorized that rule, and are today implementing it on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate.\n  Now we have at least 72 Senators who say that they agree on the \nprinciple of a balanced budget amendment. But fewer than the 67--the \ntwo-thirds necessary--that will ever vote for the passage of one.\n  Now there appear to be 90 or 100 Senators who say, ``Well, now, we \nagree on the principle of a balanced budget.'' But there are more than \nenough votes to sustain the President's veto when, in fact, he vetoes a \nreal balanced budget. In other words, when you are losing the argument, \nconcede on the principle and continue to fight on the details.\n\n[[Page S5832]]\n\n  Mr. President, I respect the sincerely held opinions of those who \nhave come to the floor and oppose any balanced budget amendment. That \nis different. There are Senators who do that. Senator Bob Byrd of West \nVirginia says he opposes any balanced budget amendment. It is my \nunderstanding that he has been consistent in not voting for one. He \nholds true to his conviction. He does not now agree ``in principle'' \nand say, ``But something is wrong with the details.'' Well, I have to \nrespect that. That is fair.\n  What frustrates me, and will increasingly anger the American people, \nis how so many in this body, or the other, say, ``Oh, I am for a \nbalanced budget amendment in principle,'' but, Mr. President, their \nactions imply differently, as shown in their votes versus their words.\n  It is a time-tested trick in this business called ``political \ngamesmanship'' to make the perfect the enemy of the good.\n  If you want to kill a proposal like the balanced budget amendment, \ninstead of saying you are against it, when 83 percent of the American \npeople are for it, you simply say that it is not good enough, not quite \nthe way we want it, and if we can only shape it a little differently, \nthen we would have it the way it ought to be.\n\n  Now, that is nitpicking in the highest form, Mr. President. You make \nup the exceptions that would gut the amendment, and you say, ``This is \nan improvement because I cannot vote for it the way it is.'' The result \nis, you kill the amendment because you want to preserve the status quo.\n  All this nitpicking and all of the blamesmanship really misses the \npoint. The one central question before us is this:\n  Would this country be better off, would the lives of American \ncitizens be improved, if we placed the Government under a balanced \nbudget amendment to our Constitution?\n  Would our children have a better life now and in the future? Would \nworking men and women have better jobs? Would our senior citizens be \nmore secure in the Government's ability to keep its promises to them? \nWould homes and education be more affordable?\n  Over the long run, would there be more money left over for charities, \nfamilies, and Government to care for the poor, the sick, and the needy?\n  These are all variations of one question. And, of course, the answer \nto that question is undeniably yes. We know that, and the American \npeople know that. We know of the huge amount of money, the economic \nvitality, that the debt of the Government now consumes.\n  Balanced budget amendment opponents say, ``We will not vote for a \nconstitutional amendment to require a balanced budget until we see your \nactual plan to balance the budget, because we know we can produce \none.''\n  You and I both know, Mr. President, we have produced a balanced \nbudget, in answer to that argument, over the last 12 months.\n  We, in fact, produced a balanced budget and did not touch Social \nSecurity. We increased spending and increased consumer choices for \nevery senior citizen in Medicare. We preserved the safety net for the \nneedy and cut the redtape to make it easier for Federal-State \npartnerships to help them. And we continued to be responsible in \nprotecting the environment.\n  All of those things were done in the context of a balanced budget. We \nanswered their charge, and we answered their call.\n  And the President vetoed it.\n  Now we understand a great deal more about this debate. Without the \nextraordinary discipline that our Constitution will bring us, we \nprobably will find it very difficult to get to a balanced budget, or \neven a nearly-balanced budget, unless we can, in fact, get a \nconstitutional amendment that requires, in the supreme law of the land, \nthat this body and the other respond every year with a balanced budget.\n  Here is an example of why I think that argument makes so much sense. \nHere is the record about the goodwill and the intent of Congresses and \nPresidents of the United States when it comes to balancing the budget:\n  The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, also called the Anti-\nDeficiency Act, was intended to keep the budget balanced. The Revenue \nAct of 1964 was supposed to balance the budget. The Byrd amendment of \n1978--offered by Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia--required balanced \nbudgets. The Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978 called for balancing the \nbudget. The Revenue Act of 1978 was supposed to balance the budget. The \nDebt Limit Increase of 1979 included language to balance the budget. \nThe Bretton Woods amendment of 1980, as amended by a second Byrd \namendment, required a balanced budget. The recodification of title \nXXXI, in 1982, with an amendment better known as Byrd III, called for a \nbalanced budget. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act--act No. 1--of 1985 \nrequired a balanced budget. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act of 1987--act \nNo. 2--required a balanced budget. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 \nwas supposed to balance the budget.\n  Why, then, do we have a debt of the kind we have today, of $5.13 \ntrillion dollars? Why are we spending hundreds of billions of dollars \non interest, after all of that exercise, from 1921 to 1990, in which \nthe specific language and the direction of the public policy of this \ncountry was to balance the Federal budget, and why do we not have a \nbalanced budget?\n  The reason is very simple. We do not have an amendment to the \nconstitution. We do not have in the organic law of the land a \nrequirement that says to the Congress and the President that you cannot \npass ``go,'' you have to make the tough choices, you have to do it.\n  As a result of that, the tough choices were never made. The American \npublic was played to. There was good intent in many of those instances. \nBut Congresses and Presidents simply could not face the kind of \ndecisionmaking that the people expected of responsible leaders.\n  Now, I have heard today the flip and the flop of the red herring so \nmany times coming from that side that it has been most difficult to \nhold a straight face.\n  What am I talking about? I am talking about Social Security. Let me \nsay for the Record they are wrong. It is a false argument, and they \nknow it. But once again the safety for the status quo is in fighting \nover the details.\n  If you do not want to face up to balancing the budget, and if you \nreally do not want a balanced budget amendment, then you find a new \nargument. Just this year alone, after those six Senators were always \nwith us, when the President said to them, you cannot be with the \namendment's supporters, find a way out, they found a way out. They \nfound a new argument. That new argument was Social Security.\n  At best, those making the argument--while one might wonder about \ntheir intention, and I trust that it is good--I must agree with Members \non our side that they are tremendously misinformed.\n  At worst, there are big special interest groups with deep pockets \nusing mass mail scare tactics to frighten innocent seniors, with one \ngoal and one goal alone, and that is to destroy the idea of a balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  Senior citizens I have talked to in my State of Idaho--and I am sure \nthat you have also, Mr. President, in your State of Michigan--know \nperfectly well that a bankrupt Federal Government will not have the \nability to send any Social Security checks out to anybody.\n  No checks will go out, if our Government is bankrupt. By killing the \nbalanced budget amendment, opponents are killing the only way--the only \ntrue way--to save Social Security and other seniors programs.\n  Robert J. Myers, the former chief actuary and former deputy \ncommissioner of the Social Security Administration, has said this. We \nhave had him before hearings. He has publicly testified and made these \ncomments. He says,\n\n       ``Regaining control of our fiscal affairs is the most \n     important step we can take to protect the soundness of the \n     Social Security trust fund. I urge Congress to make the goal \n     a reality, to pass a balanced budget amendment without \n     delay.''\n\n  That is a former chief actuary of the Social Security system. He says \nthe only way you save Social Security is to balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, we keep hearing about raiding Social Security. No one \nis raiding the Social Security trust funds. That is false rhetoric. It \nis wrong for them to use it, and they know it. But it gives them their \nexcuse for opposing the amendment.\n\n[[Page S5833]]\n\n  There are two things happening.\n  First, ever since President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a Democrat, \ncreated Social Security in the 1930's, any surplus funds have been \nborrowed by the Federal Treasury and invested in Federal bonds.\n  Why? So that the money not needed immediately to pay out benefits \ncould earn interest safely and soundly.\n  Second, ever since President Lyndon Johnson, a Democrat, put the \nGovernment on a unified budget in the 1960's, annual Social Security \nsurpluses have been counted as reducing the overall Federal deficit in \nthat year.\n  It is simply a matter of bookkeeping. Many believe it is bad \nbookkeeping. But in all fairness, it is no ruse. It is only \nbookkeeping.\n  Those are facts. They are reality. There have been no games played. \nThat is the law.\n  Ever since our last balanced budget in 1969, these borrowing and \nbookkeeping practices have been happening with Social Security. Under \n20 budgets passed by Democrat Congresses, under six budgets passed by \ndivided Congresses, and so far for one budget resulting during a \nRepublican Congress, this has been the law, and this has been the \nreality, this borrowing, and this bookkeeping.\n\n  The reality is that every budget submitted by President Clinton in \nthe last year, the House Democrat blue dog budget in the last year, the \nConrad substitute budget, and the Chafee-Breaux budget--all of them use \nthis kind of borrowing and bookkeeping.\n  So let us not play games with the record of the Congress, with the \nrecord of the Senate, with the minds of the American people. The \nreality is in the answer to the question, Are you for or are you \nagainst a balanced budget? If you are for one, you will allow the \nAmerican people to engage in this debate, to become actively involved.\n  Treasury borrowing from Social Security would continue under the \nbalanced budget amendment, and under any and every substitute--the ones \noffered by Senator Hollings, Senator Wyden, Senator Dorgan, Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Reid, whomever--the reality is, under their \nalternatives, they continue to borrow from the trust funds because the \nlaws of the 1930's require it.\n  Their alternative does nothing to change or stop the Treasury from \nborrowing Social Security surpluses.\n  Why do they not tell us this? In other words, get honest and get \nreal. Quit playing the mind game with the American people.\n  There is only one way to change Treasury borrowing from Social \nSecurity, and it has nothing to do with a balanced budget amendment.\n  The only way to make surplus Social Security funds unavailable to the \nFederal Government is to pass a law that requires Social Security \nsurpluses to be invested somewhere else outside of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Has that been proposed today? It has not. Will it be proposed by any \none of these Senators? We will see, but I doubt it. And if that bill \nwere proposed, and if it became law, that law would have exactly the \nsame effect under our amendment or their amendment.\n  So, to those who are suggesting that their opposition to the balanced \nbudget amendment is because of Social Security, I say, You do not quite \nargue the whole argument. Bring forth your bill to change the system \nfor investing in Treasury bonds, if that is what you believe. But stop \nhiding behind this ridiculous, absolutely false claim that the balanced \nbudget amendment somehow does anything to harm the Social Security \nsystem.\n  Every alternative to the balanced budget amendment the opponents have \nput forth dealing with Social Security has loopholes in it that you \ncould drive nearly any amount of spending through it, as long as you \ncall it Social Security. They are more loophole than law.\n  Their proposal would allow Social Security to run unlimited deficits \nand would allow future Congresses to raid Social Security trust funds \nto spend for anything and everything they wanted.\n  Has that question been asked of them today? No, it has not. I ask it \nnow. Is that what you are proposing--to allow unlimited deficits in \nSocial Security to allow borrowing for other purposes? Of course, they \nwould say no, but that is what their language would allow. But they do \nnot seem to want to talk about it.\n  A flatout exemption for Social Security in the balanced budget \namendment would mean more borrowing and more debt. It would mean Social \nSecurity would go bankrupt to pay for all this other spending, or there \nwould have to be a huge tax increase to stabilize it.\n  Several Senators have had serious discussions to see if there was a \nway to protect the surpluses of Social Security trust funds from being \nused for other purposes, without creating loopholes.\n  Senator Simon, whom I have worked with for years on this issue, \nSenator Domenici, and Senator Hatch spent an awful lot of time, and I \nhave, too, trying to find out if there was a clean, responsible way to \nprotect the surpluses Social Security trust funds in the context of the \nargument put forth by Democrats.\n\n  We know that can be done, but we have not been able to accomplish \nagreement with those who say that is what they want.\n  We said, let's prohibit Social Security surpluses from being counted \nto make the deficit look smaller. Let's balance the budget without \nusing the Social Security surplus. But, when Social Security starts \nrunning deficits around the year 2019, let's make up those deficits, \nlet's keep the lid on Federal borrowing, and let's shore up Social \nSecurity with funds from the rest of the budget.\n  Unfortunately, the opponents once again agreed with us on principle, \nbut not on the details.\n  Let's get back to the most important point in this Social Security \ndebate. And it is something very, very simple. If you balance the \nbudget and if you quit creating debt, you in fact strengthen and \nstabilize Social Security. You solve the problem now by creating fiscal \nresponsibility and economic growth in this country, and you accomplish \nthat by balancing budgets and moving along the process that sets this \neconomy free.\n  Deficit spending and a mounting national debt are taking a tremendous \ntoll on real people, on real families. And if we do nothing, it will \nonly get worse.\n  The President's own budget for fiscal 1995 said that unless things \nchange, Mr. President, future generations face a lifetime total tax \nrate of nearly 82 percent. A new analysis by the Congressional Budget \nOffice says that rate actually may be around 84 percent.\n  The National Taxpayers Union estimates that unless things change, a \nchild born today will pay an extra $180,000 in taxes just to pay \ninterest on the national debt. And the President and some Democrats in \nthe Senate will not allow the American people to create the mechanism \nthat will stop the growth of that kind of debt structure.\n  The Concord Coalition says that the existing Federal debt already has \nreduced the typical American family income by 15,000 spendable dollars \na year.\n  On the other hand, who benefits if we balance the budget?\n  The kids benefit, the future benefits, and everyone who wants a job, \nwho wants to buy a home, who wants a good education, wants to buy a \ncar, wants the kind of economic growth that will provide his or her \nchildren the future opportunities that they had at their age when they \nwere young.\n  That is what this whole debate is about--about a $2,400-a-year \nreduction in a mortgage payment on $75,000, 30-year mortgage. Or it is \nabout a $1,000 reduction in interest on the life of a 4-year car loan. \nOr a family saving $1,900 on a 10-year student loan. And it's about \ncreating 6 million new jobs by the year 2002.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield to the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I heard you say balanced budgets are good for the \nchildren and it is good for the future. It is good for senior citizens, \ntoo, is it not?\n  Mr. CRAIG. If the senior citizens want a strong and stable system of \neconomic security, you are darned right it is good. There is something \nelse. Senior citizens live on fixed incomes. The best thing in the \nworld for them is a very strong economy that allows them to live and to \nnot have their money exploited by inflation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It seems to me that almost everybody who has looked at\n\n[[Page S5834]]\n\nthe Social Security system over time has said the most significant, \npositive thing that can happen for that Social Security system is to \nhave a strong, growing, robust American economy with low inflation. I \nthought one of the big reasons we were all working on this balanced \nbudget is because it is more apt to produce a strong, robust growing \nAmerican economy than deficit spending of the type we have been \nundertaking for the last 40 years.\n  Am I correct in that?\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator is correct. A year ago we were challenged on \nthis floor by those who opposed a balanced budget amendment and who \nsaid you can balance the budget without an amendment.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee met that challenge responsibly \nin the way that it ought to be met and produced a balanced budget \namendment, one that brought us to balance. The chairman produced a \nbudget that honored the critical policy priorities of this country and \nsent it to a President, this President, and he vetoed it.\n  And now it is this President who is twisting the arms over here on \nthe other side to assure that a balanced budget amendment does not pass \nand that the American people do not get to exercise their \nconstitutional to debate whether to ratify it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. CRAIG. So the chairman is absolutely right.\n  Mr. President, let me try to close soon. My colleague from Alaska is \nhere to debate this issue. Here are some other statistics that are just \nso darned important for all of us to understand.\n  The gross Federal debt now tops $5 trillion--that is more than \n$19,000 for every man, woman and child in this country. The gross \ninterest payments this year are around $344 billion.\n  Here is what that says to all of us who try to deal with these \nmonstrously big numbers that nobody really understands.\n  That $344 billion in interest payments this year amounts to $1,300 \nfor every American. In other words, the average American household will \npay $3,400 in taxes this year, not for roads or education or defense, \nbut to pay interest on past Federal debts.\n  Gross interest payments this year will be equal to 54 percent of all \nthe individual income taxes collected.\n  Gross interest payments on debt will be just $4 billion less than \nwhat we will spend on the entire Social Security bill for the year; $77 \nbillion more than we will spend on all domestic discretionary programs \nput together; $79 billion more than we will spend on defense, the \nsecond largest Federal program; $145 billion more than all Federal \nmeans tested poverty programs put together; $148 billion more than we \nspent on all Medicare, the third biggest Federal program.\n  What is the message here? The message is that slowly but surely \nbecause this Senate has been unwilling to grapple with the true issue \nof getting to a balanced budget--and that is the balanced budget \namendment--over the years we have seen this debt grow in proportion to \nthe budget and the economy, and today's interest on debt is literally \nconsuming the Federal budget and the assets of the American people.\n  The Economic and Budget Outlook just released by the Congressional \nBudget Office contains a truly frightening chapter on the long-term \nbudget outlook. It says, if we do nothing, our children face a grim \nfuture.\n  Today, we are suffering from historically slow economic growth. \nUnless we change things, in one generation, the economy will start a \nreal decline and our children will face a permanently declining \nstandard of living.\n  If we do not pass this amendment, I fear for our children and I fear \nfor our country.\n  If we do nothing:\n  In less than two generations, the debt burden will grow so huge that, \nin CBO's words, it ``would exceed levels that the economy could \nreasonably support.''\n  Our children will reach the prime of their life and then retire in a \nnation in the grip of a permanently worsening recession.\n  Our grandchildren will raise families in a declining Third World \neconomy. Or--and I do not say this lightly--there will be a revolution.\n  On the other hand, these same CBO projections show what will happen \nif we do the right thing today:\n  If we balance the budget permanently beginning in 2002, real incomes \nfor the next generation will be one-third higher than they are today.\n  Our path is clear.\n  The worst thing you can say about the balanced budget amendment is \nthat maybe Congresses and Presidents will have the courage and vision \nto do the right thing without it.\n  The bitter experience of history suggests otherwise.\n  The best thing you can say about this amendment is that it guarantees \nwe will pass on the American dream to our children and that they will \ncontinue to have the opportunity for a better life; that our seniors \nwill be more economically secure; and that Americans today and tomorrow \nwill have more and better jobs.\n  I certainly hope we can arrive at that magic two-thirds vote \ntomorrow. I certainly hope the President would free his balanced budget \namendment hostages over on the other side and allow them to vote their \ntrue conviction as they have over the years under the leadership of the \nSenator from Illinois, Paul Simon, who has worked so hard to keep this \na balanced, bipartisan issue. I am so disappointed that this issue has \nbecome a partisan-type issue. But I remain hopeful, because the \nbalanced budget amendment will not go away. The people want it. The \nfuture needs it. And our nation deserves it.\n  Mr. President, I now yield----\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Ten minutes to the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair indicates to the Senator from Idaho \nhe has exactly 10 minutes remaining under his time.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Idaho. I \nthought his comments were certainly appropriate. Let us reflect a \nlittle bit about the vote we are going to cast tomorrow. That vote will \nreally determine the economic stability and the vitality of this Nation \nas we enter the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, I am going to vote for this balanced budget amendment \nbecause I believe nothing short of amending the Constitution is going \nto change our addiction to spending and living beyond our means.\n  I was a commercial banker during my previous life outside this body. \nI recall back in 1962 the Federal Government's budget reached $100 \nbillion. By 1971, it had doubled to $200 billion. By 1977, it had \ndoubled again. In 1983, the Federal budget topped $800 billion. The \nbudget for next year, fiscal year 1997, will be more than $1.6 \ntrillion.\n  We have heard concerns expressed on the other side relative to the \nSocial Security issue. It has been commented that somehow a balanced \nbudget will have a detrimental effect on our obligation to meet our \nSocial Security commitments.\n  Just think for a moment. How can we meet our obligation to our \nseniors, how can we meet the obligation of coming generations if our \nfiscal house is not in order? It has already been suggested as to what \nthe increased tax burden will have to be on future generations.\n  We have been spending far in excess of revenues. That is like \ncarrying an overdraft or carrying your accounts on your credit card \nknowing you cannot pay them off. So what have we been doing? We have \nbeen increasing the amount that we are spending for interest. I think \nit is somewhere in the area of $240 billion today. That is nearly \n$1,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. What does it do? It \npays interest on the Federal debt.\n  Now, not too many people talk about the Federal debt, but we have \nincreased the Federal debt authorization now to $5 trillion. It seems \nas if we go through a budget process, we add up what we need, we take a \nlook at the revenue that we have, and instead of either increasing the \nrevenue or cutting the expenditures we simply take what we need and add \nit to the accumulated national Federal debt, which is over $5 trillion.\n  This interest cost must be paid. I have said it on this floor time \nand time again. Interest is like owning a horse that eats while you \nsleep. It goes on and on and on. What is the exposure with the \nincreased amount that we have to pay? As everyone knows, interest rates \nfluctuate. I am often reminded of what the prime rate was in\n\n[[Page S5835]]\n\nDecember of 1980. The prime rate was 20.5. You can imagine the interest \ncost on $5 trillion if, indeed, we were in that range again, and this \ncould happen. It happened before.\n  After years of trying, last year this Congress came within one vote \nof sending a balanced budget constitutional amendment to the States. \nThe amendment passed the House of Representatives on January 26 when \nHouse Joint Resolution 1 was approved by a vote of 300 to 132, easily \nexceeding the necessary two-thirds majority. The Senate added an \namendment restricting the power of the courts to enforce the amendment \nand defeated many weakening amendments, but then on March 2 the Senate \nfailed by one vote to adopt the proposed constitutional amendment.\n  We have the opportunity to address this again tomorrow.\n  If we look at history, we will realize that for more than one-third \nof a century--35 of the last 36 years, the Government has been running \na continuous and unending string of deficits. Even if we adopt this \namendment, it is an absolute certainty the deficits will continue into \nthe year 2000.\n  I have reflected on the debt being more than $5 trillion. In 10 \nyears, Mr. President, that debt is going to rise by 80 percent up to \nwhat? Nine trillion dollars. Put another way, in the year 2006, every \nman, woman, and child in America will owe Uncle Sam $32,700. For a \nfamily of four, that is $131,000.\n  What are we thinking of here? There should be absolutely no question \nthat we do not have the self-discipline in this body to address a \nbalanced budget process. With a constitutional amendment, it will \nmandate that process.\n  We have not been blind to these deficits. For the last 11 years, \nCongress and the President have sought to find solutions, remedies. We \npassed statutes and reconciliation bills, all in the name of reaching a \ndeficit of zero. On three occasions over the past 10 years, legislators \non both sides of the aisle sat down with the President and tried to \nhammer out some workable solutions to solve the deficit. On every \noccasion the promise of a zero deficit has evaporated.\n  Congress did not have the discipline or the political courage to do \nthe one thing that would bring down the deficit, reduce spending. Yes, \nwe voted to raise taxes on more than one occasion, but have we ever cut \nor frozen spending? No. It was only last year that we finally had the \ncourage to face up to the challenge of runaway entitlements. Today, \nthose entitlements account for 55 percent of Federal spending and will \ngrow to 59 percent by the end of this century. There is not going to be \nany discretionary spending left.\n  The American public witnessed, I think, an unprecedented spectacle \nwhen the President vetoed the only creditable balanced budget proposal \never to be written by Congress.\n  Then--we got blamed for it--but he shut down the Government because \nof his refusal to give up the taxing and spending policies that have \nbrought us to the brink of national bankruptcy and placed blame on \nCongress because we attempted to responsibly address the deficit.\n  Had this amendment been incorporated in the Constitution, the \nPresident would have been in violation of his own oath of office to \npreserve, to protect and defend the Constitution--which he refused to \nabide by vetoing a real balanced budget.\n  We are basically broke. Any CPA or banker can look at the Federal \nstatement and find $5 trillion in debt; interest of 14 percent of the \nbudget would tell you that. We can no longer labor under the assumption \nthat business as usual in Washington assumes that every year we can run \nthose deficits of $150 billion, $250 billion, $350 billion--$350 \nbillion. This accumulation of debt has brought us, today, to the point \nwhere, for the first time in our history, we are forced to borrow from \nthe credit markets for the sole purpose of paying interest on the debt.\n  Think of that. We are borrowing to pay interest on the debt. We are \nnot borrowing just out there to fund our programs. We are having to \nborrow to pay the interest. That is why we are broke. It may surprise \nsome people to know that over the next 10 years we would be running a \nsurplus, we would be running a surplus in this country in the Federal \nbudget if every year we did not have to pay that $200 billion to $400 \nbillion annual interest bill that has resulted in our chronic inability \nto bring revenue and spending into balance.\n  I said we are broke. We are borrowing just to cover those interest \ncosts. That is fiscal irresponsibility. We all know it. We are subject \nto the shifting winds of international investment flows, where a minor \nchange of economic policy, not in this country, but in Bonn or London, \nor an earthquake in Japan--those are the people who are financing, if \nyou will, a portion of our debt--could have a direct effect on what \nthis United States Government has to pay for money to finance its debt. \nCan anyone imagine what would happen if the owners of our debt--18 \npercent of which, I might add, is owned by foreigners--if they felt \nthere was a sudden loss of confidence in the U.S. economy, and they \ncalled in the debt, they called in just $300 billion or $500 billion of \nour debt? How would we pay the owners off? We could not unless we \ninflated our dollar to the point that what a dollar buys today would \nactually be worth 50 cents or less. That is how it is done.\n  The only way to get out of this sea of red ink is to adopt a simple \nmandate because we do not have the discipline to do it--we have proven \nit time and time again--and adopt the balanced budget amendment.\n\n  The public knows that no family or business can survive very long \nwhen, year in and year out, the principal of its debt grows and all its \nborrowing is dedicated to paying off the debt holders.\n  When future generations look back on the decisions that we made in \nthe last decade of the 20th century, I know they will appreciate the \nwisdom of the people in the Congress in adding the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. For this amendment stands for the \nproposition that future generations are entitled to economic freedom, \nunburdened by the financial debt of past generations.\n  It is our responsibility to end the practice of sending unpaid bills \nto our children and to our grandchildren. That is a principle that \nbelongs in the Constitution in the same sense as the freedom of speech \nand the freedom of press belong to the Constitution.\n  Let me just repeat that because I firmly believe that. It is our \nresponsibility to end the practice of sending unpaid bills to our \nchildren and grandchildren. That principle belongs in the Constitution \nin the same sense as the freedom of speech and press belong in that \ndocument.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment, send it to the States \nwhere it can be debated by the people. Give them a chance to render \ntheir judgment.\n  Mr. President, I would like to introduce a bill.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Murkowski pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1844 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are talking this evening and voting \ntomorrow on whether to add another amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States. Our Constitution has had 27 amendments added to it in \n209 years. If you do not count the Bill of Rights, the first 10 \namendments, then it has been amended 17 times in about 205 years. That \nis not very many times.\n  Most times that we have amended the Constitution it has been when it \nhas become an absolute necessity. We do not revise this sacred document \notherwise.\n  I support the balanced budget amendment that is before us. I had a \nchance to vote on it last year, when it failed by one vote. I supported \nit in 1994, when it failed by two or three votes, I believe. I voted on \nit in other versions in previous years. I very much support the \nprinciple of having a constitutional amendment and to have our \nConstitution then say that Congress should live within its income. I \nthink this is very, very good discipline that results from such a \nconstitutional provision, a discipline that we see in State legislative \nbodies. I think about 46 States have such requirements. Their \nrequirements make legislative bodies, whether controlled by liberals or \nby conservatives, fiscally responsible. Fiscally responsible is mainly \ninterpreted as living within your annual income. As families must live \nwithin that income, as businesses live within that income, the\n\n[[Page S5836]]\n\nsame discipline ought to apply to the Federal Government.\n  Many of our early constitutional Framers, early statesmen, and early \npolitical leaders, believed in that principle so strongly that they did \nnot feel it had to be put in the Constitution. For maybe 170 years, \nliving within our means, was really not much of a problem. But in the \nlast generation, the Congress and even leaders in the executive branch \nhave gone hog wild on spending money. They have not cared about \nbuilding up a tremendous debt that puts an obligation on future \ngenerations. They failed to consider it an immoral obligation that we \nhave given to other generations.\n  Living beyond our income is an expression of materialism that is too \nrampant in American society. Living beyond one's income, in and of \nitself, is a major problem. Possibly, the Federal deficit is just an \nexpression of our societal excess. But to some extent, maybe the lack \nof leadership shown by us in the Congress of the United States on the \nprinciple of not balancing the Federal budget is an example of not \nliving within our income and has fed that base materialism of the \nAmerican people. I see our discussion today and the amendment we are \ndealing with as an effort to reject that sort of fiscal policy and \nreject the materialism that it promotes within our American society.\n  So we have another chance on this vote for a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment. Who knows, maybe some think this is the last \nchance. I do not think it is the last chance if we do not pass this \ntomorrow. This is not going to go away, so people might as well realize \nthat eventually the wisdom of the American people is going to win out. \nTheir wisdom is that Government ought to live within its income, just \nlike families must live within their income and businesses must live \nwithin their income or otherwise go bankrupt.\n  When is the day of bankruptcy for America? Maybe we cannot predict \nit. It might be next year, or it might be 10 years from now, but there \nis always a day of reckoning when you are not fiscally responsible. The \nsame principles apply whether it is Government or whether it is \nfamilies or businesses.\n  I am thankful for Senator Dole's wisdom in reversing his vote so that \nhe could file this motion to reconsider the balanced budget amendment \nand we can have another opportunity to do right what we did wrong last \nyear. He gave us another vote on this important amendment.\n  Of course, I am also thankful for the U.S. Constitution, including \nall of its inherent imperfections. It may be imperfect, but our \nConstitution has continued longer than any other written form of \ngovernment. I believe that this is because it is a living, breathing, \nand evolving document. Indeed, it is evolution that we seek.\n  Originally, it sought to fulfill the promises of the Declaration of \nIndependence, and that declaration grew out of our Nation's ordeal that \nwe remember as the Revolutionary War. People at that time were, \nliterally, bleeding for a crusade of liberty that they believed in. \nThey knew the oppression of a distant authoritarian monarchy. They had \na yearning to be free. They believed that freedom was bestowed upon \nthem by their creator, and the Constitution reflects that.\n  The Declaration of Independence was a promise of liberty. The \nConstitution--this Constitution that I hold in my right hand--is a \nfulfillment of that promise. It continues to fulfill the promise not of \npoliticians, but of the hearts of the people of our Nation.\n  I believe that American people, again, sense themselves oppressed by \na distant authoritarian power. That authoritarian power is Washington. \nIt has evolved, as such, since the Constitutional Convention of 1787. \nThe oppression that the American people feel is an ever-increasing \nnational debt and the heavy hand of big government. That big government \ncomes as a result of more laws and more expenditures and more programs \nthat are not paid for on a current basis. Rather, they are left to our \nchildren and our grandchildren.\n  Big government, aided and abetted by Congresses and Presidents, \nappropriates the future liability and promissory notes of our children \nand our grandchildren. History teaches us that modern day Presidents \nand Congresses cannot resist the temptation to spend us into oblivion. \nThose who oppose this balanced budget amendment speak with little \ncredibility when they propose with sanctimony some alternative way. We \nhave tried their alternative way, and it failed.\n  In last year's debate, Mr. President, we were told we did not need \nthis constitutional amendment, because if you want to balance the \nbudget, you could just go do it without it being required by the law of \nthe land. So we worked 8 months, in 13 committees, on a 1,800-page \nBalanced Budget Act of 1995. We sent it to the President around \nThanksgiving time. The President vetoed our work on December 5, 1995. \nWe received not one bit of help from people who said we did not need a \nconstitutional amendment. They thought that we could just do it, but \nthey were wrong.\n\n  How many times did we hear on the Senate floor, just do it, and we \ndid it without the constitutional amendment, without the help of people \nwho said, just do it. Then, we got a veto from a President who says now \nhe believes in a balanced budget. At the time of the veto he had not \npresented a balanced budget. We still do not have it, and we will not \nknow if we will have it, even though we are going through the process \nof resolving to balance the next fiscal year's budget.\n  I have come to the conclusion that the only viable alternative is \nwith a congressional commitment to a balanced budget through the \nconstitutional amendment that we have before us. Living within our \nmeans must be the law of the land. Americans must know that we current \nlegislators, and those who follow us, cannot enslave future generations \nto distant creditors. If there is any inalienable right, Mr. President, \nsurely it is the one to know that you are not burdened for the cost of \nsomething that you did not have any opportunity to enjoy.\n  In 1775, Alexander Hamilton said something pertinent on this issue. \nHe said:\n\n       The sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for \n     among old parchments, or musty records. They are written, as \n     with a sunbeam, in the whole volume of human nature, by the \n     hand of the divinity itself; and can never be erased or \n     obscured by mortal power.\n\n  Mr. President, this means that the people's will is the law, and the \nConstitution only becomes the law as enumeration of the people's will. \nIt tells us that sooner or later the American people will again have \ntheir balanced budget, like they did for most of the first 170-year \nhistory of our country. The people will not ultimately be oppressed by \nour spending habits. If we do not show a commitment to a balanced \nbudget, the people will balance the budget with a future Congress. \nTheir first step toward that balance will be to replace the current \nCongress with its irresponsible spending habits. Our first step to \navoid being replaced should be to pass a resolution for this amendment \nand send it to the States for their review.\n  The key to passing a balanced budget amendment is its abundant \ngrassroots, bipartisan support. This support reflects the fact that \nAmericans support the amendment by very, very large margins. It should, \ntherefore, have passed this body a long time ago by equally large \nmargins, but it has not. It has not because some Members of the other \nparty have decided to play politics. Some want to try to deny any \nvictory to Republicans for purely political reasons.\n  I think the American people deserve better. I think that the American \npeople deserve a Government that responds to the will of the American \npeople. They deserve a Government that spends only what it takes in; in \nother words, a Government that does what simple, common sense dictates.\n  Somehow, common sense eludes us. In the past, year after year, \nMembers of one Chamber or the other voted down this constitutional \namendment, and year after year, the budget deficit increased. \nMeanwhile, year after year, our children have been saddled with \nincreasingly larger debt.\n  The American people, I think, expressed their desire to eliminate the \nburden when they elected a Republican Congress in 1994 for the first \ntime in 40 years.\n  A balanced budget would mean a stronger economy, good Government, and \nmore jobs produced by that stronger economy. DRI-McGraw Hill, which\n\n[[Page S5837]]\n\nhas been called the world's leading nonpartisan economic analysis and \nforecasting firm, has concluded that the balanced budget amendment \nwould add credibility to budgeting.\n  This credibility would lead to lower interest rates and a stronger \neconomy. Mr. Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, says \nthat for individuals balancing the budget would yield $2,300 less \ninterest on a 30-year home mortgage, $603 less interest per year on a \nstudent loan, and $150 less per year on car loans. So we are talking \nabout real economic benefit coming from our passing something like the \nfailed Balanced Budget Act of 1995. Possibly we will succeed this year.\n  This same firm found that the lower interest rates resulting from the \nbalanced budget amendment could create half the necessary savings \nneeded to balance the budget in the first place. This is because \ninterest on the debt is such a large portion of our Federal budget. \nLower interest rates then mean lower payments.\n  I believe that the American people are willing to do their part to \nprevent future generations from being saddled with an unconscionable \namount of debt. They are willing to do so even if it means that some \nFederal spending they support would be affected. This is especially \ntrue if our budgeting is done fairly.\n  I am reminded by a constituent of mine who told me he was a lifelong \nDemocrat. He now votes Republican because he is certain that if we do \nnot stop spending more than we take in, we will be the ruin of our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  That is what this debate is all about today. It is about passing on \nthe American dream to our children and our grandchildren. Americans of \nall political persuasions are realizing that the role of the Federal \nGovernment must be limited. Even the people of the other party are \ntaking that view now in this town. So messages from the grassroots, \nexpressed in the last election, are getting through, not only to \nRepublicans, but to Democrats as well.\n  They know that all Federal programs have not delivered what had been \npromised. They also know that the sums of money that are spent on these \ncostly programs are tremendous. Many of these programs have failed or \nare filled with waste and abuse.\n  I hope that the Senators who may have supported this amendment in the \npast, particularly in 1994 when it was the same wording as it is now--\nthey changed their mind last time because of pressure from the White \nHouse--will come back to the original position they had when their \nparty controlled the Congress. That was a time when their President was \nnot fighting the language of this amendment.\n  It seems what was OK in 1994 should have been all right in 1995. \nSenators have one more opportunity in 1996 to correct that mistake. I \nthink the reason to do it is because our children's future is too \nimportant for us to ignore this opportunity.\n  I have spoken before about my first involvement in legislation to \nbalance the budget. It was not a constitutional amendment. It was a law \nto require a balanced budget. There was a Senator by the name of Harry \nF. Byrd from Virginia at that time. I think it was in 1978. I was a \nMember of the other body. I worked with Senator Byrd to pass a simple \nlaw that says, ``The Federal Government shall not spend more than it \ntakes in.''\n  That was a very well-intentioned but law. Quite frankly, as I look \nback on it, it unfortunately was a very weak response to a very serious \nproblem that was a lot less serious then than it is today. Because \nunder our Constitution, as you know, succeeding Congresses can \nobliterate anything that a preceding Congress has done.\n  I learned an important lesson from that Byrd-Grassley legislation. \nCongress needs help with self-discipline. Each of the prior efforts to \nbalance the budget, whether it was the Byrd-Grassley law or whether it \nwas Gramm-Rudman I, Gramm-Rudman II, or other budget agreements in the \n1990's, have all failed because they can be changed so easily.\n  Pure and simple, big government is addicted to big spending and the \nbig debt that results therefrom. That is why a constitutional amendment \nis necessary. A constitutional amendment, though difficult to get \nadopted in the first place, is also difficult to change. It cannot be \nchanged like Gramm-Rudman I or II was changed. So it would not be \nchanged by a simple unwillingness of legislative bodies to follow its \nmandate and bite the bullet.\n\n  We take an oath to uphold this Constitution every 6 years when we are \nsworn into the Senate. We see the effective restraint that a \nconstitutional provision brings to the States, as I have spoken of \nalready. Because State legislatures that are controlled by conservative \nRepublicans or liberal Democrats take a similar oath, the rule of law \nthat follows it applies and is strictly adhered to.\n  So only the balanced budget amendment that is before us will \nultimately restrain runaway Government spending. A new day will come \nwhen we have a constitutional amendment disciplining our spending \nappetites. The Senate's passage of the balanced budget amendment would \nshow the public that we have decided to get serious about protecting \nthe American dream and passing that dream on to our children and \ngrandchildren. It is in doubt today with big debt, high interest rates, \nand a growth in the economy that is slower than it takes to sustain the \nAmerican dream for our expanding population.\n  Because of high interest rates and high taxes, there are 3 million \njobs that have not been created in the present recovery since 1992 that \nwould have been created in other normal recoveries since World War II.\n  Our beloved, but imperfect, Constitution has allowed us to endanger \nthe American dream because we have not yet added the written philosophy \nthat our forefathers had in their hearts and practiced in the Congress. \nThey did not put it into the Constitution because they did not think it \nwas necessary. Now, 209 years later, we find it absolutely necessary to \nprotect our way of life. We have an imperfect document except that the \nFramers gave us article V so that the people can change the \nConstitution when necessary.\n  The people are now asking us to vote to allow them the opportunity to \namend the Constitution. Amending the Constitution is a prescription for \nprotecting the American dream. So this vote that we have tomorrow is \nreferendum in giving our constituents, particularly the younger ones, \nthe right to preserve the American dream. In my view, that is an \nabsolute necessity. It is a very clear choice between responsible \nspending or losing the American dream and our way of life. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this amendment. \nI want to pay tribute also to Senator Hatch, Senator Craig, and Senator \nThurmond, who have been among the leaders on the Presiding Officer's \nside, and former Senator DeConcini on our side, as well as Senator \nHeflin and Senator Bryan.\n  The charge is made that we are talking pure politics. I would be \nnaive if I did not admit there is some politics in all of this. \nObviously, Bob Dole is a candidate for President, and he wants to \nstress this. I have to say, in fairness to Bob Dole, this is not a \nphony position on his part. This is a stand he has taken all along. I \nam supporting Bill Clinton for President, but I appreciate Bob Dole's \nstand on the balanced budget amendment.\n  To my Democratic friends, if you want to depoliticize it, pass it. To \nmy friends on the other side who are opposed to a minimum wage, you \nwant to depoliticize the minimum wage? Pass it. It will be eliminated \nfrom the election. And the same on the balanced budget amendment.\n  The Presiding Officer is from New Hampshire where in the woods and \nthe trails of New Hampshire, prior to the Revolution, there was talk \nabout ``taxation without representation.'' My latest grandchild is now \n2 months old. Nicholas Simon, 2 months old, does not know anything \nabout the taxation that has been imposed upon him. Talk about taxation \nwithout representation, that is what we are doing to future \ngenerations. Listen to the Democratic platform of one century ago, \n1896.\n\n       We are opposed to the issuing of interest-bearing bonds in \n     times of peace.\n\n  Incidentally, no other country in history in times of peace has moved \nfrom being a creditor nation to being a debtor nation. Not only have we \ndone that,\n\n[[Page S5838]]\n\nwe have moved from being the No. 1 creditor nation to being the No. 1 \ndebtor nation. It is like moving from Super Bowl champ to the very last \nplace.\n\n  We have a lot of Jefferson-Jackson dinner parties. I assume the \nPresiding Officer has never been invited to one of these. Andrew \nJackson said, ``I am one that does not believe a national debt is a \nblessing but rather a curse.'' Thomas Jefferson was not in the United \nStates when the Constitution was written. He was over in Paris, \nnegotiating for us. When he came back, he said, ``If I could add one \namendment to the Constitution, it would be to require a balanced \nbudget.''\n  It is very interesting, Laurence Tribe, a professor at Harvard who \nopposes the constitutional amendment, says this in testimony last year:\n\n       Despite the misgivings I expressed on this score a decade \n     ago, I no longer think that a balanced budget amendment is, \n     at a conceptual level, an ill-suited kind of provision to \n     include in the Constitution.\n\n  The Jeffersonian notion that today's populace should not be able to \nburden future generations with excessive debt does seem to be the kind \nof fundamental value that is worthy of enshrinement in the \nConstitution. In a sense, it represents a structural protection for our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  There is, as the Presiding Officer knows, a lot of cynicism toward \nGovernment, much more so than in Western Europe, where the taxes are \nmuch higher than they are in the United States. I believe a fundamental \nreason for that is that, with the exception of Israel, no modern \nindustrial State spends as high a percentage of its tax dollars on \ninterest and on defense as does the United States. The average citizen \ndoes not see much for that. They do not see much in the defense area. \nClearly, we have to spend money in defense. For interest, all we get \nout of the huge debt is higher interest rates. That is it.\n  Now, I have heard some of my colleagues say they cannot vote for this \nbecause of Social Security. My friends, that is a fig leaf. It would \nmake more sense to say, ``Your astrologer advised you not to vote for \nthis.''\n  The reality is, this provides more protection for Social Security \nthan Social Security will have without this. Those who say, ``Well, \nlet's make it 2002 excluding Social Security,'' not one offered an \namendment to the budget to do that when that was up. Yet, they suggest \nwe should enshrine it in the Constitution.\n  I, frankly, worked with Senator Hatch in trying to fashion something \nthat over a period of years--and worked with Senator Domenici--over a \nperiod of years would slide into that, because you cannot do it from \n2002 that quickly. That would harm the economy.\n  It is very interesting that the chief actuary for Social Security for \n21 years, Bob Myers, says it is essential for Social Security that we \ndo it. Now, why is that the case? As Adam Smith warned us in ``The \nWealth of Nations,'' a classic document, he said that the history of \nnations is that you keep piling up debt and then you eventually debase \nthe currency.\n  That is where we are headed--there is just no question about it--as \nyou look at those long-term projections. We are going to keep piling up \nthe debt, and then at some point the order will be made, ``Start the \nprinting presses rolling; we are going to print the money. We are going \nto debase the currency. We are going to do what the economists call \n`monetize the debt.' ''\n  I get a publication that has a very limited circulation, I am sure, \ncalled Grant's Interest Rate Observer. It comes out every week. Here is \nthe most recent. You will be interested in these figures: May 17, 1995, \nforeign bank holdings of treasuries, $444 billion. May 15, 1996, a year \nlater, $553 billion. It goes up and up and up. And Lester Thurow, the \ndistinguished economist, says the question is not ``if'' foreign \ngovernments and people in other countries are going to stop buying our \nbonds, the question is ``when.'' We have to face up to this.\n  I heard Senator Murkowski speak just a little bit ago in which he \nsaid 18 percent of our bonds are now held beyond our country. In fact, \nthe figure is larger than that because a lot of it is hidden. Many \ncountries prohibit their citizens from buying bonds from other \ncountries.\n  Just take the 18-percent figure. If you take the $344 billion that is \nthe gross interest expenditure that CBO now says it will be, take 18 \npercent of that--if my math is correct, I just calculated it here \nquickly--that is $62 billion that will be sent overseas for interest \nthis year.\n  Now, there are some who believe if you help the wealthy, it will \ntrickle down and help everybody. I do not happen to believe there is \nmuch validity to that. But there sure is not much validity to sending \nthat $62 billion to wealthy people in Great Britain or The Netherlands \nor Saudi Arabia or Japan. That is not going to trickle down to American \nworking men and women. That just does not make sense.\n  Mr. President, $62 billion abroad is four times what we are spending \non foreign aid. In other words, we are spending four times as much on \nforeign aid to the wealthy as we are on foreign aid for poor people. \nThat just does not make sense.\n\n  The head of the IMF has complained that the wealthy United States \ngoes into the financial markets and raises interest, and poor countries \nhave to pay that high interest. Prof. David Calleo of Johns Hopkins \nUniversity calls that action obscene.\n  Now, to the credit of Senator Domenici and Congressman Kasich and \npeople in this body who voted to say we will balance the budget in 7 \nyears, to your credit on that side, you led the way on this. I voted \nfor it in the Budget Committee, but you led the way.\n  Let me say, in all candor, we are not going to have a balanced budget \nin 7 years unless we have a constitutional amendment. We are putting \nall the tough decisions in the last years. That is true in the \nDemocratic proposal; it is true in the Republican proposal. Those of us \nin public life like to do popular things. We need the discipline of a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  We have great interstate highways today. President Eisenhower \nproposed issuing bonds to pay for it. A Senator by the name of Albert \nGore, Sr., said, ``Let's not have deficit financing. Let's increase the \ngas tax and pay for it on a pay-as-you-go basis.'' His amendment, \nfortunately, prevailed. We saved hundreds of billions of dollars. That \nis what we have to do, put Government on a pay-as-you-go basis.\n  I heard Senator Hollings earlier today, and I have great respect for \nhim, talking about the need for some changes in our tax structure. Let \nme tell you, fundamental changes are not going to happen without a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  I hear people complaining about Alan Greenspan and what the Federal \nReserve Board is doing. Our primary problems--and sometimes I differ \nwith Alan Greenspan--but our primary problems are fiscal, not monetary. \nThe $344 billion we will spend this year on interest is 11 times what \nwe will spend on education, 22 times as much as we spend on foreign \naid, and twice what we are spend on our poverty programs.\n  The Concord Coalition--cochaired by former Senator Warren Rudman from \nthe State of the Presiding Officer, cochaired by Paul Tsongas, which \nalso has Paul Volcker on its board--did an economic analysis. The \ndeficit, in the last 20 years, is costing the average American family \n$15,500 a year in income. I do not know of any families in Illinois or \nNew Hampshire or Oklahoma who would not welcome that kind of an \nincrease. But it takes some discipline to move us in the right \ndirection. We have shown that we do not have it on our own. We need the \ndiscipline of a constitutional amendment.\n  We need to have, real candidly, political cover. We ought to do it on \nour own, but we are not doing it. We need to go back to whatever State \nwe are from and say that we really hated to cut this program, we really \nhated to increase these taxes, but the constitutional amendment forced \nus to do it.\n  If there is anyone in this body who is not certain how to vote--and \nthere probably is not--I suggest that they look at their children, look \nat their grandchildren. Forget who you might offend in this body and \nwhat they think. Look at those children and grandchildren and simply \nask: How do we build a better future for them? If you ask that \nquestion, then the vote will be in favor of a constitutional amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5839]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, if I thought, 10 years ago, I would be \nmaking this statement, I would say someone is out of his mind. But I \nhave to say now that it comes from the heart when I say this. There is \nno loss in the history of the institution of the U.S. Senate as great \nas the loss that will be incurred when Senator Simon submits his \nretirement and is no longer in this body. I say that in a very sincere \nway because Senator Simon and I have a few things in common, but \ncertainly political philosophy is not one of them. He is a liberal. I \nam a conservative. But he is very honest about his liberalism, and he \nis one who puts his priorities first. His statement about his children \nand grandchildren is very touching indeed.\n  Mr. President, I think that the vote we are going to be casting \ntomorrow will be the second most significant vote, perhaps in the last \ndecade, but certainly in this session of the legislature. The first \nmost significant vote happened yesterday when we made a decision in \nthis country not to defend ourselves from nuclear missile attack. It is \nsomething I think we made a grave mistake on, because many of the other \nthings are not significant now when you think about the threat that is \nout there.\n  What we are going to do tomorrow is certainly significant. I decided \nthat a way to approach this would be to take, verbatim, the arguments \nthat have been made in opposition to a budget balancing amendment to \nthe Constitution and address each one of them.\n  There are ten arguments. I will read these:\n  Proponents have refused to lay out a detailed plan to get a balanced \nbudget.\n  How can you tell if it would be good for the country if you do not \nknow the details? Senator Simon talked about a figleaf. This is a \nfigleaf. I can remember when we lost this earlier--I guess last year--\nby one vote, and they tried to kill it in a way that they would not \nhave to vote against it by putting an amendment on called the ``right-\nto-know amendment,'' which would outline everything that we are going \nto appropriate, everything that we are going to fund, every tax we are \ngoing to increase or decrease, for the next 7 years. Obviously, you \ncannot do that.\n  In a minute, I will show you the political philosophy of those \nindividuals who voted for the right-to-know amendment, because those \nindividuals, each one of them, voted against the final bill, and there \nis a common thread there that we need to look at.\n  I can tell you what we do know, which is that the status quo is bad--\nbad for the country. Business as usual cannot continue. We are to the \npoint where we have to make a change. We did not have that luxury last \nyear, or 10 years ago, even though we are working on this as a problem. \nI will say this. Those individuals who are going to vote against our \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution tomorrow are liberals, \nbut they do not go home and campaign that way. They are not politically \nhonest with the people back home on their philosophy. How many times \nhave you heard someone on the stump stand up and say, ``Vote for me and \nI will increase your taxes, I will increase spending, and I will \nincrease the deficit''? You do not hear it. Yet, that is exactly what \nhappens.\n  You cannot give a detailed plan as to how it is going to happen. Back \nin May 1961, President Kennedy decided that it was in our Nation's \ninterest to have a man on the Moon in 10 years. He did not say what was \ngoing to happen, or how. He did not map out the details. We could not \ndo it yet because the rockets were not built, the spacecraft was not \ndesigned, and the astronauts were not trained. Nobody said how we were \ngoing to do it. But we committed ourselves to it, and we did it.\n  Here is another one, argument No. 2: Proponents want to treat people \nlike children, hiding the hard truth from them.\n  I can tell you that is not the case. My wife and I have been married \nfor 37 years. We are into grandchildren now. One time, our No. 2 son \nwas out learning to ride a bicycle. He was a very young child. I went \nout there and pushed him, and he got balanced. Finally, he was able to \ngo all the way around the block. When he came back, he said, ``You \nknow, Dad, I wish the whole world was downhill.''\n  The whole world is not downhill. What we are embarking upon, if we \nare successful in doing it, is not going to be easy. It is something \nthat we have to do. We do not have a choice. We are out of time. We all \nknow that the world is not downhill. We have to pedal uphill. It will \ntake sacrifice. But for our children's sake and future generations, we \nhave to do it.\n  Third is that proponents say they are tired of Washington telling \npeople what to do--the Washington-knows-best mentality--and that the \nbalanced budget amendment is the ultimate Washington mandate.\n  My response to that is, no, they have it backward. Those who oppose \nthe balanced budget amendment to the Constitution are the guys who have \nbeen running this show for the last 40 years, who have created this $5 \ntrillion debt. They are arrogant in saying that we know what is better. \nYes; future generations are going to have to pay for this. But that \nWashington-knows-best attitude is what got us where we are today, that \ncontinuing business as usual for all these years. They say that despite \nthe fact that 70 to 80 percent of the people in America support a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Why? Because they know \nthat without that fiscal discipline forcing them to do it, we are not \ngoing to do it.\n\n  I think the public spoke loudly and clearly in the elections of 1994. \nIt was, in fact, a Republican year, and in a minute I will document \nthis and show this to you. A lot of people that are going to be voting \nagainst this will not be around much longer. In a way, the balanced \nbudget amendment is a mandate for fiscal responsibility on Congress, \nand it will not mandate unwanted regulation on the States or the \npeople.\n  Argument No. 4: All these Governors who are boasting about cutting \ntaxes in their States should know that the balanced budget amendment \nwill require them to impose huge State tax increases.\n  Well, that simply is not true. I think the Governors know it. The \nGovernors are supporting this. In fact, let us keep in mind that if we \nare successful in passing this at noon tomorrow, three-fourths of the \nStates are going to have to ratify this. It is not something we can do \nunilaterally. I agree with the statements made about the sanctity of \nthe Constitution. That is why the Founding Fathers made it so \ndifficult. The States will have to make the decision, and if they think \nit will increase taxes, they are not going to support it. They know it \nwill not do that. These States that have been cutting tax rates are \nactually enjoying increasing revenue. History has shown that is the \ncase. You can increase revenue by cutting tax rates. President Kennedy \nonce said, ``We have to have more revenue, and we are going to cut \ntaxes,'' and it worked. Look what happened in the United States of \nAmerica. In 1980, our total revenues were $517 billion. In 1990, 10 \nyears later, it was over $1 trillion. It doubled in that period of \ntime. That was a period of time when the tax rates took the largest \ncuts we have had in any 10-year period in history, from the marginal \nrates. In 1980, it was $244 billion that was derived from income taxes. \nIn 1990, it was $466 billion. That was after tax reductions.\n  But this mentality we have in the White House and the administration \ndoes not agree with that. They do not look at history. They are too \nsmart for that. Laura Tyson, the chief economic adviser to the \nPresident of the United States, was quoted in the Wall Street Journal \non December 30, 1992.\n  She said:\n\n       In direct contradiction to the 12 years of Republican \n     ideology, there is no relationship between the level of taxes \n     the Nation pays and its economic performance.\n\n  Of course, if you believe that, they just keep raising taxes. We know \nbetter. The people of America know better. The balanced budget \namendment will require a rate of increase in Federal spending to be \nslowed down. The States will rejoice when they can do this, and three-\nfourths of the States have already said it shall be no problem at all \nin ratifying this.\n  Three-fourths of the States have a balanced budget amendment to their \nState constitution. In 1941, my State of Oklahoma had a balanced budget \namendment. These same arguments\n\n[[Page S5840]]\n\nthey are using today were the arguments they were using back then, and \nit has worked since 1941, and it has worked in the rest of States.\n  Argument No. 5: The balanced budget amendment is a pig in a giant \npoke.\n  I do not know what this means. I do not know that anyone else does. \nBut I would say this: That the real pig in the poke was pointed out to \nme by someone who called me up. I was called up after that statement \nwas made by a young lady, a beautiful young lady professor at the \nUniversity of Arkansas, the home State of our President. She called up \nand had seen that apparently on C-SPAN. Of course, in Arkansas they \nknow something about pigs. They have the Arkansas Razorbacks, and they \nuse the pigs and the hogs and the hogs and the Razorbacks kind of \ninterchangeably. This young lady was Dr. Molly Rapier on the staff at \nthe University of Arkansas. She said the pig in the poke is in \nWashington--not outside of Washington. It is those individuals who are \nspending more and more and more and getting to the trough first.\n  The sixth argument that has been used: The balanced budget amendment \nwill give the politicians license to cut and slash and burn needed \nprograms.\n  This is the big argument they use to make it appear as if we are \ngoing to be slashing Government programs, and then they zero in on \neither the elderly or veterans or somebody else to make them think that \nwe are going to be cutting programs.\n  The Heritage Foundation came out with a study. This was conducted by \neconomists and Ph.D.'s from all over the country from major \ninstitutions. They came up with the conclusion--this is a couple of \nyears ago--that we could actually reduce and eliminate the deficit in a \nmuch shorter period of time merely by putting growth caps on. I called \nto get an update from them today. They said if we had growth caps on \nall Government spending of 1.5 percent we would balance the budget in 7 \nyears including the major tax cuts that the Republicans are asking for \nto stimulate the economy. These are the economists that are saying \nthis.\n  So we know that this argument is being used, and it is another \nfigleaf, as has been so articulated and presented by the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Illinois, Senator Simon. I think that it would do \none thing, and that it would cause a counterpressure.\n  A study was made not too long ago about all the people who come to \nsee Members of Congress in the House and the Senate. Over 98 percent of \nthem are in there to get more money for some cause. Some are lobbyists, \nsome are citizens, and some are employees that are in for more money \nfor their causes. So there is nobody out there speaking for that 80 \npercent of the people who want to reduce the size of the cost of \nGovernment. This would do this.\n\n  I remember one of the best speeches I ever heard was way back in the \n1960's when a great communicator, Ronald Reagan, gave a speech, his \nfirst political speech, called ``Rendezvous With Destiny.'' He said, \n``There is nothing closer to immortality on the face of this Earth than \na Government agency once formed.'' I think we have learned it is true. \nIt is very difficult with the political pressures to cut the size of \nGovernment.\n  The seventh argument is:\n\n       Senators are sent here to make intelligent and well-\n     informed decisions on the people's behalf.\n\n  I have heard this so many times from liberals--saying, ``We do not \nneed that because that is our job. We are elected to balance a \nbudget.'' We have not done it. We have proven that we are incapable of \ndoing it for 40 years. So we have been forced to do it.\n  That is exactly what this would be. This is not anything that is a \nnew idea. Thomas Jefferson said when he came back from France during \nthe development of our Constitution that it could have been improved by \nhaving something in there to stop the Americans from going into debt.\n  I can remember a guy named Carl Curtis from Nebraska back in 1974, \nMr. President. I was in the State Senate of Oklahoma at that time. He \nhad an idea. He was a great conservative from Nebraska. He said, ``I \nknow how we can balance the budget.'' He said, ``We can get three-\nfourths of the States to preratify, and then we could use this an as \nargument saying this is a mandate from the States.'' So I introduced a \nresolution in the State senate in 1974, and it passed to preratify the \nConstitution. It is something that has been around for a long time. It \nis something that we have an opportunity to achieve tomorrow.\n  In response to the opinion polls, a statement was made not long ago \non this floor by one of the Senators who is opposed to a balanced \nbudget. He said, ``The proponents talk about public opinion.'' Years \nago Talleyrand said, ``There is more wisdom in public opinion than \nthere is to be found in Napoleon, Voltaire and all the ministers of \nstate present or to come.''\n  But this is true only to the extent that public opinion is informed \nopinion. In the case of a balanced budget amendment it is not informed \nopinion. I have to tell that very distinguished Senator in all respects \nthat he is definitely wrong.\n  I would submit that the people of America know that we cannot \ncontinue on the road that we are on. I would submit that Talleyrand was \nexactly right when he said, ``There is more wisdom in public opinion \npolls than there is. . .''--and to bring it to up today's vernacular, \n``. . . to be found in the President, the President pro tempore, and \nall the ministers of the Clinton administration and the liberal \nDemocrats who are lobbying against the balanced budget amendment.''\n  Let us keep in mind Talleyrand, who was there during the Napoleon \nreign, also had another quote which was ``Throw mud, throw mud. Some of \nit may stick.'' That is exactly what has been happening during this \ndebate.\n  The ninth argument was:\n\n       The 1990 and 1993 budget deals worked. The way to deal with \n     the deficit is to continue the successful deficit reduction \n     effort for the last 5 years. Since 1990, we have achieved \n     over $900 billion in deficit reduction.\n  I do not know. There was an article in the Reader's Digest not long \nago called ``Budget Baloney.'' They talk about how we are saying things \nhere to make people think we are doing something constructive by \neliminating the deficit. The debt has grown and grown during this \nadministration.\n  I will have to say this. I do not want to sound like I am blatantly \npartisan. In 1990, when George Bush was President of the United States, \nhe caved in to the liberal Democrats that were controlling Congress at \nthat time, and he agreed to a tax increase. It was the wrong thing to \ndo. I voted against it. I spoke against it when I was serving in the \nother body with the distinguished Presiding Officer. I can remember \nbeing on ``Nightline'' as one of the few people to stand up against his \nown President because it was wrong. In 1993 when President Clinton had \ncontrol of both the House and the Senate it was ``the largest single \ntax increase in the history of public finance in America or anyplace in \nthe world.'' Those are not the words of conservative Republican Jim \nInhofe. Those are the words of Patrick Moynihan who was the chairman of \nthe Senate Finance Committee at that time. But in both cases the \nresults belie the claims of success.\n  If these two huge, painful budget deals were successful in reducing \nthe deficit, then Heaven help us. Just look at the figures. This is the \nPresident's own budget book. Under his plan, by 1998 our debt will \nincrease by $1.1 trillion. These are the President's figures. By the \nyear 2000, $1.1 trillion. That is something that we cannot afford.\n  The last one that I want to mention is to quote the argument:\n\n       The balanced budget amendment is nothing more than a \n     slogan, an empty promise. Most Senators who support it will \n     not even be here in the year 2000 when it will take effect.\n\n  You know the problem is that the Members of Congress who are \nresponsible for creating this burdensome national debt will not be here \nwhen our children have to pay for it. It has been said several times on \nthis floor. The Congressional Budget Office figures support the fact \nthat a person born today, unless we change it, will have to spend 82 \npercent of his lifetime income just to support the Government's \nextravagance that we are guilty of today.\n  So let me just mention that talk is cheap. There are those who oppose \nit. Those individuals who oppose the balanced budget amendment, they \nare the ones--the same ones as I suggested earlier in my talk. I \nsuggested that those individuals who voted against a balanced budget \namendment the last time\n\n[[Page S5841]]\n\nand are planning to vote it against it this time, even though they will \nnot go home and tell the people they are going to do this, are the \nliberals.\n  How do you know if they are liberals or conservatives? You do it by \nlooking at how they are rated. You do not want to stand up and call \npeople names. There are ratings organizations out there. The National \nTaxpayers Union rates as to how we vote. If we are big spenders they \nsay we are. Of those 33 individuals who voted against the balanced \nbudget amendment when it was up last time, all 33 voted for the largest \ntax increase and the largest spending increase in the history of public \nfinance. All 33 of them got either a ``D'' or an ``F'' by the National \nTaxpayers Union. That is incontrovertible. They are liberals. They will \nnot say that at home. But they are. And I suggest there is something \nelse that is incontrovertible; that is what has happened in the past. \nThose individuals who were voting for the large spending increases and \nthe tax hike and who received a ``D'' or an ``F'' are the individuals \nwho either were defeated or who retired in the 1994 election.\n  So I think it is something we need to look at, and I am hoping that \nthose individuals--as the distinguished Senator from Iowa [Mr. \nGrassley] said, a lot of the Senators who are voting for this because \nthey want to go the party line instead of voting with the people at \nhome better really stop and think about it before noon tomorrow because \nthe people at home are not going to forget.\n  I can suggest to you that we have had several people who are going to \nbe voting against it who have actually made these statements at home. \nThe Senator from North Dakota, [Mr. Dorgan], said in the Congressional \nRecord March 1, 1994: ``This constitutional amendment, no matter what \none thinks of it, will add the pressure that we reconcile what we spend \nwith what we raise.'' And he will most likely vote against it. If not, \nthe resolution will pass.\n  Senator Hollings said, ``I can offer my colleagues 3.5 trillion \nreasons for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. It ought \nto be a minimal moral obligation of our National Government. So let us \ndebate, pass and ratify the balanced budget amendment. By writing a \nbalanced budget amendment into the basic law of the land, we will \ncompel Washington to do its job.'' That is Senator Ernest Hollings, \nMarch 1, 1994.\n  Then we had our very, very distinguished minority leader, Senator Tom \nDaschle, from South Dakota, who said on February 28, 1994: ``Too much \nis at stake for us to settle for the status quo. A balanced budget \namendment will provide the fiscal discipline our Nation must have in \norder to meet the needs of the present generation without bankrupting \nthose in the future.''\n  I only say that not to embarrass my colleagues because they are all \nvery distinguished, but they certainly had a change of heart between \nthe time they were making these statements and what will happen \ntomorrow. I am hoping that two out of three of these individuals who \nmade the statement will turn around and remember what they said in 1994 \nand will vote for it, and we will pass a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, Senator Simon talked about his grandson, \nNicholas Simon, and I think that is really what it is all about. Kay \nand I have a bunch of kids, and our No. 3 child, Molly, just last \nJanuary 9 called me up and said, ``You know, Daddy, I'm about a month \noverdue, and they are going to force labor today. Would you come \nover.'' And I was right over there. She said to me, she said, ``Daddy, \nwould you like to come in the delivery room when we deliver Baby \nJase.'' Nowadays they peek. They know what it is. Back when we were \nhaving kids, they would not let you in the hospital, let alone the \ndelivery room. And so I said, ``Yes, I want to do it.''\n  I went in there and stood behind the bed, and we made it through this \nprocess. It made me appreciate my wife a lot more than I did before. \nAnd finally Baby Jase was born, Baby Jase right here was born. This is \non January 9. And he had taken his first breath. He was not even a \nminute old when she handed him to me. She said, ``Daddy, would you like \nto hold Baby Jase?'' I held Baby Jase, and I looked at him, and the \nthing that came to my mind at that time was, as we were speaking at \nthat very moment, Baby Jase was inheriting $19,000 as his share of the \nnational debt; that if we do not do something to change it like we are \nproposing today, if we do not pass this balanced budget amendment, then \nBaby Jase is going to have to spend 82 to 84 percent of his earnings \npaying it.\n  What do you think he did to deserve that? He did not do anything. \nThat is why I say, Madam President, this is not a fiscal issue that we \nare considering. It is probably the most serious moral issue we have \ndealt with since I have been in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, Webster's dictionary defines the term \n``red herring'' as ``something that distracts attention from the real \nissue. [From the practice of dragging a red herring across a trail to \nconfuse hunting dogs].''\n  The reason I share this definition with you tonight is because most \nof the arguments we have heard in objection to the balanced budget \namendment amount to little more than red herrings. The objections, I \nbelieve, are simply distractions from the real issue before us.\n  The real issue before us is that Federal spending is out of control, \nmake no mistake about it, and unless we pass a constitutional amendment \nto control spending, our children and grandchildren will never know the \nAmerica we take for granted.\n  The United States has a current national debt of more than $5 \ntrillion, and based on projections under President Clinton's latest \nbudget it will be more than $6.7 trillion by the year 2000. I have said \nit before and I believe I will say it again tonight, Madam President: \nDebtors are never free; they are only subject to the dominion of their \ncreditors. That is the real issue here.\n  Throughout the debate on this issue, we have heard no less than five \nred herrings repeated time and again. I ask you to listen carefully as \nI go through them one by one and explain why they are just distractions \nfrom the real issue.\n  Red herring No. 1 I will share with you. Red herring No. 1: ``The \nbalanced budget amendment would raid Social Security and put the burden \nof balancing the budget on the elderly.''\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. The fact is that there is no \nSocial Security trust fund--no Social Security trust fund. The surplus \nof which many speak is actually a form of IOU. The purpose of the \nbalanced budget amendment is to ensure the solvency of the United \nStates so we can protect the living standards of Americans and pay our \ncreditors. I believe if you truly care about the elderly and clearly \nunderstand the issue at hand, I see no other option than to support the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Proponents of a balanced budget amendment know that protecting our \nNation's economic solvency will do far more to protect the standard of \nliving of every American than to rely on blatant political halfhearted \nremedies that, in the end, do more harm than good.\n  Red herring No. 2 I will share with you. Red herring No. 2 is that \n``the balanced budget amendment is not enforceable. The amendment would \ncurtail the authority of and respect for the U.S. Constitution.''\n  Again, there is no truth in that. The amendment speaks for itself. \nSection 2 of the amendment requires a three-fifths vote to increase the \ndebt ceiling. If you consider that insignificant, I ask you, why do we \nvote every year to increase the debt limit? Why does the President \nsubmit his budget by the first Monday in February every year? Neither \nof these procedures are identified in our Constitution. Indeed, these \nbudget procedures are based on statute.\n  As U.S. Senators, we are obligated to abide by the law. To suggest \nthat Members will arbitrarily disregard the Constitution at best \nundermines the role Congress plays in our participatory democracy.\n  Red herring No. 3 I will share with you. What is it? They say, ``The \nbalanced budget amendment will have dire consequences on the elderly \nand the children.'' Nothing could be farther from the truth. Again, on \nthe one hand,\n\n[[Page S5842]]\n\nthe opponents of the constitutional amendment to balance the budget \nwill say that the balanced budget amendment will lead to draconian cuts \nin very critical programs. According to them, every old person, young \nperson, and poor person will be hurt by balancing the Federal budget. \nBut, red herring No. 2 claims that the balanced budget amendment is not \nenforceable. No amendment will be able to force the President and \nCongress to balance the budget. Who is going to sue them, they ask?\n\n  Which is it? Are we going to experience draconian cuts or are we not? \nThe arguments against the balanced budget amendment contradict each \nother, they say. Since the logic is inconsistent, opponents will try to \npaint a dreadful picture to the American people, hoping this will \nelevate opposition to the balanced budget amendment.\n  I have a frightening picture I would like to share with the American \npeople. Imagine a day 30 years in the future as your children are \nplanning to retire. They have worked all their lives, spent frugally, \nand saved religiously. Yet the Federal Government has continued to run \nmassive budget deficits, piling up an unconscionable amount of debt. \nOne day your children wake up and find that the rest of the world no \nlonger believes that the United States is able to meet its financial \nobligation. Thus, the value of the dollar crashes in financial markets. \nThe Federal Reserve cannot stop the falling dollar. And, in response, \nthe Treasury prints money. Suddenly--yes, suddenly--your children's \nassets are worth half of what they were a day before. Inflation is \nrampant and we are reduced to a Third World country. Everything your \nchildren have worked for has been taken from them because some Members \nof this body did not think that addressing the debt was important.\n  We know it is important. In order to pass the America we know on to \nour children, we must restrain ourselves from passing our bills on to \nour children and to our grandchildren.\n  Red herring No. 4. You have heard this. The opponents say, ``The \nbalanced budget amendment is just some popular idea we are voting for, \nbrought about by the Contract With America. We need time to think about \na balanced budget amendment.''\n  Do we? The fact of the matter is that the balanced budget amendment \nis not a new idea at all. It has been debated right here in the U.S. \nSenate. One of Thomas Jefferson's well known sayings is, ``If I could \nadd one amendment to the Constitution, it would be to prohibit the \nFederal Government from borrowing funds * * * We should consider \nourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts and morally \nbound to pay them ourselves.''\n  In 1936, Congressman Harold Knutson of Minnesota proposed the first \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. Since then, a number of \nbalanced budget amendments have been proposed. We have held hearings as \nfar back as 1979, and even voted on the amendment. Indeed, the issue \nhas come up several times since then. Several of the Senators opposing \nthe balanced budget amendment today have been around for many of those \ndebates. The balanced budget amendment is not a new idea. We know the \nissue all too well. We are not rushing to judgment.\n  Red herring No. 5, that I will share with you. The opponents say--we \ndo not believe it, but they say: ``Federal accounting does not allow \nfor capital budgeting. Federal accounting would throw chills down the \nspine of any business executive.''\n  Trying to confront the arguments against the balanced budget \namendment is like following a bouncing ball. When they are defending \nSocial Security, the books are fine, they are in surplus. However, when \nwe discuss the tremendous deficits and debt of the United States, the \nFederal accounting is somehow inept. Once again, there is an \ninconsistency in the opponents' reasoning. If you maintain the argument \nthat Federal accounting is flawed, then one must take another look at \nthe books of the Social Security trust fund. The bottom line is there \nis no fund, there is no surplus. According to accounting rules used by \nbusiness executives, liability exceeds assets. By definition, that is \nnot a surplus.\n  In addition, I hear analogies being made between the Federal budget \nand the homeowners who enter into substantial debt when they purchase a \nhouse. The difference is that homeowners do not buy a house this year, \nnext year, and the year after that. A homeowner pays down the principal \neach month, each year. The Federal Government, on the other hand, never \ngets to this point because it has to borrow just to pay the interest. \nIt is a perpetual problem that all of us are familiar with, that feeds \nitself.\n  The balanced budget amendment opponents have used every red herring \nimaginable, hoping just one of them will distract for a moment the \nAmerican people from the issue at hand. But the fact is, Madam \nPresident, the trail of debt now tops $5 trillion, as I said earlier. \nThe red herrings of a balanced budget amendment will not convince \nanyone on Wall Street or Main Street. The hunting dogs were not \nconfused. The time has come for a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States of America if we are going to save \nanything for our children and our grandchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I note a little over a year ago this \nbody rejected this proposed amendment. A great deal has happened since \nthen, but none of the fundamental flaws of the joint resolution have \nbeen corrected. It still raises serious problems related to the role of \nthe courts and the power it might confer on unelected judges to set our \nnational budget policy. It remains a serious and real threat to Social \nSecurity. It continues to risk expansion of Presidential impoundment \nauthority.\n  Madam President, all of these faults are still there, they still \nremain. But there have been significant events in the last year that do \nbear on the proposed constitutional amendment, and they go to the very \nheart of the arguments put forward by the proponents of the \nconstitutional amendment.\n  The central reason offered by the proponents of the amendment is that \nwithout this constitutional mandate we will not balance the budget. \nThat argument was appealing but ultimately unpersuasive a year ago. It \nremains unpersuasive today.\n  Prior to the vote in 1995, President Clinton and the 103d Congress \nhad just finished cutting the deficit in half--the first time for 3 \nyears in a row that the deficit had gone down, and not just by a little \nbit, but by half. The effects of the deficit reduction package we \nenacted brought the deficit down from what would have been nearly $300 \nbillion in this fiscal year to what is now projected to be $145 \nbillion, or even, based on the very most recent estimates, $130 or $120 \nbillion. In far less than just one Presidential term, what would have \nbeen a $300 billion deficit is now something in the range of only $125 \nor $130 billion. It is a tremendous achievement in the right direction, \none which I bet almost no one would have predicted could have happened \nin this short a time.\n\n  We were clearly on the road to balancing our Federal budget. Since \nthat time we have seen a number of different balanced budget proposals \noffered by Republicans, and then others offered by Democrats, and still \nothers offered by bipartisan coalitions. Of course, the President has \nbecome the first President in many decades to submit a budget that is \nactually balanced. All of those plans were drafted without the presence \nof a constitutional mandate. In fact, I firmly believe those plans \nwould not have been proposed and would not have been forthcoming but \nfor the failure of either party to find political cover in the adoption \nof a constitutional amendment. Without the ability to hide behind a \nlengthy, multiyear ratification process, this Congress had no excuse. \nThe Congress, in effect, by not having a balanced budget amendment \nbeing considered by the States for several years, is really being \nforced every day to try to live up to all the rhetoric that has spilled \non this floor in the name of balancing the budget.\n  I proposed a specific plan to balance the budget in 5 years when I \nwas running in 1992, and I am especially pleased to be able to say that \nseveral dozen of the provisions of that plan have already been enacted \ninto law in some form or another. They are part of the progress that we \nhave made in reducing the deficit by more than half\n\n[[Page S5843]]\n\nsince 1992. I will continue to push individual provisions from that \nbalanced budget plan, as well as add other ideas to it.\n  Madam President, I believe a majority of both Houses strongly \nsupports a balanced budget and is willing, even today, to set aside \npartisan differences to accomplish this most important of our economic \ngoals. But that is not what this proposed constitutional amendment is \nall about. What the proposed constitutional amendment is about, or at \nleast the idea of having this vote at this time, tomorrow, is all \nabout, is politics.\n  Does anyone doubt that the outcome of this vote will be any different \nthan the vote taken last year? Nobody has said that on either side. \nThen why have we returned to this issue right now? The answer is clear. \nThis vote is being taken for purely political purposes. The drive for \nthe constitutional amendment in my view has largely been political from \nthe beginning.\n  We should not be shocked by that. Congress, by its nature, is a \npolitical institution. That is understood and to be expected in such an \ninstitution.\n  What is disturbing, though, Madam President, is the willingness of \nsome to risk our Constitution in this manner to gain temporary \npolitical advantage. The so-called balanced budget amendment is only \none of many constitutional proposed changes. Too many of them, I think, \nare again for largely political ends. I think each of them is \nunnecessary; some of them are grossly irresponsible.\n  As I noted earlier, the call for this constitutional amendment \ncertainly cannot stem from the lack of discussion and effort and \nconsideration of the issue of balancing the budget. There are a \nsufficient number of plans to do that now, and though the plans do have \nsome significant differences, I think there is a broad middle ground on \nwhich a consensus plan that achieved balance could be enacted.\n  No, Madam President, for a majority of the supporters of this \nproposal, the constitutional amendment is more of a political device, \npure and simple. It is one of a series of political statements that is \nrepeated over and over that those folks hope will gain them the \nadvantage with the voters. How else can one explain the almost \nincredible contradiction of voting for a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget and saying that is your top priority and then at the \nsame time insisting on the fiscally irresponsible deficit increasing \ntax cuts?\n  As I have noted previously on the floor, we are in the middle of a \nstampede of proposals for tax cuts: Gasoline tax cuts, adoption tax \ncredits, a whole slew of new business tax cuts, apparently tacked on to \nthe minimum wage bill in the other body, and, of course, a $122 billion \ntax cut in the current budget resolution which was passed by this body \njust prior to our recess.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee in the other body was purported \nto have suggested the tax cuts provided for in the tax resolution might \neven total $180 billion. Let me note that not everyone who supports \nthis proposed constitutional amendment has advocated these tax cuts, in \nfairness. Some of its advocates supported efforts to strip the $122 \nbillion tax cut from the budget resolution and instead dedicate the \nsavings toward deficit reduction. But, unfortunately, Madam President, \nthose people who both supported the balanced budget amendment and were \nwilling to forego the tax cuts--a consistent position--were just too \nfew in number.\n  The overwhelming majority of those who support this amendment to our \nConstitution have consistently supported tax cuts over deficit \nreduction when it came to a vote last month. And I have said it many \ntimes on this floor, and I will say it again: What is wrong with that? \nWhat is wrong is that you cannot spend a dollar twice. You cannot spend \nit on deficit reduction and spend it on tax cuts. You can only spend it \nonce, but the folks who say they want the balanced budget amendment and \nwant tax cuts want you to think you can spend it twice, and you cannot.\n  The overwhelming majority of those who support this amendment to our \nConstitution also supported the absurd parliamentary ruling that \nendorsed the special reconciliation rule for a measure that is intended \nnot to reduce the deficit--not to reduce the deficit--even though that \nis what supposedly the budget resolution is about, but to increase it \nby having more tax cuts when we cannot afford them.\n\n  Madam President, I will make the following not very bold prediction: \nBefore the summer is out, an overwhelming majority of those who support \nthis amendment to the Constitution will be leading the rally behind a \nmassive tax cut plan that will be even larger than those we have seen \ntoday. The tax cut frenzy is only beginning to gather steam. There is \nonly one plausible explanation for that inconsistency, and, gee, it \nlooks a little bit like political expedience.\n  For the sake of avoiding a politically difficult stand, the \noverwhelming majority of those who support this joint resolution will \naccede to only what can be called, in my view, a reckless tax cut plan \nthat severely undermines the very goal they maintain requires this new \nconstitutional protection. Of course, there will be economic gymnastics \nto accompany a tax proposal, and we will all be told that plus is \nminus, that up is down by the same crowd that helped us get into this \nfiscal mess in the first place with trickle-down economics. And I \nsuspect that because they desire a political victory here, some will \nactually come to believe their own rationale, despite the clear \nevidence that it did not work before.\n  A little over a year after failing to get sufficient support for the \nproposed constitutional amendment, the supporters of the joint \nresolution will, once again, get what they desire, and that is a vote, \na vote they can use for political ends, promoting themselves or \nattacking others. The age of the 30-second television commercial and \nthe 2-minute news story really does reward this kind of gesture. We all \nknow it.\n  If you say you are for a balanced budget amendment, a lot of people \nthink you are saying you have come up with a plan to actually balance \nthe budget, even though the two things have very little to do with each \nother. It has spawned dozens of constitutional amendments, and it will \nproduce more. We may live in a political world in which it is \nuncomfortable to do the right thing, but, Madam President, I do not \nthink we were elected to be comfortable.\n  Our Nation's Founders wisely incorporated the two-thirds threshold to \nprotect against just this kind of politically motivated abuse of our \nConstitution. I earnestly hope that one-third plus one in this body \nwill tomorrow and in the future continue to have the political will \nnecessary to stand up for that great document and give the American \npeople the kind of Government they truly do deserve: a Government that \nis focused not on short-term political expedience but on the long-term \nsolutions to our problems and, in particular, the true effort to do \nwhat we can and should do here without sending this to the States, and \nthat is a topic and priority of our country to balance the budget \nwithin the next very few years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Thank you, Madam President. A famous President not too \nlong ago, Ronald Reagan, said, ``Here we go again.'' Here we go again, \nback with the same debate we heard last year in November, that somehow \nwe do not need a balanced budget amendment, because all we have to do \nis balance the budget, show the political will, get the job done, make \nthe tough decisions. That is what we hear over and over and over and \nover.\n  As has been said all day in this debate, the truth of the matter is, \nin spite of the rhetoric, the political will is not here, and it has \nnot been here, which is why we must have the amendment.\n  I have just been fascinated, since I had the opportunity to be around \nthe floor for the last couple of hours, both as a presider and just \nlistening, to hear some of this rhetoric regarding the balanced budget \namendment, the number of excuses as to why we do not need the \namendment. It is incredible. There is one right after the other: We do \nnot need it; it is unnecessary; we can balance the budget, make the \ntough decisions; just need the political will.\n  Yet, when it came down to doing it, we put a balanced budget on the \ndesk\n\n[[Page S5844]]\n\nof the President of the United States and he vetoed it. We have not \nbeen able to get a balanced budget passed. So we need the amendment. It \nis as simple as that.\n  When the balanced budget amendment was before the Senate in 1995, we \nwere told then that an amendment to the Constitution was not necessary, \nas we had been told many times before, if Congress did its work. \nCongress is not doing its work, and, therefore, we need the amendment.\n  It is interesting as to just what this amendment does. I think the \nAmerican people should understand, and it has been said on the floor \nbefore, but we are simply asking people to vote tomorrow to let the \nStates and the people decide whether they want to amend the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  No amendment passes here tomorrow. We do not have an amendment if the \nSenate gets 67 votes. That does not happen. What happens when we vote \nhere tomorrow is that this will then go to the States where three-\nquarters of the State legislatures would have to agree.\n  That is all we are asking to do. We are simply asking this Congress, \nwho at times appears to have this know-it-all attitude, to send this \nback to the States. Let the States decide whether they want to amend \nthe Constitution. If they say no, there is no amendment.\n  I campaigned for a balanced budget when I first ran for political \noffice in 1980. The national debt was nowhere near $5 trillion then. \nAnd 16 years later--16 years later--we are still debating the proposal, \ntrillions and trillions of dollars added to the debt since that time.\n  To hear the rhetoric in here, you would think it was not important, \nit did not matter, we do not need an amendment. Why would anyone like \nmyself and others devote more than a decade of time to fight for this \nbalanced budget amendment or to fight for a balanced budget, either \none? The answer is very simple.\n  I am going to take a different approach here. We have heard a lot of \nspeeches today. If some people have listened all day, they have \nprobably heard a lot of things repeated. I am going to take a different \napproach. This is going to come from the people, not from this Senate, \nnot from this Senator, not from some bureaucracy in Washington. I want \nto say what impact this amendment to the Constitution will have on the \npeople of this country, ordinary men and women, all over America. I \nwant everyone to know what balancing the budget will do to their lives, \nthe lives of every single American man and woman in a very real and \nvery tangible way.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, had a picture here of his \ngrandson on the floor moments ago. That child has an $18,000 debt \ntoday. There will be hundreds of children born here in America during \nmy remarks on the Senate floor today. Each one will be born $18,000-\nplus in debt. That is their share of the national debt. Is that fair? \nIs that fair to that child? Is that fair for us to do that?\n  I was listening very carefully to the Senator from Wisconsin a moment \nago. Is it really so unfair of us to ask that the people who are \nsuffering the brunt of this debt have the opportunity to say whether or \nnot they want an amendment? Is that so bad? I cannot understand why \nthose with this know-it-all attitude in Washington would take that \nposition.\n  Again, I repeat, no amendment becomes an amendment because we vote \nfor it with 67 or more votes tomorrow. All we are asking is that that \nlittle child who really cannot vote yet that the Senator from Oklahoma \nreferred to moments ago, through his family, have the right to say \nthrough their State legislature in Oklahoma and 49 other States whether \nor not they want to amend the Constitution because the politicians are \nnot getting the job done. That is all we are asking. It is very clear \nthat we understand that. That is all we are asking.\n  I just announced recently for reelection to the U.S. Senate, a great \nhonor. My seat in this Senate does not belong to me. It belongs to the \npeople of New Hampshire. Right over there on the floor--I am not using \nit at this moment--is Daniel Webster's desk. Daniel Webster's desk is \none of the few original desks in this Senate Chamber. I often speak \nfrom it. I often write on it, write letters to constituents on it. I \nthink about the fact that I am just a temporary steward at that desk, \njust a blip on the radar screen of eternity. That is all we are.\n\n  Sometimes we think that we are a big deal in here, we are in the U.S. \nSenate and we are very important people. But you know, in the scope of \nthings, we are really not all that important. In the radar screen of \nlife, of eternity, we are a blip, a very small blip at that.\n  Daniel Webster stood at that desk on the floor of the U.S. Senate in \nthe old Chamber and gave some of the greatest speeches of all time. \nWebster and Calhoun and Clay were some of the great orators. He stood \nat that desk. But, again, Daniel Webster was a blip on the radar screen \nof eternity.\n  So we have an obligation. We are only here a brief time. But think \nabout what we are doing to the children and the grandchildren and their \ngrandchildren. The distinguished Senator from Illinois, Senator Simon, \nwho spoke while I was in the chair, gave a very eloquent speech. He \nsaid in jest, the Senator from New Hampshire probably had never been \ninvited to a Jefferson dinner or a Jackson dinner because they were \nusually chaired by the Democrats, who obviously look at Jackson and \nJefferson as heroes. I look at Jackson and Jefferson as heroes. I am \nnot a Democrat, but I would not hesitate to go to a dinner honoring \nJackson or Jefferson.\n  But this party that leads the defeat of this amendment is not the \nparty of Jackson and Jefferson, I can assure you. Jackson and Jefferson \nwould be for the balanced budget amendment. Jefferson already, early in \nhis life, right after the Constitution was formed and written and the \nGovernment was formed, spoke out saying he felt it was a mistake that \nwe did not have an amendment to balance the budget.\n  So I am often asked what is it like, what I do like the most about \nbeing a U.S. Senator. Boy, I could say a lot of things. I have met \nPresidents. I have met foreign leaders. I walk around here with some of \nthe great Senators of our time. You can really get an ego about that if \nyou want to, but I do not. I really do not. You know, without \nhesitation, when I am asked that question --and I am asked it often--I \nsay every time, I like being a Senator because I enjoy helping people. \nThat is the truth.\n  We get a chance to help people get through this maze of bureaucracy, \nwhether it is an immigration case or perhaps some other matter where \nsomebody is having a tough time with the Federal Government, perhaps a \nveteran or whatever.\n  I think about what does that have to do with this debate on the \nbalanced budget? We can help people. We can help people by balancing \nthis budget more than a million cases that we might resolve in our \noffices, more than 10 million cases that we might resolve in our \noffices. We can help the American people, like little Jason, whose \npicture was on the floor here with Senator Inhofe a moment ago, and \nmillions of others, men, women and children, because the Joint Economic \nCommittee estimates that a balanced budget would create 4.25 million \njobs, new jobs in America, upon its passage.\n  That is 4 million people working, 4 million people feeding their \nfamilies, not on welfare--obviously, taken off welfare if they were on \nit--providing revenue to the U.S. Treasury, to provide funds to do \nsomething good, hopefully, for someone else. That is 4.25 million new \njobs if we pass the balanced budget. Those are not Government jobs, my \ncolleagues. They are not here in Washington. They are jobs all across \nAmerica as a result of the spurt in economic activity that would occur \nbecause that amendment passed.\n\n  The American people do not want a Government handout. They never \nhave. They want to work hard. They want the opportunity to earn a \ndecent living and be left alone. ``Leave us alone. Let us earn our way \nthrough life. We don't want you to give us handouts. We want you to get \nout of the way. You are here to protect us, to defend us. And you're \nnot protecting us and you're not defending us when you run us into debt \nand you give it to our children, $5 trillion.''\n  That is today. If you think of debt today as a hockey stick, the \nfirst 200 years of our Nation was the toe of that hockey stick, and the \nnext 10 or 15\n\n[[Page S5845]]\n\nwere the handle of the stick. It goes up like this. Then the next 10 or \n15 we are going to go so far out of the way, $10, $15 trillion, that, \nas others have already said many times today, we will file the \nequivalent of chapter 11, bankruptcy. It will happen. Then what happens \nto our grandchildren?\n  The debate is about our grandchildren and their children. It is about \nsimply asking those young folks and their parents and relatives to have \nthe opportunity to vote through their legislatures to pass or reject a \nconstitutional amendment. That is all this debate is about on the \nSenate floor. Anybody who says anything else is simply not accurate.\n  What else does a balanced budget do for those people out there who \nwork, those whom we represent? How about our sons and daughters who go \nto get a good education in college? I have a daughter who just \ngraduated from Lafayette College in Easton, PA, on May 19. The cost was \nroughly $100,000 in 4 years.\n  In higher education, whether it is public or private, it is not \ncheap, obviously. It is going up.\n\n  Now, think about those 21-22-23-year-olds who earned their diplomas \nlast month, or perhaps a few this month. Many of them are facing, \ntoday, an uncertain job market. Why is it uncertain? Because of the \nfiscal irresponsibility of this Government, for one thing. I have \nalready mentioned how a balanced budget can help in their job search \nbecause we can create another 4.25 million jobs. Maybe they would get \none.\n  Assume for a moment one of the graduates is fortunate and finds a \ngood job, and he or she probably has a few student loans that need \nrepayment. Lower interest rates from a balanced budget would save on \nthe average 10-year student loan for a 4-year private college, an \naverage figure, a 10-year student loan, get the loan for 10 years, \ngoing to a 4-year private college, if the budget were balanced, the \nlowering of interest rates that would occur from balancing the Federal \nbudget would save that recipient of that loan nearly $9,000 in that 10-\nyear loan--$8,885 to be exact. When the American people are told about \ncuts in education or informed of a new proposal to provide a $1,500 tax \ncredit for tuition, they should take the news with a grain of salt. The \nPresident vetoed a balanced budget that would reduce student loan costs \nby $9,000. That is what he vetoed. To atone for the veto, the President \nthen says we will give everybody a $1,500 tax credit so they can go to \ncollege. If these kids paid off their student loan, and they could pay \nthem off faster with $8,000 or $9,000 less, there is more money \navailable to the student loan pot to those coming along.\n  Bill Cosby, in a graduation speech at my daughter's graduation, said, \n``Pay off your student loans.'' That was his advice. Pay off the \nstudent loans. If you do, others will follow you and they will have the \nopportunity to get an education. If you had $9,000 less in interest on \nthose loans you could pay them off a heck of a lot faster. That is what \nthe balanced budget amendment means to them.\n  A balanced budget will do more for education in America than any \ntuition tax credit, any Government loans, or, frankly, Goals 2000. It \nis 9,000 bucks in the pockets of that young man or woman, just from \npassing balancing the budget.\n  I used to be a schoolteacher. I think I know about education. I was a \nschoolteacher, a school board member, and a father for 21 years. I \nthink I know a little bit about education. Do not take my word for it. \nAsk any students who graduated a few weeks ago and they will tell you \nthe same thing. A balanced budget will dramatically improve the lives \nof those young men and women who are just getting started in life.\n  That is why we were elected, to help people. This helps people. This \nis not a vague, opaque kind of mysterious concept we are debating here \non the floor of the Senate today. This affects every man, woman, and \nchild in America directly. There are many families in New Hampshire \nworking two or three jobs just to make ends meet, as I am sure there \nare in Oregon, Texas, and everywhere else. They do it to put food on \nthe table and pay the mortgages. The mortgage payment comes due every \nmonth, rain or shine, sickness or health. It is the largest bill most \nAmericans ever pay. Think about this for a moment. That is the biggest \nline item in your entire family budget other than the money you pay to \nthe Federal Government in taxes.\n  A family in New Hampshire with an $80,000 mortgage, and you can put \nthis in any other State, $80,000 mortgage, would save $107 each month--\neach month--if the Federal books were balanced. Over the life of a 30-\nyear loan, that family would save $38,653. Now, if someone could tell \nme what Government program or what act we could take here on the floor \nof the Senate today that would provide $38,000 in the pockets of the \nAmerican people, better than that, I would like to know what it is. \nThat is the positive spinoff of balancing the Federal budget--helping \npeople.\n\n  Again, we are talking about dramatically improving the lives of \npeople, not just residually, dramatically helping improve the lives of \nthe American people with a balanced budget. What Government program \ncould do as much for the American family as a balanced budget? \nAmeriCorps? I do not think so. Funding for the arts? Peanut subsidies? \nI am afraid not. Battling the budget is what we need to do. That helps \npeople.\n  Madam President, there is another point that is often lost in this \ndebate. The question before the U.S. Senate is whether or not we should \nsend this budget to the States for ratification. Amendments to the \nConstitution are not just sent down Pennsylvania Avenue for a \nPresidential signature or for a veto. I alluded to this earlier but I \nwant to say it again, they are sent to all 50 States, 38 legislatures, \nthree-quarters of them must pass identical language, identical \nlanguage, before this amendment becomes a part of our Constitution. \nShould the decision be made in Washington, DC, or Concord, NH, or \nButte, MT, or wherever else--how should that decision be made? Where \nare the families sitting around the table? It is not here on the Senate \nfloor in Washington, DC, where they are working their budgets out and \nworried about how they will make their payments. It is in the small \ntowns and cities all over America, where families live and work and try \nto earn a living and want the Government to help them, but to stay out \nof their way.\n  The balanced budget amendment is not a debate about accounting. It is \nnot a debate about politics. It is not a debate about anything except \nreal people. That is what this debate is about. What you have to ask \nyourself when you come down here on the floor tomorrow to vote, you \nhave to ask yourself three or four major questions: If I vote ``no'' on \nthe balanced budget amendment, do I help the college graduate \nstruggling with student loans? Do I help him or her? The answer to that \nquestion is, no, you do not. You hurt them. Second, do I help the \nsingle mother who is having trouble with her mortgage payment? The \nanswer is, no, you hurt her. I have heard people on this Senate floor \non the other side of the aisle talk about their compassion for single \nparents and the difficulties that young women with children at home \nhave as they try to go through life working and taking care of those \nchildren. I had a single mother because my dad died when I was 4 years \nold. I know what it was like. Believe me, I know what it was like for \nher. And it was tough. I know what it was like, and I know how much \nthat would have meant to her to have that much more money in real \nincome in her mortgage and perhaps to help me with my college loans had \nshe been able to have a balanced budget.\n  Do you help create a job for a laid off mill worker if you vote \n``no?'' The answer is no, you do not. You insure that he or she will \nprobably be laid off a little bit longer. There is no compassion there. \nDo you let these people and their elected representatives in the States \nhave the opportunity to debate the merits of amending the Constitution? \nDo you allow them to have that opportunity? The answer is no, you do \nnot if you vote ``no.'' You say, ``I am sorry, we do not want you to \nhave that opportunity. We don't want it to leave here. (A) we do not \nwant to balance the budget; (B) we do not want to help people; and (C) \nwe do not want you to have the opportunity to talk about that in your \nState legislature.'' That is what you say when you vote ``no.''\n  What do you really say, though? Here is what you do say: Washington \nknows\n\n[[Page S5846]]\n\nbest. We have all the answers here. We can get 66 votes or less and we \ncan beat you and you cannot get the opportunity to vote in your State.\n  My colleagues, in conclusion, the choice is very clear. There has \nbeen a lot of emotion on the floor here these last few hours, but the \nchoice is very clear. You want to help people? You want to really help \npeople without a Government handout? Vote for this constitutional \namendment to balance the budget because it will not get done, the \nbudget will not be balanced without it, and you know it. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, we have all listened with a great deal of \ninterest all day as this debate has gone on. We look at it from \ndifferent angles, I guess. There are some of us who come to this body \nand engage in this debate, and we take a look at the world from \ndifferent angles. I happen to look at it from the bottom up. I have \nbeen pretty much one of those people at the working end of the American \nspectrum, I guess. I came up the hard way. You know, for once, I had an \nidea that this year maybe common sense would prevail. I really had \nhopes of that. I am not a lawyer, not highly educated.\n  When you think about how simple this little debate is, it is just \nabout sending an idea to be considered by the people who live in our \nrespective States. That is all it is about. It is not about pain, or \nhurting, or what we are going to do. If we had a constitutional \namendment that said we have to balance the budget, do you think it \nwould cut down on the little squabbles we have in our debates on the \nbudget? No, I do not think so, because everybody has a different set of \npriorities. But the idea is just to send it to the States, to let \nAmerica take a look at it, and to let the citizens turn over in their \nown minds whether we need an amendment to force Congress to balance the \nbudget.\n  You know, Americans watch us every day, and folks at home say, ``Why \ndo you not get along better up there?'' ``Why do you have these heated \ndebates?'' I guess I have listened to the Senator from Arkansas and his \nspeech regarding mining. I have listened to that for 7 years now, \nalmost 8. It never changes. And some who do not really understand the \nissue sometimes get confused. As we talk about this issue, this issue \nof a balanced budget--and, remember, it is no sin to oppose it. In \nfact, it may be good that some would oppose it because that adds \nsomething to the debate. You have the right to oppose, but you do not \nhave the right to distort the facts.\n  We are talking about passing a proposed amendment to the Constitution \nof the United States and sending it to the States for ratification. My \nfriend from Illinois had it right. As Americans watch us, he said, ``Do \nit.'' Do we have the courage to do it? We have heard all of the \narguments. Of course, if common sense is not going to take over, then \nwe have to argue another end of it. Basically, I kind of come from the \nphilosophy on taxation that, yes, a certain amount of Government is \nneeded and desired by most Americans--in fact, I would say all of them. \nBut we still have a responsibility to that earner to allow him or her \nto earn more and to keep more so they can do more for themselves and \ntheir communities. I do not have the right to jerk the future away from \nyoung people.\n  I have a daughter that will graduate from medical school a year from \nright now. I do not have a right to jeopardize her future to practice \nher profession. I have a son that has the same kind of a future--a very \nbright future. But I, as a legislator or citizen do not have the right \nto jerk that future away from him. Do you know what? I do not think \nanybody else does either.\n  You have the right to oppose this amendment. You do not have the \nright to distort. Last year, Congress passed a budget that would have \nbalanced in 7 years. President Clinton vetoed it. In fact, in order to \navoid a balanced budget, he forced a shutdown of the Federal \nGovernment--not once, but twice. Congress was finally able to pass the \nbudget for the year, but it fell short of its goal and did nothing, \nfundamentally, to change the way Government spends the hard-earned \nmoney of our citizens.\n\n  Eighty percent of Americans favor a balanced budget amendment. And \nthe country is watching right now, this week, to see if this Congress \ncaves in to the President once more. More than any other piece of \nlegislation that we vote on this year, this constitutional amendment \nwill have the longest and the most lasting effect that we will do in \nthis 104th Congress. So I stand here as a supporter of it and ask my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a look. Just think, and \nuse your good old common sense, and do the right thing.\n  President Clinton proved one thing last year: One man can stand in \nthe way of real progress, and he can stand in the way of real reform. \nLast year, the President pressured six Democrats, who already voted for \nthe amendment in previous votes, to kill the amendment when we had a \nchance of passage. One vote. It proved that he alone was the man that \nstood in the way of success.\n  Ironically, President Clinton used to support a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. In 1985, when he was a Governor, he \nboasted about his work with the National Governors' Association, and he \nsaid, ``The NGA is on record in a resolution as supporting a \nconstitutional amendment for a balanced budget, something Republicans \ncould never have passed without the help of Democratic Governors, and I \nwas one of them.'' He referred to his own State's constitutional \nrequirement to balance the State budget as his own salvation.\n  Now, does the President want a balanced budget? He says he does \nnearly every time he is asked. But I am wondering if his words are \nsupporting his actions. But irrespective of that, do we, as Members of \nthis Congress--irrespective of what the President thinks--do we have \nthe courage and do we have the discipline to pass this amendment and \nsend it to the States?\n  Well, as I already mentioned, the President rallied the Democrats in \nCongress to kill the balanced budget amendment last summer. On top of \nthat, only one of the record five separate budgets that President \nClinton submitted to Congress even came close to balancing the budget. \nHe vetoed the Republican budget and shut down the Federal Government, \nnot once but twice, and the Republican budget would have created \nbalance by the year 2002.\n  Is it not ironic today, when we turn on the television and there are \nthe trustees of the Medicare trust fund saying that we were wrong last \nyear in saying that the trust fund will be completely out of money by \nthe year 2002. We were wrong. It is going to be out of money in 2001. \nWe have heard Senator after Senator stand on this floor and say, ``We \ncan take care of it, and we do not need all of these draconian, these \nextreme measures,'' when actually we were allowing the trust fund to \ngrow at around 7 percent a year. They called that a cut. This is the \nonly town in America where that can happen. And because we did not have \nthe nerve to deal with that situation a year ago, we are now a year \nbehind in taking actions to make sure that the Medicare trust fund is \nsolvent, is strong, and will be there for generations to come. Some \nchose to stick their heads in the sand and ignore the problem.\n  If that sort of makes you a little bit mad, whoever is listening and \nwatching, it is supposed to. We did not do our responsibility last year \nwhen we were told by the same set of trustees, three of which work for \nthe President in his administration as Cabinet Secretaries--yes; they \nwere on the television today telling us that we are in deficit spending \nnow, and we will continue to be and will be broke and out of money by \nthe year 2001. Despite the President's action, the public debate about \nthe balanced budget has been won.\n  Look at the polls. Look at the polling. One says that if you love \nthis country, there are two kinds of freedoms, and the basic of all is \neconomic freedom, because there can be no political freedom unless we \nhave economic freedom under our system. We can change the system and \nall be ruled by a benevolent ruler. Even he operates the Treasury, and \nwe all become servants and subservient to an all-powerful being.\n  I think when our forefathers put together this great Constitution, I \nwill say that as the debate went on, they would probably, the American \npeople, if that had been televised, they would\n\n[[Page S5847]]\n\nhave been a little bit cynical about Government then, because there \nwere some great debates.\n  What did our forefathers do when they put together the Constitution? \nI will tell you. They probably did not have the great vision of seeing \nAmerica as it is today, but they had a very, very strong sense of \nhistory. And if we learn anything in the study of history, it is that \nthose who forget it are damned to repeat it. When we revive history to \nmake it suit our own taste or to be politically correct, then we are \ntinkering with the compass because we are going to make some decisions \nbased on history.\n  Those forefathers were products of a feudal system. They knew that in \norder for ``free men''--two words--to survive in self-government, it \ntook about three things. It took education, it took discipline, and \nalso it took those who studied history and do not forget it.\n  I ask my colleagues by voting for a balanced budget amendment now, we \nare taking one of the many steps that is needed in order to secure a \nstable future for our children. We do not do anything in this body for \nimmediate action. Maybe some of us do. We cast votes that make us feel \ngood. It is not always good for the Nation, but it makes us feel good. \nLook what we have done. We do it because the effects of our action here \ncome many, many years later. It is the foundation that was laid by our \nfathers and our grandfathers that enabled us to do the things today, \nwhat we have to do, and we have to protect that heritage and that great \nhistory, and pass it on to the next generation. We cannot continue to \nhave runaway deficits and accumulate mountains of debt and expect to \nremain competitive and financially solvent in today's global economy.\n  So we stand in support of a balanced budget. It is even more \nimportant today. Just think of the technology that we have today--three \nlittle inventions, three little inventions that have, in comparison, or \nrelative to this building, brought the world down to the size of a \nbasketball. We can talk and interact with anybody in any other place in \nthe world, wired or wireless, in 5 seconds. Those three inventions are \nthe transistor, the jet engine, and the silicon chip. It changed our \nwhole life. We cannot go back to the old days. We cannot do it. And the \nonly way that we stay a leader in a global economy is if we stay \neconomically solvent.\n  No other nation has the potential of leading the rest of the world \nthan this country, the only superpower that is left. Yet, we would \nallow the power to be eroded by not being careful with our funds as we \nshould be. Just because we have a balanced budget amendment does not \nmean that we are not going to have--my good friend, the Senator from \nFlorida is on the floor, and he is going to have different priorities \nthan I have. He just is. We would expect that, but we can work them out \nwhen both of us know that we have to solve problem No. 1 on the ground, \nand it has to be solved within certain parameters.\n  My heavens, common sense may take over. Who knows? Sometimes in this \ntown, though, they say there is a vaccine for that. It is called \nPotomac water.\n  So I support the balanced budget amendment. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it just from the standpoint that it is like good old Quaker \nOats; it is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I support a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the Federal budget. It is a sound and necessary approach to \nsolving the severe fiscal crisis that is beginning to plague this \ncountry year after year.\n  I believe that the force of a constitutional amendment is needed to \nmandate an end to profligate spending decisions that have hijacked the \neconomic growth and security of this Nation over the past quarter of a \ncentury. Each year, when elected officials debate the Federal budget, \nresponsible spending decisions are buffeted about by the winds of \npolitical rhetoric. There is no final arbiter to insure that sound \neconomic decisions are made in the best long-term interest of the \ncountry. We need this constitutional amendment to force us to take the \nproper steps to repair and preserve the economic superiority of the \nUnited States of America.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned about the future of this country, and \nabout what failure to balance the budget today can do to burden the \nlives of our children and grandchildren tomorrow.\n  For example, there have been a number of balanced budget proposals \nproffered in just the past year. The President has offered balanced \nplans, the House and the Senate have created their own balanced plans, \nand last week a bipartisan group of Senators offered yet another \nbalanced budget plan. And yet, with all of these alternatives and \nprofessed commitment to a balanced budget, the Congress and the \nPresident have been not been able to reach agreement on a single one of \nthem. Perhaps we need the force of the Constitution of the United \nStates to give us the courage to stand up, take responsibility, and \nmake the tough choices that balanced budgets require.\n  Our burgeoning Federal debt is the greatest crisis facing our Nation \ntoday. It is devouring our savings, robbing our ability to invest in \ninfrastructure and education, and saddling our children with an \nenormous bill that will eventually have to be paid. The interest \npayments on the debt consume dollars that could otherwise go for urgent \nneeds such as infrastructure and education.\n  In 1980, the cumulative Federal debt was $910 billion. A decade later \nthe debt had tripled, and today it stands at $4.9 trillion. Simply \nlimiting the Government's ability to borrow is not enough to achieve \ndeficit reduction or to control the compounding interest on the \nnational debt. According to the Congressional Budget Office, \n``significant deficit reduction can best be accomplished by legislative \ndecisions that reduce outlays or increase revenues.''\n  If we do not balance the budget today and continue on our path of \nirresponsible spending, what will happen? Here are a few examples:\n  In the year 2000, annual interest payments on the Federal debt will \ngrow to about $305 billion--an increase of over 50 percent in just 4 \nyears. Interest payments on the debt will surpass defense spending and \nbecome the largest Federal expenditure.\n  In the year 2012, unless policy changes are enacted, projected \nspending on entitlement programs and interest on the debt will grow so \nrapidly that they will consume all tax revenues collected by the \nFederal Government.\n  In the year 2012, unless changes are made, the Government could \ntheoretically close all Federal prisons, national parks, the Pentagon, \nand eliminate spending on research and development, education, roads \nand bridges and still not have enough savings to eliminate the deficit.\n  In the year 2030, to bring the deficit down to the current level, the \nBipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform concluded that \neither all Federal taxes would have to be increased by 85 percent or \nall Federal spending programs would have to be cut in half.\n  When I took the oath of office in 1983 as Governor of the State of \nNevada, the Nevada State Constitution required a balanced budget. The \nnecessary, excruciating task of balancing the State budget took strong \nexecutive and legislative leadership. Those tough decisions were made, \nand each year the State budget was balanced.\n  Nevada is not alone in requiring a balanced budget, in fact, many \nStates across the Nation require Governors to submit, and legislatures \nto pass, budgets that reconcile revenues and expenditures. It is time \nthat the Congress and the President come together and make the tough \ndecisions that are required for fiscally responsible governance.\n  History has shown that nothing is more desired and nothing is more \navoided than the will to make tough choices. The last time our Federal \nbudget was balanced was 1969.\n  Mr. President, we are sitting on a time bomb. Our obligation to \nfinance the national debt eats away each year at our ability to address \nthe critical needs of our population. Passing this amendment will \nsignal to the American people that we are concerned about the solvency \nof this country, and it will demonstrate our commitment to preserving \nimportant government resources that are a lifeline for so many of our \ncitizens. I strongly urge the passage of the constitutional balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the United States of America was born of\n\n[[Page S5848]]\n\ndislike and disgust of taxation. Unfair and burdensome taxation was the \nimpetus for the Declaration of Independence. You would think we would \nhave learned a lesson from this.\n  Unfortunately not. Government taxes on the American people have \nreached all time high, choking off economic growth. Working Americans \nnow pay 41.3 percent of their income in taxes--a 1.3-percent increase \nsince President Clinton came into office. We spend nearly as much for \ninterest on the national debt as we spend on the defense budget and 40 \ncents of every income tax dollar goes to interest. A child born today \nis destined to pay $187,000 in interest on the national debt during his \nor her lifetime.\n  And these astronomical rates are not high enough to meet current \nspending needs. Future generations could see tax rates of up to 84 \npercent, if we don't stop this profligate spending.\n  We have tried over and over again as a deliberative body to stop the \ncycle of deficit spending. We had the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, then \nwe had Gramm-Rudman II, and then we had the budget deals of 1990 and \n1993. Yet we have not been able to get one Senate to hold the next \nSenate on the path to a balanced budget.\n  While one Senate cannot bind the next Senate, this Senate certainly \nshackles the next generation to this generations' debts. The result: \nthe cost of current programs--from which we all now benefit--is being \nfoisted upon the next generation. And that next generation of \nAmericans, who haven't yet earned their first paychecks, can't vote--\nthey have no say in what we are doing. That is obscene; that is \nimmoral; that is un-American.\n  Beltway robber barons, elected and unelected, are addicted to \nspending. The only way to end this psychological dependence to pass the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  The balanced budget amendment would outlaw deficit spending and force \ngovernment to balance its books. It would return accountability to the \nConstitution and restraint on our spending --in short, integrity in our \nGovernment. It will rightly return the power of the purse to the \npeople.\n  The belief we can only control government by controlling its capacity \nto take our money is as old as the idea of democracy. Money was--and \nis--the source of the Government's basic power. The tale of history \nbears testament to this truth. The Magna Carta prescribed that the king \ncould not impose taxes--except through the consent of the great \ncouncil. Charles I was executed because he tried to govern without \nseeking the consent of parliament in spending public money.\n  Congress today doesn't have to vote to raise more taxes in order to \nspend more money. Instead our legislature takes the debtor's path: \nspend and beg; spend and plead; spend and borrow. Our current system \nlets the Government spend on credit and sign the taxpayers' name on the \ndotted line.\n  For too long this body has assembled to satisfy the appetites of \nnarrow interests at the expense of the public. The American people are \nfed up with a Congress that spends the as yet unearned wages of the \nnext generation. Thomas Jefferson was right when he proscribed in 1789, \n``no generation can contract debts greater than may be paid during the \ncourse of its own existence.''\n  The balanced budget amendment is not a quick fix. It is real reform \nthat will end deficit spending except in times of war. Constitutional \nmeasures that enforce a balance budget have worked at the State level \nand will work at the Federal level. I know, from my service as Governor \nin one of 49 States that require a balanced budget. As Governor, I \nbalanced budgets 8 years in a row. Not only did we balance the budget, \nwe put into place a cash operating reserve fund of several hundred \nmillions of dollars. We established a rainy day fund because we knew \nthere would be episodes of fiscal crisis and financial difficulty in \nthe future that we would need to meet. And we knew, since we were \nrequired by our constitution to have a balanced budget, that we would \nneed to prepare for it in advance. Experience has shown that State \nconstitutional balanced budget provisions force legislatures and \nexecutives to prioritize and cut spending. Passage of the balanced \nbudget amendment would do the same for the Federal Government.\n  During this debate concerning a balanced budget amendment to the \nconstitution, we have heard frequently and forcefully that there is no \nneed for us to amend the U.S. Constitution. It has been argued the \nconstitution gives Congress the authority to balance the budget--for \nthe Federal Government to live within its means. Mr. President, \nCongress does not lack authority. Congress lacks self-restraint. \nCongress doesn't need permission to balance the budget, it needs to be \nforbidden from doing otherwise. When it's time to stand firm, when it's \ntime to prioritize spending, when it's time to make tough choices--\nCongress seems to experience a collective collapse of will.\n  Mr. President, last year you and I and other Members of this Chamber \nendured a balanced budget amendment debate, and ultimately we fell one \nvote short. We fell one vote short in March 1995 because a number of \nSenators reneged on their promise to vote for the amendment. We fell \none vote short because six Senators who voted against the balanced \nbudget amendment who voted for it 12 months earlier. We fell one vote \nshort because many of our colleagues said over and over again: ``All we \nneed is the will and the courage, and the determination to balance the \nbudget.'' Well, I am here to tell you that that was just one more lame \nexcuse.\n  This profligate spending must stop. In 1962, the Federal Government's \nbudget reached $100 billion. By 1971 it had doubled to $200 billion. By \n1977, it had doubled again. By 1983, it had doubled again. The budget \nfor next year, fiscal year 1997, will be more than $1.6 trillion--the \nbudget doubled again. Of course, spending has far exceeded revenues, so \nmuch so that we have accumulated a Federal debt of over $5 trillion. In \nfact, we haven't seen a budget surplus for 25 years. And next year the \nFederal Government will spend around $240 billion just to pay for \ninterest on the Federal debt--that is nearly $1,000 for every man, \nwoman, and child in America.\n  Mr. President, deficit spending is not only a threat to our \nprosperity and our children's future, it is the method by which \nWashington's imperial elite has circumvented the public, the law, and \nthe Constitution. Deficit spending allows beltway robber barons to run \nthis country without regard to the people. Whether it's pork projects \nor political payoffs, the Washington elite know how to play the game.\n  That must end. A balanced budget amendment will compel the Members of \nthis body to raise taxes if they want to spend more money--what better \nway to restrain spending than that. A balanced budget amendment will \nmake clear to all that the special interest is rewarded when the \ncitizen is penalized.\n  What will a balanced budget amendment mean? Accountability to the \nConstitution and restraint on our spending--in short, integrity in our \nGovernment. It will rightly return the power of the purse to the \npeople.\n  The balanced budget amendment is not a quick fix, it is real reform \nand it will be felt. It will be felt first and foremost by an imperial \nelite who have long run this town. It will be felt by a brood of \nbeltway barons--elected and unelected--who are robbing the next \ngeneration of their yet unearned wages. And most importantly, it will \nbe felt by the American people who will have succeeded in restoring \ntheir right to self-governance.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, last year I presented three papers to \nthe Senate urging opposition to this constitutional amendment. The \nfirst paper argued that the existing deficits were a recent event and \nmarked a sharp departure from the fiscal problems of earlier \nadministrations, which were directed primarily to the problem of a \npersistent full employment surplus, with its accompanying downward \npressure on consumer demand. The second paper related the singular \nevents of the 1980s, which led to huge deficits and a huge debt. The \nthird paper explored the folly and danger of writing into the \nConstitution decrees concerning fiscal policy which would have been \ninappropriate to a small 18th century republic, and would be \npotentially destabilizing to a world power in the 20th century.\n  In the FY 1973 budget, OMB Director George P. Shultz explained the \n``full-employment budget concept'' as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S5849]]\n\n\n       . . . expenditures should not exceed the level at which the \n     budget would be balanced under conditions of full employment.\n\n  Which is to say that in the absence of full employment, as was the \ncase in FY 1973, the Federal government should deliberately contrive to \nincur a deficit equal to the difference between the revenues that would \nactually come in at levels of underemployment, and those that would \ncome in at full employment. Far from being inevitable and unavoidable, \nthere were points in the business cycle where a deficit had to be \ncreated. Otherwise, surpluses would choke off recovery.\n  The term ``full employment surplus'' had originated earlier. The \nJanuary 1962 report of the Council of Economic Advisers explained that \nas the recovery from the recession of 1958 got underway, economic \nactivity grew and so did the revenues of the Federal government. But \nCongress would not spend the additional revenue. As a result, the \nrecovery stalled. This untoward event was ascribed to ``fiscal drag.''\n  Beginning in 1980, the Reagan White House and Office of Management \nand Budget set about creating a crisis by bringing about deficits \nintended to force Congress to cut certain programs. In a television \naddress 16 days after his inauguration, President Reagan said:\n\n       There were always those who told us that taxes couldn't be \n     cut until spending was reduced. Well, you know we can lecture \n     our children about extravagance until we run out of voice and \n     breath. Or we can cut their extravagance by simply reducing \n     their allowance.\n\n  Haynes Johnson wrote of this in Sleepwalking Through History: America \nThrough the Reagan Years (1991). I will simply quote a footnote on page \n111:\n\n       [Stockman's] former mentor Moynihan was the first to charge \n     that the Reagan Administration ``consciously and deliberately \n     brought about'' higher deficits to force congressional \n     domestic cuts. Moynihan was denounced and then proven \n     correct, except that the cuts to achieve balanced budgets \n     were never made and the deficits ballooned even higher.\n\n  A balanced budget amendment would undo all that we have learned about \neconomic policy over the past 60 years. There was enormous volatility \nin economic activity prior to 1945--volatility that would be considered \nunacceptable today. For example in 1906, output increased by 11.6 \npercent, to be followed 2 years later by a decline of 8.2 percent in \n1908, and an increase of 16.6 percent in 1909. And in 1918, output \nincreased by 12.3 percent to be followed by 3 consecutive years of \nnegative growth including a drop of 8.7 percent in 1921. And then, of \ncourse there was the Great Depression. After increasing by 6.7 percent \nin 1929, output fell by 9.9 percent in 1930, another 7.7 percent in \n1931, and then a further devastating decline of 14.8 percent in 1932. \nAfter World War II all this changed, following a brief adjustment \nperiod, as the country converted from a wartime to peacetime economy. \nSince then, the largest reduction in output was 2.1 percent in 1982.\n  In the 1970's I asked Council of Economic Advisers Chairman, Charles \nL. Schultze, what would happen if we had tried to balance the budget in \nthe middle of the 1975 recession. He reported back that the computers \nat the Council ``blew up''. GDP--then called GNP--dropped another 12 \npercent in an economy in which output was already 5 percent below \ncapacity. During the debate on the balanced budget amendment last year, \nthis simulation was repeated by the Treasury Department and by my own \nstaff with the same results. A moderate recession in which the \nunemployment rate increases by 2-3 percent turns into a major \ncontraction--may I say depression--in which unemployment soars over 10 \npercent and output falls by 15 percent or more. In the entire post-\nWorld War II era the unemployment rate exceeded 10 percent only for a \nbrief 10 months during the 1981-82 recession.\n\n  Let us not undo the progress we have already made--progress easily \nseen if we look at the facts.\n  Last year, in my third paper opposing this constitutional amendment, \nI noted:\n\n       As a result of the deficit reduction policies we have had \n     three straight years of deficit reduction--the first such \n     string of declines since the administration of Harry S. \n     Truman. Here are the numbers:\n       FY 1992: $290.4 billion.\n       FY 1993: $255.1 billion.\n       FY 1994: $203.2 billion.\n       OMB 1995 est.: $192.5 billion.\n       CBO 1995 est.: $176 billion.\n\n  With a year of hindsight I confess to being somewhat inaccurate. \nRemarkably, the deficit for fiscal year 1995 was even lower than \nprojected: $163.8 billion compared to projections of $176 to $192 \nbillion. The fiscal year 1996 deficit will be even lower, resulting in \n4 consecutive years of deficit reduction.\n  And the budget outlook improves almost monthly. While I was on the \nfloor opposing a balanced budget amendment last February, the \nCongressional Budget Office was projecting a fiscal year 1996 deficit \nof $207 billion. By August 1995, CBO had lowered its projection to $189 \nbillion. And then again another reduction in December 1995 to $172 \nbillion. Even the latest CBO forecast of $144 billion released last \nmonth is outdated. Following new revenue estimates from the Treasury \nDepartment, June O'Neill, Director of CBO, indicated on May 20, 1996 \nthat her agency had lowered its estimate of the fiscal year 1996 \ndeficit to $130 billion.\n  Some will note that the latest estimates incorporate the effects of \nboth an expected fiscal dividend from a balanced budget and legislative \nactions that reduced discretionary spending.\n  But the bottom line is even better than expected, so let's give a \ncheer.\n  The deficit has been cut by more than 50 percent from $290 billion to \nabout $130 billion in 4 years.\n  The deficit is now about 1.7 percent of GDP.\n  And we have a primary surplus--that is, excluding interest payments, \nrevenues exceed outlays.\n  Adopting a constitutional amendment to balance the budget--which I \nargued in 1981 in the Wall Street Journal is tantamount ``to writing \nalgebra into the Constitution''--can only jeopardize the remarkable \nprogress we have already made. We can and we will complete the job of \nbalancing the budget without this amendment.\n  I urge the Senate to once again reject this proposed balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader, Mr. \nDole, has scheduled for the Senate a reconsideration of the enormously \nimportant issue of amending the U.S. Constitution to require that \nCongress return to the principle of a balanced federal budget.\n  One of my heroes, Thomas Jefferson, put it this way:\n\n       The question whether one generation has the right to bind \n     another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay \n     them ourselves.\n\n  That, Mr. President, tells it all, and that is one of the many \nreasons that I so strongly support the balanced budget amendment. It is \nindeed wrong--in fact, it is criminal, for Congress to mandate the \nFederal Government to spend more than it takes in. It is demonstrably \ndestructive to the economy, and ultimately to our society. It is a \nhorrible legacy to impose upon our children and grandchildren.\n  The Congress has a moral duty to stop the charade of out-of-control \ndeficit spending which has shackled future generations with a debt that \ncauses wage stagnation and anemic economic growth. For too long, the \nCongress discarded its duty and responsibility, and has shamelessly \nsupported bloated appropriations for political expedience.\n  For a very long time, this institution has condoned the free-lunch \nsyndrome, which has never existed, and never will. Mr. President, as of \nthe close of business Tuesday, June 4, the Federal debt--down to the \npenny--stood at exactly $5,139,963,594,008.65, or $19,395.97 for every \nman, woman, and child in America.\n  A deliberate debt of this magnitude, knowingly run up by Congress, is \nbizarre. It is, in fact, a con-game. And that is what the 1994 election \nwas all about: restoring integrity and accountability to Government. To \ntheir credit, Republicans in Congress delivered on their commitment \nwhen the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 was enacted, cutting Federal \nspending by $961 billion over 7 years. And although the budget proposed \nannual increases in spending--over and above the $1.6 trillion \nappropriated for fiscal year 1996--President Clinton vetoed it because \nit didn't spend enough.\n\n[[Page S5850]]\n\n  Mr. Clinton, after having himself proposed a Federal budget that \nprojected deficits as far as the eye could see, engaged in a comical \nseries of proposed budgets that, he asserted, would balance the Federal \nbudget in 10, 7, 9 or 8 years--take your pick. Even the Washington Post \ndeclared that the proposed Clinton budget ``relies on gimmicks that \nalmost no one believes would survive.'' This illustrates why it's \nimperative to have the U.S. Constitution mandating a required balanced \nbudget.\n  On March 2, 1995, the Senate failed, by one vote, to approve this \namendment. All but one of the Republican Senators supported it. But \nonly 13 Democrat Senators supported it, which doomed the balanced \nbudget amendment last year.\n  Today we have one more opportunity to approve the amendment in this, \nthe 104th Congress.\n  Again, Thomas Jefferson said it best:\n\n       To preserve our independence, we must not let our leaders \n     load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election \n     between economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude.\n\n  Will the Senate heed Jefferson's wise counsel? We shall shortly see.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to conclude \nthe debate on today of a balanced budget amendment. As the Presiding \nOfficer said in his remarks, and as my friend from Montana reiterated \nin his, it has been a long day, filled with active debate and some \nemotion, on this important subject. I do not intend to keep the Senate \nlong with my remarks, but I would like to make a few statements \nrelative to the decision that we will make tomorrow.\n  As I have in the past, I shall vote for the constitutional amendment \nto insert into the U.S. Constitution a provision requiring a balanced \nbudget as a fundamental principle of our Nation's public policy. It is \nunfortunate that we have to vote on a constitutional amendment to force \nus to do something that we ought to do and that most Congresses \nthroughout the history of this proud Republic have done. However, we \nhave reached the point at which I have concluded that a constitutional \namendment will be necessary in order to provide to this Congress and to \nfuture Congresses the necessary constitutional backbone in order to \nmaintain a policy of a balanced budget.\n  What does the passage of a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution accomplish? The passage of this amendment will not, as the \nPresiding Officer has stated, place this into the U.S. Constitution. It \nrefers this matter now to the States, and it will be the responsibility \nof three-quarters of the States through their appropriate legislative \nprocess to make a determination as to whether this shall be added to \nthe Constitution. Certainly the passage of this amendment will not \nresult in a balanced budget or the diminishment by even a penny of the \nU.S. deficit. Rather, this is a statement of an objective and the \nprovision of constitutional methods by which to give some assurance \nthat that objective will be reached. This is not a substitute for the \nlong road of difficult decisions that will in fact be required in order \nto reach a balanced budget.\n  This amendment may make us feel patriotic. It may make us feel good. \nBut it is not a cure-all for our budget woes. The budget deficit will \nnot suddenly disappear because of the passage of this amendment.\n  I reflect on a decision which this Senate made a few days prior to \nMemorial Day. I was part of a group which has worked over the past \nseveral months to develop a balanced budget plan, a plan which, within \n6 or 7 years, would bring our deficit into balance and would make those \nstructural changes that would give us some confidence that once in \nbalance, the budget would stay in balance past that 6- or 7-year \nperiod. This effort, which has been referred to as the centrist \ncoalition or as the Chafee-Breaux coalition, was a serious effort to \ndevelop a proposal which would actually achieve the objective of a \nbalanced budget.\n  I think in the development of this proposal and in its disposition by \nthe Senate that there are some important lessons. The first of those \nlessons is that this effort by the centrist coalition was bipartisan. \nIt happened that the final proposal was developed by 22 Members of this \nSenate, 11 Republicans and 11 Democrats. It was not intended that it be \nso equally balanced, but that was how it finally evolved. I believe \nthat there is an important lesson here, and that is that almost any \nserious effort in this Government which is intended to have a \nsustaining life must be based on a broad foundation of bipartisanship. \nThere is an arrogance and an ignorance which is associated with efforts \nwhich assume that one individual or one party can carry a major reform.\n\n  It has been said, and I believe correctly so, that the U.S. \nConstitution was the first time that the basic structure of a \ngovernment was written with one of its fundamental objectives being \nthat that government should not function efficiently. Our Government \nwas designed to be difficult. Our Government was intended to be such \nthat no government, by its alacrity and by its effective organization, \nwould be able to trample on the rights of minorities or individual \ncitizens. The very fact that it is difficult to accomplish anything \nwith our form of government underscores the importance of starting the \nprocess of change with a bipartisan spirit.\n  So, while there have been many speeches given in the last few hours \nabout the heroic efforts to try to balance the budget which then \nfoundered because of the Presidential veto, I suggest they had no \nchance of getting to the destination in the first place and were not \nserious efforts at getting to that destination because they failed the \nfundamental, initial test of an effort at serious bipartisanship. Our \neffort, the centrist coalition, was a serious bipartisan effort.\n  What happened to our effort? Our effort failed. It failed by a vote \nof 46 yeas and 53 nays. It had 22 Republican votes and 24 Democratic \nvotes, so its essential bipartisanship from the beginning carried \nthrough to the final vote. It was good news that the vote was as close \nas it was. Frankly, I was surprised that there were 46 Members of the \nSenate who would be prepared to put their names behind the very tough \nchoices that were contained in that centrist coalition.\n  The bad news was that in fact it did lose. That failure indicated \nthat, for another year, we were not going to have a plan for a balanced \nbudget. It also indicated the gap, the chasm, between the rhetoric and \nthe actions of people who will stand and, with such flourish, indicate \ntheir commitment to a balanced budget but, when there is an actual \nopportunity to vote for a bipartisan bill, do not. This was a \nbipartisan bill which a significant number of Members of both parties \nwere prepared to support and with some expectation that, if it were \nactually passed by the Congress, that the President would sign it into \nlaw. That it failed is an indication of the gap between rhetoric and \nthe actual tough choices that we have to make.\n  There have been a number of analogies on the floor in the past few \nhours. One of those analogies, which I think the Presiding Officer \nused, was of a hockey stick, to describe that we had an essentially \nbalanced budget for most of our Nation's history and then in the last \nfew years we have gone off the chart, in terms of deficits. If I could \nuse that hockey analogy, and hockey is not a sport that is particularly \nwell known to me, I would say that those who give speeches in favor of \na balanced budget are like a hockey player at practice, where the net \nis empty and all you have to do is take the puck and, with your hockey \nstick, knock it into the net. If you are sufficiently skilled, that is \nnot a particularly difficult thing to do.\n  What happens when the actual game starts, when the full teams of both \nsides are on the ice? Then you might have somebody in the net with the \nskill of John Vanbeesbrook, who is the goaltender for the Florida \nPanthers. The challenge comes to be able to score when you have a \ndifficult target to hit.\n  That is the nature of the challenge we are going to face and which \nthe passage of this constitutional amendment is not going to allow us \nto avoid.\n  At some point, whether we pass this amendment or whether we do not \npass this amendment, collectively, and in a bipartisan spirit, we are \ngoing to have to make some very tough choices. There has been lots of \ndiscussion about why we are doing this. We are doing it in order to \nhelp the people of America\n\n[[Page S5851]]\n\nbe able to buy a home, get a job, pay off their student loans. We are \ndoing it because it is our generation's responsibility. A frequently \nstated reason is we are doing it out of a sense of responsibility to \nour children or grandchildren. I want to join that chorus.\n  Mr. President, this happens to be a picture taken of my wife and \nmyself and our eight grandchildren. These three, who are triplets, were \nborn approximately 14 months ago. I am pleased to report that one of \nthose triplets, whose name is Adele Gibson, took her first steps \nyesterday, and I was there to observe her taking three of those first \nsteps. She is ready to start her life of increased mobility and \nindependence. It is for Adele and her cousins and the millions of other \ngrandchildren of America for whom we take this action.\n  This amendment will force us to make some of the tough decisions that \nwe have become too accustomed to avoid. The passage of this amendment \nis not a time to exalt. Passing this amendment is not a victory. We may \nhave, by passage of this amendment--should we be able to get the \nconstitutional number to do so tomorrow--performed the equivalent of \nthe hockey exercise of getting the puck into an empty, unguarded net.\n  The challenge is going to be when we can do the tough work of scoring \nagainst the difficult opponent of inertia, the difficult opponent of \nspecial interest, the difficult opponent of people who have developed a \nset of expectations that are necessarily going to have to be challenged \nif we are to move in a different course. These choices will be \ndifficult, and many of them will not be politically prudent. However, \nthey must be made.\n  So, Mr. President, I state again that it is my intention tomorrow to \nvote for the constitutional amendment which will establish as a \nfundamental policy of the Government of the United States of America \nthat we will balance our budget. But I do not wish anyone who observes \nthis process, and certainly none of us who will participate directly in \nit at noon tomorrow, to be under any delusions that we have done some \nheroic act by voting for this constitutional amendment. We have just \nstated that we are unable to make the tough choices without the threat \nof a constitutional crisis in failing to do so and, thus, are prepared \nto impose the shackles of that crisis upon ourselves and those who will \nserve here in the future.\n  We have stated that while we have been unwilling to make the tough \nchoices to date, that with those shackles we will be forced to do so.\n  So this is a time of sober reflection on our failure rather than \nexaltation at a temporary success.\n  I hope that my colleagues will provide the necessary constitutional \nmargin to pass this amendment tomorrow, because without it, I do not \nsee any evidence in our actions and actions as recently as the past 2 \nweeks that give me cause to believe we will, in fact, make those tough \ndecisions to balance the budget of the U.S. Government, achieve the \nbenefits that will come from that and be faithful to Adele Gibson and \nthe other grandchildren of America.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the State of Maine has a rich tradition of \nsending independent and thoughtful voices to the U.S. Senate. Margaret \nChase Smith and Ed Muskie are just two Senators with whom I have served \nwho have carried on this tradition.\n  For the past 18 years, that tradition and the best interests of Maine \ncitizens have been very ably represented in this Chamber by our \ncolleague, Bill Cohen.\n  One thing I have learned about Bill Cohen is that he does not know \nhow to just touch the surface of an issue. If I gave him an assignment, \nor if he involved himself in a problem, then along with learning \neverything there is to know about that problem, he also would provide \ninnovative solutions.\n  Military preparedness, the Central Intelligence Agency, lobby reform, \nhealth care fraud and abuse, Medicare, international trade, these are \njust a few of the countless areas that have benefited from Bill Cohen's \nintellect and energy.\n  As my colleagues know, Bill has also found time to publish a number \nof books, including a very thoughtful look at his first year in the \nSenate, a spy novel, an account of the Iran-Contra investigation, and a \nnumber of volumes of poetry.\n  Bill's departure from the Senate will leave him with more time for \nwriting, and more time for thinking. And I have no doubt that his \nwriting and his thinking will continue to influence American public \npolicy for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/05/senate-section/article/S5851-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SENATOR PAUL SIMON\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, it is no secret that one regret I will have \nwhen I leave the Senate is the fact that we did not send a balanced \nbudget amendment to the States. And I know that regret is shared by \nmany in this Chamber including our colleague, Senator Paul Simon. The \nbalanced budget amendment is a cause that Senator Simon has \ncourageously advanced since his arrival here many years ago in 1985. \nPerhaps his aversion to deficits and red ink arose from the fact that \nSenator Simon began his career at age 19 by editing and publishing a \nsmall newspaper.\n  Whatever the reason, Senator Simon hit the nail on the head when he \nstated that allowing skyrocketing deficits to continue was ``a policy \nof folly.'' If I know Senator Simon, I know that he will continue to \nwrite and speak against this policy of folly until it is changed.\n  The balanced budget is not the only debate to which Senator Simon has \ndevoted his considerable intellect and energy. Education reform, the \nimpact television has on our children, and world hunger are just three \nof the many issues Senator Simon has embraced during his 12 years in \nthis Chamber.\n  I will also long remember the support Senator Simon provided during \nthe battle for passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act. His long \nand distinguished public career also includes 8 years in the Illinois \nHouse of Representatives, 6 years in the Illinois State senate, 4 years \nas Illinois lieutenant governor, and 10 years in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. Somehow, this prolific writer has also found time to \nauthor 15 books and through all his nearly 50 years of service, from \nhis day as crusading editor until today, he has maintained a spotless \nreputation for total and complete integrity.\n  Though we come from different sides of the aisle, I can say without \nhesitation Senator Simon's retirement will deprive this Chamber of one \nof our most thoughtful Members. Elizabeth joins me in wishing he and \nJeanne many more years of health and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/05/senate-section/article/S5851-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5851-S5852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATOR MARK HATFIELD\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, in the suite of offices I have been \nprivileged to occupy as Republican leader hangs a picture of Senator \nCharles McNary of Oregon. Senator McNary served as Republican leader \nfor over 10 years in the 1930's and 1940's, and he served for over 26 \nyears in the Senate.\n  He was the longest serving Senator in Oregon history until his record \nwas broken by our colleague, Senator Mark Hatfield. All Oregonians \nwould agree that not only has Senator Hatfield made history in terms of \nlongevity, he has also set standards in terms of integrity.\n  Senator Hatfield and I have served together in this Chamber for over \n27 years. In that time, we have agreed on many issues and we have \ndisagreed on many others, but I can say without hesitation that not \nonce in the years we have served together did I ever doubt that Mark \nHatfield was standing up for what he truly believed was right for \nOregon and for America.\n  Senator Hatfield has devoted himself to many causes in the Senate, \nincluding improving Oregon's infrastructure, medical research, and the \nsearch for a cure to Alzheimer's disease. Perhaps he is best known for \nhis dedication to the cause of peace, a dedication\n\n[[Page S5852]]\n\narising from service in World War II where he saw battle at Iwo Jima \nand Okinawa, and was among the first U.S. servicemen to enter Hiroshima \nfollowing the atomic explosion.\n\n  Before entering politics, he was a college professor, and when he \nreturns to Oregon in January he will once again enter the classroom. \nThe fact is, however, that for Senator Hatfield the U.S. Capitol was \nalso a classroom and the lessons he has taught us all, lessons in \nstatesmanship, leadership, and friendship, will remain with us and with \nthis Chamber for many years to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. President, yesterday three Swiss Red Cross relief \nworkers were killed in Burundi. I want to express my condolences to the \nInternational Committee of the Red Cross and the families of the \ndeceased.\n  The ICRC staff were attacked as they returned from a project \nproviding humanitarian relief to the civilian Burundian population. \nICRC is the largest humanitarian organization in Burundi, providing \nwater to over 200,000 people, as well as cans, pots, and blankets. The \nRed Cross agricultural programs keeps 150,000 people alive.\n  Over the years, when I have traveled in Africa, I have always been \nimpressed with the courageous work of the ICRC. From Somalia to Rwanda, \nAngola to Liberia, the ICRC performs critical functions--often, as we \nsaw yesterday, at great personal risk. In many of these crises, I \nsimply do not know what we would do with the ICRC.\n  The International Red Cross has long been identified as a neutral \norganization which meticulously avoids taking sides in armed conflicts. \nFor that reason, the brutal attack on the relief officials--in a \nvehicle clearly marked with Red Cross emblems--is particularly \noutrageous.\n  Mr. President, while much of the rest of the world--and even most of \nAfrica--is moving forward into the 21st century, some countries \ncontinue to deteriorate into almost medieval levels of brutality with a \ntotal disregard for human life. Over the past year, the violence in \nBurundi has increased dramatically as both the Burundian military and \nrebels based in Zaire have killed civilians at will.\n  While the extremists pursue a strategy of intimidation, the civilians \nof Burundi suffer. In recent months, thousands of innocent people have \nbeen killed. Tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes, \nmany forced into Zaire and Tanzania.\n  As the level of violence grows, Burundi risks spiraling totally out \nof control into a cycle of genocidal brutality.\n  Mr. President, it is difficult to know what to do in this type of \nsituation. Clearly, as security permits, we will support humanitarian \nrelief operations. The United States and our Europeans allies will \ncontinue to engage in active diplomatic efforts to stop the killing. I \ncommend the administration, particularly National Security Adviser Tony \nLake, for taking a trip to Burundi to signal high-level concern. And \nthe United Nations is exploring a numbers of options to address the \ncontinued violence.\n  But I believe the primary responsibility--and the most effective \nmeans--to stop the killing lies with those on the African Continent.\n  First and foremost, the Burundians themselves must stand up and say \nthat enough is enough. The military--the primary perpetrators of the \nviolence--must end the brutality and perform as a neutral, professional \nforce protecting, not killing, their citizens. The Hutu rebels based in \nZaire must stop their campaign of terror. All parties must stop \nspreading fear and pursue their goals through dialog.\n  Mr. President, the neighboring states--those most affected by the \ninsecurity in Burundi--must play an active role in reestablishing \nstability in the region.\n  Former President Nyerere of Tanzania is leading an active diplomatic \ninitiative to bring the Burundian parties together. I commend President \nNyerere for his efforts, and the United States should continue to \nstrongly support him.\n  I would urge the Organization of African Unity to become more engaged \nin Burundi. The Secretary General of the OAU has issued a statement on \nBurundi. But the OAU, in order to be relevant, must stop talking about \nending conflict and begin to take actions to stop conflicts.\n  Finally, as the primary host to refugees from Rwanda and Burundi, \nZaire has a clear interest in promoting peace in Burundi. Yet, all \nevidence points to the continued destabilizing role of Zaire in central \nAfrica. President Mobutu and Prime Muinister Kengo must use their \ninfluence to stop the arms trafficking to the Hutu rebels based in \nZaire. They must arrest the intimidators spreading fear among refugees. \nAnd they must improve security on the border.\n  Over the years, I have been one of the first to criticize President \nMobutu for his human rights and economic policies in Zaire. He has \ndestroyed the physical and social infrastructure of his country, \npotentially one of Africa's richest and most powerful. Now he is \nfeeding instability in Burundi and Rwanda despite the interests of the \nZairian people in stability. President Mobutu should understand that \nhis role in central Africa will be noted and remembered by the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, once again I want to express my deep sadness over the \nbrutal murder of the three International Committee of the Red Cross \nrelief workers in Burundi. They died in a noble cause: helping innocent \ncivilians stay alive. It is my hope that their deaths will be among the \nlast in Burundi--and not just one more tragic event in the continued \nslide into uncontrollable ethnic brutality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/05/senate-section/article/S5852-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     FOREIGN OIL CONSUMED BY UNITED STATES?

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending May 31, the United States imported 8,700,000 \nbarrels of oil each day, 900,000 barrels more than the 7,800,000 \nbarrels imported during the same week a year ago.\n  Americans relied on foreign oil for 57 percent of their needs last \nweek, and there are no signs that this upward spiral will abate.

As of the close of \nbusiness yesterday, June 4, 1996, the Federal debt stood at \n$5,139,963,594,008.65. On a per capita basis, every man, woman, and \nchild in America owes $19,395.97 as his or her share of the Federal \ndebt.\n  More than two centuries ago, the Continental Congress adopted the \nDeclaration of Independence. It's time for Congress to adopt a \ndeclaration of economic responsibilities--and an amendment requiring \nthe President and Congress to come up with a balanced Federal budget--\nnow.\n\n[[Page S5853]]\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting one \nnomination which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/05/senate-section/article/S5852-4", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5853-S5854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON SMALL BUSINESS AND COMPETITION--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--\n                                 PM 152\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Small Business:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit to you my annual report on the state of \nsmall business, and to report that small businesses are doing \nexceptionally well. In the year covered by this report, a record \n807,000 new firms reported initial employment. Firms in industries \ndominated by small businesses created almost 60 percent of the nearly \n3.3 million new jobs. Business failures and bankruptcies declined at \nsome of the sharpest rates in a decade.\n  Small businesses have both contributed to and benefited from the \nrecent strength of the economy. The deficit reduction plan I initiated \nin 1993 has cut the budget deficit in half. The economy has created 8.5 \nmillion new jobs since January 1993--almost all of them in the private \nsector. The combined rate of unemployment and inflation is at its \nlowest level in more than 25 years.\n  A major success story has been in the women-owned business sector. \nWomen are creating new businesses and new jobs at double the national \nrate. Today, women own one-third of all businesses in the United \nStates. Clearly, there is no stopping this fast-growing segment of the \neconomy.\n  Last June I met in Washington with nearly 2,000 small business \nowners--participants in the national White House Conference on Small \nBusiness. They took precious time away from their businesses to tell us \nabout their problems and their ideas for resolving them, turning over a \nlist of 60 recommendations for Government action. Their ideas are \nreflected in many of the recent initiatives of my Administration.\n\n\n                      improving access to capital\n\n  One of the keys to a healthy small business sector is access to \nadequate start-up and working capital. The Small Business Lending \nEnhancement Act of 1995, which I signed last October, helped to \nincrease access to capital through the Small Business Administration's \n(SBA) section 7(a) loan guarantee program. Last year, the SBA provided \nnearly $11 billion in long-term credit and other financial assistance \nto more than 67,000 small businesses, bringing SBA's total loan \nportfolio to $26 billion. The number of 7(a) guaranteed loans has \nincreased dramatically, up 52 percent from fiscal year 1994 to fiscal \nyear 1995--and that's with a smaller budget and fewer employees at the \nSBA. Moreover, during that same period, the number of 7(a) guaranteed \nloans to women-owned businesses grew by 86 percent; loans to minority-\nowned businesses increased by 53 percent; and loans to businesses owned \nby U.S. veterans grew by 43 percent.\n  Other initiatives are under way. My administration has been working \nwith banks and banking regulators to remove impediments to small \nbusiness lending by financial institutions. The Riegle Community \nDevelopment and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 amended the banking \nand securities laws to promote the growth of a secondary market for \nsmall business loans. And my administration is looking to reduce small \nbusiness securities filing and disclosure burdens. In June 1995, the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission proposed regulations that would \nfurther this small business goal.\n\n\n                         easing the tax burden\n\n  The Federal Government should reward rather than discourage \nentrepreneurs who take risks and create jobs. To that end, we have \nworked to simplify the tax code and make it more equitable for small \nfirms.\n  In April 1995, I signed legislation to increase to 30 percent the \nshare of health insurance premiums that self-employed individuals can \ndeduct on their tax returns beginning this tax year--and we're working \nto increase that amount.\n  Small firms are less likely than their larger counterparts to be able \nto provide retirement plans. While 75 percent of workers in businesses \nwith more than 1,000 employees have pension plans, only 24 percent of \nworkers in businesses with fewer than 100 employees have them. I have \nproposed a new pension plan targeted to the needs of small businesses--\nthe National Employee Savings Trust (NEST). The NEST would provide \nbenefits similar to those of a 401(k) pension plan and would be simple \nto create and operate.\n\n  My Administration has endorsed other improvements that make existing \npension plans safer and more beneficial for business owners and \nemployees alike. For example, we have proposed to eliminate the \n``family aggregation'' restrictions on pensions for family members, so \nthat spouses or children who work in the same or related businesses can \nearn their own retirement benefits.\n  Our 1993 economic plan made 90 percent of small businesses eligible \nfor tax relief. It established a targeted tax preference for capital \ngains, reduced the record-keeping requirements for the meals and \nentertainment deduction, and raised the small business expensing limit \nfor equipment by 75 percent, to $17,500. We have proposed to increase \nfurther the value of equipment that can be directly expensed to \n$25,000.\n  My Administration is also taking steps to ensure that tax regulations \nare as simple and understandable as possible. For example, \nadministrative guidance has been published to provide tax relief to S \ncorporations and partnerships, simplify depreciation computations, and \nease inventory capitalization for small businesses.\n  We are pursuing tax form simplification through our Simplified Tax \nand Wage Reporting System (STAWRS). This joint effort among Federal and \nState agencies will simplify, unify, and streamline tax reporting so \nthat taxpayers will eventually be able to file their State and Federal \ntax and wage returns at one location, electronically. All these efforts \nwill bring tax reporting into the modern age while reducing the \npaperwork burden for small business.\n\n\n             SHRINKING THE REGULATORY AND PAPERWORK BURDEN\n\n  Regulation and paperwork continue to be a key concern of America's \nsmall business owners, and I am proud of the progress my Administration \nhas made in addressing this concern. For example, the SBA is \nstreamlining all its regulations and converting them to plain English. \nAn application form for the most common SBA loans used to be an inch \nthick and take 5 to 6 weeks to approve. We've reduced the form to one \npage and cut turn-around time to 3 days.\n  I've said it before: the era of big Government is over. We have been \nworking hard to give the American people a Government that works better \nand costs less. We are eliminating 16,000 pages of unnecessary \nregulations and streamlining 31,000 more--shifting decision-making out \nof Washington and back to States and local communities. In addition, we \nare directing Federal agencies, where possible, to cut by half the \nfrequency of reports the public is required to provide to the \nGovernment.\n  More broadly, much of our National Performance Review effort to \nreinvent Government has been pointed specifically at helping small \nbusiness. The U.S. Business Advisor, which provides Internet access to \ninformation from all Federal agencies, and the U.S. General Store for \nSmall Business, which offers business owners one location for dealing \nwith the Federal Government, illustrate our commitment to reinventing \nhow Government serves the small business community.\n  In March 1995, I announced a new approach to lessening the regulatory \nburden on small firms. Under this commonsense approach, small \nbusinesses can now avoid paying penalties for violations if they \ncorrect the problem within an appropriate period of time. And for those \nviolations that may take\n\n[[Page S5854]]\n\nlonger to correct, a small business may get up to 100 percent of its \nfine waived if that same money is used to correct the violation.\n  I'm proud to have succeeded in putting more teeth in the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act (RFA). Under the 1980 Act, Federal Government agencies \nmust analyze their proposed regulations for their effects on small \nfirms--and revise them if they will create an unfair burden. In the \npast, however, because the agencies' analyses could not be reviewed in \nthe courts, small businesses had no meaningful recourse if an agency \nmade a poor decision. On March 29, I signed into law the Small Business \nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, which allows for judicial \nreview of Federal agency RFA analyses. The Act also emphasizes \ncompliance assistance and requires agencies to provide small businesses \nwith simple and clear guidelines to assist them in complying with the \nregulations that affect them.\n\n  As small business owners have told us, they care about environmental \nprotection and occupational safety; after all, they drink the same \nwater, breathe the same air, and share the same workplace hazards as \neveryone else. My Administration has challenged small businesses and \nregulatory agencies to find cheaper, more efficient ways than \ngovernment regulation to meet the high environmental and workplace \nstandards Americans want.\n\n\n                  opening markets and expanding trade\n\n  Every year the Federal Government spends $200 billion on goods and \nservices, and small businesses receive a substantial share of that \nmarket. I am committed to expanding further the opportunities for small \nbusinesses to win Federal contracts. I fought for the Federal \nAcquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 and the Federal Acquisition Reform \nAct of 1996, which have simplified the procurement process and made it \neasier for small firms to do business with the Federal Government.\n  The 1994 law also created a new Government-wide electronic commerce \nsystem, FACNET, which will eventually permit electronic submission of \nbids and proposals. I encourage small businesses to take advantage of \nthese new procurement procedures to provide more goods and services to \nthe Government.\n  In addition to the Federal marketplace, foreign markets offer \nsignificant opportunities for small business owners to compete and win. \nWhile the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) are opening markets abroad, my \nAdministration's National Export Strategy had made it easier here at \nhome for small businesses to export. Among other things, we've opened \n14 U.S. Export Assistance Centers to provide one-stop access to export \ninformation, marketing assistance, and finance.\n\n\n                       technology and innovation\n\n  Technological innovation by small firms is a major reason for \nAmerica's leadership in the world economy. Through the Small Business \nInnovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs, \nthe Federal Government taps into the brain power of small businesses to \nmeet its own research needs. In the process, these programs help spur \ntechnological innovation to foster new businesses and jobs.\n  The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program alone has \nnearly doubled awards to small businesses during my Administration--up \nfrom $508 in 1992 to more than $900 million in 1995. And the quality of \nSBIR research proposals has kept pace with the program's expansion.\n  We've also dramatically expanded the Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership to help America's 380,000 smaller manufacturers become more \ncompetitive in world markets. Sixty locally managed manufacturing \nextension centers--up from seven in 1993--are delivering much-needed \nservices to this important small business sector.\n  As this report documents, changes are coming at lightning speed. \nSmall business owners recognize that they will need all the \ntechnological skill and ``connectivity'' they can muster just to keep \nup. Through manufacturing extension centers, FACNET, the U.S. Business \nAdvisor, and other information networks, we can help make available the \ninformation small businesses need to start up and succeed.\n\n\n                            the human factor\n\n  If the heart of our entrepreneurial economy is small business, then \nthe heart of small business is its people--small business owners and \ntheir employees. We need to work with small businesses to strengthen \nand support this dynamic human resource.\n  We've seen what business growth can do for communities, and we hope \nto encourage more business formation in empowerment zones and \nenterprise communities: legislation before the Congress would provide \nmore tax incentives and waivers of some regulatory requirements in \nthese areas. SBA's one-stop capital shops specifically target \nempowerment zones and enterprise communities.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we're taking steps to modify the tax code in \nways that will make it easier for small businesses to offer health care \nand retirement plans to their employees. We also want to make sure that \nworkers and their families can keep their health insurance even when \nthey change jobs. I have urged the Congress to enact the Kassebaum-\nKennedy bill, which would make health insurance coverage more \n``portable'' for our Nation's workers.\n  We want to make better use of our work force training dollars by \nconsolidating and streamlining many of our Federal work force training \nprograms. Under our proposal, States and localities would have more \nflexibility to administer these programs in the way that will do the \nmost good for our workers and small business owners.\n  I'm pleased that young entrepreneurs were represented at the White \nHouse Conference on Small Business and that the conference looked to \nour economic future by endorsing more mentorships and workplace \neducational opportunities for young people. These private-sector-led \nefforts form an essential part of the work-based learning program I \nenvisioned when I signed into law the School-to-Work Opportunities Act \nof 1994.\n  It takes a great deal of courage to start something new, to carve a \nreality out of a dream, often with few resources, sometimes in adverse \nsurroundings, and in an economy that demands much of its participants. \nThat is why we celebrate and listen to America's small business owners \nand why we will continue to look for ways to nurture and support this \npowerful economic engine--the small business sector.\n                                                    William J.

A bill to require that 401(k)-type pension plans be subject \nto the same prohibited transaction rules that apply to traditional \ndefined benefit pension plans; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n               THE 401(k) PENSION PROTECTION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I introduced a bill to protect \nAmerica's 401(k) retirement savings.\n  Mr. President, this bill is designed to close a major, unintended \nloophole in Federal pension law, a loophole that jeapordizes 401(k) \npension plans.\n  The legal protections afforded traditional pension plans are not \napplied equally to 401(k) pension plans. Traditional pension plans, \nknown as defined benefit pension plans, may not invest more than 10 \npercent of their assets in securities and real property of the \ncorporation they work for. Federal law further requires that all \ntraditional pension plans investments be diversified. This protection \ndoes not uniformly apply to 401(k) plans.\n  This increases the investment risk to 401(k) plans. This Increased \ninvestment risk is borne totally by 401(k) plan members, not by the \ncompanies sponsoring the 401(k) plans.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, 401(k) plans do not have Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation insurance, as do traditional pension plans, in the \nevent the employer corporation goes bankrupt. So the protections of \ndiversity become even more urgent.\n  The protections for traditional plans were wisely put in Federal law \nwhen the Pension Reform Act, known as ERISA, was adopted in 1974. The \nlimitations were designed to prevent the recurrence of the many pension \nscandals that predated the passage of ERISA, scandals in which \nemployers used their employees' pension plans as the company piggy-\nbank. Scandals in which the sponsoring company went bankrupt and the \nemployees lost not only their jobs, but their pensions.\n  Unfortunately, these protections do not apply to 401(k) plans. That \nis an unintended consequence, a quirk of history.\n  When ERISA was passed, there was no section 401(k). 401(k) was added \n4 years later, in 1978, to a section of ERISA governing profit sharing \nplans, not pension plans. At the time no one thought 401(k) plans would \nbe any more than small supplemental, profit-sharing plans.\n  At the time, no one predicted that 401(k) plans would become the \npredominant form of pension plan. Consequently, no one thought to \nprotect them as ERISA protected pension plans. Consequently, Federal \nlaw permitted 401(k) plans to invest more than 10 percent of their \nassets in the employer sponsoring the 401(k)plan. In fact, 401(k) plans \nare permitted to invest all of their assets in the sponsoring company.\n  That was hardly noticed when 401(k) was added in 1978; 401(k) plans \nwere tiny--thought of as profit sharing plans. But today, the \ninvestment loophole represents a danger to the retirement security of \nAmericans. It is a danger to the 23 million Americans who belong to \n401(k) plans. It is a danger to the 675 billion dollars that these \nAmericans have saved in their 401(k) plans.\n  Today's Wall Street Journal reports just how dangerous it is. The \nJournal today describes the plight of thousands of employees of Color \nTile, Inc. Until January, Color Tile was a major name in retailing, \noperating 774 stores in 48 States, coast-to-coast. There were 62 stores \nin my State of California alone.\n\n  Suddenly in January, Color Tile went into bankruptcy; 234 stores were \nclosed. Hundreds of employees lost their jobs, many with only 30 \nminutes notice. The jobs of thousands more are at risk. Unfortunately, \nso are their pensions.\n  Color Tile employees were shocked to learn after the bankruptcy that \nnearly 85 percent of Color Tile's 401(k) assets were Color Tile stores. \nThe 401(k) plan owned 44 stores leased to Color Tile. As a result of \nthe bankruptcy, Color Tile broke many of the leases on stores owned by \nits employees' 401(k) plan. Moreover, the 401(k) plan borrowed to build \nmany of the stores. Those mortgage-loan payments to the plan's banks \nstill have to be paid, but, because Color Tile repudiated many of the \nleases, rent payments to pay bank loans are no longer available. As a \nresult, the plan told shocked workers last month, that it isn't ``clear \nthat the plan has sufficient cash to pay the bills, including mortgage \npayments.''\n  For Color Tile employees, things could not be much worse. Color \nTile's only pension plan is the 401(k) plan. The employees are facing, \nnot only the loss of their jobs, but their pension savings.\n  This would not be possible if 401(k) plans were protected by the \nrules that protect traditional pension plans. If my bill had been law, \nColor Tile's pension plan would not be in jeopardy.\n  My bill would simply apply the same pension protections to all \nplans--401(k) and traditional pension plans--that deliver retirement \nsecurity. For the first time, 401(k) plans would have the same 10 \npercent conflict-of-interest limitations on investments with the \nsponsoring company that have always applied to traditional pension \nplans. It would be illegal to do what Color Tile did to its employees.\n  It would be illegal for a company to borrow more than 10 percent of \nits employees 401(k) plan assets--as the company slides into \nbankruptcy. That's exactly what happened to the employees of Metacor, \nInc., of Deerfield Beach, FL. In the 24 months before Metacor filed for \nbankruptcy, the company used its employees 401(k) plan as a piggy bank. \nThe 401(k) plans made 34 separate loans to Metacor in those 24 months, \nuntil nothing was left to loan. Most people believe that was made \nillegal in 1974 when Congress passed the Pension Reform Act. They are \nmisinformed. Unfortunately, we exempted 401(k) plans. My bill would \nclose that loophole.\n\n  The only plans exempted under my bill would be plans designed as true \nprofitsharing plans, stock bonus, or stock option plans--plans not \ndesigned specifically for retirement.\n  My bill also exempts employee-directed 401(k) plans, because \nemployees should be able to waive the 10-percent limitations if they \nwant to. It's their money.\n  My bill would have protected not only the employees of the 62 Color \nTile stores in my State--8 in Orange County alone--but the employees of \nColor Tile stores everywhere. Had this bill been law, the employees of \nthe 12 stores shut down in Illinois, the 5 stores shut in Wisconsin, \nthe 4 stores shut in Virginia, the 3 stores shut in Michigan, the \nstores shut in Texas, Oregon, and Minnesota would not be worried today \nabout losing their 401(k) pension plan assets.\n  Remember many have already lost their jobs, now many are losing their \npensions too.\n  The employees of stores shut in my State, California, in Visalia and \nSan Diego, would not be worried about their 401(k) plan.\n  Mr. President, I hope my two colleagues--the Senators from the State \nof Mississippi--are listening. One of you may soon be the majority \nleader and in a position to greatly help the passage of this bill.\n  I say to both of them: you can remember the 225 former employees of \nthe Cleveland, MS, Color Tile factory. You can help assure the \nunfolding tragedy of the Color Tile 401(k) plan will not happen again. \nYou can help pass this bill. I will work with you.\n  Here is a picture of 12 of those Mississippi employees. This picture \nwas taken at the front gate of the factory after it was closed in \nFebruary. This picture is America. Unfortunately, it says that America \nneeds better protections for 401(k)'s.\n  This is Dorsey Kelsey, 57 years old. Dorsey worked at the plant 18 \nand a half years, as a janitor. Her husband is Robert Kelley. Robert \nworked at the plant for over 20 years. Between them, Robert and Dorsey \nhad $20,000 in the 401(k) plan. $20,000 that Robert needs, but can't \nget access to, if he ever will. Robert and Dorsey are why we need this \nbill.\n  This is Woodrow ``Moose'' Issacs, 57, also of Cleveland, MS. Moose \nwas a maintenance mechanic and worked at the plant for 38 years. His \nlast statement from the 401(k) plan, as of September 30, 1995, showed \nhe had $57,900 in the plan. A good deal of that money he may never see.\n  Raymonda Almond, 53, of Boyle, MS was in outside sales. She worked \nfor the plant for 9 years and saved $17,000.\n\n[[Page S5858]]\n\n She planned on using the money to supplement her Social Security when \nshe retired. Now she needs it to live on, but cannot get access to it. \nSome of it she possibly never will see.\n  She will just have to make do with Social Security.\n  Paul Locke, 24 years old, worked at the plant for 3\\1/2\\ years. He \nwas a full-time student at Delta State University and worked full time \nat Color Tile. He saved $4,000, money that he was going to use as a \ndown payment on a house when he graduated. That house will probably \nhave to wait.\n  I could list the other seven former Color Tile employees in this \npicture, some holding their children, some holding grandchildren. \nSuffice to say that collectively this picture represents $199,900 in \nsavings in the 401(k) plan. Saved through years of work at Color Tile. \nMoney that is at risk because the Federal Government is not adequately \nprotecting 401(k) plans.\n\n  Mr. President this picture says more than I could ever say about why \nwe need this bill. I ask all my colleagues to join me in protecting \n401(k) pension plans--just as well as we protect traditional pension \nplans.\n  It is time to close an unintended and unforeseen loophole in ERISA. \nIt is time to apply the 10-percent limitations on conflict-of-interest \ninvestments to 401(k) plans. Let us protect 401(k) members just as we \nprotect the members of traditional pension plans.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. FAIRCLOTH (for himself and Mr. Helms):\n  S. 1838. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and \nissue coins in commemoration of the centennial anniversary of the first \nmanned flight of Orville and Wilbur Wright in Kitty Hawk, NC, on \nDecember 17 1903; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n                the first flight commemorative coin act\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by my colleague \nfrom North Carolina, Senator Helms, to introduce the First Flight \nCommemorative Coin Act. This revenue-neutral legislation instructs the \nTreasury Secretary to mint coins in commemoration of the Wright \nBrothers' historic 1903 flight on the North Carolina coast.\n  Mr. President, in the cold morning hours of December 17, 1903, a \nsmall crowd watched the Wright flyer lift off the flat landscape of \nKitty Hawk. Orville Wright traveled just 120 feet--less than the \nwingspan of a Boeing 747--in his 12-second flight. It was, however, the \nfirst time that a manned machine sailed into the air under its own \npower.\n  The residents of Kitty Hawk, then an isolated fishing village, thus \nbore witness to the realization of the centuries-old dream of flight.\n  The significance of the Wright Brothers' flight reaches far beyond \nits status as the first flight. There flight represented the birth of \naviation. On that morning, aeronautics moved from untested theory to \nnascent science, and it triggered a remarkable technological evolution.\n  In fact, just 24 years after their fragile craft rose unsteadily and \ntook to the air, Charles Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic Ocean. In 1947, \nless than half a century after the pioneer 31 mph flight over Kitty \nHawk, Chuck Yeager shattered the sound barrier over the Mojave Desert.\n  The rapid aeronautical progression, which the Wright Brothers \ninitiated on that December morning in Kitty Hawk, is, of course, \nremarkable. Mr. President, it was just 66 years after the Wright \nBrothers' 120-foot flight--a timespan equivalent to the age of many \nMembers of this body--that Neil Armstrong traveled 240,000 miles to \nplant the American flag on the Moon.\n  Today, some 86,000 planes lift off from American airports on a daily \nbasis, and air travel is routine. It was with a sprinkling of \nonlookers, however, that the Wright Brothers ushered in the age of \nflight on that cold winter morning in Kitty Hawk.\n  The site of the first flight, at the foot of Kill Devil Hill, was \ninitially designated as a national memorial in 1927 and is visited by \nclose to a half-million people each year.\n  I think that First Flight Commemorative Coin Act is a most \nappropriate tribute to the Wright Brothers as the centennial \nanniversary of the first flight approaches. The coin will be minted in \n$10, $1, and 50 cents denominations, and its sales will fund \neducational programs and improvements to the visitor center at the \nmemorial.\n  These commemorative coins are struck to celebrate important \nhistorical events, and, of course, the proceeds are an important \nrevenue source to the custodians of these legacies. The centennial \nanniversary of the Wright Brothers' flight merits our observance.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues for their support, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1838\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1997 to \nthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration for human space \nflight; science, aeronautics, and technology; mission support; and \ninspector general; and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n            the nasa authorization act for fiscal year 1997\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today, as chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Space, I introduced the NASA \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 1997. The bill is cosponsored by the \nchairman of our Space Subcommittee, Senator Conrad Burns, who has \nprovided the committee with great leadership and direction on space \npolicy matters.\n  In the past, the main challenges NASA faced were technological. \nToday, NASA faces a new set of challenges which are mainly budgetary, \nbut they are no less daunting than the Apollo missions to the Moon. To \nthe credit of Administrator Dan Goldin, rather than complain about the \ncurrent budget challenge faced by the Federal Government, he has faced \nthem head on. Last year, he developed an ambitious budget-cutting plan \nto reduce his agency's budget by more than $5 billion over the next 5 \nyears. Under the plan, NASA funding would drop from its current level \nof $13.9 billion to $11.6 billion by the year 2000.\n  To date, NASA has not revealed precisely how it will make these cuts \nwhile at the same time fulfilling its commitment to its major ongoing \nprograms--including multibillion-dollar initiatives like space station \nand Mission to Planet Earth. There is a growing sense NASA's budget is \nalready cut to the bone and further cuts by Congress might prevent the \nagency from realizing its bold visions in space science and \nexploration. With that in mind, my bill is aimed at providing NASA \nsufficient funding authority to continue the missions and programs that \nhave inspired our Nation and the world.\n  Mr. President, my bill authorizes $13.7 billion in fiscal year 1997 \nto support a diverse and forward-looking space program to move NASA \ninto the 21st century. It authorizes all of NASA's major current \nprograms such as Mission to Planet Earth, space station, space science, \nand aeronautics and, in almost all cases, at their requested funding \nlevels. It also continues funding for the new Reusable Launch Vehicle \nProgram aimed at providing private industry the technology to \neventually build a shuttle replacement. The bill contains an \nauthorization for NASA's new radar satellite program which is so \ncritical to U.S. leadership in space science and our competitiveness in \nthe growing satellite remote sensing market.\n  Mr. President, let me make special mention of certain portions of the \nbill.\n  I believe Mission to Planet Earth may be NASA's most important and \nrelevant program. The satellite data from Mission to Planet Earth will \ndeliver direct benefits to the taxpayer in contrast to the speculative \nspinoffs promised by other space activities. For this reason, the bill \nfully funds this activity at the requested level of $1.4 billion.\n  Using the latest satellite technology, Mission to Planet Earth will \nhelp researchers understand and predict the global climate trends that \naffect our lives. As a Senator representing an agricultural State, I \nhave a keen interest in this program's potential to provide detailed \ndata on soil conditions, topography, crops, and other information \ncritical to the farming and ranching community. I also take great pride \nin the selection of the EROS Data Center in Sioux Falls, SD as one of \nthe regional data centers that will collect and distribute this \nsatellite data.\n  I am very concerned that, under the new budget constraints in which \nwe find ourselves, some may seek to sacrifice Mission to Planet Earth, \nand space science in general, to fund space station. That would be a \ndisservice to the Nation and I will oppose any such move strongly.\n  I am pleased with the direction of the baseline plan for the Mission \nto Planet Earth Program and am concerned about the possibility of NASA \ntaking any imprudent and unnecessary efforts to restructure the \nprogram. Accordingly, the bill specifically prohibits NASA from \nchanging the program unless, 60 days before such action, NASA has \nreported to Congress on the nature and overall impact of the planned \nchanges.\n  The bill also provides the full $2.1 billion requested funding for \nspace station. However, this authorization should not be interpreted as \na ringing endorsement of that program. I am a longstanding support of \nthe program, but, in recent years, I have become concerned that it has \nbecome too expensive, too complex, and too dependent on the \ncontributions of Russia, the latest station partner.\n  In a June 1995 report, the General Accounting Office [GAO] estimated \nthat the total cost of the design, launch, and operation of the space \nstation will be $94 billion. That is almost seven times the entire \nannual budget for NASA. Given the history of past missions, it is fair \nto assume that $94 billion price tag for the program will increase over \ntime. If that happens, we may wake up to find the enormous space \nstation budget has crowded out every other NASA program to become \nNASA's only mission. Because of my reservations about space station, I \nmay well reconsider my support in the future. But, for now, with the \nstart of the space station assembly only 1 year away, I am supporting \nfull funding in fiscal year 1997 for the space station effort.\n\n  The bill also authorizes NASA's Reusable Launch Vehicle Program, \nwhich will support the X-33 and X-34 activities to pave the way for the \nlater development by private enterprise of a replacement for the \nshuttle in the next decade. Employing 1970's technologies and costing \n$400 million per flight, the shuttle may have outlived its usefulness. \nHowever, within today's budget constraints, the Government cannot \nafford to foot the entire bill for a new multibillion dollar spacecraft \ndevelopment program. That is why the Reusable Launch Vehicle Program, \nwith its emphasis on sharing financing with industry and its goal of \nmoving our national space transportation system toward privatization, \nseems a viable concept worth pursuing.\n  The bill also authorizes $35 million for NASA feasibility studies and \nsubsequent development and operations work for a new radar satellite \nprogram. Earlier this year, at the urging of the Commerce Committee and \nthe Congress, NASA announced its commitment to study the feasibility of \ndeveloping a new civilian radar satellite with scientific applications. \nBecause radar satellites have the ability to see through cloud cover, \nthey will dramatically enhance the capability of the Nation's existing \noptical-based satellite\n\n[[Page S5860]]\n\nsystems such as Landsat. With Japan, Europe, and Canada already \noperating radar satellite systems, and with Canada poised to deploy one \nlater this year, the United States cannot afford to be left behind in \nthis critical technology.\n  In my role as chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation, it has become apparent to me that small-city, rural \nStates like my home State of South Dakota are often forgotten in our \nvast $70-billion Federal science and technology enterprise. That part \nof America wants and deserves to be part of the technological \nrevolution. More importantly, it wants to contribute. It is in the \nnational interest to strengthen the scientific talent, resources, and \ninfrastructure in our rural States through appropriate research, \neducation, and outreach activities. The bill attempts to accomplish \nthis in several ways. It increases funding for the Experimental Program \nTo Stimulate Competitive Research [EPSCoR] from its current level of \n$4.9 million to $10 million. NASA's EPSCoR Program, was well as similar \nprograms in six other science agencies, have been instrumental in \nproviding Federal funding for academic research in rural States. My \nbill also funds the efforts of two separate university-led consortia \nformed to process Mission to Planet Earth satellite date into useful \ninformation for the farming and research communities in the Upper \nPlains States region.\n  Finally, Mr. President, my bill urges NASA to consider the use of \nunderutilized military and other Federal Government facilities before \ncommitting to new leases of the construction of new facilities to \nfulfill agency requirements. With the end of the cold war and the \ndrawdown of our military infrastructure, we have many facilities and \nproperty that are unused or woefully underutilized. In my home State of \nSouth Dakota, I can cite the Ellsworth Air Force Base as an example, \nbut every Member in the Senate can no doubt identify an underutilized \nmilitary facility in his or her State that might be put to some cost-\neffective use in our U.S. space program. I strongly believe that NASA \nshould start taking a serious look at using some of these valuable \nassets and properties that have served as the foundation of our \nnational defense before making huge financial commitments to new leases \nor facilities. My bill would simply require NASA to engage in this kind \nof review as a matter of agency policy.\n  Mr. President, I believe NASA is up to the challenge of keeping \nAmerica preeminent in aeronautics and space despite the intense budget \npressure and despite the increasing competition from other spacefaring \nnations. I am convinced this authorization bill provides NASA with the \nsupport it needs to meet that challenge.\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the \nNASA authorization bill for fiscal year 1997, introduced by Senator \nPressler, the chairman of our Commerce Committee. Let me take this \nopportunity to thank Senator Pressler for crafting a bill which \nprovides the funding NASA will need to complete billion-dollar missions \nlike space station and Mission to Planet Earth on schedule and prepare \nfor the next century.\n  As chairman of the Science, Technology, and Space Subcommittee, I \nhave concerns about NASA's cost-cutting plan to reduce its budget by $5 \nbillion over 5 years and cut its spending to $11.6 billion by the year \n2000. The goals and missions of our space agency must be balanced \nwithin fiscal responsibility. This legislation authorizes $13.7 billion \nfor NASA in fiscal year 1997. This level, slightly less than the $13.8 \nbillion budget request, will allow NASA to continue all of its major \nongoing aeronautics and space programs, including Mission to Planet \nEarth, space station aeronautics research, and space science and \nexploration.\n  The bill authorizes the full $1.4 billion requested by NASA for its \nMission to Planet Earth. This program has come a long way in recent \nyears. Originally, it was misperceived as being exclusively focused on \nglobal warming and developing justifications for caps and timetables on \nindustry emissions. Now we realize it is much broader than that. From \nseveral oversight hearings before the Science Subcommittee, we now know \nit is really about using satellite technology to help farmers predict \nweather on a year-to-year basis and measure soil moisture using a desk-\ntop computer. It is about giving land planners, mappers, and foresters \na cost-effective tool to help them do their work. It is about mineral \nexploration and archaeology. In short, Mission to Planet Earth is about \nusing NASA's satellites to help average citizens in their everyday \nactivities. At the University of Montana and other institutions in the \nPlains States, our researchers are already eager to gather data from \nthe program so they can start developing useful applications for the \ncommunity. It is time to proceed with carrying out the sound baseline \nplan for the program and not get sidetracked by calls for delays, \ncutbacks, and unnecessary studies from vocal opponents of this \nimportant initiative. The bill's full funding for Mission to Planet \nEarth should help the program go forward.\n  The bill also provides $2.1 billion for the space station account and \nrelated activities. After more than a decade of planning and hard work, \nthe United States and its foreign partners will finally start the \nassembly of the mammoth orbiting laboratory late next year. Let me \nfirst say that I wholeheartedly support the space station. I believe \nthe space station represents the next logical step in our manned space \nexploration program. If successful, this program will demonstrate what \ngreat nations can do when combining their talent and resources for \npeaceful scientific purposes. Beyond that, the space station will help \nour Nation maintain and strengthen its traditional leadership in \naeronautics and space. While I continue to have some concerns about the \nheavy reliance of the current space station plan on Russian \nparticipation, I am optimistic that space station will successfully \nproceed within budget and on schedule.\n  I believe that NASA's aeronautics research program is one of the main \nreasons for our Nation's preeminence in aerospace. Aeronautics is the \nfirst A in NASA. Yet, for many years, aeronautics seemed to be reduced \nto a small A status. It always seemed to take a back seat to the higher \nprofile space missions. However, under Dan Goldin's leadership, that is \nbeginning to change and NASA is giving aeronautics the backing it \ndeserves. For instance, the High Speed Research Program is developing \nprecompetitive technologies in support of supersonic aircraft. It is \nestimated that the first country to market such an aircraft stands to \ngain $200 billion in sales and 140,000 new jobs. Similarly, the \nAdvanced Subsonic Technology Program funds research in support of \nsubsonic airplanes--a market that generates 1 million jobs and \ncontributes over $25 billion annually to the U.S. trade balance. These \nprograms are moneymakers and it is in the national interest to give \nthem whatever support they need. Accordingly, our NASA bill authorizes \naeronautics research at the requested level of $858 million.\n  Our bill also provides authorization for NASA's successful collection \nof technology transfer, education, and outreach activities. These \nprograms have been very effective in allowing our quality research \ninstitutions in rural States and regions to contribute to the \ntechnological revolution. For instance, last May, our Science \nSubcommittee heard from Professor Steve Running of the University of \nMontana about his promising research in the use of remote sensing \nsatellite data in forest and crop management. Our rural States can make \nan enormous contribution to the civilian space program if only given \nthe chance.\n  In that connection, the bill provides $10 million for the \nExperimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research [EPSCoR] \nProgram--an increase of $5.5 million over the requested level of $4.5 \nmillion. This authorized increase reflects the important role that \nNASA's EPSCoR, as well as its counterparts at other Federal science \nagencies, has played in supporting vital academic research in rural \nStates like Montana. The bill also includes sufficient funding to \nenable NASA to continue support for a new Rural Teacher Resource Center \nand a new Rural Technology Transfer and Commercialization Center to \nserve the Upper Plains States region. NASA made commitments to those \nnew centers this year to fill in coverage gaps in NASA's outreach \nprograms.\n\n[[Page S5861]]\n\n  Full funding is also provided for ongoing technology programs to keep \nNASA on the cutting edge. The bill supports the Reusable Launch Vehicle \nProgram aimed at developing, and flight testing, new technologies to \nreduce the cost of access to space and eventually lay the foundation \nfor a Shuttle replacement. In addition, there is funding to continue \nNASA's commitment to a new radar satellite program. Unlike conventional \nsatellites, radar satellites are unaffected by cloud cover or \nnightfall. Now that Canada, Japan, and Europe have operational systems, \nit is clearly in the national interest for this country to develop that \ncapability for civilian purposes as soon as practicable.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I note that the bill contains buyout \nprovisions that we worked out with NASA that are intended to reduce the \nneed for the agency to resort to reductions in force to downsize its \nwork force. We recognize the need for NASA to reduce its 25,000-person \nwork force to meet its budget targets. However, such personnel \nreductions need to be implemented in a gradual and thoughtful manner, \nwith proper consideration for the personnel affected. It is with that \nin mind that we have provided the buyout authority in the bill to \nencourage voluntary separations in support of NASA's downsizing effort.\n  Mr. President and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation \nwhen it is considered by the full Senate later this year.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PRESSLER (for himself, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Hollings, Mr. \n        Bryan, and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1840. A bill to amend the Federal Trade Commission Act to \nauthorize appropriations for the Federal Trade Commission; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n        the federal trade commission reauthorization act of 1996\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation, I am pleased to introduce, along \nwith Senators Gorton, Hollings, and Bryan, the Federal Trade Commission \nReauthorization Act of 1996. This bill reauthorizes the Federal Trade \nCommission [FTC] for 2 years with funding sufficient to maintain \ncurrent staffing levels.\n  Congress last reauthorized the FTC in 1994. That authorization was \nthe Commission's first since 1980. In that reauthorization legislation \nwe significantly modified the Federal Trade Commission Act. At present, \nwe see no need to further modify the FTC's authorizing statutes. \nTherefore, this is an extremely simple piece of legislation. It \nauthorizes funding for the FTC of $107 million for fiscal year 1997 and \n$111 million for fiscal year 1998. As I mentioned earlier, these \nauthorization levels would simply maintain the existing staffing level \nof 979 FTE's.\n  The Federal Trade Commission is a law enforcement agency. The \nCommission's primary authority is derived from section 5 of the Federal \nTrade Commission Act through the declaration that ``unfair methods of \ncompetition * * * and unfair or deceptive acts or practices'' are \nunlawful. The FTC's dual mission is to enforce Federal consumer \nprotection laws and antitrust and competition laws. The FTC has \nenforcement and administrative duties under 37 separate acts.\n  The Commerce Committee held a hearing on the FTC on May 7, 1996. We \nare pleased with the general direction of the Commission. Under the \nleadership of Chairman Pitofsky, and his predecessor, Chairman Steiger, \nthe Commission has established a solid performance record.\n  No comprehensive controversy surrounds the FTC today as it did in the \nlate 1970's and early 1980's. As one would expect of a law enforcement \nentity acting in complex and, often, uncertain situations, individual \nCommission actions are sometimes not met with universal approval. \nNevertheless, there is a general consensus that the Commission is \nfunctioning efficiently and effectively.\n  The FTC fulfills its mission with minimal burden on taxpayers because \nit generates over half its annual operating budget through fees from \nthe corporations it regulates.\n  I hope the Senate will join Senators Gorton, Hollings, Bryan, and \nmyself in supporting this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1840\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Trade Commission \n     Reauthorization Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION.\n\n       Section 25 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. \n     57c) is amended by striking ``and not to exceed'' and \n     inserting ``not to exceed'' and by inserting before the \n     period the following: ``; not to exceed $107,000,000 for \n     fiscal year 1997; and not to exceed $111,000,000 for fiscal \n     year 1998''.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (by request):\n  S. 1841. A bill to reform the Nation's welfare system by requiring \nwork and demanding personal responsibility; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n         The Work First and Personal Responsibility Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, at the request of the administration, I \nrise to introduce the Work First and Personal Responsibility Act of \n1996. This was sent to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of \nthe House of Representatives on April 26, 1996, by Alice M. Rivlin, \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget.\n  I do not support this bill, and will indeed oppose it with great \nconviction. All the same, the President is entitled to the courtesy of \nhaving his bills introduced, printed, and referred to the appropriate \ncommittee. This particular bill will be referred to the Finance \nCommittee, of which I am the ranking Democratic member. Hence this \nsimple duty falls to me.\n  I have a further purpose in introducing this bill. As Senators know, \nit is the fixed practice of the Office of Management and Budget to \nrequire a report from the appropriate Department or Departments on the \nimpact an administration measure would have on the area of concern. \nSuch a report is required of legislation passed by Congress and \npresented to the President for approval. Last October 24, 1995, at the \nfirst--and only--meeting of the House-Senate conference on H.R. 4, the \nHouse-passed Personal Responsibility Act and the Senate-passed Work \nOpportunity Act, I stated that ``when fully implemented the time limits \nin the House bill would cut off benefits for 4,800,000 children.'' This \nwas not a complicated calculation. There are this many children \nreceiving benefits, that many who can expect to receive benefits for \nmore than 5 years, and so forth. The mean stay on AFDC is 12.9 years. I \nconcluded my statement calling on the White House to release a report \non the Senate-passed bill which had been prepared by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services.\n\n  Three days later, on October 27, 1995, Elizabeth Shogren in the Los \nAngeles Times reported that the Senate-passed bill, thought to be \nmoderate as compared with the House-passed bill, ``would push an \nestimated 1.1 million children into poverty and make conditions worse \nfor those already under the poverty line * * *''\n  The Senate needs to know what would be the poverty impact of this \nnewest administration proposal. It cannot be much less, or so I would \nthink. Bear in mind that OMB estimates $41 billion in Deficit Reduction \nfrom fiscal year 1996 through 2002.\n  I await an early reply from the administration. There has been more \nthan sufficient time to make the calculations. One may be sure that if \nthere were any prospect that the bill would reduce the number of \nchildren in poverty, we would have learned this by now.\n  The problem of understanding within the administration and the \nCongress, or so it appears to me, is that there is simply too little \ngrasp of just how bad conditions are among America's children. None of \nus is without responsibility for this. Some protecting the good name of \nthe poor; others assuming knowledge about behavior and behavioral \nchange. Too few following Hippocrates' dictum: Primum non noncere. \nFirst do no harm. But it is not too late, if only we will look at the \nfacts.\n  Two weeks ago, my revered colleague, Representative Sam M. Gibbons \nand I requested of the Office of Management and Budget an analysis of \nS.\n\n[[Page S5862]]\n\n1795, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996, \nwhich is the latest Republican welfare reform bill. The poverty impact. \nToday I am also requesting an analysis of the poverty effects of the \nPresident's latest proposal. This will be critical for Members to \nbetter understand the potential effects on children of both pieces of \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill and the letter of \ntransmittal from Dr. Alice M. Rivlin, Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Title-by-Title Summary\n\n\n                     title i--work-based assistance\n\n       Title I repeals the Aid to Families with Dependent Children \n     (AFDC) program and replaces it with a time-limited, work-\n     based Temporary Employment Assistance (TEA) program. TEA \n     continues open-ended Federal matching payments for State \n     expenditures on welfare assistance. It also repeals the Job \n     Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS) program and replaces it \n     with a new Work First program. (Funding for JOBS, AFDC \n     Administration, and Emergency Assistance is merged into Work \n     First. Most activities under these programs remain allowable \n     under Work First.) Title I requires welfare recipients to \n     sign personal responsibility contracts and mandates that they \n     work or engage in job training within two years of first \n     receiving benefits.\n       Title I also requires States to meet welfare recipient work \n     targets. It includes a five-year time limit on the receipt of \n     cash benefits, but allows States to exempt a portion of the \n     caseload from the time limits. Vouchers must be provided to \n     children in families that lose assistance due to the time \n     limit. In addition, Title I provides performance bonuses to \n     States based on their job placement effectiveness. It also \n     gives States the option to deny additional welfare benefits \n     to families that have another child while receiving welfare \n     benefits.\n       Title I mandates that States operate child abuse prevention \n     and protection, child support enforcement, foster care, and \n     adoption assistance programs as a condition of receiving the \n     Federal match. States also must operate a child care program \n     under the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act \n     of 1990. Title I amends the CCDBG Act and consolidates the \n     three individual child care programs under current title IV-A \n     of the Social Security Act into one program. Funding for \n     child care is significantly increased. This title also \n     continues the one-year entitlement to transitional Medicaid \n     benefits for families losing welfare benefits due to \n     employment or excess income. In addition, it allows States to \n     enter into demonstration programs to make periodic advances \n     of the earned income tax credit (EITC) to welfare recipients \n     in jobs programs (as opposed to having workers file for the \n     EITC themselves).\n\n\n                  title ii--child support enforcement\n\n       Title II proposes stringent child support enforcement \n     measures including a State case registry of child support \n     enforcement orders. It improves paternity establishment and \n     requires employers to report new hires to a central State \n     data base. Title II allows States to revoke drivers and \n     professional licenses for parents who refuse to pay child \n     support. It also removes administrative barriers that impede \n     the enforcement of child support orders.\n\n\n                       title iii--food assistance\n\n       Title III amends the Food Stamp and Child Nutrition \n     programs. It adjusts the maximum Food Stamp allotment to 100 \n     percent of the Thrifty Food Plan and reduces the standard \n     deduction and indexes it to the Consumer Price Index \n     thereafter. Title III also counts all energy assistance as \n     income and includes a work requirement that makes adults age \n     18 to 50 with no dependents ineligible for food stamps after \n     six months of each year unless they work 20 hours a week or \n     participate in workfare or training (although eligibility \n     continues if a State fails to supply a training or workfare \n     slot). It also includes State flexibility measures and new \n     program integrity proposals to reduce Food Stamp trafficking \n     and program waste. Finally, Title III better targets food \n     subsidies for family day care homes and makes other minor \n     changes in Child Nutrition programs.\n\n\n                     title iv--treatment of aliens\n\n       Title IV makes only ``qualified aliens'' eligible for the \n     TEA (formerly AFDC), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and \n     Medicaid programs. In addition, it gives States the option of \n     applying the same eligibility criteria to State funded needs-\n     based assistance. Title IV also lengthens until citizenship \n     the deeming period during which a sponsor's income is \n     presumed available to support a legal permanent resident \n     should he or she apply for SSI, TEA, or Food Stamps. It makes \n     all future affidavits of support legally binding and provides \n     States the option to extend sponsor income deeming to State \n     funded needs-based cash assistance if the immigrant is denied \n     TEA, SSI, or Food Stamps.\n\n\n             title v--supplemental security income reforms\n\n       Title V tightens eligibility standards for disabled \n     children who receive SSI benefits. Children currently on the \n     rolls who are found no longer eligible would not receive \n     benefits as of January 1, 1998. It creates new guidelines for \n     the Social Security Administration to conduct continuing \n     disability reviews (CDRs).\n       Title V also creates a dedicated savings account for SSI-\n     eligible disabled children for education, job training, and \n     equipment or housing modifications related to their \n     disability, and allows this account to be excluded from \n     income and resource determinations. It establishes an \n     installment schedule for paying past-due SSI benefit amounts, \n     and authorizes the Commissioner of Social Security to reduce \n     Social Security (OASDI) benefits by the amount of overpayment \n     of SSI benefits without an OASDI beneficiary's consent.\n       Title V also denies SSI eligibility if drug addiction or \n     alcoholism is the basis for the disability determination. \n     Current SSI recipients who are eligible on the basis of drug \n     addiction or alcoholism will no longer receive benefits as of \n     January 1, 1997. A portion of the savings from this proposal \n     ($50 million annually during FYs 1997-1998) will be used to \n     fund additional drug (including alcohol) treatment programs \n     and services through the Substance Abuse Prevention and \n     Treatment Block Grant program.\n       Title V also makes individuals convicted in Federal or \n     State court of having fraudulently misrepresented their \n     residence in order to receive welfare benefits from two or \n     more States ineligible to receive SSI for ten years from the \n     date of conviction. It makes fugitive felons ineligible for \n     SSI. In addition, it provides that the appropriation of \n     additional administrative funds to SSA for FYs 1996-2002 for \n     conducting Social Security Disability Insurance and SSI CDRs \n     should trigger an increase, within specified limits, to the \n     discretionary spending caps. The title would also provide \n     authority to increase the discretionary spending caps, within \n     specified limits, upon appropriation of funds for FYs 1996-\n     1997 to the Social Security Administration to implement any \n     changes to the SSI program pursuant to adoption of welfare \n     reform.\n       Title V provides that when private insurance covers the \n     costs of SSI eligible children in medical care facilities, \n     these children will no longer be eligible for their full SSI \n     benefits. Instead, they will only be eligible to receive the \n     same $30 per month standard amount that Medicaid-covered SSI \n     eligible children receive.\n\n\n             title vi--social services block grants (ssbg)\n\n       This title reduces the amount required to be allotted among \n     States for SSBG under Title XX of the Social Security Act \n     from $2.8 billion to $2.73 billion in FY 1996, and to $2.52 \n     billion for each of FYs 1997-2002.\n\n                           Deficit Reduction\n\n       The Office of Management and Budget estimates that the \n     Administration's welfare reform proposal saves $41 billion \n     during FYs 1996 through 2002. This total includes $3 billion \n     in savings resulting from the enactment of P.L. 104-121, \n     which extended the debt limit and modified the Social \n     Security Act, and reflects interactions with Medicaid \n     proposals in the President's FY 1997 Budget.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 1996.\n     Hon. Albert Gore, Jr.,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am enclosing for the consideration of \n     the Congress the Administration's ``Work First and Personal \n     Responsibility Act of 1996,'' a comprehensive proposal to \n     reform the Nation's failed welfare system. The President \n     remains committed to working with the Congress to pass a \n     bipartisan welfare reform bill this year that honors the \n     values of work, responsibility, and family. This proposal \n     will end the current welfare system by requiring work, \n     demanding responsibility, strengthening families, and \n     protecting children.\n       Under this legislative proposal, everyone who can work must \n     go to work, and no one who can work can stay on welfare \n     indefinitely. This proposal replaces Aid to Families with \n     Dependent Children (AFDC) with a time-limited benefit \n     conditioned on work. It imposes tough work requirements and \n     time limits, including a lifetime limit of five years for \n     receipt of welfare benefits. It gives States the means to \n     provide child care that is essential to imposing tough work \n     requirements and moving people from welfare to work. States \n     are given broad new flexibility to tailor welfare reforms to \n     local needs, but are also held accountable for continuing \n     their commitment to move people from welfare to work. The \n     proposal permits adjusting to changing economic circumstances \n     and provides vouchers to meet the most basic needs of \n     children in families whose benefits end.\n       The Work First proposal demands responsibility as well. It \n     includes the toughest child support enforcement measures ever \n     proposed. The proposal requires minor mothers to live at home \n     and stay in school as a condition of receiving assistance and \n     gives States the option to deny additional benefits for \n     additional children born to parents who are on welfare.\n       The proposal achieves significant savings by reforming the \n     Food Stamp and Child Nutrition programs, while preserving the \n     national nutritional safety net. The Congressional Budget \n     Office estimates that these reforms would save almost $22 \n     billion over\n\n[[Page S5863]]\n\n     seven years through provisions such as counting energy \n     assistance as income and tough new program integrity measures \n     to crack down on Food Stamp fraud. The proposal gives States \n     unprecedented flexibility to administer the Food Stamp \n     program, with new work requirements and time limits on able-\n     bodied, childless adults. It continues to index basic \n     benefits with inflation, better targets food subsidies for \n     family day care homes, and makes other adjustments in the \n     Child Nutrition program. The proposal protects children by \n     preserving the school lunch program and important child \n     welfare programs for abused and disabled children.\n       The proposal achieves substantial savings in other areas by \n     requiring sponsors who bring immigrants into the country to \n     be held legally responsible for their financial well-being, \n     and by better targeting eligibility for childhood disability \n     benefits. It also includes two provisions that are part of \n     the recently enacted Public Law 104-121. The first provision \n     modifies the Social Security Act to deny benefits to adults \n     who are on Supplemental Security Income due to drug abuse or \n     alcoholism. The second provision improves program integrity \n     measures through expanded continuing disability reviews. The \n     savings from these enacted proposals should be applied \n     towards the total savings to be achieved through welfare \n     reform.\n       The Administration's welfare reform proposal reduces \n     spending by $41 billion over seven years. This total includes \n     the $3 billion in savings resulting from the enactment of \n     Public Law 104-121 and reflects interactions with Medicaid \n     proposals in the President's FY 1997 Budget.\n       I urge the Congress to act favorably and expeditiously on \n     this important proposal. Welfare reform is at the top of the \n     President's and the Nation's agenda. The Administration is \n     confident that agreement can be reached this year on \n     bipartisan welfare reform legislation that is tough on work \n     and responsibility and serves the interests of our Nation's \n     children. We look forward to working with the Congress to \n     achieve this urgent national goal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Alice M. Rivlin,\n                                                         Director.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 1842. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 to improve protections for workers in multiemployer pension \nplans, to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n               the workers pension protection act of 1996\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I introduce the Workers' Pension \nProtection Act of 1996 in order to level playing field for millions of \nAmerican workers who participate in multi-employer pension plans. This \nbill will extend, to them, the protections previously established for \nworkers in single-employer pension plans. First, the legislation \nharmonizes the rules for all workers by adopting a 5-year vesting \nrequirement which conforms to vesting rules applicable to other \nqualified pension plans. Furthermore, this bill also protects workers' \npension benefits by making sure that these multi-employer plans are \nsufficiently funded so that the benefits promised today will actually \nbe there for the worker when he retires.\n  One benefit which has long been extend to workers in single-employer \npension plans is the guarantee of benefits after a maximum of 5 years \nof service. Workers whose employers contribute to multi-employer plans \nmay work for up to 10 years before they are guaranteed to receive any \nbenefits from their pension plan. This bill extends the same 5-year \nvesting right to multi-employer plan participants.\n  Many of this country's multi-employer pension plans are significantly \nunder funded by billions of dollars. This legislation targets those \nbade apples--the under funded plans. This bill addresses the problem \nwith four provisions that are consistent with the pension reform for \nsingle employer pension plans that we passed in 1994 as part of the \nGATT legislation.\n  First, this bill would prohibit multi-employer plan trustees from \nincreasing pension benefits unless a plan has a 95-percent ratio of \nassets to current liabilities attributable to employees and their \nbeneficiaries. Pension plans would be required to operate with a \nbalanced budget and could not run in the red as they do now.\n  Second, this bill would prohibit multi-employer trustees from \ngranting a benefit increase in a multi-employer plan which satisfies \nthe 95-percent ratio if the increase would reduce this ratio below 90 \npercent. In addition, should the ratio drop due to fluctuations in the \nmarket or other changes in the funding valuation, the trustees could \nnot increase benefits again until they retain the 90-percent ratio. \nThese ratios will allow multi-employer pension plans to operate at full \nfunding yet maintain the discretion to rely on actuarial analysis in \nmodifying benefit levels.\n  Third, multi-employer plans would be required to use a single, \nidentified interest rate and mortality table assumptions in all \ncalculations for all players. As in the single employer pension reform \nlegislation in 1994, the interest rates and mortality tables must be \nstandardized and should conform with the most recent data. As a result, \nthese plans could not continue to use one rate when reporting to the \nGovernment and different rate when determining liability associated \nwith under funding. This is the same commonsense approach that was \napplied to single employer pension plans when the GATT legislation was \npassed.\n  Finally, as did the GATT legislation, this bill would require that \nplan trustees provide notification of their financial status on annual \nbasis to participating employees in easily understood terms. Once and \nfor all participants and beneficiaries will begin to understand how \nsecure there pension benefits really are because these interests rates \nmore accurately predict the return on investment than current rates \npermitted for multi-employer plans. With a better understanding of the \nworth of their pension benefits workers can make informed decisions \nabout their future retirement needs.\n  In the last Congress, we took significant and necessary steps to \nreform the pension laws for retirement security for millions of \nAmerican workers. Unfortunately, a large segment of the work force was \nleft behind and is in need of similar protection. Union employees \nparticipating in multi-employer pension plans have been contributing \nhard earned dollars to these plans with the expectation of receiving \n$2,000 to $3,000 a month when they retire. They are not aware that, if \ntheir plan goes belly-up due to significant under funding, they could \nreceive less than $500 a month. This legislation will ensure that the \npension benefits, union employees have worked so hard for and are \ndepending on, will be there when they are ready to retire.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section \nanalysis of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n                              Section 101\n\n       Section 101 prohibits multiemployer pension plan trustees \n     from increasing benefits unless the plan is operating with at \n     least 95 percent funding. If a plan satisfies this minimum \n     funding requirement, it may choose to increase benefits if \n     the benefit increase would not reduce the funding levels to \n     below 90 percent. The plan would then be required to reach 95 \n     percent funding again before increasing benefits.\n       This section also requires multiemployer plans to use the \n     interest rate assumptions and the mortality tables that were \n     passed into law in the 1994 GATT legislation for single-\n     employer pension plans. These interest rates more accurately \n     predict the return on investment than the current rates \n     permitted for multiemployer plans. Furthermore, the mortality \n     tables currently relied on by multiemployer plans date back \n     to 1971 while the GATT legislation required that single-\n     employer plans rely on more current data. This section \n     requires that multiemployer plans rely on the current \n     mortality tables.\n\n\n                              section 102\n\n       Section 102 amends ERISA by modifying the anti-cutback rule \n     contained in ERISA Sec. 204(g). This provision is necessary \n     in order to revoke any trustee action which violates the \n     other provisions of this bill.\n\n\n                              Section 103\n\n       Section 103 requires multiemployer plan administrators to \n     notify plan participants, beneficiaries and contributing \n     employers of the plan's funded status and the limits of the \n     PBGC's guarantee should the plan terminate while underfunded. \n     The notice must be written in a manner which can be \n     understood by the average plan participant. This provision \n     duplicates the notice requirements for single-employer plans \n     contained in the GATT legislation.\n\n\n                              section 201\n\n       Section 201 requires multiemployer plans to adopt the \n     interest rate and mortality tables used by single-employer \n     plans as mandated in the GATT legislation for all purposes. \n     For a description of these interest rate and mortality table \n     requirements, see Section 101 above.\n\n\n                              Section 301\n\n       Section 301 provides employers the right to seek an \n     injunction against a plan to prevent an impermissible benefit \n     increase.

A bill to provide for the allocation of funds from the mass \ntransit account of the highway trust fund, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                        MASS TRANSIT LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that \nattempts to level the playing field for transit donor States across the \ncountry. In addition to myself, Senators Lott, Thurmond, Thomas, \nJeffords, and Cochran are all original cosponsors.\n  Federal transit dollars are distributed according to the Federal \nTransit Act as amended by the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act [ISTEA]. Similar to highway dollars, transit dollars are \ncollected at the gas pump and are distributed by both formula and \ndiscretionary grants.\n  States such as Oklahoma that do not receive back all of the revenues \nthat they send to the Federal mass transit account are considered donor \nStates. Unfortunately, these States are not getting nearly as much back \nin Federal funding as they contribute. My proposal is designed to \naddress this critical transit problem. Each State that contributes $45 \nmillion or less into the Federal mass transit account will be \nguaranteed to receive back no less than 80 percent of its \napportionment.\n  States should be able to expect local dollars to be used for local \ntransit needs. Oklahoma-generated revenues should be remitted back to \nOklahoma to provide for improved public transportation for Oklahomans, \nnot urban mass transit systems in other States. This bill will put \nequity into the mass transit apportionment system by returning these \nlocally generated dollars home.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1844. A bill to amend the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act to \ndirect a study of the opportunities for enhanced water based recreation \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n            the national recreation lakes study act of 1996\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this is an important time of the year \nfor Americans: It is among the first weeks of the summer vacation and \nrecreation season, and it is National Fishing Week.\n  Millions of Americans are either tuning their boat engines, tying \nflies, dusting off their hiking boots, squeezing into their bathing \nsuits, or putting on their water skis. In short, we're ready to go, and \nthe vacation rush is on. Many people got a jump start last week, \nheading to lakes or national parks. Being lucky enough to be in Alaska, \nI was able to steal a couple days myself. If you want to hear my big \nfish stories, ask me later.\n  This is also an important week for at least three other reasons: I am \nintroducing legislation to help increase recreational opportunities on \nthis Nation's lakes and rivers; the Senate Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources holds a hearing Tuesday on S. 1703, my legislation \nraising millions of dollars for our national parks; and the House and \nSenate conference is working to resolve the differences on the most \nimportant parks and conservation legislation in a decade.\n  Let's take a moment to take stock of some of this Nation's natural \nbounty and talk about a couple areas where we can take action to \nprotect and enhance it. Let's start with the recreation lakes \ninitiative.\n  The Recreation Roundtable recently reported that a body of water--a \nlake, river, or ocean--is the primary choice for 40 percent of \nAmericans' recreational destination. Nearly 17 million boats are in use \nin this Nation, and sales of boats and boating goods are on the \nupswing. Fishing and the bragging rights that go along with it are two \nof Americans' favorite pastimes.\n  But, when it comes to our thousands of bodies of water, both natural \nand man made, are we using our resources as wisely as we should? Are we \nliving up to our recreational potential? We probably are not.\n  In addition to the many natural lakes and rivers with which this \nNation is blessed, we also have an enormous resource in man-made \nreservoirs built by Federal, State and local agencies, as well as \nprivate entities. For important practical, financial, and legal \nreasons, most public resources in these areas must first go to purposes \nsuch as flood control, navigation, and water supply. But, even after \nmeeting those requirements, there is a lot of untapped recreational \npotential in almost every State.\n  The recreation lakes initiative I am introducing today will \nreinvigorate the public-private partnership between States, the Federal \nGovernment, and private entities to make the most of our public, water-\nbased recreational opportunities.\n\n  While this bill concerns public assets, the private sector plays a \nvery important role. Did you know our national forest lands provide \nover one-half of all skiing in the United States without the Federal \nGovernment building one lift or one ski lodge? My legislation will help \nbuild a true partnership to make the recreation on or near our man-made \nlakes available to all Americans.\n  My legislation will kick-start this partnership by bringing together \nFederal agencies, State and local governments, and recreation users and \nproviders to make specific recommendations about how we can use our \nvast untapped recreational potential. While protecting the integrity of \nour lakes and reservoirs for their primary purposes, they will be \ncharged with finding ways to make them more available to Americans.\n  The prudent use of these resources will protect the environment, help \nlocal communities and decrease the demand for other, overburdened \nresources. It will also help bring days of joy to thousands of \nAmericans who are brought in closer touch with the great outdoors.\n  Speaking of the great outdoors, I want to say a few words about our \nnational parks. This week marks the beginning of the summer vacation \nseason, and our national parks are a main destination.\n  From the majesty and colors of the Grand Canyon--to the excitement of \nOld Faithful--to the remote beauty of Alaska's national parks, millions \nof Americans are traveling thousands of miles to catch a glimpse of our \nnatural heritage. While the beauty and excitement is still there, \nAmerican are facing some unsightly problems when they reach their \nvacation destinations. For many years, the National Park Service has \nstruggled with a growing maintenance backlog. Increased park use and \nthe addition of more new parks have stretched Federal park dollars to \nthe hilt. Now, with Federal funds already tight, the National Park \nService's park maintenance backlog stands at $4 billion.\n  The time has come to make needed repairs and to restore the luster to \nsome of our crown jewels. We need an infusion of cash no Congress and \nno President could provide overnight. It is unfortunate some in this \nadministration has chosen election-year rhetoric over substance to try \nand meet these needs. Federal funds can and will keep our parks open \nand running. But we need private funds--like those that\n\n[[Page S5865]]\n\nflowed in to restore the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island--to help \npay for the backlog of repairs in our parks.\n  My legislation--introduced April 25 and scheduled for a hearing this \nThursday--will generate $100 million a year or more for our national \nparks.\n  It provides the National Park Foundation the means to collect funds \nfrom individuals, foundations, and corporations. It gives this official \nfundraising arm of the National Park Service the authority to engage in \nappropriate business relationships, similar to those already enjoyed \nby the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the National Forest \nFoundation, and the U.S. Olympic Committee.\n\n  Rather than allowing movie executives, advertisers, and publishers to \ncontinue making millions off the intellectual property and assets of \nour parks for next to nothing, my bill will allow our parks to get \nsomething in return. It will provide a responsible way to reduce our \nNational Park Service's long-term maintenance backlog.\n  Our natural and recreational assets must be conserved and enjoyed by \nAmericans. As we enter the summer vacation months, we must take the \nextra steps needed to make this possible. These two bills--our \nrecreation lakes initiative and my bill to provide $100 million a year \nfor maintenance of our national parks--are a good start.\n  We continue to work on park concessions and entrance fee reforms. A \nHouse-Senate conference committee also continues to meet to work out \nthe details on my omnibus 60-plus item parks and conservation package. \nFrom the Selma to Montgomery National Historical Trail to the San \nFrancisco Presidio to lands needed for the Winter Olympics, the \nbeneficial effects of this legislation will be felt in every State.\n  As I stated, I am introducing legislation on a recreation lakes \ninitiative and I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record. I want to emphasize that the study mandated \nby this bill will rely on existing data and is designed to develop \ncreative solutions to involve the private sector. We do not need an \nelaborate multiyear effort to produce volumes to gather dust on the \nshelves. What we need is a thoughtful exchange of views on how best to \ndevelop the recreational potential at our Federal, man-made lakes and \nreservoirs, without diminishing or adversely affecting the purposes for \nwhich those areas were established.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1844\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Recreation Lakes \n     Study Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       The Congress finds that the federal government, under the \n     authority of the Reclamation Act and other statutes, has \n     developed man-made lakes and reservoirs that have become a \n     powerful magnet for diverse recreational activities and that \n     such activities contribute to the well-being of families and \n     individuals and the economic viability of local communities. \n     The Congress further finds that in order to further the \n     purposes of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the \n     President should appoint an advisory commission to review the \n     current and anticipated demand for recreational opportunities \n     at federally-managed man-made lakes and reservoirs through \n     creative partnerships involving federal, State and local \n     governments and the private sector and to develop \n     alternatives for enhanced recreational use of such \n     facilities.\n\n     SEC. 3. COMMISSION.\n\n       The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (P.L. 88-\n     578, 78 Stat. 897), as amended, is further amended by adding \n     the following new section 13:\n       ``Sec. 13. (a) The President shall appoint an advisory \n     commission to review the opportunities for enhanced \n     opportunities for water based recreation which shall submit a \n     report to the President and to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on \n     Resources of the House of Representatives within one year \n     from the date of enactment of this section.\n       ``(b) The members of the Commission shall include:\n       (1) The Secretary of the Interior, or his designee;\n       (2) The Secretary of the Army, or his designee;\n       (3) The Chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, or his \n     designee;\n       (4) The Secretary of Agriculture, or his designee;\n       (5) A person nominated by the National Governor's \n     Association;\n       (6) Four persons familiar with the recreation and tourism \n     industry, at least one of whom shall be familiar with the \n     economics and financing of recreation related infrastructure.\n       ``(c) The President shall appoint one member to serve as \n     Chairman. Any vacancy on the Commission shall be filled in \n     the same manner as the original appointment. Members of the \n     Commission shall serve without compensation but shall be \n     reimbursed for travel, subsistence, and other necessary \n     expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties. \n     The Secretary of the Interior shall provide all financial, \n     administrative, and staffing requirements for the Commission, \n     including office space, furnishings, and equipment. The heads \n     of other federal agencies are authorized, at the request of \n     the Commission, to provide such information or personnel, to \n     the extent permitted by law and within the limits of \n     available funds, to the Commission as may be useful to \n     accomplish the purposes of this section.\n       ``(d) The Commission may hold such hearings, sit and act at \n     such times and places, take such testimony, and receive such \n     evidence as it deems advisable: Provided, That, to the \n     maximum extent possible, the Commission shall use existing \n     data and research. The Commission is authorized to use the \n     United States mail in the same manner and upon the same \n     conditions as other departments and agencies of the United \n     States.\n       ``(e) The report shall review the extent of water related \n     recreation at federal man-made lakes and reservoirs and shall \n     develop alternatives to enhance the opportunities for such \n     use by the public. In developing the report, the Commission \n     shall (1) review the extent to which recreation components \n     identified in specific authorizations associated with \n     individual federal man-made lakes and reservoirs have been \n     accomplished, (2) evaluate the feasibility of enhancing \n     recreation opportunities at federally-managed lakes and \n     reservoirs under existing statutes, (3) consider legislative \n     changes that would enhance recreation opportunities \n     consistent with and subject to the achievement of the \n     authorized purposes of federal water projects, and (4) make \n     recommendations on alternatives for enhanced recreation \n     opportunities including, but not limited to, the \n     establishment of a National Recreation Lake System under \n     which specific lakes would receive national designation and \n     which would be managed through innovative partnership-based \n     agreements between federal agencies, State and local units of \n     government, and the private sector. Any such alternatives \n     shall be consistent with and subject to the authorized \n     purposes for any man-made lakes and reservoirs and shall \n     emphasize private sector initiatives in concert with State \n     and local units of government.''\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 814\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of

Mr. President, I am pleased to share with my \ncolleagues today a piece of history that is being realized in Oregon \nthis year. The celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Oregon \nSymphony is truly a grand accomplishment. The Oregon Symphony has \nentertained, hosted, and delighted audiences all over the world, myself \nincluded.\n  In 1896 the Portland Symphony Society was founded, with the first \nsymphony conducted by W.H. Kinross performing in October of that same \nyear. Now, 100 years later and still going strong, the symphony is the \nsixth oldest symphony in the United States, and the oldest symphony \nwest of the Mississippi River.\n  The Oregon Symphony is truly that, a symphony for all of Oregon to \nenjoy. The symphony is not confined to its home in downtown Portland. \nIt is not confined by the glorious Cascade mountain range. What makes \nthis symphony so unique is the ability it has to reach out to all of \nthe citizens of Oregon. The symphony plays in front of audiences in \nschool gymnasiums, parks, and small auditoriums. Wherever there is a \ndemand in the State for the Oregon Symphony, the symphony will go.\n  Recently the symphony played in a full gymnasium in Burns, OR. This \nsmall community with a population of 2,880, is located in the remote \neastern high desert portion of the State. The town of Burns \nenthusiastically welcomed the symphony. The townspeople gladly rolled \nup their sleeves and with their own hands built a proper stage for the \nsymphony members in the schools gymnasium. The town of Burns sold 760 \ntickets for the event, a complete sellout. This concert is a true \ntestimony to what the symphony means to the citizens of Oregon.\n  When the symphony cannot travel, it often makes arrangements for free \nconcerts in Portland. The symphony routinely plays for schoolchildren \nfrom all over the State in the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall, \nshowcasing their talents and educating the children in the arts.\n  One of the greatest moments in the history of the symphony was in \n1980 with the appointment of Maestro James DePreist as music director \nand conductor. Under Maestro DePreist the Symphony is no longer made up \nof volunteer musicians, the symphony now draws some of the finest \nprofessional musicians in the country. In 1987 the professionalism of \nthe symphony shone through as they released their first recording.\n  Today, the Oregon Symphony is truly something to be proud of.\n  Whether playing in front of a sold out audience in a high school gym \nin Burns, OR, or in the elegant surroundings of the Arlene Schnitzer \nConcert Hall, the symphony amazes and entertains crowds with a \ntriumphant and magnificent sound. I would like to thank the Oregon \nSymphony, and wish it 100 more glorious years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/05/senate-section/article/S5867-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO CAPT. GEORGE H. HUBAN, U.S. NAVY\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise to take this opportunity to honor \nCaptain George Huban who will retire shortly from the U.S. Navy after \n28 years of faithful service to our Nation.\n  Captain Huban is a 1968 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy. Following \nhis commissioning, Captain Huban served aboard the destroyer USS Noa in \nSoutheast Asia during the Vietnam War. He later attended the Supply \nCorps School and served as Supply Officer on the attack submarine USS \nHaddock. Captain Huban then went on to a variety of tours including \nSquadron Supply Officer to ballistic missile Submarine Squadron \nFifteen; contracting officer at the Naval Sea Systems Command; \nassistant to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations; Supply Officer, USS \nPugent Sound; and Commander, Sixth Fleet Supply, where he coordinated \nlogistics support for fleet operations off the coast of Lebanon.\n  Following these tours, Captain Huban served at several senior staff \npositions. From 1986 to 1988, he served as Executive Assistant to the \nDeputy Comptroller of the Navy and was then named Assistant Director of \nAcquisition Policy in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the \nNavy. Captain Huban then served as Director of Supply Corps Personnel \nat the Naval Supply Systems Command in Washington, DC.\n  His final tour in the Navy was as the Commanding Officer of the Navy \nSupply Corps School in Athens, GA. Although Captain Huban was born in \nVermont, the residents of Athens, GA, welcomed him and now consider him \none of their own. I am certain he will continue to play in active role \nin the community following his retirement. While serving as Commanding \nOfficer at the Navy Supply Corp School, he has been instrumental in \nproviding the highest quality of logistics training to officers and \nenlisted personnel not only to Navy personnel but to all U.S. service \npersonnel, armed forces personnel of many of our allied nations, and \nDepartment of Defense civilian personnel. Captain Huban will be \nfollowed by Captain John Drerup as Commanding Officer at the Supply \nCorps School.\n  A man of Captain Huban's character and dedication is rare indeed. His \noutstanding service will be genuinely missed, and I am pleased to \nrecognize him before the U.S. Senate. Let me also recognize his wife \nPatricia and daughter Cristin. The sacrifices they have made in support \nof Captain Huban's service are equally noteworthy. I wish him and his \nfamily all the best as he brings to a close a long and distinguished \ncareer in the U.S. Navy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/05/senate-section/article/S5867-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  WEST ANCHORAGE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to recognize an \noutstanding group of students from West Anchorage High School in \nAnchorage, AK. Twenty-three young people, from my home State, were \nrecently in Washington, DC to compete in the We the People . . . the \nCitizen and the Constitution national finals. They successfully \ncompeted against 49 other classes from around the Nation and \ndemonstrated a thorough understanding of the fundamental ideals and \nvalues of American constitutional democracy.\n  The program, administered by the Center for Civic Education is the \nmost comprehensive of its kind, reaching more than 22 million students \nat the elementary, middle, and high school levels in its 9 year \nhistory. The national finals, in which these students competed, \nsimulated a congressional hearing whereby students testified as \nconstitutional experts before a panel of judges.\n  I commend the following students and their teacher, Roberta \nMcCutcheon, for their determination and dedication to such a worthwhile \ncompetition: Susan Angst, Jessica Burton, Nathan Carr, Amber \nChristensen, Allen Clendaniel, Claire Dennerlein, Theodore Dickson, \nWhitney Faulkner, Clifford Haywood, Todd Holway, Anne Kelly, Lori \nLeMaster, Brooke Maury, Amber Popken, Joanna Resari, Thomas Sardy, \nKivlina Shepherd, Lisa Stokes, Ian Street, Zareena Tran, Kate Weber, \nJustin Weeks, and Kiao-Le Zhao.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/05/senate-section/article/S5867-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5867-S5868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   1996 ANNUAL REPORTS: BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY AND \n                          MEDICARE TRUST FUNDS\n\n\n            Financial Status of Medicare and Social Security\n\n   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, in their annual report released \ntoday, the\n\n[[Page S5868]]\n\nboard of trustees of the Federal hospital insurance trust fund \nestimated that the assets of the trust fund--Part A of the Medicare \nProgram--will be exhausted by the end of calendar year 2001. Last \nyear's estimate was 2002. As ominous a statement as this may seem, it \nis meaningless. In point of fact, Medicare part A outlays have exceeded \npayroll tax collections since 1992, when a cash flow deficit appeared \nof approximately $3 billion--a deficit funded with general revenues. \nMedicare part A outlays that year were $85 billion, while payroll tax \ncollections were only $82 billion.\n  The trustees of the old age, survivors, and disability insurance \ntrust fund also issued their annual report today. They estimate \nexhaustion of the old age, survivors, and disability insurance trust \nfund in the year 2029. Last year's estimate was 2030. Again, \nmeaningless. Social Security outlays will exceed payroll taxes in the \nyear 2012. By the year 1997, outlays for Social Security and Medicare \npart A will exceed payroll tax collections for Social Security and \nMedicare. According to the 1996 trustees' reports, combined outlays for \nSocial Security and Medicare part A in 1997 will be $514 billion; \npayroll tax receipts will be only $506 billion. And the combined \ndeficit for the two programs will grow rapidly thereafter, reaching \nalmost $100 billion in about 10 years.\n\n\n      Effect of Medicare and Social Security on the Federal Budget\n\n  Prior to 1992, during the period in which Medicare part A payroll \ntaxes generally exceeded outlays, the program contributed to a \nreduction in the overall deficit. This is because the deficit \ncalculation is based on the unified budget, and the trust fund into \nwhich Medicare payroll tax collections are deposited is merely an \naccounting device. It is irrelevant for purposes of calculating the \ndeficit. Since 1992, with outlays consistently exceeding payroll tax \ncollections, Medicare part A has been adding to the deficit. If \nMedicare and Social Security are in the black, they reduce the deficit. \nIf they are in the red, the deficit is increased.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/05/senate-section/article/S5867-4", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5868-S5869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     EXPLANATION OF SELECTED VOTES TO THE SENATE BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\nMr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, similar to last year's \nconsideration of the budget resolution, the Senate considered a near-\nrecord number of amendments this year, many of which were offered after \ntime had expired and voted upon without debate. Since time was limited \nthen, I want to spend a few moments now to offer explanations for \nseveral of the more critical votes.\n  As with last year's budget, several amendments were offered which \ntargeted increased spending to certain areas of the budget. These \nincluded a Boxer amendment to increase by $18 billion Medicaid \nspending, a Byrd amendment to increase domestic discretionary spending \nby $65 billion, and a Kerry amendment to provide $7.3 billion in \nincreased funding for the EPA, national parks, NOAA, and other areas. \nIn all three cases, these spending increases were offset with increased \ntaxes.\n  Mr. President, while I strongly support many of the programs targeted \nby these amendments, it will be extremely difficult for Congress to \nbalance the budget if we choose to raise taxes every time we want to \nfund additional programs. By opting to tax and spend our way out of \ntight budgets, we are simply putting off the difficult choices which \nmust be made. For this reason, I opposed these amendments.\n  Another amendment I opposed was the Domenici amendment to provide an \nadditional $4 billion in domestic discretionary outlays for next year. \nI applaud the chairman of the Budget Committee for working hard to \nrestrain spending and I support many of the programs that this \nadditional funding would assist, including education funding. But while \nthe actual programs benefiting from this amendment are undefined, it \ndefinitely moves us away from our goal of restraining the growth of \ngovernment spending and balancing the budget. As was pointed out during \nthe debate, this amendment would raise domestic discretionary spending \n$17 billion above the level that was called for in last year's budget \nresolution. In my mind, that is simply too much.\n  Another amendment dealing with taxes was the Wellstone amendment \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that, once the $500 per child family \ntax credit had been adopted, the next priority for the Finance \nCommittee should be legislation to provide a tax deduction of up to \n$10,000 for higher education tuition expenses.\n  Mr. President, this amendment does not debate the propriety of \nenacting tax cuts. Instead, it focuses upon who is best suited to \ndecide what American families should do with their hard earned money--\nthe families themselves or the Federal Government. In effect, Senator \nWellstone is saying, I will let you keep more, as long as you use it \nfor college expenses, because that is my priority. On the other hand, \nRepublicans say, We are going to allow you to keep more of what you \nearn to use it as you--not the government--thinks best. We should not \nonly give Americans a tax break, we should also give them the freedom \nto set their own priorities with their own money.\n  The final amendment targeting tax cuts was one I supported--the \nAshcroft amendment to allow taxpayers to deduct payroll taxes from \ntheir income when calculating their income taxes. Once again, this \namendment presented Senators with a clear-cut choice: Do we allow hard-\nworking men and women to keep more of what they earn so they can spend \nit as they see fit, or do we take their money and invest it in more \ngovernment. While I did not support all the offsets included in the \nAshcroft amendment, I believe there is an overwhelming case to be made \nfor significant tax cuts at this time. Not the least of these is the \nrecord tax burden currently shouldered by American families. According \nto economist Bruce Bartlett, combined local, State, and Federal taxes \nnow consume a record percentage of the total national income. This is \nentirely too much, and I support reasonable efforts to help reduce this \nburden.\n\n  Several amendments were targeted at federal education efforts. One \nwas the Kerry amendment to add $56 billion to the education function \nand offset that increased funding by reducing the tax cuts called for \nin the bill. In the words of Senator Kerry, this additional funding \nwould provide enough money to be sufficient to keep pace with student \nenrollment and inflation over the next 6 years.\n  Mr. President, last year I worked extensively with Senators Snowe, \nKassebaum, and others to ensure that our efforts to balance the budget \ndid not hurt students. I support effective education programs. What \nthis amendment proposes, however, is to eliminate our ability to pass \ntax cuts for families with children, and spend that money instead on \neducation bureaucrats who, in some cases, oversee programs as wasteful \nas any in the Federal Government. Given the choice between bureaucrats \nand families, I chose families.\n  There were also several amendments that focused on Republican efforts \nto reform our entitlement programs. The most broad-based of these was \nthe Kerry amendment on long-term entitlement reform. This amendment \nwould express the sense of the Senate that Congress should enact a \nbroad set of entitlement reforms, including raising the retirement age \nand adjusting the Consumer Price Index, to ensure the long-term \nsolvency of Social Security and other entitlement programs. Senator \nKerry has been an outstanding leader on the issue of entitlement reform \nand I applaud his efforts. Nevertheless, I believe that adjusting the \nConsumer Price Index should be done only after the special commission \ncreated to study the CPI's accuracy has an opportunity to publish its \nfindings.\n  This was also the principle reason I opposed the Chafee-Breaux \nsubstitute budget, which received 46 votes. The substitute budget made \nmany of the same tough choices as the underlying Republican budget, \nincluding welfare reform, slowing the growth of Medicaid, and tax \nrelief for families. On the other hand, the amendment would have saved \n$91 billion from a .5-percent reduction in the Consumer Price Index. \nThis reduction would have meant lower benefits for seniors, and higher \ntaxes for families. It also meant the bipartisan budget could spend \n$117 billion more in discretionary spending over the next 6 years. \nWhile there was much to like in this alternative budget, I could not \nsupport the decision to cut\n\n[[Page S5869]]\n\nbenefits and raise taxes solely in order to fund additional spending.\n  Another amendment focused on entitlement was the Kennedy amendment \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that any reconciliation bill will \nmaintain the existing prohibitions against additional charges by \nproviders under Medicare. For the existing Medicare system, I agree \nthis prohibition against so-called balance billing makes sense. On the \nother hand, the current Medicare System is going broke, and it makes \nlittle sense to tie the hands of the Finance Committee when they search \nfor innovative ways to preserve the current system while providing new \noptions to seniors. In effect, the Kennedy amendment is an attempt to \nforestall Medicare reform. As such, it is irresponsible and I voted \nagainst it.\n\n  Finally, there were several miscellaneous amendment which deserve \ncomment. The first of these was the Graham-Baucus amendment to create a \n60-vote point of order against efforts to divert savings which result \nfrom health care fraud and abuse programs from the Medicare HI trust \nfund to be used for other purposes.\n  First, it is important to note that this amendment would have no \nimpact on the solvency of the Medicare trust fund. As a trust fund with \na dedicated source of revenues, funding for Medicare part A cannot be \ndiverted for other uses. Nor can savings resulting from Medicare \nreforms be used for any purposes other than to make the trust fund more \nsolvent. Simply put, this amendment would have no real impact on \nMedicare whatsoever.\n  Second, this amendment violated the Budget Act by creating a point of \norder outside the jurisdiction of the Budget Committee. It is simply \nagainst the rules for the budget resolution to create points of order \nagainst legislation originating from other committees. For these two \nreasons, I opposed this amendment and supported Chairman Domenici's \npoint of order against it.\n  One amendment dealing with foreign policy was the Lott amendment \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that the United States should be \nreimbursed for expenses related to U.N. actions in Iraq. The amendment \ncalls on the United States Ambassador to the United Nations to modify \nthe recent U.N. resolution which permits Iraqi oil sales to be used for \nreimbursing U.N. humanitarian expenses. I supported this amendment.\n  The bottom line is Iraq--through the revenue derived from its recent \nU.N. oil sales--should reimburse the United States for money expended \nduring Operation Southern Watch and Provide Comfort--whereby United \nStates troops protected Kurdish and Shiite Muslims from Saddam Hussein. \nThe U.S. expenses were of a military nature, but were made to satisfy a \nU.N. humanitarian policy. As such, these efforts should not be financed \nfrom the pockets of American taxpayers, but rather from the purses of \nthe belligerent government that made them necessary in the first place.\n  The last amendment I would like to comment upon is the Roth amendment \nto take .5 cents of the mass transit gas tax--which is 2 cents total--\nand apply it toward Amtrak. While the issue of Federal subsidies is for \ninterstate passenger rail service is extremely contentious and \ninvolved, using the highway trust fund to support Amtrak clearly \nundermines the integrity of the fund and should be opposed. If Congress \nchooses to continue its support for Amtrak, it should be done through \ngeneral revenues and subject to the same review process to which other \ndiscretionary spending is subject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/05/senate-section/article/S5868-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PORTERVILLE HIGH SCHOOL 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n   Mrs. BOXER.

Our \neconomy has produced more than 9.4 million new jobs in the last 3 \nyears, and the lion's share of these have been generated by small \nbusinesses.\n  We have much to do to provide a richer and less burdensome economic \nenvironment, as the June 1995 White House Conference on Small Business \nconcluded. Business and Government are communicating on how best to \naddress the central concerns expressed by the small business sector, \nand New Mexico's delegation to the White House Conference has been \nparticularly active in the implementation of the conference's \nproposals. Supporting our Nation's entrepreneurs and small business\n\n[[Page S5870]]\n\nowners and highlighting the achievements of our Nation's most competent \nchampions of economic growth should be one of our highest priorities, \nand it is my pleasure to thank these awardees for their important \ncontributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/05/senate-section/article/S5869-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DISPOSAL OF CERTAIN COMMODITIES\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee \non Agriculture be immediately discharged from its further consideration \nof Senate Concurrent Resolution 63, and that the Senate proceed to its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 63) to express the \n     sense of the Congress that the Secretary of Agriculture \n     should dispose of all remaining commodities in the disaster \n     reserve maintained under the Agriculture Act of 1970 to \n     relieve the distress of livestock producers whose ability to \n     maintain livestock is adversely affected by the prolonged \n     drought conditions existing in certain areas of the United \n     States, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the concurrent resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4042\n\n (Purpose: To expand the type of disaster conditions addressed by the \n                              resolution)\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I understand there is an amendment at the \ndesk offered by Senator Kassebaum, and I ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns], for Mrs. Kassebaum, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4042.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, line 3, insert ``and other adverse weather'' \n     after ``drought''.\n       On page 2, line 9, strike ``the prolonged drought'' and \n     insert ``disaster conditions, such as prolonged drought or \n     flooding''.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend the junior Senator from Kansas \nfor calling attention to the devastating impact of adverse weather on \nour Nation's producers. I fully support Senate Concurrent Resolution \n63, which urges the Secretary of Agriculture to make available \ncommodities in the disaster reserve for livestock feed.\n  I also commend Senator Kassebaum for agreeing to broaden the \nresolution to include producers suffering from flooding and other \nweather related disasters. In my home State of South Dakota and \nthroughout the eastern cornbelt, excessive rainfall this spring has \nprevented producers from planting their crop. This resolution \nacknowledges the importance of addressing the effect of both drought \nand flooding on producers.\n  Senate Concurrent Resolution 63 reinforces an initiative to utilize \nthe disaster reserve already undertaken by the Secretary of \nAgriculture. Secretary Glickman has informed me that he has formally \nasked the President of the United States to issue an emergency \ndeclaration to allow the use of the commodities within the reserve, and \nhe expects a positive response shortly. In light of the actions the \nadministration has already taken in this area, some have argued this \nresolution is superfluous, but it is fitting for Congress to send a \nclear signal that we support the efforts of Secretary Glickman and the \nPresident, and I have, therefore, joined as a cosponsor of the \nresolution.\n  Before passing this resolution, it is also worth noting that \nPresidential approval of the use of the disaster reserve is necessary \nonly because the recently enacted farm bill suspended the Secretary's \ndiscretionary authority to access these stocks through the Emergency \nLivestock Feed Program. Recently, my distinguished colleague from New \nMexico, Senator Jeff Bingaman, introduced legislation to reauthorize \nthis valuable program. I hope the majority will also give prompt \nattention to this legislation to assist producers suffering from \nweather-related disasters. This bill, introduced with bipartisan \nsupport, would give immediate relief to farmers and ranchers victimized \nby the devastating drought in the Southwest and other areas.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to commend Secretary Glickman \nand the President for their quick, decisive and thorough response to \nthe drought plaguing the Southwest and Central Plains States. Secretary \nGlickman has already opened the Conservation Reserve Program for haying \nand grazing, provided additional funds for the Emergency Loan Program, \nand expanded crop insurance for forage crops. Utilization of the \ndisaster reserve to provide emergency livestock feed is yet another \nexample of the President's commitment to rural America.\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to, \nthe resolution be agreed to, as amended, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the \nresolution appear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4042) was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 63), as amended, was agreed \nto, as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 63\n\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1.
