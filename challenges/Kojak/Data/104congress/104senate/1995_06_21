FOSTER, JR., TO BE MEDICAL DIRECTOR IN THE \nREGULAR CORPS OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE AND TO BE SURGEON GENERAL OF \n                       THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Foster, Jr., of Tennessee, to be \n     Medical Director in the Regular Corps of the Public Health \n     Service, subject to qualifications therefor as provided by \n     law and regulations, and to be Surgeon General of the Public \n     Health Service, for a term of 4 years.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, first I would like to ask unanimous \nconsent that Dr. Jim Wade, a Robert Woods Johnson Fellow of the staff \nof the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, be allowed the \nprivileges of the floor during the consideration of the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering the \nnomination of Dr. Henry W. Foster, Jr., to be Surgeon General of the \nUnited States. At noon today, the Senate will vote on the motion to \ninvoke cloture, which would limit debate on this nomination.\n  Mr. President, I oppose this nomination, for reasons that I will \nbriefly explain, but I will vote for cloture so that [[Page S \n8722]] the Senate can make a clear-cut decision on Dr. Foster's \nnomination. While I respect the right of any Senator to engage in \nextended debate on any issue, I have long believed that nominations \nshould be dealt with in a direct fashion. My practice has been to \noppose filibusters on nominations and I will oppose one on this \nnominee, even though I do not support Dr. Foster's confirmation.\n  This nomination has been embroiled in controversy from the outset due \nto the fact that, as an obstetrician-gynecologist, Dr. Foster has \nperformed abortions. That fact has become a battle cry for those on \nboth sides of the abortion issue.\n  When the Committee on Labor and Human Resources considered this \nnomination, I said that Dr. Foster deserved to be judged on his whole \nrecord, not on a single issue. I have weighed the full record and \nconcluded that I cannot support Dr. Foster's nomination.\n  Given the troubled term of Dr. Joycelyn Elders, it was clear to me, \nand it should have been clear to the administration, that the next \nSurgeon General needed to be someone who immediately could reestablish \nthe credibility and nonpolitical authority of this office.\n  But political it has become, and many Americans, including me, wonder \nwhy we need a Surgeon General if he or she is going to be caught up in \npointless rhetorical controversies that do nothing to address the \ncritical health issues facing our Nation.\n  The Surgeon General's main role is to speak to the entire Nation on \nhealth issues in ways that both enlighten and challenge us. I believe \nthat Dr. Foster cannot effectively perform that role, largely because \nhis own credibility and authority was undermined at the very start of \nthe nomination process.\n  Despite his many strengths, I believe Dr. Foster is the wrong person \nto step into this badly damaged office at this time.\n  On top of this overarching concern, I have serious reservations about \nthis nomination when it is weighted solely on Dr. Foster's own merits, \nparticularly his willingness to provide strong leadership on difficult \nissues.\n  My concern about Dr. Foster's leadership goes to the heart of this \nnomination--his supervision and direction of the I Have a Future \nProgram, which the administration and Dr. Foster himself have made the \ncenterpiece of his nomination.\n  In his opening statement to the committee, Dr. Foster talked about \nthe success of this program and his desire to lead a national crusade \nto deal with the critical problem of teenage pregnancy in this country.\n  The I Have a Future Program is not without merit and undoubtedly has \nchanged the lives of some young people for the better. Dr. Foster \nshould be commended for his efforts in working to create a worthwhile \nprogram. There is no question in my mind that Dr. Foster has a sincere, \ngenuine concern for young people and is deeply committed to helping \nthem.\n  However, the record also is clear that the I Have a Future Program \nhas never shown significant success in reducing teenage pregnancy. In \nfact, evaluations produced in 1992 and in 1994 raise serious questions \nabout whether this program has had unintended consequences by \nincreasing sexual activity among its participants.\n  If anything, the I Have a Future Program demonstrates the extreme \ndifficulty, the extraordinary resources, and the potential risks \ninvolved in efforts to deal with teen pregnancy. Far from being a model \nfor a national crusade, it is instead a warning sign to us all to \nproceed with caution on this matter.\n  In both his testimony to the committee and in response to written \nfollowup questions, Dr. Foster has been unwilling to come to grips with \nthe difficult, fundamental questions raised in evaluations of this \nprogram. I am troubled by this unwillingness. A Surgeon General must \nhave not only a good heart, which Dr. Foster certainly has, but the \nability to ask hard questions and demand solid answers rooted in fact \nand in science.\n  Mr. President, are we asking too much of the Surgeon General of the \nUnited States? If, indeed, this is a position of importance to us in \nthis country, I think not. We need the strongest possible leadership \nfor our Nation's public health concerns. And I do not believe Dr. \nFoster is that nominee. Therefore, I will vote against his \nconfirmation.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome the opportunity for the Senate \nto have a chance to express itself on the nomination of Dr. Foster.\n  There was some comment earlier about the fact that Dr. Foster has \nbeen on the calendar for a very limited period of time and a question \nwhy there should have been so much concern about the consideration of \nDr. Foster.\n  The principal reason for that is because leaders in the Senate \nindicated they were going to use their power, such as that of the \nmajority leader, to not even consider the nomination that had been \nreported out of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, and there are \nothers who indicated that they were going to use the rules of the \ncommittee in order to raise a higher barrier, higher hurdle, for the \nnominee to go over in order to be approved for the position of Surgeon \nGeneral.\n  So there has been a great deal of concern, and I think that the \noverwhelming majority of the American people, certainly those who \nwatched the consideration in the hearings for the time that Dr. Foster \ntestified, had to feel that the issue of fairness was in play here; \nthat Dr. Foster had been nominated by this President, really an \noutstanding nominee, one that has demonstrated his qualifications well, \nreported out of the committee, and that the Senate in its own way ought \nto have the opportunity to express itself.\n  Quite frankly, the fact that we are going to vote for cloture in \norder to be able to get to the nomination I do not think is the way we \nought to be considering the nomination. I do not think it is fair to \nDr. Foster, and it is not fair to the American people, who want to have \nan outstanding doctor as the Surgeon General.\n  It continues to be my position, and I think for most persons, that \nthis is not the fair way to treat this nomination. It is not the fair \nway to treat an individual who has gone through the process with great \ndignity, great patience, great grace, great strength, and demonstrated \na knowledge and an ability and a strong commitment to do the job of \nSurgeon General.\n  I think those who have pointed out there are other forces at work \nhere are correct. This really is an issue that involves, I believe, a \nwoman's right to choose, and the issue of privacy, the question of the \ndoctor who is going to be Surgeon General is going to face a litmus \ntest on the issue of abortion before being able to be confirmed. When \nall is said and done, Mr. President, that is really the issue that is \nout there. Dr. Foster is entitled to a vote. He is entitled to a vote \nup and down, and the American people are entitled to a Surgeon General \nwho understands and respects the right of privacy, the constitutional \nright of a woman's right to choose.\n  Now, I listened carefully during the course of the hearings. There \nare those who have talked about this, and we will have a chance during \nthe course of this debate this morning to hear many of our colleagues \nwho want to speak on it, as we should hear from them. But nonetheless, \nwhen the bottom line is drawn, that is the underlying issue. We will \nhear about the Tuskegee study. We will hear about sterilization. We \nwill talk about the number of abortions. We will talk about the I Have \na Future Program, but you cannot get away from the fact that this \nextraordinary individual for 38 years has devoted himself to the well-\nbeing of needy people in our society.\n  How many other doctors would leave the hallowed halls of great \ninstitutions and go down and serve in the most underserved part of \nAmerica, the poorest area of America. This is a baby doctor, delivering \n10,000 babies over the course of time. I do not even recognize the \nnominee from the descriptions that many of our colleagues who are \nopposed to Dr. Foster would use.\n  How many would spend their time not only delivering babies in some of \nthe most difficult circumstances and then devote their lives to \ntraining young people?\n  We will hear what was the effect of the I Have a Future Program. It \nwas good enough for President George Bush [[Page S 8723]] to give it an \naward--good enough for that. Where were those voices then who are \ncomplaining about this program now? They were silent. Why? Because \nPresident Bush identified this as a program trying to make a \ndifference.\n  We will hear that program flyspecked on the floor of the Senate, but \nwhat you will not hear are those young voices. You will not see the \neyes of those young people on the floor of the Senate. You will not be \nable to shake their hands, as many of us have done, and hear them say, \n``Dr. Foster made a major difference in my life. He has given me real \nhope. I am staying in school. I am going on in school. I am \nabstaining.''\n  We will hear, ``Well, did the information really emphasize \nabstinence? When was it printed?''\n  You are missing the point. How many other doctors have really \nattempted to lead the country to try to do something about the problems \nof teenage pregnancy? How many others have tried to keep our young \npeople in school, as Dr. Foster has done? And how many have been a \nsource of inspiration, as he has?\n  I daresay, Mr. President, when you look at his commitment, when you \nlook at his dedication, he could have taken that medical diploma and \nbeen on easy street today. He did not have to go through this process. \nHe could have a good, solid income and be living in the best areas and \ncommunities of any city in this country. But he dedicated himself to \nthe people who are left behind in our society, those without. And he \nwas recognized by the Institute of Medicine as a leader of his field. \nDoes anybody understand how you get selected by the Institute of \nMedicine, one of the most prestigious and important academic \nachievements? Because of his record, because of his commitment. He has \nserved on ethical panels in his own State. He has assumed every kind of \nposition of leadership and distinction because of extraordinary \nservice. And he has been recognized by some of the most important \ncharitable organizations because of that leadership.\n  The Carnegie Foundation, that does so much work in terms of poor \nchildren, recognized his program. They reviewed it. He asked for help \nand assistance, technical help and assistance. And when he asked for \ntechnical help and assistance, those who are opposed to him say, ``Take \nthat letter. Look, he really didn't know what he was doing because he \nasked for technical help and assistance.'' It is the most convoluted \nrationale for opposition to this nominee.\n  Mr. President, this nominee by training, tradition, concern and \nconviction is a man who can serve this country, is a man who has been \ndedicated to youth, is a man who has been an outstanding researcher in \nsickle-cell anemia and infant mortality and perinatal kinds of \ndiseases. He is a man who can serve as Surgeon General with \ndistinction, and I hope he will be approved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield to the Senator from Maryland 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Good morning, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise this morning to lend my voice and \nmy vote to the nomination of Dr. Henry Foster to be Surgeon General of \nthe United States of America.\n  This morning I will be pleased to vote for Dr. Henry Foster to be the \nSurgeon General of the United States. Why? When I look at Dr. Foster, I \nsee a man who meets my criteria for the Surgeon General of the United \nStates. He has competence. He has character. He has commitment. He \nbrings bedrock values and the right professional credentials to the \noffice of the Surgeon General.\n  He is truly a leader, a man who leads by example. He leads by example \nin the way he has lived his life, both personally and professionally. \nDr. Foster has dedicated his life to improving people's health, \nparticularly the health of women and children, and most often the \nhealth of those who are without health care, those who have been left \nout, those who have been pushed aside, those who have been down and \nout.\n  When Dr. Foster returned from the U.S. military, he could have gone \nto a lucrative practice somewhere in the North and would have gone on \nto make a great medical contribution and, I am sure, would have made a \nlot more financial profit for his family. But he chose to go to the \nSouth. And to the South he went. And he reached out his very able hand \nto those in a segregated health care system that needed a doctor and \nneeded a medical helping hand.\n  That is who Dr. Foster is. He is a qualified professional bringing \ncompetence as a clinician, a medical administrator, and a scholar in \nresidence now. For 38 years, he has been a respected member of his own \nmedical community. He has been a medical professor and then even a dean \nof a medical school. He will bring great knowledge and expertise to the \nSurgeon General post. I believe he will serve with distinction.\n  In the debate, we will hear things about the Tuskegee study, the \nfamous study done on the issue of syphilis in which African-American \nmen did not know that they were being experimented on in his own \ncountry. You will also hear about how Dr. Foster participated in a \nstudy on hysterectomies and how some of the people involved were \nmentally retarded.\n  But let me tell you about that. There is much going to be said, what \ndid Dr. Foster know and what did Dr. Foster do?\n  In that area of the Tuskegee study, Dr. Foster told the committee \nthat he knew nothing about that Tuskegee study until years later. Now, \nthat will be disputed here this morning. I will tell you, as a member \nof something called the National Medical Society--because the AMA would \nnot let African-American doctors in--his own peers, if they knew that \nhe knew about the Tuskegee study, he would have been shunned and \nostracized in his own community. They would not have made him the dean \nof the medical school at one of the most distinguished, historically \nblack colleges in the United States of America.\n  Then they will talk about the fact that in a study that he did--not \nhysterectomies that he performed--mentally retarded girls were \ninvolved. There will be the issue of parental consent. Dr. Foster will \ntell you there was parental involvement. Now, are we going to dispute \nthat? Well, his peers in Nashville did not dispute it.\n  Then the medical society, when they finally admitted African-\nAmericans after all those years, they made him the head of the \nbioethical committee.\n  So who should judge who Dr. Foster is? Is it the U.S. Senate, who has \nonly gotten to know him or the people who have known him for 38 years \nin his own medical profession?\n  I say, let us go back home and talk to the people who knew Henry \nFoster, and they will tell you how he stands.\n  Now, Dr. Foster's character. Dr. Foster served as a captain in the \nU.S. Air Force. He brought character and competence, as I said, to that \njob. When he served willingly in the military, his character and \ncompetence were never questioned. So why should we question it now? He \nwillingly served in the U.S. military. America wanted him then. And I \nsay America wants him now. They want him to be the Surgeon General.\n  The Surgeon General's office is organized on a military model--\n``Surgeon General.'' And I believe that he will lead a campaign, a \ncampaign against teenage pregnancy, a campaign against infectious \ndisease. The Surgeon General will show that the triad for health care \nin the United States is prevention, primary care, and personal \nresponsibility. And that is the kind of campaign Dr. Foster will lead.\n  But while he is a great clinician, he brings old-fashioned values. As \na community leader in Nashville he did voluntary work in his own \ncommunity, serving on boards, including the March of Dimes, to lead the \nfight against birth defects. We have all heard a lot about how he has \nbeen a driving force behind the teenage pregnancy program, I Have a \nFuture. He won a point of light for that. I hope he will be more than a \npoint of light for the United States of America. I Have a Future \nstresses to the teens the importance of abstinence.\n  Mr. President, I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Two minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes. [[Page S \n8724]] \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I Have a Future stresses to teens the importance of \nabstinence and self-esteem and teaches teens to say ``no'' to teenage \npregnancy, and ``yes'' to abstinence, personal education and jobs. We \nsee under that program fewer teens getting pregnant and more young \npeople going to college.\n  Dr. Foster has dedicated his life to giving people chances, giving \nwomen the chances to have healthy babies, giving babies the chance to \nhave healthy childhoods, and giving the teens a chance to have a \nsuccessful future.\n  I say let us give Henry Foster a chance. Let us give him a chance. He \nis both a man of the mind and a man of the heart. He is a man of the \nmedical community and is involved in his own community and the kind of \nleader and distinguished public servant our country needs. I look \nforward to his tenure as the next Surgeon General. I hope we will not \ndeny him his day in the U.S. Senate by hiding behind a parliamentary \nmaneuver.\n  Mr. President, I yield such time as I might have left.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President?\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. President, \nin my view, as a matter of basic fairness, Dr. Henry Foster is entitled \nto his day in court. He is entitled to a vote on the merits without \nhaving a filibuster foreclose an up or down vote.\n  The real challenge in this matter is whether Dr. Foster is \ndisqualified from being Surgeon General of the United States because he \nhas performed abortions, a medical procedure lawful under the \nConstitution of the United States. This should not be a matter which is \ndebated on the floor of the U.S. Senate with respect to Dr. Foster's \nconfirmation. But that happens to be the fact of the matter. All of the \nother issues are red herrings. Dr. Foster acquitted himself brilliantly \nin his testimony before the committee. I met with Dr. Foster \nextensively, examined his record, and there is no question but on the \nmerits he is well qualified to be Surgeon General of the United States.\n  But the sole issue which confronts his confirmation today is that he \nhas performed abortions, a medical procedure lawful under the \nConstitution of the United States. We have to remember, Mr. President, \nthat it is not Roe versus Wade, the Justice Blackmun opinion of 1973, \nwhich governs here today but it is the decision of the Supreme Court of \nthe United States in Casey versus Planned Parenthood, written by three \nJustices appointed by Republican Presidents. And the matter ought not \nto be a partisan issue here. I suggest, Mr. President, that it is a \nvery bad precedent if there is to be a filibuster based on ideology.\n  Judge Thomas, when he was up for confirmation for the Supreme Court \nof the United States--now Justice Thomas--would have been foreclosed \nfrom confirmation had the same procedure, the same tactic been employed \nin reverse. Judge Thomas was confirmed to be Justice Thomas by a vote \nof 52 to 48. Had there been an ideological battle, Justice Thomas would \nnot have received 60 votes, and he would not have been confirmed. I \nsuggest that this is a very, very bad precedent, if we are going to \nstart fighting ideology on the floor of the U.S. Senate when it comes \nto the confirmation of someone who is before this body.\n  Now, Mr. President, we know that in last November's election, there \nwas a sea change by the American people. And we now have a new look in \nthe Congress of the United States. But I think it is important for \nSenators on both sides of the aisle to focus on the fact that there was \nnothing in the Contract With America on a woman's right to choose. \nThere was nothing in the Contract With America on the subject of \nabortion. There was nothing in the Contract With America that is \nlegitimately raised here in the consideration of the nomination of Dr. \nHenry Foster.\n  And I suggest, Mr. President, that if this body is going to become \nembroiled on this constitutional issue, a woman's right to choose, a \nmedical procedure sanctioned by the Supreme Court of the United States, \nwe are not going to be able to attend to our core responsibilities.\n  What the 104th Congress was elected to do is to reduce the size of \nGovernment, to cut spending, to balance the budget, to lower taxes, to \nhave effective crime control, and have strong national defense. It is \ntrue that this issue has come to the floor under a limited time \nagreement. But when this body takes up the question of abortions on \nmilitary bases, we will be discussing that for days, weeks, or perhaps \nmonths. This is not the kind of issue that ought to embroil the \nCongress of the United States, the Senate of the United States. The \nconstitutional law has been established in the building across the \ngreen by the Supreme Court of the United States and the opinion written \nby three Justices appointed by Republican Presidents. We ought not \nallow this ideological issue to obscure the underlying question as to \nwhether Henry Foster is qualified to be Surgeon General of the United \nStates.\n  If we become embroiled in these matters, we will not be doing the job \nthat we were sent to do in the 104th Congress. I urge my colleagues to \nset aside ideology, to recognize the constitutional right of a woman to \nchoose and not to disqualify this nominee because he is carrying out a \nmedical procedure which is authorized under the Constitution. Cloture \nought to be invoked, and this man ought to have his day in court, ought \nto have his day in the Senate on the merits, and if that is done, I \nbelieve he will be confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, what is the time that is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time remaining on your side is 71 minutes \nand 84 minutes 31 seconds on the other side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nMassachusetts and rise in strong support of the nomination of Dr. Henry \nFoster to be Surgeon General. While I am delighted that the day of \ndebate has finally arrived, I must say how unfortunate I find it that \nDr. Foster's nomination may be resolved--not by the will of the \nmajority--but by the minority rule permitted under the Senate's cloture \nrule, which was invoked here even before there was any debate.\n  I have long believed that every President deserves great deference in \nthe choice of nominees, provided that the individual is qualified for \nthe position for which he or she has been nominated. And because of \nthat belief, I have--over the years--cast votes for nominees for whom I \nhad little enthusiasm. This is not the case today. Today I can \nenthusiastically cast my vote for Dr. Foster, after having met him, \ntalked with him, and listened to him carefully during 2 full days of \ntestimony before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.\n  I believe that Dr. Foster is a man of substance, who has worked very \nhard all his life to achieve an unselfish kind of success. Dr. Foster \nwas raised in the rural South at a time of intense segregation, \nenduring those indignities with the kind of dignity, intelligence, and \nvision that enabled him both to see that he could achieve something \nimportant in his life--and to do it. He speaks eloquently of his \nfather's teachings of the value of education and hard work, and he has \nclearly incorporated those values into everything he has done \nthroughout his life.\n  Dr. Foster's credentials alone render him a qualified candidate for \nSurgeon General. A practicing obstetrician-gynecologist for 38 years, \nhe is also a medical educator who has devoted much of his professional \nlife to reducing infant mortality and preventing teen pregnancy. He has \nserved as both dean of the school of medicine and acting president of \nMeharry Medical College, and has been the recipient of many awards and \nhonors--too numerous to mention here--ranging from induction into the \nInstitute of Medicine to receiving a Thousand Points of Light Award \nfrom President Bush for his I Have a Future Program that promotes self-\nesteem and positive choices among at-risk teens.\n  But it is true that qualifications alone may not be sufficient for a \nperson to hold a position of leadership and [[Page S 8725]] trust in \nour Government. Especially with a position attracting as much attention \nas Surgeon General, it is important that the person appointed be an \nexample of the best that our country has to offer.\n  Mr. President, from what I have learned about Dr. Foster, I believe \nthat he is such a person. In addition to excellent academic and \nleadership qualifications, Dr. Foster has traveled an admirable path, \nin the early years forfeiting a life of wealth in a more comfortable \nsetting to return to his roots--this time to poor, rural Alabama--to \nhelp an underserved population that needed his care. Since then, Dr. \nFoster has helped train the minds and influence the careers of hundreds \nof Meharry Medical College students, many of whom have followed in his \nfootsteps.\n  While Dr. Foster's life and career have not been without their \ncontroversial moments, there are few, if any, individuals of prominence \nand principle in this country who have not experienced such moments in \nlife. I have reviewed carefully the information available to me about \nthose times in Dr. Foster's life and have asked him about others. I am \nsatisfied that Dr. Foster has told the truth about the discrepancies \nthat arose shortly after his nomination was announced, and I believe \nthat his actions can be explained in the context of the times and the \nnature of his work.\n  I have been most impressed by the strong support Dr. Foster has \nreceived from the medical community, from public health and social \nservice advocates, and from individuals in my State and around the \ncountry--including several Rhode Islanders who have contacted me to say \nthat they personally know and admire Dr. Foster. I hope that the U.S. \nSenate will look fairly at the man himself and consider carefully his \nstory, his dreams, his vision for the country, and his qualifications. \nI feel confident that it we do that, we will confirm the nomination of \na person of compassion, humor, and dedication, whom I believe deserves \nthe chance to serve his Nation as the next Surgeon General.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and the chairman of the \ncommittee. Let me say briefly, Mr. President, that first of all, I \nstrongly support this nomination. I believe Dr. Henry Foster is not \nonly deserving of a Senate vote but also deserving of an affirmative \nvote, confirming him as Surgeon General of the United States. And it \nshould be done so with a note of celebration.\n  It is, I think, a low moment for the U.S. Senate that we are going to \nbe engaged in a couple of cloture votes on this nomination. This is an \nindividual who has served his country, his community with great \ndistinction over four decades. It saddens me deeply that we are going \nto be engaged in a procedural approach to deny this individual a \nstraight up-or-down vote on his nomination, that you have to produce \nnow 60 votes in order to be confirmed as Surgeon General of the United \nStates, for an individual who, as everyone now knows, has been \nrecognized by his Governor, by a former President of the United States \nof the majority party for his contribution.\n  As I said, we should be celebrating his life and his contribution, \nrather than making him the subject of ridicule. I am just deeply \nsaddened that it has come to this, that we are engaged in procedural \nmaneuverings.\n  Let me put it bluntly, this is not about Dr. Foster. We are engaged \nin Presidential politics. That is what this is about. This is not a \nquestion of whether or not Dr. Foster deserves to be confirmed as the \nSurgeon General of the United States. This is a game of one-upmanship, \nin my view, and that is what it comes down to. Frankly, he is being \nused as a pawn in this process to advance the particular political \nagenda of candidates for an office that will not be decided for 18 \nmonths in this country. Anyone who suggests otherwise, I think, has not \nbeen around here in the last number of weeks.\n  This is a highly qualified individual, Mr. President. No one denies \nthe fact the White House did not handle this terribly well, but it is \nnot the White House that is up for confirmation this morning. It is Dr. \nHenry Foster. Be angry at the White House if you want, suggest they \nmight handle the process in a more efficient manner, but do not make \nDr. Foster the victim of that criticism, however legitimate it may be.\n  This is an individual, as I mentioned, who gave four decades of his \nlife to helping others and could have easily just retired, enjoyed the \ncomforts that his profession might offer him through whatever financial \nremuneration he might receive, rather than stepping forward and to \naccept the position of Surgeon General of the United States.\n  The President has identified a very critical and important issue, and \nthat is teen pregnancy. Dr. Foster has run a program in Tennessee \ncalled I Have a Future. That program has its difficulties. Our \ndistinguished chairperson of the Labor Committee has identified some \nareas where she thinks the success of the program has not been as \nstrong as it could be. That may very well be the case. I am not even \ngoing to argue about that. The point is, and I say it with all due \nrespect, at least he is trying, he is trying to do something about it.\n  Programs have been tried and failed across this country, but people \nstep up and try to do something about a plague in our Nation--and that \nis kids having kids. Every American citizen in this country knows what \na serious problem it is. Here is a doctor in Tennessee who, on his own \ninitiative, went out and said, ``I think I will roll up my sleeves and \ntry and do something about it.'' And so he tries, and he has great \nsuccess, I point out. An overwhelming majority of these kids have \ncompleted high school, many have gone on to college, trying to get \ntheir lives straightened out\n setting an example of how you can achieve success, deferring the \ngratification that too many youngsters in this country do not \nunderstand or appreciate the benefits of avoiding.\n\n  So this individual does that, is involved in a variety of community \nactivities over the years, and receives one of President Bush's points \nof light. Lamar Alexander asks him to head up an infant mortality \nprogram in the State. And then an American President says, ``Would you \nserve as a Surgeon General and come up here and see if we cannot come \nup with a national program to deal with this issue?'' Here is a man who \nwas the first African-American to be in medical school in Arkansas \nyears ago, who struggled against all of the problems associated with \nbeing an African-American through the 1940's and 1950's and 1960's, who \nserved his country in uniform. He comes through this process and all of \na sudden he goes through this wringing, wrenching process because he \nhappens to be an obstetrician-gynecologist, one of 35,000 of them in \nthe country, who has performed abortions, a legal procedure.\n  Obviously, there are those who disagree with abortion. Are we saying \nhere this morning that anybody out there who is an obstetrician-\ngynecologist better never come forward and try to seek a position in \nthe Federal Government, particularly a confirmable position; do not \neven think about it?\n  I heard the other day from people when I asked them whether or not \nthey would be willing to step forward and seek a position. I talked to \nyoung people and said, ``Would you ever think about serving your \nGovernment if asked to serve?'' They laughed. There was uproarious \nlaughter when I suggested it. Two got up and said, ``What did Dr. \nFoster go through? Do you think I would ever be willing to go through \nthat process?''\n  We better think twice about what we are doing when we drag people \nlike this through the mud and deny them an opportunity to serve. No \nsound-thinking person having witnessed what this man has gone through \nwould step forward. We are doing great damage by engaging in a cloture \nmotion here. Let us vote this man up or down. If you do not like him, \nvote against him, but do not deny him the opportunity to receive, I \nthink, the majority of votes he would receive in this body, and let him \ndo his job as Surgeon General. We do not do ourselves proud by going \nthrough a process like this.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  [[Page S 8726]]\n  \n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 seconds. We have the \nmembers of the committee that were here this morning prepared to debate \nthese issues that have been raised. We have read about them in the \nnewspapers, we have heard about them on radio, and we have watched them \non television. We believe they have been answered. We are prepared to \ndebate.\n  I hope we are not going to be in the situation where we are using up \nour time in the last hour and we do not have an opportunity because we \nhave those who want to speak and advocate for Dr. Foster. We have had \nnow close to 45 minutes, and I have other Senators eager to address the \nSenate in support of this. We are trying to deal with these issues. We \nare here and we want to debate this. This is enormously important.\n  So I hope that we can at least engage and respond. I think the \nAmerican people want that. This is a very, very important matter. There \nhave been a lot of charges made. We are prepared to respond to them. \nBut we do not want to be unfair to Dr. Foster by denying the \nopportunity for our colleagues here that are interested in this in the \nSenate, and certainly the American people, who are paying attention to \nthis debate, to be able to make the case for him.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, if I may respond to the ranking \nmember, the Senator from Massachusetts, there are many Members on our \nside, of course, members of the committee, as well as others, who do \nwish to respond. Many could not be here until between now and 10 \no'clock. So it, unfortunately, appears that your side is using more \ntime than ours. I will do the best that I can to encourage Members to \ncome to the floor because time is going by. Many have wanted to give, \nand will give, some very strong statements.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Kennedy, for \nthe time and also for his leadership here.\n  Strangely, the issue of abortion is dominating our consideration. \nHere is an obstetrician/gynecologist who has delivered over 10,000 \nbabies and was involved in 39 abortions, some of which he was just the \nsupervising physician, where his name is on record. If he is confirmed, \nthere will not be one additional abortion in this country because he is \na Surgeon General of the United States--maybe less, but not more. I say \n``maybe less'' because I concur completely with what Senator Dodd had \nto say about the I Have a Future Foundation.\n  Here is a distinguished physician who took an interest in teenagers \nin a public housing project, and the statistics are squishy because \nthey move in and out. But there is one statistic no one questions, \nwhich is that the dropout rate for these young people changed \ndramatically. And that has a great deal to do with abortion. There are \na lot of things we do not know, but we do know that girls, as well as \nboys, who complete high school are much less likely to become pregnant \nand become teenage parents.\n  There are 1 million teenage pregnancies in this country, 400,000 of \nwhich end up in abortions. He could have ducked that. He could have \nbeen home watching television. He could have gone to the country club \nand played golf instead of working with teenagers. And he cared. We \nhave an opportunity to nominate someone and to approve someone who \ncares.\n  Dr. Foster, if you are listening and viewing this somewhere, let me \ntell you that this is not a judgment on you that is being made in the \nU.S. Senate. You can be proud of your record; your family can be proud \nof your record; your profession can be proud of your record; your \ncountry can be proud of your record. What we are doing is making a \njudgment about the U.S. Senate, about whether we have the courage to do \nwhat is right. I am sure the chairwoman would agree with me on this. \nThere was not a single member of the committee who listened to his \ntestimony that did not come away very much impressed by Dr. Foster. If \npeople had not taken positions prior to his testimony, he would be \noverwhelmingly approved here. We are judging ourselves.\n  Senator Specter mentioned Justice Thomas when he was up. Senator \nKennedy and I were on the Judiciary Committee and strongly opposed him. \nTed Kennedy did not get up here and try to have a filibuster. Paul \nSimon did not try to have a filibuster. We let the process work. That \nis what we ought to do. That is what we ought to do in fairness to Dr. \nFoster, but it is also what we ought to do in fairness to the process, \nin fairness to the U.S. Senate.\n  I hope we do the right thing, and the right thing is to let us make a \njudgment whether or not he should serve as Surgeon General of the \nUnited States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Is there some event going on that the other side does not \nwant to show up this morning on this?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself a couple of minutes. I thought we were \nsupposed to meet at 9 o'clock, in any event, to go over the job \ntraining----\n  Mr. DODD. Hark, hark, I hear the roar of an angel here. The magic \nwords and the doors open. We may now get some time on the other side.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman for \nyielding. I rise in opposition to the Foster nomination.\n  Elections have consequences. I think democracy is based on the \nprinciple that when the American people go to the polls and vote, that \nvote has an impact on government. I think when the American people \nvoted for Bill Clinton, they either knew or should have known that his \nPresidency was going to mean a bigger Government. It was going to mean \nmore spending. It was going to mean more taxes. It was going to mean \nmore decisions made in Washington and fewer decisions made around the \nkitchen table. It was going to mean, on political appointments, that \nliberals were going to be nominated.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, we have considered hundreds of Clinton \nnominees. I am not aware of one who represented my philosophy or my \nvalues. Yet, with the exception of a small handful of those nominees, I \nhave either voted for them or I have allowed them to pass without a \nvote. Why? Because I think philosophy alone is not grounds for voting \nagainst confirmation of any nominee, including Dr. Foster.\n  What I have tried to do is to set out three criteria for considering \na nominee: No. 1, is the nominee competent for the position? No. 2, is \nthe nominee credible? Can you believe what the nominee says? Is the \nnominee trustworthy in his or her career? No. 3, are the nominee's \nviews--in the case of Bill Clinton--mainstream Democrat Party views of \nthe type that the American people could have believed, could have \nknown, or could have been expected to have known would be reflected in \nthe people that Bill Clinton--as they would have known him and \nperceived him in the 1992 election--would nominate?\n  It is on the basis of these three criteria that I oppose the Foster \nnomination and will resist the nomination with my colleagues. It is on \nthe basis of that opposition, on these three criteria, that we are \ngoing to have two votes on cloture. I hope and believe that those \ncloture motions will be defeated, and that the Foster nomination will \nnot go forward.\n  Let me start with competence. Dr. Foster has held two important \npositions in his career that have been pointed out as his \nqualifications for this office. No. 1, Dr. Foster was the head of \nMeharry Medical College's obstetrics-gynecology residency program. \nDuring his tenure as head of that department, that program lost its \naccreditation.\n  I do not believe that is a strong recommendation. I do not believe \nDr. Foster's record of having allowed the department, under his \nleadership, to lose its accreditation, is a qualification to hold a \nposition which, in essence, is a position as America's physician. In \nthat position he would oversee the presentation of reports and would \nactually make substantive decisions that would be binding on other \nmembers of the Government.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will not yield. I would be happy to yield when I finish. \nIf you want to yield on your time, Senator Kennedy, I would be happy to \nyield on your time, but I only have 15 minutes.\n  No. 2, Dr. Foster served as director of the I Have a Future Program. \nIn the [[Page S 8727]] stated mission is, to ``address the burgeoning \nproblem of adolescent pregnancy.'' That is the stated goal of the \nprogram.\n  We have heard repeatedly Dr. Foster's leadership in this program \nstated as a qualification for being Surgeon General. Now, on two \noccasions, and only two occasions that I am aware of, there were \nevaluations of this program. In both evaluations, the 1992 evaluation \nand the 1994 evaluation, evidence, that was in no way challenged by the \npeople who were running this program, was clearly presented that showed \nthe program had failed to produce any change in adolescent pregnancy \namong the people who were involved in the program as compared to the \npeople who were not involved.\n  In both evaluations, any difference in pregnancy rates that existed--\napparently a slightly higher level in the first study, a slightly lower \nlevel in the second study--were considered statistically insignificant. \nIn neither case did these two evaluations find any statistically \nsignificant difference in teen pregnancy rates among people in this \nprogram.\n  On the two major positions that Dr. Foster has held--the head of a \ndepartment of a medical school which lost its accreditation under his \nleadership, and a program funded by charitable contributions which did \nnot, in either study reporting on its achievements, achieve its goal--I \ndo not believe that any private personnel firm in America would have \nrecommended Henry Foster for a position in the private sector of the \neconomy, based on these two factors, or would have ever come forward \nwith his name as someone qualified to be Surgeon General.\n  I am not going to get into the credibility issue because it will be \ndiscussed at length by my colleagues. On virtually every issue, from \nthe number of abortions he performed, to whether or not it was standard \npractice to have involuntary sterilization of mentally incompetent \npeople, to the very nature of the I Have a Future Program, or from the \nsimple question of whether Dr. Foster had ever had a malpractice suit \nor been the subject of litigation, on almost every subject which was \nraised in the hearing, in almost everything which has been debated, in \nalmost every issue that has come from the White House or come from Dr. \nFoster, there has been a consistent credibility problem.\n  Now, I want to get to the real reason that I am opposed to this \nnomination. We have two good reasons that anybody could be opposed to \nit. I oppose it for those reasons. But the real reason I oppose it is, \nthe American people would have had no reason to believe that the Bill \nClinton running for office in 1992 who became President would have \nappointed such a person. They would have every reason to believe it \ntoday.\n  In 1995, after Joycelyn Elders, after gays in the military, after the \nClinton Justice Department has entered every suit involving quotas and \nset-asides on the side of quotas and set-asides, after a series of \nappointments of people who hold radical views, today, no one is \nsurprised.\n  Let me read four brief statements that in 1992, as candidate for \nPresident, Bill Clinton said. No. 1, ``I want the American people to \nknow that a Clinton administration will put their values into our \nsocial policy at home;'' No. 2, ``I want an America where family values \nlive in our actions, not just in our speeches;'' No. 3, ``The thing \nthat makes me angriest about what's gone wrong in the last 12 years is \nthat our Government has lost touch with our values while our \npoliticians continue to shout about them;'' and finally, ``We offer our \npeople a new choice based on old values.''\n  Now, some people have said this is a debate about abortion. To some \nextent, it is a debate about abortion. But it is a debate about radical \nviews on abortion that were held by Joycelyn Elders and that are held \ntotally and completely by Dr. Foster.\n  The view that, No. 1, we should not have parental notification for \nminors, a view that the vast majority of American people do not share. \nA view that abortion on demand should everywhere be the rule and the \nguiding principle, even in late abortions, even in those cases where \nStates, today, are trying to exercise their legitimate rights under the \nWebster decision.\n I do not believe those views represent traditional American values. I \ndo not believe they represent the will of the American people. And, \nfinally, let me read one little quote which tells the whole story, from \nthe ``I Have A Future, Family Life Module Staff Manual'' from September \n1994, which was sent by the White House to the committee as a summation \nof the work of Dr. Foster on this program. Let me read one quote.\n\n       Values are neither good nor bad. They are the way you feel.\n       Values are neither good nor bad. They are the way you feel.\n\n  That in no way represents in any degree the statements that Bill \nClinton made throughout his 1992 campaign. The Foster nomination is a \nnomination of a person who does not represent the traditional values of \nthe American people and a person whose views are radical as compared to \ntheirs and outside the mainstream that could have been expected of Bill \nClinton when he was a candidate in 1992.\n  Final point: Why filibuster? Why not bring this up for just a simple \nvote and let the majority rule? The Founders, in setting the rules of \nthe Senate, felt that if a determined minority had strong views that in \norder to shut off debate, it would require a supermajority. That \nprovision has been used on numerous occasions by both parties and, by \nand large, it has served the interests of the public well. When \nJoycelyn Elders was nominated by the President, based on her record, \nbased on her credibility, based on her qualifications, and based on how \nher views compared to the views of candidate Bill Clinton in 1992, I \nstrongly opposed her nomination. But this was early in the process. We \ndid not know what she would be like as a Surgeon General, and so no one \nprevented the vote.\n  We now have seen a disastrous tenure by Joycelyn Elders. We have seen \na tenure that has divided the country. And I do not believe that we \nshould confirm a candidate for Surgeon General whose views are \nidentical to Joycelyn Elders' in nearly every way.\n  We made a mistake on Joycelyn Elders by not denying a vote on her \nnomination. That was a mistake I, for one, was determined not to make \nagain.\n  Now, I believe that this is a nominee who is wrong for this job. If \nthere is one position in Government that ought to be easy to fill, it \nought to be Surgeon General. The duty of Surgeon General is to use \nmoral suasion on public health issues. The duty of the Surgeon General \nis to unite the Nation in promoting good public health. And that ought \nto be an easy thing to do because nobody is opposed to good public \nhealth.\n  Surely, there must be one physician in America who voted for Bill \nClinton, who supports him, who shares his views as stated in the \ncampaign, who could do that job. Unfortunately, Dr. Foster is not such \na nominee. I oppose his nomination. I have determined, along with my \ncolleagues, to vigorously oppose it, to require that there be a vote on \nending debate. For the sake of saving the time of the Senate, we have \nagreed to a procedure to vote on it not once but twice so certainly no \none can say they did not get the opportunity to end this debate. But I \noppose this nomination. This is the wrong person with the wrong views \nfor the wrong job. I think we can serve the public interest by saying \n``no.'' I think ``no'' is the right answer. I am confident we are going \nto say it.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding me the time and I yield back my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to yield myself just a \nminute. Does the Senator from Texas understand why the accreditation \nwas lost during that period of time? Does the Senator understand? Has \nhe had an opportunity to review the record and see the excellent \nexchange between Dr. Frist and Dr. Foster on the issue of accreditation \nthat responds to that point that the Senator has made?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I have had an opportunity to look at that. But I think the \nfact remains, whatever you are going to say about an individual and \nabout his efforts, when you are talking about promoting a person to be \nthe Nation's chief physician, it is not a qualification under any \ncircumstance to say that under his stewardship his department at his \nmedical school lost its accreditation. No matter how or why or what the \ncircumstances, I do not think [[Page S 8728]] anybody would say that is \na qualification. Nor do I believe that his I Have A Future Program, \nwhen the only two evaluations that were ever done, to the best of my \nknowledge, showed it had absolutely no statistically significant effect \non the objective it sought, should be considered a qualification.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield time to myself. I wish the \nSenator had a chance to review the record, because the issue of \naccreditation was addressed very credibly by Senator Frist, talking \nabout exactly what happened, the loss of patients and the change of \ndemography there and the leadership that was provided by Dr. Foster.\n  These are the kinds of issues that have been reviewed and re-reviewed \nand re-reviewed. I think having his comments about that and putting \nthat in perspective has certainly responded to this kind of a charge.\n  I think we have gone through the issue--I will yield myself 30 more \nseconds--about I Have A Future. At least Dr. Foster tried and he was \ngiven an award by the President of the United States, George Bush. I \ndid not hear the complaints about that program at the time when \nPresident Bush was identifying it. There is a solid record that they \nreduced the dropouts, continued education, and went on to successful \ncareers.\n  I do not know whether the Senator had a chance to meet with many of \nthose who came through the program of I Have A Future, because they \ncame here and spoke to Members of the Senate who were prepared to meet \nwith them, to talk about exactly the kind of difference that Dr. Foster \nhad made in their lives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield the junior Senator from Oklahoma \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank my colleague for yielding a few minutes here.\n  Mr. President, I was not planning to speak on this nomination today \nbut while presiding for an hour and listening to some of the debate \nthat has taken place, I felt compelled to do so because I think there \nis a misunderstanding as to why some of us are going to be opposing the \nnomination of Henry Foster.\n  I disagree with my friend, the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSpecter, when he said that abortion is the sole issue. Abortion is not \nthe sole issue in this nomination. I happen to be pro-life. It would be \nan issue with me if it were the sole issue, but it is not. The issue \nhere in my opinion is credibility. I want to make it abundantly clear, \nwhen I vote against the nomination of Henry Foster to be Surgeon \nGeneral, it is not because of his pro-abortion stand, or the abortion \nissue. It is his credibility.\n  I suggest that we recall--I do not think anyone in this Chamber knows \nwhat his real position is or how many abortions he performed because \nthere has been such a variance in what he has reported and what he has \nsaid. I can remember when his name first came up and there was an \narticle written in the Washington Post quoting him, quoting the White \nHouse, saying he had performed one abortion in his career.\n  Then, on February 3, 1995, the Department of Health and Human \nServices released a statement by Dr. Foster which stated, ``I believe \nthat I have performed fewer than a dozen pregnancy terminations.'' This \nwas a statement by Dr. Foster.\n  Then, back on November 10, way back in 1978, Dr. Foster, as a member \nof the Department of Health, Education and Welfare Ethics Advisory \nBoard, is recorded in an official Government transcript saying, ``I \nhave done a lot of therapeutic abortions, probably near 700.''\n  The documentation of that is HEW Ethics Advisory Board Meeting, \nFriday, November 10, 1978, Seattle, WA, page 180. The White House first \nclaimed that the transcript was not genuine but later admitted its \nauthenticity.\n  Dr. Foster initially claimed the transcript was inaccurate, that he \ndid not make the statement nor did he do what the statement said, but \nlater he said he did not remember making the statement.\n  At about the same time, in November 1980, OB/GYN News published a \nstory regarding a study conducted on behalf of Upjohn Pharmaceuticals \nby Dr. Foster at Meharry Medical College in Nashville to develop an \nabortion pill based on the chemical prostaglandin. Dr. Foster has \nadmitted that he was the research director of a clinical study in which \n55 chemical abortions and 4 surgical abortions were performed on women \nparticipating in the study.\n Appearing on ABC's ``Nightline'' Program on February 8, 1995, Dr. \nFoster stated he was the physician of record in 39 abortions since \n1973, since Roe versus Wade. He stated that the number of 39 did not \ninclude any of the 59 performed as a part of the study noted above \nsince while he supervised the trial he did not personally perform these \nabortions.\n\n  So, Mr. President, to me regardless of whether your feelings are \nabout abortions--again, I am pro-life--the fact is that either his \nmemory is very bad or he has a habit of saying things that are not \ntrue. The inconsistencies are incontrovertible. I agree with my friend \nfrom Texas. But I think it is one more very significant reason to vote \nagainst the nomination of Henry Foster; and, that is, he says things \nthat are not true.\n  So, Mr. President, I wanted to clarify why I will be opposing the \nnomination of Henry Foster.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to put in the \nRecord the report of the Carnegie Corporation of May 3, 1995. They are \nthe one funding the I Have a Future Program. This is what they say:\n\n       By 1994, a significant proportion of the young people who \n     received ``I Have a Future Services'' showed improvement on \n     several measures of success, compared to a control group. The \n     Corporation has worked with Meharry Medical College in \n     developing the program, and Meharry has been responsive to \n     recommendations for ways to improve the research design and \n     the curriculum. The Meharry team has courageously and \n     thoughtfully tackled an important and difficult problem. ``I \n     Have a Future'' should have useful lessons to impart to \n     others attempting to enhance the life options of young people \n     caught in adverse circumstances.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the Carnegie Corporation of New York, May 3, 1995]\n\n                            I Have a Future\n\n       Carnegie Corporation of New York funded the ``I Have a \n     Future'' program from its inception in 1986. ``I Have a \n     Future'' is a life options program addressing the multiple \n     risks that many young people face in adverse circumstances--\n     the risk of school failure leading toward dropping out, the \n     risks of early pregnancy, the risks of drug abuse, and the \n     risk of delinquency.\n       The program takes a comprehensive, problem-solving approach \n     to the underlying factors involved in high-risk behaviors. It \n     works to enhance young people's self-esteem, positive \n     feelings toward family members, and a sense of responsibility \n     toward their community. It urges them to pursue their \n     education through high school and beyond and tries to give \n     them a real sense of future possibilities.\n       The program combines many of the elements that researchers \n     and practitioners agree are found in successful intervention \n     programs for high-risk youth. These include individualized \n     attention, collaboration with other community agencies, staff \n     with specialized training, social skills training that helps \n     adolescents both resist negative peer influences and adopt \n     health enhancing behaviors, peer support, the involvement of \n     parents, career/life planning, and opportunities for \n     community service.\n       By 1994, a significant proportion of the young people who \n     received ``I Have a Future Services'' showed improvement on \n     several measures of success, compared to a control group.

They are the ones who have done the \nevaluation. This is their bottom line.\n  I withhold the rest of our time.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Louisiana 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues, in considering the confirmation of a \nPresidential nominee I think that we as [[Page S 8729]] Members of the \nSenate have an obligation to vote on the merits of the nominee's \nqualifications. I intend to vote for cloture so that we can vote on the \nmerits of this nomination later.\n  I have differed with some of the President's nominees. In fact, I \nvoted against President Clinton's previous nominee for Surgeon General. \nI feel very strongly that the Senate should not hide behind procedural \nvotes that present the question of the nominee's qualifications from \neven coming up. We should have the courage to bring the nomination up, \ndebate his qualifications, and then vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on the \nmerits. I realize that there are differences of opinion among our \ncolleagues on this nominee, and indeed, on what the proper role of the \nOffice of the Surgeon General should be. This I would suggest should be \ndebated and decided by a vote of the Senate on the merits.\n  I have met with Dr. Foster in my office and discussed his views and \nalso his past practices. He has family connections to my State of \nLouisiana, and I found him to be a very sincere person. I think, Mr. \nPresident, that the Senate owes the President and this nominee a vote \non his qualifications and not just a vote on whether to even bring it \nup.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nMassachusetts, and I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this Senator has been serving the Senate now for 17 \nyears representing my people of the great State of Nebraska and in \nspeaking for them I have tried to support the wishes of the Presidents \nof the United States from all different parties whomever they wish to \nplace in their key positions. I have not always done so, because I \nthink everyone should be looked at on an individual basis.\n  Like the Senator from Louisiana who just spoke, this Senator voted \nagainst the last nomination by President Clinton for the position that \nis now being debated with regard to Dr. Foster. I never as long as I \nhave been here have taken part in a filibuster to try to thwart the \nwill of the majority of this body and the elected President of the \nUnited States, whether that President be a Democrat or a Republican, to \ngo the filibuster route and thwart the will of the majority of this \nbody.\n  Mr. President, it seems to this Senator that the debate on the Foster \nnomination has simply deteriorated into a series of pronouncements by \nhis opponents as to how they have come to principled reasons for voting \nagainst him.\n  I may be wrong. But it is the opinion of this Senator that Dr. Foster \nis being crucified on the altar of Presidential politics, pure, and \nsimple. That is not what all of the opponents of Dr. Foster are \nthinking in my mind. But it is to a considerable extent of some who are \nproviding leadership. I think crucifying someone to enhance someone \nelse's Presidential ambitions is a sorry sight, indeed, to see \nhappening on the floor of the supposedly deliberative body that makes \nup the U.S. Senate.\n  I guess the feelings about abortion of this Senator are somewhat \nlegendary in this body. I suspect that Dr. Foster and I do not see eye \nto eye on the matter of abortion. But despite the many pronouncements \nto the contrary, I believe any reasoned, seasoned interest of the U.S. \nSenate would recognize and realize that in all too many cases votes \nwill be cast one way or other on this nomination driven by one's \nfeelings or pressure groups on abortion.\n  Having said that, I probably do not agree directly with Dr. Foster on \nabortion, but I still say that all of the abortions that he has been \ninvolved in, as near as I can tell, are fully legal. He has broken no \nlaw of the United States of America. He has broken no laws of the \nprofessional organizations to wish he is a very prestigious member.\n  I sat down with Dr. Foster in a one-on-one meeting not long ago. I \ncame away from that meeting convinced that here is a family physician \nthat I would like to have being the family physician of my family.\n  How then could I not vote to support his nomination even though we \nmight not agree on all issues? He is a very decent human being. He is \nan understanding human being. He has the bedside manners, if you will, \nof what most of us would think of as a family physician.\n  He is very much concerned about the falling morality in this country. \nNo one has spoken out more effectively, in my view, than Dr. Foster \nwith regard to out-of-wedlock births and what we are going to do about \nit. Certainly there has been some confusion with regard to some \noriginating statements that came out of the White House early in the \nnomination process. But there are few among us who have never made some \nmistakes, made some errors. I do not think any of those mistakes or \nerrors on the part of Dr. Foster were intentional or plotted or \ndesigned to mislead. I think he made some mistakes. Who of us has not \nmade some mistakes?\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, that we in the Senate have an \nobligation to have a majority vote, if you will, on nominees for \nimportant high office sent to us for confirmation by the President of \nthe United States. So I will vote for cloture.\n  I think it is somewhat discouraging that by and large Dr. Foster is \nbeing crucified on the altar of Presidential politics; that we are even \nhaving a filibuster and a cloture vote. But I do not object to the \nright of my colleagues, mostly on the other side of the aisle, who \nchoose this route. That is within their right. I think it is not \nplaying fair with Dr. Foster or a qualified nominee sent us for \nconfirmation by the President.\n  So I hope that the Senate will have the courage to rise above the \nobvious attempt to crucify Dr. Foster for the sake of partisan \nPresidential politics. It is wrong. It should not be a part of this \nprocess. And I hope the Senate will rise to the occasion and enough \nMembers on that side of the aisle will recognize that despite some \nreservations they might have, and in some cases legitimately so, the \nright way to proceed on this is to stop the filibuster, invoke cloture, \nand then let the Senate adopt by majority vote its will. For the Senate \nto adopt a majority vote under its will will require some help from the \nRepublican side of the aisle. We do not have enough votes on this side.\n  Mr. President, I thank my friend from Massachusetts, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Today we face a set of questions. They are serious questions. They \nare questions of procedure, of principle, questions of candor and \nquestions of credibility, for today we begin a debate not only about \nthe qualifications of an individual to serve as Surgeon General but \nabout the terms under which that debate will take place. It is a debate \nneither easily resolved nor easily limited. Neither is it a debate to \nbe taken lightly.\n  There are those who have said that the Surgeon General's office is an \noffice of just a handful of people, that takes up less than $5 million \nof the taxpayers' money and therefore does not deserve the scrutiny \nthat it has been given.\n  I disagree. The office of Surgeon General speaks with enormous \ninfluence and persuasion. Power of the position lies not in its \nlegislative authority but in its ability to influence both the tone and \nthe content of our national conversation concerning some of the most \nprofound challenges that we face. And today the office of Surgeon \nGeneral is in serious need of repair. It is an office that has been \ndiscredited by the reckless agenda and the damaging statements of its \nlast occupant.\n  What we really need now, what we need today, is a Surgeon General of \nimpeccable credentials and unquestionable credibility. We need a \nnational doctor who commands the confidence of the people and who can \nunite us in tackling our most pressing pathologies. When you need a \ndoctor, you need someone that you can trust; you need someone of \nreliability; you need someone of consistency. You do not want to go \nback with the same symptoms and get a different diagnosis in each \nvisit. You do not want to have a different prescription. You need the \nconfidence of knowing that what is said is what is believed and what \nwill be followed. [[Page S 8730]] \n  We have pressing challenges. We have pressing pathologies. They are \npressing. Whether it is the continuing scourge of cancer, the crisis of \ndrugs, or the tragedy of illegitimacy, the problems are apparent and \nyet the solutions are not so apparent.\n  There are those in this administration who look at these problems and \nsay that the only solution is to accommodate people in their problems. \nTo teens in the back seat of a car they would say, ``Better use a \ncondom'' when they should be saying ``Stop. Get out; change your way of \nliving.'' To addicts on the street, they would say, ``Better use a \nclean needle,'' when they should be saying, ``Stop. Get help; change \nyour way of living.'' We do not need those who would say, ``How can we \nhelp you in a lifestyle which is threatening your health and the health \nof the American people?'' What we do need are people and leaders who \nwill appeal to us at our best, who will appeal to the better angels of \nour nature, not seek to accommodate the basest of human desires. We \nneed leaders who will agree with the great English writer and thinker \nG.K. Chesterton who wrote, ``What is wrong is that we do not ask what \nis right.''\n  We should be seeking to ask every individual, especially those faced \nby serious health challenges, how can we avoid these health challenges? \nHow can we provide a healthy Nation by having the kind of consistent \napproach to behavior that will improve substantially where we are?\n  Frankly, there is not a lot that is right with this nomination. \nInitial appearances and claims were deceiving. If we were to just take \nwhat was originally given us, if we were to truncate or shorten the \ninvestigation, if we were to limit the debate, over and over again in \nthis nomination we would find ourselves acting on the basis of \ninaccurate and false data, acting on the basis of alleged conclusions \nunsupported by the facts.\n  In a rush to market this nominee, the Clinton administration has \ndisplayed a reckless indifference to the evidence and a casual \ndisregard for substantiating documentation. The frequent contradictions \nand serious misrepresentations about both the background and record of \nDr. Henry Foster and about the performance of the I have a future \nprogram have in my mind seriously undermined the credibility of this \nnominee. They have led to confusion and to controversy surrounding the \nnomination. They have made any notion of a brief debate about this \nnominee impossible.\n  Let me just recap for a moment. Dr. Foster was introduced to the \nAmerican people as the architect of a program touted as an abstinence-\nbased program. The fact. It turns out that the program is based on \nweekly contraceptive distributions. A program which alleges a focus on \nabstinence has been unable to produce any abstinence brochures \ndeveloped, produced, or updated under Dr. Foster's leadership. In fact, \nthe only brochures that could be located regarding abstinence were \nbrochures written, published, and printed after Dr. Foster's nomination \nand after the controversy over Dr. Foster's so-called abstinence \nprogram began.\n  Dr. Foster was introduced to the American people as a man behind the \nprogram touted as preventing teen pregnancies. President Clinton called \nit an unqualified success.\n  Well, it turns out, according to its own data, participants were more \nlikely to have had sex than nonparticipants, and that contraceptive use \nwas not increased among those who were participants as compared to \nthose who were nonparticipants.\n  Maybe President Clinton was half right in calling the program an \nunqualified success. It certainly was not a success, but it was \nunqualified in terms of helping these young people, for more of the \nyoung people had been involved in sexual activity who participated in \nthe program than those who never even participated in the program. And \naccording to the reports promulgated or published by the program \nitself, the words of the report say that there was no statistically \nsignificant difference in pregnancy rates between those participating \nin the program and those not participating in the program.\n  And as Dr. David Murray of the nonpartisan research group STATS, \nstated:\n\n       The program's statistical results do not support the notion \n     that pregnancy prevention or even lowering the risk of \n     pregnancy follows from program participation.\n\n  Dr. Foster was introduced to the American people as the doctor behind \na program extolled as reaching multitudes of children. It turns out \nthat more individuals drop out of the program than persist in the \nprogram for complete participation.\n  Just a week after the Labor Committee nomination hearings, I received \na letter from Dr. Foster stating that he had inadvertently \nmisrepresented his position to me when I asked about additional \nstatistics or studies on the I Have a Future Program. During the \nhearing, it became apparent from the studies that were available that \nthe program's marks were not high, that it was not achieving its \nintended result.\n  So I asked if there were other studies, if there had been other data \naccumulated, if there were evaluations, and he clearly answered no. But \nhis letter which he sent to me says that what he should have said was, \n``Yes, there are other statistics.'' As a matter of fact, there was not \nonly an additional study but an independent analysis of that additional \nstudy. And this additional material reinforced the conclusions earlier \nmade about the failure of the program; as a matter of fact, material \nwhich suggested a counterproductivity of the effort altogether.\n  But the additional material, that kind of a contradiction, just \nserved to underscore and undermine further the credibility of this \nnomination, a credibility which was not sustainable and believable as \nit related to the number of abortions conducted, was not sustainable or \nbelievable about the quality and nature of the studies, was not \nsustainable or believable about the impact on young people.\n  As we consider a vote to decide whether or not we are going to have a \ncomplete, open and full debate on this nominee or whether or not we are \ngoing to cut off debate rather quickly, these revelations point toward \nmore debate, more scrutiny, more exposure, not less. For it seems the \nmore we probe, the more we discover, and never in this nomination have \nwe found that the initial representations were supported by the \nevidence or the facts. It is always that the additional revelations \nsomehow contradicted what the marketing by this administration had \nbeen.\n  Dr. Foster is a decent man who should be commended for his dedication \nand service to a desperately needy population. I do not think anyone \nwould contradict that. But his nomination is more than a matter of \npersonality, it is about standards of credibility and integrity, and it \nis about the belief in what things will remediate the pressing \npathologies of our society. It is about an exceptional situation where \nan office has been discredited by an individual, our last Surgeon \nGeneral, who discredited not only the office but the administration \nthat she served. It is about this nomination, and this consideration is \na debate about substantial and gross inconsistencies and contradictions \nthat will continue to swirl around the nominee.\n  I believe that we need a nominee who inspires unquestioned \nconfidence. We need someone that we have the kind of faith in that we \nexpect in our family doctor. This nominee does not pass that test. The \nprocess has not provided a basis for that kind of belief.\n  The questions remaining are serious enough that I voted against this \nnomination in committee, and I believe that they are serious enough \nthat we should all vote against any measure that would limit the debate \nover this nomination today.\n  I inquire as to what time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 52 minutes 45 \nseconds. The Senator from Massachusetts has 43 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator \nfrom Connecticut to clarify some points.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts. I just wanted to \nrespond quickly to the Senator from Missouri on part of his statement. \nI sent a letter on June 13 to the majority leader in which I pointed \nout, again, the overwhelming evidence that this program, I Have a \nFuture, has long supported abstinence--not just on some rhetorical \nstatements, but rather based [[Page S 8731]] on evidence, pamphlets, \nvideos, so forth, that have been available going back to 1986. To \nsuggest somehow that these were manufactured documents that came up \nafter Dr. Foster's nomination is just not borne out by the facts.\n  Mr. President, the following are among materials that have been \nprovided to the committee--by the way, I am not holding these, they \nhave been part of the record. For example, the 1989 edition of the \nfamily life module staff manual specifically calls for the handing out \nof a pamphlet entitled ``Many Teens Are Saying `No.' '' A copy of that \npamphlet was provided to the committee. A 1986 pamphlet from the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to which Dr. Foster \nalluded in his hearings called ``A Parent's Guide to the Facts: To Help \nMothers and Fathers Talk to Their Teenagers About Sexual \nResponsibility.'' That was the title. It includes a similar abstinence \nmessage. The pamphlets are only part of this program. The same \nabstinence message is delivered through videos, training materials, \ngroup discussions, games, a variety of other materials, all of which \nare a part of the record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask for 30 additional seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, all of that material has been made available \nto the committee. To say that these were manufactured documents that \ncame up after the nomination is ludicrous. It is all there, it is all \navailable to the committee. It is a longstanding record of supporting \nabstinence as part of that program. To suggest otherwise is unfair to \nthe nominee. It is not an accurate reflection of the hearing record.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. President, I have listened to the debate for about the last 40 \nminutes or so. I have decided to not speak in the language of \nstatistics or charge/countercharge. I sit on the Labor and Human \nResources Committee and had an opportunity to hear Dr. Foster and go \nthrough this hearing with him.\n  I have heard some language from my colleagues, mainly on the other \nside, about appealing to the better angels of our nature, about values, \nabout mainstream, and about competency. So let me try to, within my own \nway, within a very short timeframe, set the record straight.\n  Dr. Foster, during the committee hearing, was articulate, thoughtful \nand able to maintain his sense of humor. And more importantly, the \ncommittee and the American people came to see a compassionate, humane, \ncaring theme--Dr. Henry Foster, the same Dr. Henry Foster known to his \nfriends, to his family, and to his community and, more importantly, to \nhis patients.\n  Sometimes we do not know what we do not want to know. We went through \nthe debate on the I Have a Future Program over and over and over again \nin committee. The Senator from Massachusetts mentioned the Carnegie \nFoundation report. There is not one Senator here that should ever argue \nanything other than the question of why children have children is \ncomplicated and none of us really knows the answers, though we are all \nstruggling to find those answers.\n  But Dr. Foster at least tried. During the hearing, every time I heard \na criticism of this program, I asked my colleagues, ``Could you point \nto another program that had more success? Could you point to a more \nworthy attempt? If we want to talk about values and how you live your \nlife, can you point to a doctor who has been more there with young \npeople, who has cared more about this problem of teenage pregnancy, who \nhas cared more about the problem of substance abuse, who has cared more \nabout the problem of violence in the lives of all too many young people \nin America, who has cared more about the problem of HIV infection and \nAIDS?''\n  Mr. President, I must tell you that during the committee hearing--and \nI suspect on the floor of the Senate as well--there will be no answer \nto the question I just raised. The silence will be deafening.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Henry Foster does appeal to the better angels of \nour nature. I heard one of my colleagues earlier talk about the \nstandards being competency, credibility and mainstream values. \nCompetency? This is an Africa-American man who has a whole life of \naccomplishments. This is an African American man who has contributed \nenormously to communities and to our country. And mainstream values? \nWhat is more consistent with mainstream values than to take your \nprofessional ability and to use that ability in such a way that you \ngive to the most vulnerable citizens in our country, you take your \nprofessional ability as a doctor and give it to communities and you \nserve people?\n  Mr. President, the key to a successful and effective Surgeon General \nis, will that Surgeon General have rapport with the people of our \ncountry? There is no question in my mind that Dr. Foster will. Dr. \nFoster, if you are watching this debate--and for all the people in the \ncountry that are watching the debate--Dr. Foster, be proud. This \npersonal attack is all about politics in the worst sense. Be proud of \nyour life. Be proud of what you have done. I believe, as a Senator from \nMinnesota, Dr. Henry Foster will serve our country very well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. First, I wish to compliment my friend and colleague, \nSenator Coats, for his work on this nomination. I also would like to \nclarify a couple of statements that have been made by some of the \nproponents of the nomination.\n  I heard some of the proponents say this nomination is about \nPresidential politics. I disagree. I have seen politics play a part in \nprevious nominations for different things. But I will tell you as a \nperson who has been involved in some of the battles on the office of \nSurgeon General in the past, I do not think this is about Presidential \npolitics. I remember Dr. C. Everett Koop, who eventually was confirmed \nfor Surgeon General, but he was held up for months, almost a year.\n  I remember Dr. Elders. I was involved in slowing down that \nnomination. I tried to defeat it. I tried to use parliamentary \nprocedures, and I slowed it down for several months, because I thought \nshe was the wrong person to be Surgeon General. That was not about \nPresidential politics, although people said that on the floor. Dr. \nElders alluded to it being about race. And that was wrong. She was the \nwrong nominee and she was the wrong Surgeon General. She made a lot of \nstatements, both prior to her confirmation and after her confirmation, \nthat proved she was the wrong person to be Surgeon General.\n  And, Mr. President, I state that Dr. Foster is the wrong person to be \nSurgeon General. He should not be confirmed. It does not have anything \nto do with Presidential politics. He should not be confirmed.\n  Why? I do not think we can trust him. I think time and time again he \nhas made statements that have proven not to be truthful. I do not think \nhe has been honest. I do not think he leveled with the Congress or with \nthe American people. I do not think somebody should be confirmed if \nthey cannot tell the truth. That does not mean he is not a nice guy, or \nthat he has not done some good things. But if a person does not tell \nthe truth, then they should not be confirmed to a high-level office. As \na matter of fact, I terminate the employment of people if they do not \ntell the truth. I think that telling the truth is a basic requirement.\n  You might say, well, where are you getting these facts, and where are \nthese things coming from, and is this not just based on opinions not \nfact? Well, a lot of it comes from Dr. Foster himself. A lot of the \nstatements he has made on very sensitive, important issues have been \nmisleading, at best. A lot of people have said this issue is about \nabortion because a lot of people [[Page S 8732]] do not want to have \nsomebody who has performed abortions be Surgeon General.\n  I agree. I do not want to have an abortionist as Surgeon General. But \nI also will say that with the numbers in the Senate, that probably \nwould not necessarily disqualify somebody or mean they could not get \nthe votes to be confirmed. But what about when you have statements \nlike, maybe I have performed one abortion--that came out of the White \nHouse. Then we had a statement issued by the White House and by Dr. \nFoster, and I will read this statement. They have a printed statement \non February 3, 1995 that says:\n\n       In that period of almost three decades as a private \n     practicing physician, I believe that I performed fewer than a \n     dozen pregnancy terminations.\n\n  Fewer than a dozen. This is a release to try to stop the discussion \nof how many abortions Dr. Foster had performed, because they had a \nproblem with their nomination. And then I find out in a Department of \nHealth-HHS hearing, Ethics Advisory Board, on November 10, 1978, Dr. \nFoster talks about doing about 700 or so abortions. So to quote, it \nsays, ``I have done a lot of amniocentesis and therapeutic abortions, \nprobably near 700.''\n  That was Dr. Foster. What was the response? First the White House \nsaid, ``He was not there.'' ``It was not Dr. Foster.'' Then, ``He is \nmisstated or misquoted and did not remember making the comments.'' But \nit is in this record. The White House was saying it is not true. It \nturns out, I think, that it is. In Dr. Foster's statements on abortion, \nhe is misleading Congress and the American people. On ``Nightline'' he \nsaid, ``I have done fewer than 39 abortions.'' Well, he was not \ncounting those 700 or so he referred to in his testimony before the \nEthics Advisory Board nor was he counting the abortions that occurred \nduring a study he headed at Meharry, where over 50 abortions were \ncaused by use of a suppository.\n  And then also in Dr Foster's statements, he says, ``Well, I am not \nabout abortion. I abhor abortion. I am against it.'' And then I look at \nsome of the statements he made about the suppository, talking about, \nhow this suppository can induce abortion in 1 to 7 hours and could be \navailable for prescription in 36 months. We are going to have \nsuppositories where everybody can get abortions; they can be quick, \neasy, and cheap.\n  He made that statement. So I am thinking, wait a minute, how is this \nconsistent with ``I abhor abortion,'' but he is doing a study to see if \nwe can have a suppository to make it available to everybody. Then I go \nback to a statement the White House released that said, ``I have done \nfewer than a dozen.'' On ``Nightline,'' he said, ``I did 39.'' And then \nwe read a transcript saying he did 700. Then he is doing a study on a \nsuppository where it could be cheap, free, and available to everyone.\n  Then I am when I read what Dr. Foster stated on February 27, 1995--\nthat he is fighting mad at ``white right-wing extremists that are using \nmy nomination to achieve their radical goals.''\n  That reminds me of some of the statements that Dr. Elders made. Who \nis he talking about? I am opposed to his nomination for a lot of \nreasons, but I have never put myself in that category. I do not know \nthat people would put the New York Times in that category. Generally, \nit is a fairly liberal paper--editorially, at least.\n  On February 10, the New York Times says, talking about Dr. Foster:\n\n       Although Dr. Foster is a highly respected obstetrician, his \n     lack of candor about his abortion record disqualifies him \n     from serious consideration. Misleading statements by \n     candidates for high positions simply cannot be condoned.\n\n  They go on:\n\n       Of course, the chief blame for this debacle lies with the \n     White House, which once again put forth a nominee without \n     adequately vetting the person's background or knowing the \n     answers to potentially explosive questions. As a result, the \n     administration put out false information on the number of \n     abortions performed by Dr. Foster.\n\n  They summarize and say, ``It is time to withdraw the nomination.''\n  I think they were correct. However, the White House did not withdraw \nthe nomination. They have been fighting for this nomination. They think \nthis is important. They have tried to turn this into all kinds of \ndifferent philosophical battles. They are wrong.\n  Some of my other colleagues have raised issues concerning \ncredibility. I think there is a real credibility problem. Concerning \nthe syphilis study, Dr. Foster stated, ``I didn't know about that until \n1972 when it became public.'' Yet, I do not think that is the truth. \nDr. McRae, who was president of the medical society at the time of the \nstudy, stated in a letter on February 28, 1995, ``I sat at the end of \nthe table, and Dr. Foster sat some two chairs down from me on the \nleft.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        L.C. McRae, Jr., M.D.,\n\n                              Mount Vernon, GA, February 28, 1995.\n     Mr. Jerry Horn,\n     Celebrate Life Magazine.\n       Dear Mr. Horn: With reference to your inquiry concerning \n     the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, I will express my knowledge of \n     the study as I know it to be.\n       Some weeks before the County Medical Society Meeting of May \n     19, 1969, I received correspondence from Dr. Bill Brown at \n     Emory University, U.S. Public Health Service. He was \n     requesting a meeting with the County Medical Society to \n     discuss an on-going ``study''. Prior to this letter I had \n     received an endorsement from Dr. Ira Myers who was the \n     Alabama State Health Director calling my attention to the \n     fact that I would be hearing from Dr. Brown.\n       The meeting was organized and held at the then Torch Cafe \n     some four miles outside Tuskegee. Prior to that time we held, \n     our meetings at John Andrews Hospital on Tuskegee Institute \n     Campus. At this meeting were apprised, myself and everyone \n     there included, of an on-going syphilis study that began in \n     1932 and was to run over a forty-year period. This study \n     consisted of a double blind study of treated and untreated \n     male syphilis patients. This was the first that any \n     physicians in the County Medical Society knew anything about \n     this study. Dr. Brown made his presentation requesting that \n     we endorse the continuation of the study. It was my feeling \n     and belief that the study was ending within three years \n     bringing it to its forty-year period that was designed in the \n     study. A list of the remaining patients in the study was \n     given to each physician and I noted four or five of my \n     patients that were on the list whom I had treated for latent \n     syphilis not knowing that they were involved in the study.\n       Members attending the meeting to the best of my knowledge \n     were myself, Dr. Brown, a colleague of his, Dr. John Hume, \n     Dr. Thomas Calhoun, Dr. Howard Settler and Dr. Henry Foster.\n       I sat at the end of the table and Dr. Foster sat some two \n     chairs down from me on the left. The presentation was one \n     conducted over a thirty to forty-five minute period of time \n     and it became our consensus that we would endorse the \n     continuation of the study.\n       What is striking to me about the fact that those members \n     present as named were unaware of the study, however no future \n     conversations were held at either meetings or with me. When \n     the news broke in 1972 about the Tuskegee Syphilis Study and \n     Dr. Foster's name came up in that he was greatly helpful in \n     working out the logistics of seeing that patients were \n     located and treated and I felt that from my knowledge to the \n     news media that Dr. Foster was doing a great service and I \n     still feel that way to this day. What concerned me was that \n     he was at the meeting and voiced no objection to the \n     continuation of the study and yet became outraged in 1972 \n     when approached by members of the press and other interested \n     parties concerning the Tuskegee Syphilis Study.\n       The minutes of the meeting have not been located and \n     through talking to some other reporters it was determined \n     that Dr. Howard Settler, of course, was Secretary-Treasurer \n     of the County Medical Society in 1969 and he stated that most \n     recently, that his secretary had died and he had no idea \n     where the minutes were.\n       If I can be of any further service to you, please advise.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                        Luther C. McRae, Jr., M.D.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Dr. Foster was vice chair of the medical society where \nthey were being briefed on the syphilis study in 1969, yet Dr. Foster \nemphatically says, ``I was not there.'' He was not there. He performed \na delivery that day. It turns out that the time of delivery that day \ndid not coincide with the birth record of that child. There are so many \ninconsistencies, so many downright misstatements of fact. It leads me \nto conclude that Dr. Foster should not be confirmed.\n  Maybe one that troubles me, maybe it troubles me more than others, \ndeals with the sterilization of the mentally retarded. This is \nsterilizing mentally retarded women without their consent. Dr. Foster \nadmits doing this.\n  As a matter of fact, in the summer of 1974 he read a paper to a \nmedical association that said, ``Recently, I have [[Page S 8733]] begun \nto use hysterectomy in patients with severe mental retardation.'' Since \nthen, both Dr. Foster and the White House said, well, that was \nmedically accepted, that procedure was in the medical mainstream. That \nis false. That is outright false.\n  As a matter of fact, in Alabama, that summer the law on sterilization \nshifted dramatically and practices that were formerly perhaps part of \nthe medical mainstream were no longer.\n  I have a whole list, including the case in June 1973, where Mary \nAlice Relf, age 12, and Minnie Relf, age 14, were surgically sterilized \nin a hospital in Montgomery, AL. To make the story short, this case \nwent to court. This was in June 1973. HEW regulations were sought to \nprotect the rights of all persons, including the mentally retarded, \nwith respect to sterilizations paid for with Federal funds.\n  However, those regulations did not take effect because the Federal \ndistrict court in Washington, DC, in March 1974, found HEW had no \nauthority to fund any nonconsensual sterilization whatever.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Oklahoma 1 minute, \nadditionally.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, if we look at the inconsistencies, they \nsaid sterilization for the mentally retarded was in the medical \nmainstream. It was not.\n  There were court cases saying, ``No, do not do it.'' HEW said, ``We \nwill not do it or fund it.'' Dr. Foster was making speeches to medical \nassociations saying, ``We are doing it.'' There were cases, and there \nwas an outcry against this activity.\n  If we look at this, if we look at the inconsistencies of his \nstatements on what happened on the number of abortions, if we look at \nthe syphilis study where he said, ``I don't know anything about it,'' \nand Dr. McRae and others say, ``Yes, he was informed about it,'' I \nthink there are so many inconsistencies we really have serious \nquestions about his honesty to Congress and to the American people.\n  Therefore, I happen to agree with the New York Times in their \neditorial that I read from, and their editorial today which states that \nDr. Foster should not be confirmed by the Senate.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, could I inquire how much time remains on \neach side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has 40 minutes and 40 \nseconds; the Senator from Massachusetts has 35\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield five 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  I am very disheartened and, frankly, disgusted with what is starting \nto emerge here on the Senate floor.\n  A defamation of a man's character. A defamation of a man's career by \nSenators who do not even know this man; by Senators who are not even \nphysicians; by Senators who think they know more than professional \norganizations who have honored this man, than patients of this man who \nhave come forward to testify to his decency, his qualifications, his \nintegrity; by Senators who think they know more than President George \nBush, who gave his program the 1,000 Points of Light Award; by Senators \nwho think they know more than their own colleague, Dr. Bill Frist, a \nSenator here, who said very clearly that he supports Dr. Foster.\n  I quote to my fellow Senator on the other side of the aisle, their \nown colleague, Senator Frist: ``When people ask me why I support Hank \nFoster's nomination, I will tell them simply, because he's qualified to \ncarry out the duties of Surgeon General, and I am confident he will \nperform that job well.''\n  I am disheartened that people would come on this floor and attack a \ndecent man the way they are doing here today. I take offense at it. I \napologize to Dr. Foster for it and to his family and his friends.\n  This is about politics. Politics of the worst sort. This is about \npressure. Pressure of the worst sort. This is about sacrificing a \ndecent man on the altar of right-wing politics in America.\n  I hope that if we do not win this vote today on cloture that the \nAmerican people will rise up, that they will phone their Senators, \nbecause there is a chance to reconsider if we do not win today.\n  I am appalled at what I have heard here. I am appalled that people \nwho claim to stand for family values and for a decent society, would \nattack a decent man in such a personal way.\n  I share the views of my friend from Connecticut when he says, ``Who \nin their right mind will put themselves through this and get caught up \nin Presidential politics like this?''\n  Dr. Foster is an ob/gyn--an obstetrician-gynecologist--and delivered \nthousands of babies. Mr. President, only a very small percentage of his \npractice involved abortion. And this is how he gets treated.\n  This is a man who, as my friend from Maryland said, could have been a \nwealthy doctor in the Northeast somewhere playing golf at country clubs \non the weekend, but chose to go into the South where women had to \ntravel 150 miles to get decent health care.\n  I have letters I will put into the Record from doctors who served \nwith Henry Foster, who saw that compassion. And people in this Chamber \nwith a cushy lifestyle get on this floor and attack him personally for \ngiving up his life, so he could serve people in need, so he could turn \naround the infant mortality rate in the Deep South.\n  They say ``He will be like Joycelyn Elders.'' What does that mean? \nWhat does that mean? I have never heard that before on this floor. When \nwe take up a nominee, that people compare him to the person who held \nthe office before. What does it mean? Think about it. More than one \nperson on this floor has said it. The only thing I can think of is that \nthey are both African-American.\n  I ask you to search your soul in this debate and stop the personal \nattacks on a decent human being. If you want to vote against him, vote \nagainst him.\n He deserves his day.\n\n  I ask for 30 additional seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the Senator 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. He deserves his day. And filibustering this nomination is \nkeeping him from his day.\n  If you do not think a woman deserves a right to choose, fight against \nit. Convince the American people, because they do not agree with you. \nThey want Government kept out of that decision. Do not take it out on a \nman who brought thousands of babies into this world.\n  Oh, he forgot exactly the number of abortions. We have heard that. \nMaybe he forgot the exact number of babies he brought into the world. \nWould that change your mind?\n  Let us be fair. Let us stop the personal attack. Let us stop \nPresidential politics. Let us vote for cloture. Then let each and every \nSenator vote his or her conscience.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes, or more if he needs it, \nto the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today we are debating much more than the \nqualifications of Dr. Henry Foster. Few could argue he is not \ntechnically qualified. Furthermore, few, if any, would contest the fact \nthat Henry Foster is a decent man who has worked hard and done much \ngood in his lifetime.\n  I might also say, for my part I am not too caught up in these issues \nof credibility with regard to things that may or may not have happened \na decade or more ago. I do not agree with my colleagues who say that \nyou cannot trust this man. I hope the Members of this body are never \njudged by standards of consistency in other matters by which we judge \nsome of these nominees.\n  However, Dr. Foster is caught up in something much bigger than \nhimself and, therefore, so are the rest of us in this debate. Because \nof the way the President has used the office of Surgeon General and the \nappointments to it, we are now engaged in a heated national debate, one \nthat I think is divisive and unnecessary. At a time when all of us, and \nespecially the President, should be looking for ways to bring people \ntogether in this country, the President, by means of this appointment, \nhas chosen instead to give a [[Page S 8734]] symbolic victory to one \nside in the abortion debate.\n  The President has taken the office of Surgeon General, a rather \nobscure office with no real authority whose purposes have traditionally \nbeen to simply promote mental and physical health, and raised it to the \nposition of spokesperson with regard to sensitive moral and social \nissues. Then he has proceeded to appoint Dr. Elders to that position, \none of the worst and most controversial appointments in recent years.\n  With that legacy, naturally the position has become one of great \nsensitivity to many of the American people. It is time for an \nappointment that will symbolize a return to matters of basic health \ncare. It is time for an appointee who will command the attention and \nrespect of the Nation with regard to these issues.\n  Instead, the President has made an ``in-your-face'' appointment that \nwas totally insensitive to the religious and moral beliefs of a large \nsegment of the American people. One must assume the President knew the \nfirestorm of divisiveness that this appointment would cause and that he \nsimply assumed he would be the political winner in this national debate \nthat would ensue, regardless of whether or not Dr. Henry Foster was \nconfirmed.\n  That is not the proper use of the office of the Surgeon General and \nthat is not the proper use of this nomination. Therefore, I choose not \nto endorse the President's actions and I will not vote to confirm this \nnomination.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. \nBut I ask the Chair to inform the Senator when he has used 10 minutes \nof time.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues that confirmations are probably \none of if not the most difficult tasks required of us here in the \nSenate because we are not dealing with abstract statistics. We are not \ndealing with generalizations. We are not dealing with issues per se. \nBut we are dealing with fellow human beings, their character, their \nlives, their experience--who they are.\n  When we make a judgment on a nominee, I believe it is a task that \nneeds to be taken with some humility. None of us can claim a past \nwithout mistakes or without failings. Nevertheless, we are required to \nweigh the record against the criteria for service and come to an \ninformed decision.\n  Let me begin today by saying what is not at issue in this nomination. \nDr. Foster's commitment to the poor is not at issue in this nomination. \nHe has proven that commitment over many years of service. Dr. Foster's \nengaging good humor is not at issue. He has shown it in our Senate \nhearings and at other times. And the administration's initial handling \nof the nomination should not be at issue. You can hardly blame Dr. \nFoster for White House incompetence.\n  My concerns in this process have been specific and they have been \nfactual. I have attempted to raise some basic questions, questions that \nfor me are determinative in my decision in terms of whether I would \nsupport or not support Dr. Foster. Has the nominee been candid? Has the \nnominee, during his career, displayed the ethical judgment and \nleadership necessary for the position of U.S. Surgeon General? Would \nthis nominee unify our Nation on important health concerns, or would he \nfragment it through divisive moral debates?\n  I think it is interesting that today in the New York Times, an \neditorial appears addressing the question of candor. It is not, I \nbelieve, either inconsistent nor does it indicate some kind of a right-\nwing conspiracy that Members who have opposed Dr. Foster have raised \nthe questions of his credibility and his candor with the Senate and \nwith the public. I am quoting from the New York Times, which says:\n\n       We continue to believe that Dr. Foster has forfeited any \n     claim to the job by his initial lack of candor about his \n     abortion record. He had a constitutional right, indeed duty,\n\n  According to the New York Times--\n\n     to perform abortions for his patients. The number he \n     performed . . . is in fact rather modest for a busy \n     gynecologist serving a needy population.\n       But numbers are not at issue here. The sad fact is that, \n     from the day his name was announced, Dr. Foster seemed \n     determined to minimize his abortion record and kept being \n     forced to revise the numbers upwards. His misleading \n     statements led us in February to oppose his candidacy. \n     Nothing that has emerged in the later hearings or comments \n     has justified those misstatements.\n       . . . Dr. Foster's candidacy fails the candor test. He \n     deserves . . . to be rejected.\n\n  Those are not words from this Senator. Those are not words from other \nSenators. Those are not words from the right wing. Those are words from \nthe editors of the New York Times on the issue of his candor. So I \nthink it is a legitimate issue. It is a legitimate issue to raise. It \nis a legitimate issue to evaluate. It is a legitimate issue by which to \nform a judgment as to whether this particular individual is the \nindividual that is best suited for the position of U.S. Surgeon \nGeneral.\n  It is not our job in a nomination debate to deal in general \nimpressions. Our task is to investigate specific concerns.\n  The questions that I have raised I believe can be answered from the \npublic record. In my opinion, none of these questions were answered \nsatisfactorily during the hearing process; none in favor of Dr. \nFoster's nomination.\n  There are at least four concerns that I would like to raise before \nthe Senate for consideration.\n  First, at the beginning of this process, I was concerned that Dr. \nFoster gave varying accounts of his record on abortion--numbers that \ncould not be explained by a faulty memory alone. The nominee has tried \nto dismiss those concerns, but he has not in my opinion specifically \nanswered them.\n  I am concerned with more than numbers in this matter. I am a pro-life \nSenator. I would prefer a Surgeon General who extends his compassion to \nthe weakest members of the human family. For me, as a matter of moral \nprinciple, a commitment to speak for those who cannot speak for \nthemselves.\n  Having said that, the numbers are not relevant as the New York Times \nhas indicated. It would seem unlikely to me that someone who admits to \nperforming 39 abortions would confuse that figure with performing just \none or even 12, that someone who testified that he abhors abortion, and \nit is one of the most difficult things that he has ever had to do, \nwould be confused over his involvement in abortion or would not \nremember what his involvement was, and only when pressed on the record \nwould say, ``Well, yes, I guess the number is different than what I \ninitially indicated.'' It is clear that Dr. Foster oversaw, in addition \nto the 39 that he admitted on the ``Nightline'' show, 55 additional \nchemical abortions, and 4 additional surgical abortions as part of a \nscientific study of which he was involved with.\n  We also know now from an official HEW transcript that Dr. Foster \nhimself claimed to have done 700 amniocentesis and therapeutic \nabortions. We were never able to clarify just exactly what the \nbreakdown was in terms of those abortions; where they came from. That \nis the clouded part of the record.\n  I cannot avoid the conclusion that Dr. Foster's frequently changing \nnumbers and varying accounts of his personal involvement with abortions \nare profoundly troubling and difficult to explain as a mere lapse of \nmemory.\n  Second, I am concerned that Dr. Foster may have been informed about \nthe Tuskegee syphilis study before 1972, when it became widely known. \nThat concern was not in my opinion satisfactorily answered despite my \nlengthy and thorough questioning of Dr. Foster on this subject in the \nconfirmation hearing.\n  Dr. Foster declared in the Labor Committee hearing that neither he \nnor anyone in the county knew anything about the study. But we know \nthat a number of medical personnel in the county helped conduct the \nstudy and knew that treatment was being denied to those black men who \nhad syphilis in the name of continuing the study. We know that Dr. \nFoster was chief of obstetrics at the Tuskegee Institute, which \nprovided services in connection with the study.\n  We know that Dr. Foster was vice president and later President of the \nMacon County Medical Society when that society was consulted regarding \nthe study, and when that society agreed to cooperate with the public \nhealth service.\n  I have considerable additional material that if time would allow I \nwould be [[Page S 8735]] happy to share with the Senate. I have \nforwarded a letter to each Member of the Senate for their consideration \ndetailing this information. If time permits, I hope to be able to \nexamine some of that material.\n  The Washington Post editorialized that this was a critical factor in \nSenators' decisions of knowing what Dr. Foster knew and when he knew it \nregarding the Tuskegee study. That editorial claimed that, if he had \nknowledge of that study before 1972, he was not qualified for this \noffice. I presented to the Senate a lengthy detailed record of \ninformation that I believe leads to the conclusion that Dr. Foster did \nknow about the study and did not respond as he indicated.\n  We know that Dr. Foster, as then president of the medical society \nrecalls, may have attended a meeting at which the medical society was \nnotified of the study, and documents from the Public Health Service \nspecifically state that each member of the society, which is a small \nsociety, 10 Members I believe, was provided with a list of surviving \nparticipants in the syphilis study.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator should be informed that he has \nconsumed 10 minutes, and that he has 27 minutes and 10 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me state, third, that I was concerned that Dr. Foster performed \nsterilizations on the mentally handicapped, without proper consent. \nThat concern was not fully answered.\n  Dr. Foster confirmed that this procedure was done, without the assent \nof patients and without a judicial decision. He and the White House \ndefended this practice as mainstream medicine at the time, but we found \nthat this procedure was not mainstream, even at the time. It was \ncontradicted by Alabama case law, Federal regulations and professional \nstandards.\n  I cannot avoid the conclusion that Dr. Foster, on this issue, \ndisplayed little ethical sensitivity, and demonstrated no ethical \nleadership.\n  Finally, I became concerned with both the inflated claims and the \ndirection of Dr. Foster's I have a future program. This concern was not \nanswered. In fact, it was decisively confirmed.\n  Dr. Foster and the White House claimed that abstinence was the \nbedrock of I have a future, and that the program itself was a \ntremendous success. Objective evidence undermines both of these \ncontentions. Abstinence is not mentioned in two promotional brochures \nfor the program, but contraception is prominently featured. In the \nprogram curriculum, abstinence gets a weak second billing to an \naggressive contraception focus.\n  On this issue, the pattern of carelessness with the truth was \nrepeated. When abstinence brochures were presented to the committee to \nshow the nominee's commitment to this principle, the publisher \nconfirmed the procedures were written just before Dr. Foster's \nselection and were ordered only a month after his nomination.\n  I have a future is a story of good intentions and poor results. Two \nevaluations by the program's own staff show it may actually have been \nharmful to teen participants. Although they started the program more \nabstinent than the control group, they ended up more sexually active, \nand no less pregnant at the end of the program.\n  Mr. President, I cannot avoid the conclusion that I have a future is \na program operating on a failed theory, the theory that contraception \ncan be an acceptable substitute for restraint.\n  In considering this nomination, I always come back to the unique \nnature of this office, an office with little staff, little funding, but \nexceptional influence. That influence is based on persuasion and \nrespect alone. It is based on the ability to build consensus and \nprovide moral leadership.\n  Dr. Foster has many good qualities, but they are not the qualities \nfor this office, particularly at this time, in the aftermath of Dr. \nElders. The reputation of this position must be rebuilt, or its entire \nfuture is in doubt. That job of rebuilding will require credibility, \nethical judgment, and candor, and it will require in my opinion, a \ndifferent nominee.\n  For all these reasons, I cannot support this nomination, and I urge \nmy colleagues to defeat the motion to invoke cloture.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 3\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator \nfrom Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of Dr. \nHenry Foster and I think his background and training and education \nmakes him uniquely qualified.\n  I rise today in support of the nomination of Dr. Henry Foster to be \nSurgeon General of the United States. Like many of my colleagues, I do \nhave some reservations concerning the nomination. But in my judgment, \nthere is nothing about his background that--under current law--should \ndisqualify him from serving as the Nation's chief spokesman on health \ncare issues. Based on his testimony before the Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee--which many hailed as an old fashioned tour de \nforce--early last month and the accolades he has received from friends \nand associates since his nomination, he should be confirmed without \nfurther delay.\n  I think his background, training, and education make him uniquely \nqualified for this position, and I believe his testimony before the \ncommittee helped to dispel some of the fears of his opponents. I think \nwe should be encouraged by this process. The May 2 hearing served the \npurpose for which confirmation hearings are designed--the nominee was \nable to make his case in his own way and in his own words, outside the \nrealm of political caricature and interest group misrepresentation. His \nqualifications were already well-known; after the hearing, the nominee \nwas well known. This is the way the process should work.\n We should now have the opportunity for an up or down vote, based on \nwhat we know.\n\n  What we know of Dr. Foster is that he has 38 years of experience as \nan educator, professional physician, and public servant. He was the \nfounder of a program that addressed the issue of teenage pregnancy \ncalled I Have a Future, developed in 1987. The program stressed \nabstinence as a first method of reduction. It was chosen by former \nPresident Bush for his Points of Light Program.\n  Dr. Foster served 2 years of Active duty and 2 years of Active \nReserve duty in the U.S. Air Force. He was instrumental in the \nconsolidation of Meharry Medical College and Metropolitan General \nHospital in Nashville, saving both from possible closure. He is a \nmember of the prestigious Institute of Medicine and is a member of many \ndistinguished medical advisory and review boards. He served as chief of \nobstetrics and gynecology at the John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital in \nTuskegee, AL, where he still has the full support of the local \ncitizens.\n  This nomination has been sidetracked by disputes about how many \nabortions Dr. Foster performed, whether he knew about a controversial \n40-year syphilis experiment on black men conducted in Tuskegee, and \nwhat role he played in hysterectomies performed to sterilize mentally \nretarded patients during the 1970's.\n  I am personally opposed to abortion. My position is well known, since \nthe national media once carried my statement: ``As a former fetus, I am \nopposed to abortion.'' But the fact is that it is a legal medical \nprocedure that is generally carried out by obstetrician-gynecologists \nsuch as Dr. Foster. Reasonable people can debate what the law of the \nland should or should not be with regard to abortion.\n  Regardless of how many abortions he may have performed, the number is \nirrelevant because it is a legal medical procedure taught in many \nmedical schools. As to the question of his candor in recalling the \nspecific numbers, I suppose it would be fair to say he made errors in \nhis recollection. I practiced law for 25 years in a small country town, \nand once I was asked how many murder cases I had tried. I gave an \nanswer, and then upon reflection I realized the number I had given was \nincorrect. Then I got to thinking about it. Well, let us see. I did not \nthink about this case, and I did not think about that case, and I soon \nrealized that each time I thought about it I had really made a mistake.\n  Unless recollections are supported and refreshed by documentation, \nthey are inherently hazy, especially in relationship to a long career. \nIn hindsight, it would be clear that he should have not given out a \nprecise number at the time. He may have made a mistake in [[Page S \n8736]] trying to neutralize a politically divisive issue. I do not \nthink he intentionally misled the public, the administration, or the \nLabor Committee for his own personal gain.\n  The issue of when Dr. Foster knew of the syphilis experiments was \naddressed at the committee hearing. It has been alleged that he learned \nof these experiments during a May 19, 1969, briefing on the study. \nHowever, based on my reading of the record, Dr. Foster did not learn of \nthe study until it became public in 1972.\n  I have a copy of an affidavit signed by Minnie Capleton Jamison, of \nTuskegee, AL, whose son Dr. Foster delivered by Caesarean section on \nthe evening of May 19, 1969. Ms. Jamison specifically recalls that part \nof the procedure occurred at 7 p.m., with the official medical record \nindicating that her baby was delivered at 9:17 p.m. The briefing on the \nsyphilis study is said to have begun at 7 p.m. on May 19 at a medical \nsociety meeting. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this affidavit \nbe printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HEFLIN. His critics charge that even if he was not at the May 19, \n1969, briefing, he could have found out about the study through \nspecialty journals unlikely to have been read by Dr. Foster. To read \nall medical articles and all journals, few doctors would have time to \ntreat patients. This standard clearly violates the bounds of reason and \nlogic.\n  Finally, some charge that Dr. Foster should not be confirmed because \nhe performed hysterectomies on four mentally retarded\n patients for hygiene or life-saving purposes. During his testimony, he \nresponded that these were not ``forced'' or ``involuntary'' \nsterilizations under the guidelines in place at that time. Informed \nconsent was given consistent with the medical ethics in the 1960's and \nearly 1970's, the time period during which these four procedures were \nperformed.\n\n  Senator Frist's support is one of the most compelling arguments in \nhis favor. As the Senate's only physician, he is in a unique position \nto judge the Surgeon General's qualifications and ability to serve. \nJust as we look to the legal community to make recommendations about \nSupreme Court and other judicial nominees, we should look to members of \nthe medical community for their assessments of nominees that are \nrelevant to their field. Senator Frist--a physician and Republican--\nstrongly supports Dr. Foster. Virtually every medical group has come \nout in favor of his nomination. Their recommendations should carry a \ngreat deal of weight as we cast our votes.\n  Some worry that like his predecessor, Dr. Foster will be a divisive \nfigure when who we need is a unifier. But anyone who saw the way he \nconducted himself at the hearing cannot doubt his ability to bring \npeople together and serve as a soothing force in our Nation. As a \nnational official, his constituency and responsibilities will be vastly \ndifferent and more comprehensive than as a private physician. There \nwill be competing interests and views that he will have to take into \naccount and often balance if he is to be successful. Like most nominees \nto high office, I expect Dr. Foster to grow and adapt to his new role \nin ways that will serve the country well.\n  Dr. Foster has the type of friendly, down-to-earth bedside manner \nthat each of us look for in our own physicians. He has professional \nexpertise and a keen realization of the health problems which confront \nour Nation that will guide him well in the office of Surgeon General. \nIn deference to basic fairness, cloture should be invoked, and we \nshould proceed to confirm this nominee.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  Statement of Minnie Capleton Jamison\n\n       My name is Minnie Capleton Jamison, and I am a resident of \n     Tuskegee, Macon County, Alabama. I reside at 1307 Gregory \n     Street in Tuskegee.\n       On the evening of May 19, 1969, I gave birth to my son, \n     Steven Darryl Jamison. Dr. Henry W. Foster was my \n     obstetrician and guided me along the entire course of my \n     pregnancy and delivered the baby. It had been a difficult \n     pregnancy. I was confined to bed for seven of the nine \n     months, and during the fourth month it was necessary for Dr. \n     Foster to perform a surgical procedure to prevent a \n     miscarriage. I had had two miscarriages before this.\n       I went into labor on May 18, 1969. I was admitted to John \n     A. Andrew Memorial Hospital in Tuskegee that evening, and I \n     was given medicine to slow labor. My baby was delivered by \n     Dr. Foster on the next evening, May 19, 1969. The delivery \n     was by Caesarean section.\n       I remember the evening well, but I do not remember all of \n     the specific details. I know that Dr. Foster looked in on me \n     from time to time, but I do not recall exactly what time he \n     looked in or exactly how often he checked on me. I remember \n     that the delivery took place at night, and that I was in \n     surgery for approximately two hours. I recall specifically \n     that part of the procedure was at 7:00. I recall that I was \n     very nervous and I was hyperventilating. I was doing \n     breathing exercises and I tried to focus on a clock at 7:00 \n     p.m. I remember that the anesthesiologist was trying to calm \n     me at the time, and that Dr. Foster joined and helped to calm \n     me. I recall that all of this was before Dr. Foster started \n     to operate, but I do not recall more specifically at what \n     point this was in the procedure. I understand that the \n     medical record indicates that the delivery took place at 9:17 \n     p.m., and I do not dispute that record.\n       I also remember well what fine care Dr. Foster gave to me \n     and my son. I remember that throughout a difficult time for \n     me Dr. Foster was warm and attentive. I had been told by \n     another obstetrician that I could never have a child. Dr. \n     Foster told me that he would work with me and do everything \n     humanly possible to make sure I could have a child, and he \n     did. He was a very busy man with many patients, but he always \n     took time and was always there to help. He was always very \n     human and very professional. He is a fine man and will make a \n     fine Surgeon General.\n       Signed: Minnie Capleton Jamison.\n       Date: 4/28/95.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, today we should be debating the nomination of Dr. \nHenry Foster to be U.S. Surgeon General. After all, it has been 6 \nmonths since this Nation has had a leading public health spokesperson, \nand the clock is still ticking.\n  I will remind my colleagues that every 59 seconds a baby is born to a \nteen mother. Every 17 minutes in this country AIDS takes another \nAmerican life. And this year, 46,000 women will die of breast cancer.\n  We should be debating the nomination of Dr. Henry Foster but we are \nnot. We are debating whether or not to allow a vote on Dr. Foster in \nthis Chamber. This is very unfortunate, particularly in light of the \nmany health care crises in this country.\n  When I first met Dr. Foster, I was very impressed for one very \nimportant reason. He is an ob-gyn. I have fought long and hard, as this \nbody knows, for women's health issues. Every wife, every mother, every \nsister, every daughter understands that women's health issues have been \nat the bottom of the barrel for too long in this country. I thought \nfinally with an ob-gyn as Surgeon General, our health concerns would be \nbrought to the top of the Nation's agenda.\n  Let me make this very clear. I see a no vote today as a vote to deny \nwomen, for the first time and probably for a long time, a voice from \nthe top on women's health issues.\n  I was also impressed by Dr. Henry Foster's devotion to teens in our \ncountry. As all of you know, I have two teenagers at home. I listen to \nthem in my living room, and I hear the same message: No one cares about \nthem. Adults go in their houses; they shut the doors; they close the \nblinds and no one pays attention.\n  Dr. Foster paid attention. He was willing to dedicate his personal \ntime and his life to give children a message of hope, of opportunity \nand chance. That is what his point of light program, I Have a Future, \nis all about. This Senate should not go on record dashing that message \nof hope for our children today. A no vote on cloture does just that.\n  Let us not forget the bigger picture and message in today's vote. For \n5 months, Dr. Foster has gone through a very intense process: An FBI \ncheck, a search of his entire medical records; every word he has \nuttered has been magnified, expanded, looked at, and questioned, and he \nwent through the entire committee process. He passed with flying \ncolors.\n  I heard some of my colleagues on the Senate floor say that Dr. Foster \nwas confused, that he was not forthright. Anyone who looks at the \nrecord, anyone who watched Dr. Foster before that [[Page S \n8737]] committee, feels as I do, that he is a man of dignity, of honor. \nHe is honest and he is forthright.\n  Are we giving him a vote today on his nomination? No. We are arguing \nwhether or not he gets a vote in this Chamber.\n  What does that say to Americans in this country who may at some point \nbe asked to serve their country? If you cast a no vote on cloture \ntoday, it says loud and clear: Think twice; think about your entire \nlife being scrutinized by this Senate body, think about giving up \nmonths of your personal life, your job, and your security only to hit \nthe end of the line and not even get a vote on your nomination. A no \nvote today on cloture sends a loud, strong message for future votes on \nPresidential nominations, and I think the Members of the Senate should \nthink long and hard before they cast their votes today.\n  This vote today will be a vote on fairness. Can this body be fair to \na person? And can we be fair to ourselves and the Senate process? I \nagree with my colleague from Illinois, Senator Simon, that this is not \na vote on Dr. Foster; it is a vote on us. And meanwhile, I will remind \nmy colleagues the clock is ticking.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, could you just inform us of the remaining \ntime on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has 23\\1/2\\ minutes; \nthe Senator from Massachusetts has 20\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the cloture motion on the \nFoster nomination. The only issue that we should have to address is \nwhether or not the President's nominee to be Surgeon General is \nqualified for that office. If the answer is yes, he should be \nconfirmed. If the answer is no, then that individual should vote \nagainst Dr. Foster's nomination.\n  But, Mr. President, under no circumstance is it appropriate or fair \nfor us to filibuster, to erect extraordinary hurdles to a vote on \nconfirmation, to use procedural tricks to avoid having to take up the \nquestion of whether or not the President's nominee is qualified to \nserve in this office.\n  In the first instance, Mr. President, I join my colleagues in saying \nto the world that Dr. Foster is eminently qualified to be Surgeon \nGeneral of the United States of America. He is a physician with a \nspecialty in women's health. He has been through fire. Every aspect of \nhis credentials, his actual objective qualifications to serve have been \nexamined and found to be worthy. He is eminently qualified to serve as \nSurgeon General.\n  With regard to his character, which is the second part of what we are \nsupposed to look at, there is again in my mind no question that Dr. \nFoster has the highest integrity. No person, Mr. President, who worked \nwith Dr. Foster in his 38 years of practice says otherwise. His \ncolleagues, his patients, the community, those people who have known \nhim for 38 years in professional life all have good things to say about \nhim and laud him for his efforts in behalf of women's health.\n  And so the question becomes, as has been suggested by my colleagues, \nwill the subjective bar, the subjective analysis be raised so that \nanyone who stands for an office such as this risks character \nassassination as a function of their willingness to serve our country? \nI do not think that that is appropriate.\n  Mr. President, the fact is that the opposition here is not as much \nabout Dr. Foster as it is about culture wars. Abortion is not the issue \nhere. Abortion, if anything, is the hook. It is the hook. I will ask \nthe question to anybody, what obstetrician-gynecologist could say with \ncertainty that they have never performed an abortion. It is a function \nof ob-gyn. Similarly, a syphilis study is not an issue. Again, he was a \nwomen's health specialist. The purpose for the opposition to use an \nemotional issue such as abortion is to divide America again. They are \nusing this as the hook to raise the issue of culture war, to divide us \none from the other.\n  I submit to this body that, if anything, Dr. Foster does not want to \nbe a divisive force in our community's dialog. If anything, he wants to \nbring us together.\n  He has worked hard to raise the issues about what a Surgeon General \nought to do. He has worked hard to articulate the kind of values that \nhe respects. He has actually stood for the last 139 days going through \nall kinds of changes and difficulties, 139 days in order to make the \nmessage that we have to come together as a community, as a nation in \norder to reclaim our youth, in order to restore and rekindle hope, in \norder to make the Surgeon General's office a force for healing.\n  That is the mission that Dr. Foster has attempted to undertake. He \nis, obviously, committed to this. He has been through what can be \ncalled nothing less than trial by excoriation. And yet he has survived \nall of the attacks with his integrity intact and with his ideals \nunimpeached.\n  So the only question, again, I think we have to face right now is \nwhat kind of ideals will be represented by the action of this U.S. \nSenate. Will it be the crass politics of obstruction and division, or \nwill it be a message of fairness? Will we allow this nomination to come \nto a vote, or will we erect additional procedural hurdles against that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. In conclusion, I just say that Dr. Foster's \nnomination deserves a vote, America deserves a vote, and I hope to have \nthe support of my colleagues for this motion to invoke cloture. Thank \nyou.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Kentucky and 1 \nminute to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Senator, and I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I, like Senator Dole, oppose Dr. Foster's nomination \nto be Surgeon General. However, I refuse to become a pawn in Senator \nGramm's Presidential politics. This cloture vote has Presidential one-\nupmanship written all over it, and it is a disservice to the American \npublic.\n  I agree with my colleague who said this vote represents the first \nRepublican primary. This is about Presidential politics, pure and \nsimple. If we had played by these rules in the past, James Watt would \nnot have become Secretary of the Interior, Ed Meese would not have \nbecome Attorney General, Samuel Pierce would not have been HUD \nSecretary, Clarence Thomas would not be on the Supreme Court, and \nRobert Bork would not have had an up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. President, I will vote against Dr. Foster, but I think he is \nentitled to a vote. I agree with those who say we should vote to invoke \ncloture so then we can vote for the nominee. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 1 minute.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, sadly, we put people on trial too much in \npolitics in our country today. That is what has been done to Dr. Henry \nFoster by his opponents, both in the Senate and in the press. He has \nbeen put on trial, accused with reckless charges and careless words \ndesigned to tarnish the reputation of a good man.\n  For instance, I heard at one point in this debate that Dr. Foster had \nperformed hundreds of abortions. I asked the opponent who charged that \nhow he had arrived at that number. He showed me a number that included \nabortion and amniocentesis. I asked, ``Do you think amniocentesis is an \nabortion?'' because that is what was included in that number. That is \nan example of the reckless charges designed to discredit the reputation \nof a good man.\n  I do not know Dr. Foster very well, but I do know from testimony by \nhis friends and colleagues that he is a good, decent, honest man who \nhas dedicated his life to helping others.\n  Sadly, he has been put through a political meat grinder, as happens \nall too often these days. The treatment of this nominee has been \nfashioned to serve the political interests of some in the Senate, in my \nopinion. But we can correct that today. We can do justice to Dr. Foster \nby voting to invoke cloture and then by confirming his nomination to be \nSurgeon General. [[Page S 8738]] \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott] is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nIndiana for yielding me this time. I commend him for his efforts with \nregard to this nomination. I know he has been diligent in trying to \nfind the truth, and in this instance, it has not been easy.\n  I want to begin my remarks by frankly questioning the current \nscenario of the office of Surgeon General. Over the past few years, \ninstead of being a position that brought us together in advocacy of \ngood health policies, it has become a position that divides us. It has \nmade us fight over various issues.\n  I have come to question whether we really need this position. Why \nshould the Federal Government have a paid advocate in this office? \nThere is a cost involved--about $1 million. There are a number of staff \npeople involved, along with a travel budget. I have reached the \nconclusion that the Surgeon Generalship is a position we probably do \nnot need anymore. What is done within that office should be done by \nother agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services or \nelsewhere in Government and the private sector.\n  The second point I want to make needs a longer explanation. The \nFoster nomination came to the Senate in the aftermath of the situation \ninvolving the former Surgeon General, Dr. Joycelyn Elders. There were \nmany problems associated with her tenure in office, with what she had \nto say and how she said it.\n  Many of us raised concerns about her conduct as Surgeon General, and \neventually, of course, the President had to call for her resignation, \nbecause she was advocating things that most people in America certainly \nwere not comfortable with. I do not believe Dr. Foster would do the job \nin the same way. I think his approach would be gentler. I am certain he \nwould not say some of the things that Dr. Elders said when she was \nSurgeon General. But he has held some offices and has otherwise been \nassociated with organizations which advocate the very things Dr. \nJoycelyn Elders advocated. I believe that is the wrong approach to the \noffice of Surgeon General.\n  More than ever before, if we are going to have that office, we need a \ndoctor who will advocate health measures which are in the overall best \ninterest of our country and with which most Americans can agree. Maybe \nit is good to have some leading-edge comments every now and then, but \nwe need not have those issues flaunted in our faces, as they have been \nfor the past couple of years and, frankly, as they were over a longer \nperiod of time. That is one reason why Dr. Foster, given some of the \nthings in his background, was a mistaken selection by the President of \nthe United States.\n  My next point is extremely important: No, we should not blame Dr. \nFoster for the mistakes of the administration in handling his \nnomination, but we should expect to get candid, direct, and accurate \ninformation on presidential nominees. There is no question that some \ninaccurate information was given to Senators, whether by the White \nHouse or by Doctor Foster himself. The Senator from Kansas, Nancy \nKassebaum, certainly was given some inaccurate or incomplete or \nmisleading information. Senator Kassebaum is not given to overreacting, \nbut she was one of the first to raise concerns about the way the Foster \nnomination was handled.\n  Then we went through the process of the administration's changing \ninformation it had previously provided concerning Doctor Foster's \nrecord. Clearly, it was not handled well by the administration. That \nalone is not enough to reject the nomination, but it certainly is a \nproblem.\n  What bothers me more than anything else about this nomination is that \nlack of total truthfulness, that changing of important information. \nMaybe it was because Dr. Foster was not familiar with the fast ways of \nWashington. Maybe he sometimes talked without checking his facts. But \nthe misstatements happened several times. There also were slips of the \ntongue when he questioned the motives and the background of the people \nwho opposed his nomination.\n  He subsequently said that was a mistake. But there is a pattern here, \na pattern of inadequate, insufficient or incorrect information from the \nadministration, a pattern of changing information from the nominee, and \na pattern of talking before thinking. That is what got Dr. Elders in \ntrouble. Why does anyone want to repeat that experience?\n  Dr. Foster got off to a bad start by repeatedly revising his \ninformation about the number of abortions he had performed in his \ncareer as an obstetrician-gynecologist. That was only the first of many \nconfusions which have, collectively, eroded his credibility.\n  For instance, we were told that his I Have a Future Program has had \nmarvelous results. I think the concept of that program is good. I would \nlike to see it work. I like the idea of abstinence education for teens, \nhelping them live up to their responsibility to avoid sexual activity. \nBut then we found out that that was not quite the case with Dr. \nFoster's program.\n  We found, moreover, that Dr. Foster was associated with organizations \nwhich, in fact, took quite a different approach to teen pregnancy. He \nhas had a long and close relationship with Planned Parenthood, which \nhas for years opposed abstinence-based programs like those funded under \nHHS' title XX program. Indeed, Dr. Foster held a high profile in that \norganization at the very time it was fighting in the courts against a \nTennessee parental notification law regarding abortion.\n  We also found what appears to be the very belated printing of \nbrochures stressing abstinence for his I Have a Future program. These \ndocuments seem to have been ordered from Meharry Medical College, where \nDoctor Foster is dean, on March 8, 1995, weeks after his program had \ncome under fire for its emphasis upon teen contraception instead of \nrestraint. This had all the earmarks of an organization doctoring its \nrecords to sway a Senate committee. The shipping invoice for the \npamphlets was dated March 23, 1995. They were passed out to the Labor \nand Human Resources Committee at Dr. Foster's hearing in early May.\n  So, once again, it seems that truth is an evolving matter where Dr. \nFoster is concerned. It has been shaded this way and that as we have \ngone through the process. Another example--and something about which I \nhave a great deal of concern--is the issue of involuntary \nsterilizations. At a time when the involuntary sterilization of \nretarded girls and mental patients had provoked national outrage, Dr. \nFoster reported his own expertise in that regard in an article in the \nSouthern Medical Journal. The article appeared in 1976, 3 years after \nan especially shocking case--the Relf case--occurred in Alabama, where \nDr. Foster was a prominent ob-gyn. The Federal courts, the Congress, \nthe Department of HEW were all involved. But the furor seems to have \nbeen lost on Dr. Foster.\n  Equally troublesome is the cloud of uncertainty that now obscures Dr. \nFoster's role in the notorious Tuskegee experiments, conducted over \ndecades in his home county of Macon, AL. It stretches credibility to be \ntold that a physician of Dr. Foster's prominence--indeed, the vice \npresident of the County Medical Society--did not know about all that.\n  How could he not have known that his fellow doctors had agreed to \nwithhold antibiotics from men being tortured and killed by syphilis? I \nfind it hard to believe that this information escaped him until it was \nnationally publicized--and he denounced it--years later.\n  The Foster nomination has presented a persistent pattern of \nmisinformation, not just the instances I have mentioned here, but \nothers, like his leadership of a research project at Meharry in \nconjunction with a pharmaceutical company. We still need a clearer \naccount of that episode, why it was undertaken and why it was \neventually abandoned.\n  All these things considered, I think it would be a mistake to confirm \nthis nominee. We do need more information, and more accurate \ninformation, before accepting Dr. Foster as Surgeon General. [[Page S \n8739]] \n  Dr. Foster's advocates are right in one regard. The real vote to \nconfirm or reject his nomination will occur today at noon. That is the \nvote on invoking cloture. That is the vote that counts.\n  I believe this nominee should not be confirmed. I urge our colleagues \nto consider the many serious reasons why I and other Senators have \ntaken that position. It is not just the abortion issue, but the many \nquestions about the veracity of the nominee concerning programs he was \ninvolved with, organizations he was associated with, and medical \ncontroversies in which he played a part.\n  I urge a vote against the cloture motion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts. Just in very brief form, because time is so limited, I \nsat here in amazement and I listened to what was being said very \ncarefully. I just heard that Planned Parenthood is opposed to \nabstinence for teenagers. I have never seen that mailing or that \nprogram. It is absurd. What we are talking about is a man and his \nprofessional qualifications to fill this job. He did not run for \noffice. That was not his credentials. He was not looking at how this \nmight be one day when he was considered for a nomination to a high \npost. He did what his conscience and the Hippocratic oath had him do. \nHe has been endorsed--I heard this morning on the radio, that Dr. \nMcAfee, the president of the American Medical Association, heartily \nendorses Dr. Foster and his qualifications. Further, he has been \nendorsed by the Association of American Medical Colleges, by the \nAssociation of Academic Health Centers, the American Academy of \nPediatrics, the Tennessee Medical Association, and the American College \nof Physicians. They all know he is qualified.\n  The problem here is not Dr. Foster's qualifications. The problem here \nis politics at the expense of the health of the American people. The \nproblem is that we are playing Presidential politics right here in this \nroom. It is pitiful. Talking about the fairness of the system and how \nit is equitable for a minority to restrict the majority view, why can \nwe not have a straight up-or-down vote on this without threats of \nfilibuster? When it was Robert Bork or John Tower or Clarence Thomas, \neven though there was strong opposition, many Senators opposed them. \nThe fact is that the votes were held here, up or down.\n  So when I sit here and I listen to what the debate is about, the \ndebate is not about Dr. Foster and it is not about fairness to the \nAmerican people; it is about who can score points. And they score \npoints, unfortunately, while Americans die. Every day, 2,000 Americans \ndie from heart disease. Every day, close to 1,200 men and women die \nfrom tobacco-related illness, people die from breast cancer, and every \nday 110 men and women and children die from AIDS. These figures are \ntragic, but what is more tragic is these deaths result from preventable \ndiseases.\n  I hear people castigating this very well-qualified physician, this \ncompassionate human being, who lifted himself up by his bootstraps, and \ncriticize him for what he did and for what he thought was right. I am \nnot much for biblical quotations, but John said, ``He that is without \nsin among you, let him first cast a stone.''\n  I hear mistakes being made all over the place here. We have an Ethics \nCommittee that hears breaches of conduct by the Senators. And, yes, \nthis man is condemned because he did what his conscience and the law \nallowed him to do. I think we ought to get an up-or-down vote on this. \nI hope my colleagues will vote for cloture and we can confirm Dr. \nFoster's appointment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in support of a vote for cloture. \nI believe this would probably be the first time in history if cloture \nis not granted for a nominee that has come out from a committee with a \npositive recommendation to be denied an up-or-down vote.\n  I also recognize from listening to those who have opposed granting \ncloture, that it is critical that we have debate on Dr. Foster, because \nthere is so much information out here which is incorrect.\n  I sat through the hearings, and I have gone through thousands of \npages of documentation, and I came to the conclusion that a President \nhas the right to have people around him who he wants to have, and he \nhas that right here.\n  There is nothing that should stand in the way. First of all, there is \nno evidence whatsoever that this man is not competent to handle the \njob.\n  Second, there is no credible evidence that there is any flaw in \ncharacter or any reason why this person should be denied the job.\n  To deny Dr. Foster the ability to have his nomination debated is \nindefensible, in my mind. I am not going to go into all the issues, but \nthere are a couple I would like to straighten out.\n  First of all, the Tuskegee situation. All of the argument has been \nabout who knew what when. When did it occur? Was he there? Was he not? \nWhat we do not know is whether at that meeting which the CDC held in \nTuskegee in the late 1960's, with the doctors of Macon County that they \nwere told anything about the fact that there was a group of black men \nbeing denied treatment in order to see the difference between treating \npeople with syphilis versus not treating them. That did not come out \nuntil the 1970's, and all hell broke loose, and everyone said what a \nshocking thing.\n  Whether Dr. Foster was there--the evidence was clear he was not--but \neven if he had been there, he would not have learned anything.\n  All of the information that has clouded that, strike it out of your \nmind, and remember that nobody at that time other than CDC knew the \nexperiment was being conducted. Whether he was there or not is \nirrelevant.\n  Second, another issue where there is confusion, as the previous \nspeaker from my side of the aisle got into, there were two situations \nwith respect to a sterilization situation which occurred in this \ncountry at a time when the decision was, and it was sort of ethical and \nconsidered wise in many respects, to sterilize seriously mentally \ndeficient people. That had nothing to do with Tuskegee. The previous \nspeaker got that confused. Make a judgment, but it was not unethical or \nimproper at that time. Later on it was discarded as a methodology.\n  Third, the abortion issue. Yes, there was changing information, \nconfusing information, things hard to follow. That was not the doctor's \nfault. He was very clear. He searched his records and found out, over \n30 years, performed 39 abortions, or was responsible for them. Thirty \nyears--that is not a doctor who is working in abortion clinics. He is \nan ob-gyn. Obviously, he is going to have a number of abortions during \nthat period of time, to save the life of the mother or whatever.\n  The abortion issue is one that has been made to be a key issue, when \nit should not be here at all.\n  I would ask Members to try and remove from your minds all the \ndiscussion we have had, and ask the simple question: Is this person \ndeserving of the right to have a vote of up or down? That is the crux \nof it.\n  We are having this cloture vote, because there are at least 51 votes \nthat will support Dr. Foster to be the next Surgeon General of the \nUnited States. This is an attempt to use the cloture--and some of these \nissues which the information is, at best, misunderstood--to try and \nprevent or even avoid having that opportunity to vote.\n  I urge my colleagues to seriously recognize and understand, first, \nthe facts are very clear that the doctor ought to be recommended. The \ncommittee recommended him. More importantly, that he ought to be \nentitled to an up-or-down vote on the issue. We will discuss it and \nspend a day or so discussing these things so we can clear this up in \neveryone's mind.\n  I spent days on this, and I am confident there is no reason this \ndoctor should not be confirmed. He certainly should be allowed to have \na vote up or down on whether or not he should be confirmed to be the \nnext Surgeon General of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  [[Page S 8740]]\n  \n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from South \nDakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the nomination of Dr. \nFoster. He does not represent the family values that my State seeks.\n  Also, I am very concerned about inconsistent statements. As has been \nstated on this floor, not to paraphrase from others, but the real issue \nshould not be whether or not young people will lose a clean needle when \nthey use drugs. The Surgeon General of the United States should \nencourage them to say ``No'' to drugs.\n  We really need to take a look at this position of Surgeon General and \nsee whether it even needs to exist in the future. The Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services is supposed to do this function.\n  If we are going to have a Surgeon General he should be a role model \nfor family values, for what our country believes in. He should be a \nstrong opponent of the use of drugs and of teenage pregnancies, stating \nhis opposition to it. Not stating other side issues such as using clean \nneedles, et cetera, et cetera.\n  I am strongly opposed to the nomination and shall vote against \ncloture. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 4 minutes \nand 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, many of my colleagues have quoted from \nnewspapers--Senator Coats quoted from the New York Times. But he failed \nto say something important: The New York Times says Foster deserves a \nvote. So do not just give half the story. They are calling for a vote. \nWe should vote ``yes'' on cloture.\n  The Boston Globe said it well. ``It is time for the opponents of \nFoster to choose: Either let Foster be confirmed without a fuss, or \nseek protection under the political equivalent of chapter 11, because \nall their arguments are bankrupt.'' They are bankrupt.\n  Then the Republican San Diego Union Tribune, quite a Republican \neditorial board, said: ``The more we learn about Foster, the more \nconvinced we are he would be an effective Surgeon General.'' The \nChicago Tribune says Foster's prospects for approval by the committee \nappear to be good, and of course they were right. The Republican \ncommittee sent him to this floor positively, but then they add, ``A \nfoul situation is developing in the Senate.''\n  My friends, a foul situation has developed in this Senate. This \nRepublican Senate is trying to deny this man a vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleagues who have \nbeen here on the floor this morning working very hard to bring this \nnomination to a vote.\n  I remind everyone that the clock is ticking on the health of all \nAmericans. Our Nation has been without a Surgeon General for 6 months.\n  I see this vote very clearly today: We are not voting on the \nnomination of Dr. Henry Foster today. We are voting on the opportunity \nfor Members to vote on that nomination. A ``no'' vote will send a very \nclear message to women across this country. It denies women the \nopportunity to have a Surgeon General who specializes in women's health \ncare.\n  A ``no'' vote denies teenagers across the Nation a spokesperson who \ncan give them hope and opportunity and who believes in them.\n  A ``no'' vote sends a message to all Americans that public service is \nnot something they should get involved in.\n  A ``no'' vote denies this country the service of not one man, but \nmany future leaders.\n  A ``yes'' vote says this body is fair and will allow the vote of Dr. \nFoster to come before this body.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 1 minute to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this debate of Dr. Foster has often \ncharacterized him in a way that I think is misleading. Dr. Foster has \nbeen characterized as someone who is not the man that I met in my \noffice.\n  Dr. Foster came and met with me, both in my office and met in the \ncommittee, and showed the kind of person we want to be the Surgeon \nGeneral of the United States.\n  First of all, he showed backbone and he showed guts. Anyone of a \nlesser personality would have flinched under this new toxic atmosphere \nin which we find Presidential nominees going forward. But he was \nwilling to speak to both friend and to foe, to speak with candor, \ngrace, dignity, quiet good humor, the willingness to set the record \nstraight.\n  That is why we can see why he was so well-regarded by his patients \nand by his own community with the bedside manner.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself the remaining minute.\n  The issue before the Senate comes down to a simple question of \nfundamental fairness. I believe that a majority and probability an \noverwhelming majority of our Republican Senate colleagues know in their \nhearts that Dr. Henry Foster deserves to be confirmed as the next \nSurgeon General of the United States.\n  Dr. Foster is a highly principled physician whose honesty, integrity, \nand outstanding character shine through. His extraordinary record of \nachievement shows, beyond any reasonable doubt, the lives he saved, the \ndoctors he has trained, and his pioneering leadership against teenage \npregnancy.\n  President George Bush sought to highlight his I Have a Future Program \nin Nashville, TN. He honored it as one of his 1,000 points of light.\n  We all know what is happening here. The normal confirmation process \nhas been sidetracked by Republican Presidential politics. Dr. Foster \ndeserves a vote. I hope the Senate will vote cloture on this so that he \ncan be judged fairly and honestly and candidly.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of Dr. \nHenry Foster's nomination to be Surgeon General.\n  Since February 2, when President Clinton first announced his nominee \nfor Surgeon General, a wide range of criticisms and attacks have been \nleveled against Dr. Foster. I believed and said from the very beginning \nDr. Foster deserved the same chance as every other nominee to address \nthese concerns in a committee hearing. That indeed is the reason for \nthe hearing process.\n  I further stated that, although I had not yet found any valid reason \nto oppose Dr. Foster's nomination, I would withhold my final decision \nuntil after the committee hearings were held. Now that the hearings are \nconcluded, I have decided that I will vote in support of Dr. Foster's \nnomination. I believe any questions as to whether or not Dr. Foster is \nfit or qualified for this position were dispelled during the hearings. \nI think it is fair to say that this was never the chief concern about \nthe nomination.\n  I realize that there are some people who oppose his nomination \nbecause he, like many obstetrician-gynecologists, performed abortions \nin the practice of his profession. However, I do not believe Dr. Foster \nshould be disqualified from serving as Surgeon General solely because \nhe performed abortions. We face the possibility of such a history \nwhenever we consider an obstetrician-gynecologist for this position.\n  Much has been said about Dr. Foster's ``credibility'' due to some \ninitial confusion about how many abortions he performed in the course \nof practicing his profession for more than 20 years. Dr. Foster \naddressed these concerns honestly and forthrightly in his opening \nstatement before the Labor and Human Resources Committee.\n  In that statement, he asserts that:\n\n       I regret the initial confusion on this issue. But there was \n     never any intent to deceive. I had no reason to do so * * *. \n     I have worked very hard to establish a record of credibility \n     and ethical conduct. It is open to anyone who chooses to \n     scrutinize it.\n\n  I think that those of us in public life should be able to eternally \nempathize with him about the difficulty of ``getting it exactly right'' \nwhen speaking to a reporter.\n  Not only did Dr. Foster address the ``credibility issue'' in his \nstatement, but he also outlined what kind of Surgeon General he says he \nwill be and how he intends to focus on the ``full range of health \nchallenges'' facing our Nation, including cancer, AIDS, heart disease, \nmaternal and child health, aging, substance abuse, violence, and teen \npregnancy. [[Page S 8741]] \n  Another issue raised during the hearings was the question of whether \nor not Dr. Foster had personal knowledge prior to 1972 of the \n``Tuskegee study'' in which black men were denied treatment for \nsyphilis in order that doctors could observe how the disease \nprogressed. This experiment was abruptly terminated in 1972 when it was \npublicly disclosed that then-available treatments were being withheld \nfrom these men. When questioned at the hearings, Dr. Foster stated \nemphatically that he had no knowledge of the study before 1972. In \nfact, Dr. Foster never approved of or in any way cooperated with this \nstudy. In 1972, when he was fully informed of it, he immediately called \nfor the study to be stopped and for the surviving men to be treated.\n  The real issue about this nomination, for me, is not ``the bad \nthings'' Dr. Foster did not do, but the many noble, altruistic things \nhe has done. I have had several opportunities to visit personally with \nDr. Foster and to question him on various issues. He described to me \nhis\n work with disadvantaged youths and the role he played in creating the \n``I Have a Future'' Program that encourages teens in some of \nNashville's toughest housing projects to be sexually abstinent and to \navoid drugs. I am impressed by the fact that Dr. Foster has spent his \nlifetime preaching abstinence. It is not just a slogan or a high-minded \nphrase for him. He has been right down in the trenches helping some of \nthe poorest people in society. Many lives, including hundreds of young \npeople, have been touched by Dr. Foster's work in his community. He is \na good and generous man.\n\n  Dr. Foster's philosophy emphasizes delaying sexual activity, \nproviding education and job training, and ensuring access to \ncomprehensive health services. Not only has he been successful in \nreducing teen pregnancy, but he has also helped to instill the values \nof personal responsibility, belief in God, and self-esteem in many \nyoung people who live in absolute poverty and are most ``at risk.'' \nMany of those youth traveled to Washington this past winter to express \ntheir admiration and respect for Dr. Foster. All anyone had to do was \nlisten to their personal stories to understand how Dr. Foster has made \na profound impact on their lives.\n  Dr. Foster is one of the leading experts on, and advocates for, \nmaternal and child health, and has developed and directed teen \npregnancy and drug abuse prevention programs that bolster self-esteem, \nand encourage personal responsibility. He has had a distinguished \ncareer as a physician and community leader, and I believe he is a very \nqualified nominee who will make an outstanding Surgeon General.\n  Finally, I would implore my colleagues to at the very least bring \nthis man's nomination to a vote. I know that many in my party are \ndispleased by the way the administration failed to display all relevant \ninformation about this nomination. And, I know that many have strongly \nheld views about abortion. But, do not make this man the victim of \nthose controversies. There are other places to voice displeasure about \nthese matters. A nominee, who comes before this body, seeking only to \nserve his country, deserves far better.\n  Dr. Foster has strong bipartisan support both inside the Senate as \nwell as around the country. I look forward to seeing him make a \npositive contribution to the Nation's public health.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Dr. Henry \nFoster to be the Surgeon General of the United States.\n  Over the past 4 months, Dr. Foster's entire career has been under \ngreat scrutiny. Opponents of his pro-choice stance have looked for \nevery shred of information that could cast a shadow on the character \nand integrity of Dr. Foster. I believe that his opponents have failed \nin this effort.\n  I followed the nomination hearing with great interest. During the \nhearing, Dr. Foster conveyed a sincere vision of what he would do as \nSurgeon General. His top priority would be to continue his work on \nreducing teenage pregnancy. This is an important vision.\n  I am astounded by the personal attacks that have been made against \nDr. Foster on the floor of the Senate today. I believe we should be \nfocusing on the thousands of babies that Dr. Foster has delivered and \nthe thousands of teenagers he has counseled. Instead, the focus has \nbeen on a medical procedure that is legal in all 50 States.\n  I believe Dr. Foster is a man of integrity who will excel as Surgeon \nGeneral.\n  When President Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, I was the first member of the Senate to declare my opposition to \nhis nomination. I did not believe that Clarence Thomas was qualified to \nserve on the Court. Even with strong reservations, I felt that Judge \nThomas deserved an up-or-down vote.\n  I hope the opponents of Dr. Foster will let his nomination come to a \nvote. He deserves no less.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on May 25, the Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee voted to approve President Clinton's nomination of \nDr. Henry Foster as Surgeon General, over my opposition. I voted \nagainst Dr. Foster because he has shown extreme intolerance of those \nwith whom he disagrees, and is therefore not the kind of Surgeon \nGeneral who can or will exercise broad moral leadership. I intend to \nvote against his nomination here in the Senate if that nomination comes \nto a vote.\n  Dr. Foster's indulgence in name-calling--decrying those who disagreed \nwith him as ``white, right-wing extremists''--came after his \nnomination, when he was already a public figure. His behavior shows his \nlack of capacity to build consensus. For the first 2 years of the \nClinton administration, this Nation suffered a needlessly divisive \nSurgeon General. We do not need another for the remaining year and a \nhalf. The next surgeon general should heal wounds, not deepen them.\n  Despite my opposition to Dr. Foster's confirmation, however, I will \nvote for cloture. If a majority of the Senate is willing to confirm the \nnominee, then he should be confirmed. All sides have had ample time to \nair their views; no useful purpose is served by further delay.\n  But the most important reason not to filibuster Dr. Foster's \nnomination is that a filibuster will set a terribly damaging precedent. \nHad this tactic been used 4 years ago, Clarence Thomas would not be on \nthe U.S. Supreme Court today. Dr. Foster deserves a straight up-or-down \nvote. Whether one agrees with him or not, he is entitled to the same \nconsideration given almost every other nominee.\n  In 2 years, a Republican President will be submitting nominees for \nfar more important offices. That President will appoint Cabinet members \nand Supreme Court Justices who undoubtedly will be opposed by Democrats \nand the national media. I do not want to make it easy for them to stall \nnominations of future conservatives by giving their opponents the moral \nprecedent to use the filibuster as a means of defeating them. I also do \nnot want to further cloud the nomination process by essentially \nensuring that the only nominees who can gather the necessary 60 votes \nfor confirmation are those with no track record, no history of making \nbold statements, and no strong views that make them attractive to large \nsegments of our Nation.\n  Nominations to the Supreme Court are the most important a President \ncan make, nominations that affect the future of the country long after \nthe President who made them is gone. To put at risk future nominations \nto the Supreme Court just so we can hand President Clinton a setback \ntoday makes little sense.\n  I agree that Dr. Foster should not be put in a position where he will \nhave a forum to speak about the important issues of the day. He has \nalready proven that when he is given that opportunity, he will make \ncomments that divide our Nation and lead to the kind of debate we see \nhere on the Senate floor. Dr. Foster is not a builder; to the contrary, \nhe uses political rhetoric to divide people, a tactic that makes for \ncaptivating headlines in the newspapers and provocative television \nstories, but does little to make our Nation stronger.\n  So let me be clear--no matter how strongly I feel that the nomination \nof Dr. Foster should be defeated, I am not willing to put the long-term \nfuture of our Nation at risk by allowing a precedent to be set that \ncould lead to the filibuster of the next Republican nomination to the \nSupreme Court.\n  In short, my Republican colleagues should not now set a precedent \nthey will soon come to regret. To prevent this vote from coming to the \nfloor is to [[Page S 8742]] thwart the democratic process and to tamper \nwith appropriate executive privilege. I remain as opposed as ever to \nthe confirmation of Dr. Foster, but I am unwilling to put the long-term \nfuture of our Nation at risk by allowing such a mischievous precedent \nto be set.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe nomination of Dr. Henry Foster, Jr., as Surgeon General. The issue \nis not one of abortion. I believe the President of the United States \nhas the authority to nominate whomever he pleases to represent his \nposition. However, the position of Surgeon General is unique in that it \nrequires pulling Americans together as this nation's doctor.\n  Unfortunately, Dr. Foster's credibility to represent the public \nhealth concerns of this country was severely damaged during the \nnomination process. I am deeply concerned about Dr. Foster's \nconflicting statements with the findings by the Senate Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources and with the White House. Our Nation's \n``family doctor'' needs to be consistent and must speak with \ncredibility so all will listen.\n  This time of exploration into the background of Dr. Foster has caused \nme to evaluate the role of the Office itself. It seems to me when this \ncountry is making priorities in the budget, it does not appear that the \nOffice of Surgeon General is particularly integral to the overall \nmission the Federal Government faces. The Secretary of Health and Human \nServices has a budget of $726.5 billion. Surely, the Secretary can take \nover the role of the Surgeon General and save the taxpayers substantial \nmoney.\n  The Office was created back in 1870 in order to direct the Marine \nHospital Service. The primary purpose was to provide health care \nservices to sailors. It is clear to me that the Office has outlived its \nintended service.\n  Mr. President, many issues that Surgeon Generals in the past have \ntrumpeted, like the risk of smoking and fetal alcohol syndrome, are \ncrucial to health of our country. No one wants to silence that \ndiscussion. Those public health concerns can and should continue to be \na priority, but as part of the role of our Secretary for the Department \nof Health and Human Services, or even in certain circumstances the \nPresident himself.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for the \nnomination of Dr. Henry Foster, Jr. to be Surgeon General of the United \nStates. I do so because Dr. Foster fulfills the two conditions I \nconsistently apply when deciding whether to support a particular \nnominee's confirmation: First, is this nominee ethical with a \nprofessional record of integrity; and second, does this nominee possess \nthe proper professional qualifications and background for his or her \nparticular position?\n  My conclusion is that Dr. Foster fulfills both criteria. He is first \na man of high integrity and ethics; and second has demonstrated a \nlifetime record of professional accomplishment, commitment, and \nscholarship to the field of medicine, and in particular, gynecology and \nobstetrics.\n  Throughout the years I have applied these two criteria consistently \nand even-handedly, even when a nominee's own personal ideology has at \ntimes differed from my own. I do so again today.\n  Dr. Foster is a classic obstetrician-gynecologist of the highest \norder. He is not an abortion doctor. In fact, throughout his medical \npractice and career, Dr. Foster has promoted abstinence as the best way \nto prevent unwanted pregnancy. His practice has focused on delivering \nhealthy babies and educating young people about proper family planning \nso that unwanted pregnancies and abortions can be avoided. Dr. Foster \nhas demonstrated particular commitment and compassion to both rural and \ninner-city America and the unique health care-related problems these \ntwo areas face.\n  I respect the concerns of those who oppose Dr. Foster. Yet I also \nbelieve it is fair and appropriate to give this nominee the benefit of \nthe doubt. Years ago, there was another Surgeon General nominee that \nattracted more than his fair share of criticism, although most of that \ncriticism came from the left. That was, of course, Dr. C. Everett Koop.\n  Dr. Koop went on to prove his detractors wrong. He went on to serve \nthe Reagan administration with great class and distinction. And I would \nurge Dr. Foster to look toward Dr. Koop as a role model. If he does \nthat, I am convinced he will be a great Surgeon General.\n  In sum, over the last four decades Dr. Foster has proven to be a \nrespected scholar, an accomplished researcher, a practicing physician, \nand an esteemed medical school dean. I believe that a person of Dr. \nFoster's professional background should be confirmed.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of Dr. \nHenry W. Foster, Jr., to be Surgeon General of the United States.\n  While I recognize the concerns that have been expressed about this \nnomination, after reviewing his Senate Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee confirmation hearings, I am confident that Dr. Foster \nanswered all questions honestly and openly and is well qualified for \nthe position of Surgeon General. Accordingly, I will vote for cloture \nand in support of his nomination if cloture is envoked.\n  Any examination of Dr. Foster's record, Mr. President, shows that Dr. \nFoster has dedicated his life to the health and well-being of others--a \nqualification uniquely suited to a Surgeon General nominee.\n  Dr. Foster has worked at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, TN, \nwhere he has received numerous honors for his work in obstetrics, \ntreatment of sickle cell anemia, and teen pregnancy prevention. In \n1988, in a Tennessee housing project, Dr. Foster began his I Have a \nFuture project which encourages young people to practice abstinence and \nwas named by former President George Bush as one of his Thousand Points \nof Light.\n  And Dr. Foster's record of service continues to this very day.\n  Mr. President, at the very least, Dr. Foster deserves a vote by this \nbody on the merits of his nomination. We owe him that much. So I urge \nmy colleagues to support today's vote to envoke cloture on the \nnomination of Dr. Henry Foster as Surgeon General of the United States.\n  With that I thank the chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Does the Senator from Indiana have any further speakers?\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time, since I know \nwe are virtually out of time at this point. I will allocate whatever \nleader time may be required to make my statement.\n  Mr. President, several facts need to be emphasized before we take \nthis vote. First, Dr. Foster may be one of the most qualified \nnominations ever to be made for Surgeon General of the United States. \nNo one denies the fact that he has had an extraordinarily distinguished \ncareer--as a dedicated public servant, as an accomplished educator, as \nan exemplary community leader.\n  Dr. Foster has touched and positively influenced more people's lives \nthan most can hope to in a lifetime. More than 10,000 children who owe \ntheir lives and health to Dr. Foster can attest to that.\n  Second, the fact is we need a Surgeon General now. We need a leader \nin health, just as we need a leader in economics, in law, or in foreign \npolicy. Some would argue we need a Surgeon General even more than in \nthese other areas.\n  Many of the most serious health problems plaguing our country are \nthose money and health insurance cannot solve. They are problems of \npublic health: smoking, teenage pregnancy, breast cancer, AIDS, and \nviolence. Every 59 seconds, a baby is born to a teen mother. Every 30 \nseconds, a child in our Nation smokes for the first time. Every day, \n2,000 Americans die of heart disease. This year, 46,000 women will die \nof breast cancer. These figures are all the more tragic because, in \nlarge measure, they are preventable.\n  But how do we prevent these problems without leadership? The answer \nis, we cannot. The two most powerful tools of prevention are public \neducation and moral suasion, both functions of leadership. No one is \nbetter suited than the Surgeon General to use each of these tools.\n  The third fact, and it is a fact, is that a majority of Senators \nrecognize both [[Page S 8743]] the need for a Surgeon General and the \nqualifications of Dr. Foster. Democrats and Republicans supported Dr. \nFoster's nomination in committee. Democrats and Republicans support his \nnomination now. It is clear that a majority of this body supports this \nnomination today. They know how badly we need a Surgeon General. They \nknow how important it is, how important these issues of public health \nare. They know how eminently qualified Dr. Foster is. They know what a \nskilled Surgeon General he will be.\n  But they also know there is a catch. The catch is there is a minority \nof Senators who, for the most unfortunate reasons, want to deny Dr. \nFoster even the opportunity for a vote. They know that Dr. Foster may \nbe the first victim of Republican Presidential politics; that this vote \nmay be hostage to a narrow constituency in the Republican Party who \nhold a different philosophical view than Dr. Foster. That is really \nwhat this is all about. It is about whether or not the far right has \nenough influence to stop a qualified public servant from serving his \ncountry. It is about whether some who seek the Republican Presidential \nnomination can make this the first vote of the Republican primaries.\n  Mr. President, this matter is too important to be trivialized by \npolitics. This nomination, more than virtually any other, will affect \nthe lives of millions of children and other Americans who need the \nleadership that Dr. Foster can give. It is a matter of fairness, not \nonly to Dr. Foster, but to all those who now wait--who wait for \nsolutions to breast cancer, who wait for help for teenage pregnancy, \nwho wait for strategies in coping more ably with violence, with AIDS, \nwith heart disease.\n  In the cause of fairness, in the cause of doing what is right, let us \nstand united as Democrats and Republicans in giving this man and our \ncountry what he and it deserves--a vote for cloture and a vote for the \nconfirmation of the next Surgeon General for the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  The Chair might inform the majority leader there are 11 minutes and \n27 seconds remaining on the side opposing the nomination, and of course \nthe leader has time.\n  Mr. DOLE. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  I think most everything has been said, but I just want to repeat a \nfew things and sort of set the record straight about some other things. \nTo begin with, maybe just a little history here might help some of my \ncolleagues who may not have been here at that time.\n  From 1987 to 1992, I served as Senate minority leader under \nPresidents Reagan and Bush. There can be little doubt that during that \ntime, the process of Senate confirmation became more contentious and \nmore political than ever before. Some of the nominations that became \npolitical footballs are well known--Robert Bork, John Tower, and \nClarence Thomas, to name a few. But most of us here have probably \nforgotten about the others. While we may have forgotten, I am certain \ntheir families have not forgotten and they probably have not forgotten, \neither.\n  This is not my information; it is information provided by the \nCongressional Research Service. During the 6 years Democrats controlled \nthe Senate under Presidents Reagan and Bush, 11 nominees were reported \nout of the committee but did not receive a vote on the floor of the \nSenate. In other words, they came out here and that was the end of it. \nThey did not get any vote; not on cloture, not anything. They just sat \nhere and they went away at the end of the session.\n  Eighteen nominees were allowed a committee hearing but not a \ncommittee vote. Is that fairness? We had all this talk about fairness. \nWhere is the fairness in that, when you have a hearing and no vote?\n  And a staggering 166 nominees were not even given the courtesy of a \ncommittee hearing.\n  Let us get everything straight out here. I have listened to all the \ncrocodile tears this morning about this nomination, but I have not \nheard anybody go back and review what has happened in the past. These \nare facts. These are facts. These are not Bob Dole's facts. These are \nfacts.\n  I was just one of the many Senators, Democrat and Republican alike, \nwho said during those years that if the Senate continued to turn \nconfirmations into inquisitions, then good men and women would be no \nlonger interested in serving in our Government.\n  When President Clinton took office, my philosophy remained the same: \nAbsent unusual circumstances, a President's nominee should generally be \nconfirmed. And Republicans cooperated to confirm President Clinton's \nCabinet in record time. I think even the President said so when he \ncalled me.\n  In fact, during his 2\\1/2\\ years in the White House, President \nClinton has submitted 248 names to the Senate for confirmation to \ncivilian positions. Several have been controversial, but not one has \nbeen defeated in committee or here on the floor--not one. Not one.\n  My point is this: When we were in the minority, Republicans did not \nabuse the nomination process. And we will not abuse it now that we are \nin the majority. And we have not abused it with this nomination.\n  I assume, when people refer to Presidential politics, they may have \nme in that category. Everything around here is Presidential politics up \nhere, but not downtown. Oh, it is all statesmanship in the White House. \nIt would never occur to them to have any Presidential politics.\n  When this nomination was made, that was Presidential politics, to try \nto drive a wedge between Republicans on the issue of abortion. That is \nwhat it is all about. President Clinton made a calculated political \nmove--politics. Politics, not qualification.\n  Nobody, including Dr. Foster, can question the fairness of the \nhearings chaired by Senator Kassebaum who, if cloture is invoked, will \nvote against Dr. Foster.\n At no time did the hearings become a media circus. We went through \nmedia circuses this year, and when the Democrats had control, we had \nnominees who were being pilloried day by day and ridiculed by the \nmedia, by the liberal media.\n\n  Dr. Foster was asked tough questions. He gave his answers and the \ncommittee voted him out 9 to 7.\n  I heard on the morning news that this has been delayed and delayed. I \nam going to give the facts again, as I did when this debate started.\n  This nomination was put on the calendar the 26th of May, the day we \nwent out for the Memorial Day recess. We came back on the 5th of June. \nAs I calculate, today is the 21st. I said that I wanted to meet with \nDr. Foster. He could not meet the first weekend because he had \ncommitments. I do not fault him for that. I could not meet the next \nweekend. We met on Monday. Today, we have the debate on the floor--on \nWednesday.\n  So I want to set the record straight for those who are saying somehow \nthis has all been held up. It has not been held up at all on the Senate \nfloor. In fact, I think it is a very expeditious handling of the \nnomination.\n  Yes, supporters of the nominee must obtain 60 votes. That is the way \nit works. I have had the Congressional Research Service do a little \nwork in that area. I have heard people say, ``Oh, this never happened \nbefore.'' It has happened a lot. I voted. Let me just give you a little \ninformation here. Sometimes facts may not be important, but they are \nnice to have in the record.\n  Cloture was first sought on a nomination in 1968, when a motion to \nproceed to the consideration of the Abe Fortas nomination--Chief \nJustice of the Supreme Court--was defeated 45 to 43. When cloture was \nnot invoked, President Johnson withdrew the nomination. Since 1968, 24 \nnominations have been subjected to cloture votes.\n  So there have been plenty of precedents for cloture proceedings on \nnominations.\n  In 1980, as the Senator from Massachusetts will recall, the \nnomination of Stephen Breyer to the Circuit Court of Appeals was \nsubject to a cloture vote because of Republican concerns. Cloture was \ninvoked, and the nomination was confirmed. I voted aye on cloture, and \nI voted aye on the nomination.\n  In 1986, a very, very important nomination, the nomination of William \nRehnquist to be Chief Justice of the [[Page S 8744]] Supreme Court was \nsubjected to a cloture vote--the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court \nsubjected to a cloture vote; not some small office with a staff of \nseven, with no policy, nothing but a public relations office. I voted \nyes on the cloture motion. I voted yes on final passage.\n  Prior to the 103d Congress, the following nonjudicial nominations \nhave been subjected to the cloture procedure: William Lubbers, \nnominated to be general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, \n1980; Don Zimmerman, nominated to be a member of the National Labor \nRelations Board, 1980; Melissa Wells, nominated to the rank of \nAmbassador, 1987; and William Verity, nominated to be Secretary of \nCommerce, 1987. On each of these nominations, cloture was invoked and \nthe nominations were confirmed. And that is only part of the story.\n  I remember meeting a few years ago with a fellow named Bill Lucas, an \noutstanding black American who was sheriff in Wayne County, MI; an \noutstanding man, a Republican. The Black Caucus did not show up for \nthat event. But he was an outstanding American. The vote in the \ncommittee was 7 to 7, a tie. That was the end of it. We never had a \nvote. We never had anything on the Senate floor because the Judiciary \nCommittee said, ``No; we are not even going to report it out, not even \nunfavorably.'' That is fairness? I do not think so. It was not fairness \nfor Bill Lucas. It was not fairness to his family. He did not have any \nhearing on the Senate floor.\n  So I just suggest that we are all talking about all this being fair. \nI have a memory for fairness. I have been here a while, and I have \ntried to be fair. I had a number of options--not bring it up at all. \nBut I did not believe that was appropriate. I thought about it. It was \nan option. But that would have been one person making a decision for \n100 Senators, and I did not do it although it has been done in the past \nby majority leaders on the other side when they had a majority, not to \nbring it up at all. But I chose not to do that. I do not believe we \ngive up our rights when we bring it up. We are not giving up our \nrights. And I can understand where people would have different views.\n  I would say, as I have said, I had a good visit with Dr. Foster. I \nthink he is a very nice person. We are not voting on that. There were \ncontradictions in his statements. I asked him 20 to 25 questions, and I \ntried to make a record so I would understand, myself, on much of the \ndebate. I read the information which Senator Coats sent to each of us, \nwhich was very helpful.\n  I was troubled by the Tuskegee information. I was troubled by \nsterilization of some mentally retarded women. I was troubled by a lot \nof these things that Dr. Foster had no recollection of. I could not \nunderstand it. But again, let some say, ``OK, maybe you can dismiss \nthat.'' So I just suggest that there may be a lot of things--I am proud \nof the fact that Dr. Foster is a veteran. He served his country. I am \nproud of that. He is proud of that.\n  I just want to suggest that a cloture vote on a nomination is nothing \nnew here in the Senate. As I said, there are 24 nominations that have \nbeen subjected to cloture votes since 1968. And one of those votes \noccurred on the nomination of William Rehnquist to be Chief Justice of \nthe United States, the head of the third branch of our Government, and \nwe had to have a cloture vote.\n  So it seems to me that we understand the options. I told Dr. Foster \nwe would not let him hang there in limbo. He told me his sabbatical \nends the first of the month. He has been on a year of sabbatical, and \nhe would like to have some determination. I think he is entitled to it. \nThat is why we are here today.\n  So I must say, we said let us do it. The Democrats said, ``Oh, we \nwould like to wait a week''--so they can work over Republican Senators \nand try to get the liberal media to follow the steps that they normally \ndo and spread their spin across America.\n  So I say again, about Presidential politics, certainly everything is \nnot Presidential politics here. If I wanted to have one-upmanship, I \nwould not have brought the nomination up. Maybe others have ideas about \nPresidential politics. But again, let me suggest that certainly it was \nnot overlooked at the White House.\n  I think another major point is candor. I think even Dr. Foster's \nsupporters have to say on a number of occasions, this nominee's candor \nhas come into question. All of these were not Dr. Foster's fault. This \nparticular nomination was flawed from the outset because of the way it \nwas handled at the White House, the way they did not bring out all of \nthe information right up front. I know that was not Dr. Foster's fault.\n  In his committee hearing, in his public statements, and in his \nmeeting with me, Dr. Foster had an explanation for every misstatement \nconcerning the number of abortions he performed and for every \ncontroversial action, including his alleged knowledge of the infamous \nTuskegee syphilis study and his role in sterilizing several mentally \nretarded women during the early 1970's. Some explanations made sense, \nand some did not. Some questions were answered and some were not.\n  And somewhere along the line, I think a line was crossed where no \nmatter how Dr. Foster tries, there will always be questions in the \nminds of many Americans about this nominee's candor and credibility.\n  This is not just the opinion, as has been noted here--I have watched \nevery debate on C-SPAN--it is not just the opinion of a few \nconservative Senators. It is also the opinion from an editorial in \ntoday's New York Times.\n  But it seems to me, Mr. President, that we have President Clinton \ndemanding we return to civility in our politics. He said the Americans \nwant Republicans and Democrats to work together for the betterment of \nour country.\n  If that is true--and I think it is--then this nomination certainly \ndoes not further those goals. Without consulting with Senator \nKassebaum, my colleague, or any other Senator, President Clinton \nselected a nominee who was all but guaranteed to cause a political \ncontroversy, a nominee who was all but guaranteed to divide the Senate, \nand all America, as well. And that is just what this nomination has \ndone.\n  Sadly, this divisive nomination was made in the wake of the forced \nresignation of a Surgeon General whose tenure led many to believe that \nthe time had come to abolish the office before it became even more \npoliticized than it was.\n  So again, I will conclude by saying that while I admire Dr. Foster's \nmilitary service and his obvious passion for his work--and he has done \na lot of good work--that somewhere out there among America's hundreds \nof thousands of physicians, there is a man or a woman whose past \nactions and statements would not divide the American people and this \nChamber. They can be pro-choice. They could be pro-life. They could be \nwhatever. There are thousands and thousands of qualified people out \nthere. The Surgeon General should be ``America's doctor''--America's \ndoctor.\n  I have listened to these statements, one just by the Democratic \nleader, about cancer, heart disease, the Surgeon General is going to \ntake care of all these things. If we just confirm Dr. Foster, all these \nthings are going to go away. We know that is not the case.\n  They should not be the Democrat's doctor or the Republican's doctor. \nThey should not be the liberal's doctor or the conservative's doctor. \nIdeally, their qualifications and experience should be so apparent that \nthey would be confirmed by an overwhelming vote. And this is most \nassuredly not the case here. The bottom line is, will Dr. Foster unite \nthe American people? Will his public pronouncements and speeches be \nregarded as medical and scientific fact rather than political rhetoric? \nWould he be regarded as America's doctor? That is the question we need \nto answer.\n  As I said, he may be a fine person, but in my view he is the wrong \nperson for this job.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator \nfrom Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished chairman and the \nSenator from Maine.\n  Mr. President, it was a real pleasure for me on February 16 of this \nyear to join the distinguished chairman of this committee, the ranking \nmember, Senator Baucus, and chairman of the subcommittee, Senator \nWarner, with whom I joined in introducing S. 440, the National Highway \nSystem Designation Act of 1995.\n  Since its introduction, the Subcommittee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure, of which I am a member, conducted four hearings, had a \nfull committee markup and moved this bill to the point where we are \nnow. This is a priority measure. I am very grateful for the bipartisan \nleadership and support that this measure has obtained.\n  The concept of the NHS was authorized in the big Federal highway \nbill, ISTEA, to solicit State and local input in designing a national \ntransportation system which would move people and goods efficiently and \nsafely across the country.\n  This is something I have worked for throughout my career in State and \nFederal government, and it has always been important to those of us in \nmy State of Missouri, that we who are at the crossroads of the Nation \nbe included in a modern national network that would provide Missouri \nthe same kind of full access to the markets that the coasts currently \nhave, and it would provide our friends and neighbors from other States \nthe opportunity for efficient transportation through the heartland of \nthe Nation.\n  NHS was developed from the bottom up. In our State, the highway and \ntransportation department coordinated with metropolitan planning \norganizations, regional planning agencies, highway groups and local \nofficials to determine the highway priorities.\n  Missouri then acted promptly in submitting the approved plan to the \nFederal Department of Transportation for incorporation into the overall \nsystem. This, to me, Mr. President, is a great example of the \ncooperation between Federal, State, local governments, and private \nsector organizations, and we should encourage this kind of cooperation \nin the future.\n  In its entirety, as the Members well know, NHS will be a 159,000-mile \nnetwork of interstate highways, major arterials and key corridors \nacross the United States. These highways will carry more than 75 \npercent of all commercial traffic, although they comprise only 4 \npercent of the Nation's highway mileage. For our State of Missouri, Mr. \nPresident, this means 3,490 rural and 973 urban miles of highways that \nare the most economically important roads in the State, carrying 46 \npercent of all motor vehicle traffic.\n  The NHS will be the backbone of our transportation infrastructure \nnetwork. They will carry over 40 percent of the Nation's highway \ntraffic, 75 percent of heavy truck traffic, and 80 percent of our \ntourist traffic, which is vitally important to us. These highways are \ncritical for both State and interregional commerce. These highways are \nthe economic lifeline, especially for States like mine.\n  I know that in striving to reach a balanced budget by 2002, we have \nto make tough choices and recognize that the Government cannot do it \nall. But by developing and passing the NHS, we are establishing \npriorities, priorities on our highway and transportation needs, in \norder to ensure that we invest our limited funds wisely. We recognize \nthe role that the transportation infrastructure has with the state of \nour economy. It is imperative that these critical things receive \npriority attention.\n  We must realize the importance of this legislation being passed and \nsigned into law by September 30 of this year. Without passage, States \nwill not receive their apportionments of $6.5 billion. There is $156 \nmillion for our State of Missouri. We cannot delay or hinder the \npassage of this bill which means so much to our constituents. I join my \ncolleagues in urging prompt adoption of this measure here. I also urge \nour colleagues in the House to act on this legislation before it is too \nlate. This is of vital national concern.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I particularly thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine for yielding time to me.\n[[Page S 8746]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 1442\n\n(Purpose: To eliminate the penalties for noncompliance by States with a \n            program requiring the use of motorcycle helmets)\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Snowe], for herself, Mr. \n     Campbell, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Smith, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \n     Kohl, and Mr. Kempthorne, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1442.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . ELIMINATION OF PENALTIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE WITH \n                   MOTORCYCLE HELMET USE REQUIREMENT.\n\n       Section 153(h) of title 23, United States Code, is amended \n     by striking ``a law described in subsection (a)(1) and'' each \n     place it appears.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am now offering an amendment today, along \nwith my colleague, Senator Campbell from Colorado, as well as my \ncolleagues, Senators Moseley-Braun, Smith, Feingold, Kohl, and \nKempthorne. Essentially, what our amendment would do is to repeal the \npenalty that would be imposed on those 25 States that have yet to pass \na mandatory helmet law.\n  Yesterday, Senator Smith from New Hampshire offered an amendment that \nincluded both seatbelt and helmet laws. That amendment failed. So I am \nnow offering today an amendment that would help 25 States--half of our \ncountry--who have yet to pass a mandatory helmet law.\n  We had considerable debate yesterday as to whether or not it is \nappropriate for the Federal Government to intrude upon decisions that \nrightfully belong to the States. We began this Congress with a pledge \nto reduce the size and the scope of the Federal Government and to \nrestore the ability of States to resolve their own problems with their \nown solutions and with their own people.\n  I think we need to hold firm to that commitment. It is not a one-time \ndeal or a part-time arrangement that we have for the people of this \ncountry to meet a commitment that they demanded in the last election. \nReducing the size, scope, and intrusion of the Federal Government is a \ncentral part of our legislative agenda in this Congress. That is why I \nam introducing this amendment here today. It is one that I have worked \non and Senator Campbell has worked on over the years. We happen to \nthink that it is inappropriate for the Federal Government to impose on \nthe States a mandate and a requirement that they have to enact specific \nlaws, otherwise, in this instance, they lose a percentage of their \ntransportation funds.\n  As we know it, ISTEA was passed in 1991, and penalties took effect a \nyear later, and States could enact both a mandatory seatbelt and helmet \nlaw. There are two States that have yet to enact seatbelt laws--Maine \nand New Hampshire. There are 25 States that have yet to enact mandatory \nhelmet laws. And these penalties take effect in October of 1995, \nwhereby 1.5 percent of the transportation funds from that particular \nState will be diverted to safety education programs. In 1996, it will \nbe 3 percent of the transportation funds that will be diverted to \nsafety education programs. All told, that represents, in the year 1995, \na loss, as exemplified by this chart, of $48 million to those 25 States \nin badly needed highway improvement funds or bridge repair.\n  In 1996, the penalty is doubled to $97 million for those 25 States. \nThey will lose precious transportation funds--funds that already had \nbeen appropriated to the States, which I think is very unprecedented, \nand will be used for safety education programs.\n  If you look at the State of Illinois, it would lose $12,480,000 in \nthe year 1996. Ohio will lose, in 1996, $9,280,000. That is a \nsubstantial amount of money to be lost for any State when it comes to \nhighway repair. Certainly, it is true for my State of Maine, which has \nmore than 22,000 road miles in the State. We need every dollar we can \nuse for highway repair.\n  Now, under this penalty, the State of Maine will be required to \ndouble the amount of money for safety education programs, to more than \n$1 million, as a result of this penalty. It will be money that cannot \nbe used for highway road repair if they do not pass a mandatory helmet \nlaw. I think that, frankly, is the wrong approach to take. It is, \nagain, Federal Government micromanaging State policy. It is \ndemonstrating the arrogance of the Federal Government. It certainly \nrepresents an excessive reach of the Federal Government and, again, the \ncoercive means that the Federal Government is willing to use to force \nStates to be brought into line with what the U.S. Congress considers to \nbe politically correct.\n  The penalties that will be levied are going to be substantial, as I \nmentioned before. But more important is the fact that the States \nalready recognize the importance of safety education programs. In fact, \n44 States already have in place rider education programs for motorcycle \nriders. It was not because the Federal Government bullied the State \ninto establishing those programs. No. It was something that the States \nrecognized on their own as essential to improving motorcycle riding \nsafety. And that is why I believe that fatalities and accidents have \nbeen substantially reduced over the last decade--far ahead of the time \nbefore these penalties even took effect under ISTEA when it was passed \nin 1991.\n  Those 44 programs represent $13 million to the States, and they \nraised that funding by imposing fees on motorcycle registration and \nlicenses. In my State of Maine, we have a $500,000 program. It has \nproven to be valuable, essential, and effective in reducing fatalities \nof motorcyclists. In fact, in Maine in 1993, we ranked the second \nlowest in the country for motorcycle fatalities. I think it does prove \nthat those programs become very effective toward reducing accidents on \nthe road and certainly fatalities.\n  That is why I think the States should be allowed to determine their \nown policies with respect to safety on the highways and certainly with \nrespect to motorcycles.\n  Since 1983, the number of accidents have decreased from 307 per \n10,000 registered motorcyclists to 206 in 1992. Fatalities similarly \ndeclined from 8 per 10,000 registered motorcyclists in 1983 to 6 per \n10,000 in 1992. This shows, in my opinion, a remarkable decline. And \nthis all occurred, as I said, prior to the enactment of section 153 \nthat went into effect,\n I think demonstrating clearly that the heavy-handed treatment by the \nFederal Government is not essential to improving motorcycle safety. The \nStates are certainly better able, better prepared, and better equipped \nto address those issues.\n\n  I was somewhat disturbed yesterday by the tenor of the debate. I \nthink there is some feeling that somehow the Governors and State \nlegislatures are somewhat less concerned or disinterested or \nunresponsive to what is happening on their own highways and roads.\n  I do not think there is anything that could be further from the \ntruth. The fact is, motor vehicle laws have always been within the \npurview of State government. It has been traditionally their \njurisdiction. I think there is nothing wrong with the Federal \nGovernment creating incentives for establishing certain programs or \npassing certain laws.\n  We should not be imposing heavy-handed penalties to force the States \nto do something that they do not deem appropriate or in their \ninterests. That is for themselves to determine in making and creating \nState policy.\n  In response to the chairman's comments yesterday, the chairman was \nsaying in any of the competitions for motorcycle riders, they are \nrequired to wear helmets. I think we can say very safely that many feel \nthat people should wear helmets. But that should not be a decision made \nby the Federal Government.\n  The question of who decides who should wear helmets should be \nappropriately placed with the States. For personal safety, I certainly \nwould recommend, and I have worn a helmet when I have ridden a \nmotorcycle, because I think it is important.\n  The chairman made the comment yesterday that there is a requirement \nat these competitions that riders wear helmets. Mr. Dingman sent a \nletter to the chairman. I quote from it:\n\n\n[[Page S 8747]]\n\n       As part of your justification for keeping in place the \n     section 153 penalties on States that do not have mandatory \n     helmet laws for all riders, you stated that the AMA requires \n     all riders to wear helmets in the competitive events we \n     sanction. I would like to point out that although regarding \n     the American Motorcycle Association races, sanctioning \n     policies are established by riders committee through a \n     democratic process.\n\n  In seeking to repeal the section 153 penalties, we simply want to \ngive the States the same ability to make a decision regarding helmet \nlaws through a democratic process without coercion from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I think that is the bottom line here. What we are attempting to \nachieve through this amendment is to allow the decision to be made by \nthe State legislatures and the people in those States. That is what we \nshould be doing. That is the kind of approach, I think, that should be \ntaken at the Federal level, to leave those decisions that are best made \nby the State governments to the States.\n  Finally, I would also like to quote a letter by the Governor of the \nState of Wisconsin, Governor Thompson.\n  Mr. President, he writes:\n\n       Wisconsin cycling community, in their legislatures, has \n     said our State does not want or need a law requiring all \n     motorcyclists to wear helmets. The most recent efforts to \n     enact such a law was unsuccessful in the 1994 legislative \n     session. Instead, Wisconsin relies on a partnership approach \n     marked by responsible riding and effective training and \n     safety programs. This approach is working well. During the \n     past 12 years, without a mandatory helmet law, Wisconsin has \n     continued to pose one of the Nation's best motorcycle safety \n     records. Still, Federal laws require States to pass mandatory \n     helmet laws covering all motorcyclists by October 1, 1995, or \n     face strict penalties. If Wisconsin does not pass a mandatory \n     motorcycle helmet law by this Federal deadline, more than $7 \n     million in Federal funds will be taken away from highway \n     projects and transferred to motorcycle safety programs of the \n     next 2 years.\n       Instead of leading the charge for a mandatory helmet law in \n     Wisconsin, I am leading the fight in Washington against \n     burdensome Federal mandates. Wisconsin must have the freedom \n     to choose what works best for our State without facing \n     costly, one-size-fits-all Federal laws that tie our hands. I \n     hope you support this effort by contacting your U.S. Senator \n     or Representative, urging them to help repeal the helmet law \n     mandate. The decision on whether to require helmet use must \n     be made by individual States, not by the Federal Government.\n\n  I think that is well said.\n  Again, I want to underscore another point, as mentioned by Governor \nThompson. The fact is, Wisconsin has a very effective rider safety \neducation program and has one of the best safety records in the \ncountry. Yet they do not mandate the use of helmets. They are not going \nto change their law in the State of Wisconsin regardless of what the \nFederal Government does with respect to the penalty imposed on them \nthrough the use of transportation funds.\n  The point is, even prior to the imposition of penalties, 24 States \nout of the 25 said that they had not passed mandatory helmet laws. Only \none State, since ISTEA passed in 1991, the State of Maryland, passed a \nlaw. That was before the penalty was in place. That was so they could \nqualify for an incentive grant program for additional funding.\n  The point is that over half of the States, or half the States, in \nthis country have not adopted the helmet law because they think it is a \ndecision that should not be forced upon them by the Federal Government. \nI certainly could not agree more.\n  I hope my colleagues will support my amendment to repeal this \nintrusive measure so the States can make their own decisions and their \nown policies. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  They say here on some bills that everything that can be said about an \nissue has been said, but not every Senator has said it. Yesterday we \nwere in debate well over 2 hours on the Smith amendment. I would like \nto point out there was a very clear difference. We had some people \nyesterday who said that if the amendment did not deal with seatbelts, \nthey thought they could support it.\n  I would like my colleagues to know that the Snowe amendment does only \ndeal with helmets and, in fact, does not repeal anything. It simply \nstops the blackmailing by the Federal Government of States to pass \nmandatory helmet laws.\n  In my opinion, the 25 States out of compliance are not going to \nchange. A number of States have repeatedly voted down mandatory helmet \nlaws, as has our State of Colorado. I think they will continue to do \nso.\n  If a Senator is from a State that is out of compliance, I think the \nSenator will be asked by constituents, when they go home, why did that \nSenator vote to continue penalizing a State if that Senator did not \nsupport the Snowe amendment? Why did Senators take the right away from \ncitizens in their own State to make that choice?\n  Those States include Alaska, they will be penalized over $2 million, \n$2.7 million; Arizona will be penalized over $2 million; my State of \nColorado will be penalized $1.9 million; Connecticut will be penalized \n$2.3 million; Delaware, $735,000.\n  I will read all of them so those Senators who may not know if their \nState is out of compliance or not, will know at the end of this.\n  Hawaii will be penalized $1.334 million; Illinois, $6.12 million; \nIndiana, $2.934 million; Kansas, $1.6 million; Maine, $853,000; \nMinnesota, $2.192 million; Montana, $1.6 million; New Hampshire, \n$800,000; New Mexico, $1.9 million; North Dakota, over $1.1 million; \nOhio, over $4.6 million; Oklahoma, $1.9 million; Rhode Island, \n$700,000; South Carolina, over $1.734 million; South Dakota, $1.1 \nmillion; Utah, $1.69 million; Wisconsin, the State from which we just \nhad the letter introduced in the Record, Governor Thompson's State, \npenalized $2.4 million, yet they have repeatedly voted down mandatory \nhelmet laws; and Wyoming, your State, Mr. President, will be penalized \nover $1 million if the Snowe amendment does not pass.\n  My State of Colorado has no helmet law. We had one until 1977. Have \nnot had it since then. The Colorado State Legislature has repeatedly \nrefused any attempt to implement one. The last time it was up, it lost \nin committee by 6 to 1.\n  We do not need the U.S. Senate or any Federal agency second-guessing \nour legislature on that issue. Yet that is exactly what we are doing in \nColorado and the other 24 State legislatures if this amendment is not \nadopted. I do not think there is any question that helmet laws do not \nprevent accidents, nor do they make safer drivers.\n For the 14-year period between 1977 and 1990, States with mandatory \nhelmet laws had 12.5 percent more accidents and 2.3 percent more \nfatalities than did States that did not have mandatory helmet usage.\n\n  In the past decade, motorcycle fatalities have decreased 38 percent \nand accidents have plummeted 41 percent. I think those figures are \nparticularly impressive because the Federal Highway Administration \nestimates that the average vehicle miles traveled by motorcyclists has \nincreased 85 percent since 1975. These statistics are unmatched in any \nother category of road user, passenger, or commercial.\n  The opponents of the Snowe amendment will tell you the reason those \nnumbers of deaths and injuries have gone down is because of mandatory \nhelmet laws. We disagree. We believe in most cases they have gone down \nbecause we have better trained riders, that through rider education \ntraining throughout America we simply are getting more people who are \nriding that understand the dangers and are better riders.\n  What can account for the decrease in accident fatalities? Evidence \nclearly indicates that the most effective way to reduce motorcycle \naccidents is through comprehensive education programs. Many of us \nthink, in fact, it should be established in the schools just as driver \neducation is for automobiles.\n  Currently, 42 States have established and funded some sort of safety \nprograms. They have done that without the Federal Government mandating \nthat they do so. The national average of motorcycle fatalities per 100 \naccidents is 2.95 per 100. States with rider education programs and no \nhelmet laws, however, have the lowest death rate, 2.56 fatalities per \n100 accidents. States with mandatory helmet laws and no rider training \nhave a significantly higher rate of 3.09 fatalities per 100 accidents.\n  We are talking on the floor almost every day about Federal mandates. \nI do not remember the exact vote, but some [[Page S 8748]] months ago \nwe overwhelmingly passed the unfunded mandates bill on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate in which we basically said we heard from our constituents \nacross America who said, ``Get the Government somewhat out of our \nbusiness and curtail some of the mandates you are making in the U.S. \nCongress that forces States to do things against their will.'' Many \nbelieve in part that message in the last election was almost all about \ngetting Government reduced in size and out of our personal decisions.\n  I happened to see a license plate the other day from the State of my \nfriend, Senator Smith of New Hampshire, that I thought was rather \ninteresting. It was a license plate made by the State of New Hampshire. \nOn the license plate it says, ``Live Free Or Die.'' That may sound a \nlittle arcane in this day and age, but the fact of the matter is many \nAmericans still believe they have enough Government imposed on them and \nthey should be able to make more decisions in their own private lives.\n  While it can be argued that mandating these things would be good for \nAmerica's citizens--and I am sure some of the opponents of the Snowe \namendment may so argue--is it right to have the Federal Government \nintrude in our lives to the extent they tell us how to dress for \nrecreational pursuits? I think that is absolutely wrong, and I strongly \nurge my colleagues to support the Snowe amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my \ndistinguished colleagues in support of this amendment to repeal the law \nthat levies financial penalties on States that have not enacted \nmandatory helmet laws.\n  Mr. President, when you say the words ``right to privacy'' these \ndays, most Americans think of reproductive freedom and more \nspecifically of a woman's right to choose. Although reproductive \nfreedom is certainly an important part of the individual liberty \nprotected by our constitutional right to privacy, the right to privacy \nreally does encompass much more.\n  One of the best definitions of its scope and its importance came in a \n1928 dissent by Justice Louis Brandeis in the case of Olmstead versus \nUnited States. In that opinion, Justice Brandeis stated:\n\n       The makers of our Constitution undertook to secure \n     conditions favorable to the pursuit of happiness . . . they \n     sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts, \n     their emotions, and their sensations. They conferred, as \n     against the Government, the right to be let alone, the most \n     comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by \n     civilized men.\n\n  The authors of the Constitution knew all too well the danger posed by \na Government that did not respect individual privacy. For that reason, \nprivacy is protected explicitly by the 4th, 9th, 10th and 14th \namendments to our Constitution and, indeed, by the very foundation and \nstructure of that document.\n  When it comes to supporting our constitutional right to privacy, I am \nas determined as they come. In fact, everything I do here in the U.S. \nSenate is dedicated to protecting and promoting the rights and \nliberties of all Americans. That is why I have cosponsored this \nlegislation during both the 103d and 104th Congress, legislation that \nwould strike the provision in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Act \nwhich infringes on our right to privacy by forcing citizens to wear \nmotorcycle helmets. More specifically, this provision forces States to \nenact mandatory motorcycle helmet laws by transferring highway \nconstruction funds to highway safety programs in States that failed to \nenact such laws.\n  Since Illinois is one of only three States without a mandatory \nmotorcycle helmet law, the U.S. Department of Transportation has \nalready transferred more than $6 million from our highway construction \nprogram to the highway safety program in fiscal year 1995. It is \nexpected to transfer more than $12 million out of this very important \nprogram, the construction program, in fiscal year 1996.\n  Although I do not own a motorcycle, I ride one every chance I get, \nand sometimes without a helmet. Like many Americans all across the \ncountry, I love the feeling, the sensation, the enjoyment that I get \nfrom that experience.\n  Just a few months ago, I joined 3,000 members of ABATE of Illinois on \na freedom ride from the Illinois Department of Transportation to the \nIllinois State Capitol to remind members of our State legislature that \nour democracy is only as strong as the rights and the liberties of its \ncitizens. So the question of individual freedom and privacy is \nparamount in my analysis of this issue.\n  This issue is not about whether or not people should wear a \nmotorcycle helmet. I, frankly, encourage everyone to do so. In fact, \nthere is the old motorcyclist's shorthand phrase, ``Those who do not \nwear helmets do not have brains to protect.'' The fact is, you should \nwear a helmet when you are riding.\n  The question, however, here, is whether or not the Government should \nbe making that decision for me or for any other American. To that \nquestion my response is a resounding ``no.'' The fact of the matter is, \nthere is insufficient data to suggest that, by forcing States to give \nup money by forcing States to transfer highway dollars in behalf of \ndictating what motorcyclists should wear, that there is any real public \npolicy served by that. If the Federal Government wants to increase \nmotorcycle helmet use, it should invest more in highway safety \neducation programs like the very successful motorcycle training program \nin Illinois instead of forcing States to enact mandatory helmet laws. \nThose programs give individuals the information they need to make \ninformed decisions regarding safety, training regarding the proper use \nof motorcycles, and how one should properly operate that machine.\n  The fact of the matter is, however, this is a mandate that goes too \nfar. This is an infringement on individual choice. This is an \ninfringement on the right to privacy. I believe this amendment should, \ntherefore, be supported by everyone who cares about our capacity as \nAmericans to make decisions, personal decisions, regarding personal \nsafety.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the Snowe-Campbell-Moseley-\nBraun-Feingold-Kohl amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I feel very strongly this is a bad \namendment. I regret it has been brought up. Yesterday, we debated the \nseatbelt bill containing this provision in it. It was defeated. The \nseatbelt part was dropped. And now we are strictly debating motorcycle \nhelmets and whether the Federal Government has the right, as it is \ncurrently doing, to provide an incentive, if you would, for the States \nto enact a helmet law or, if they fail to do so, they will be \ndeprived--some of their funds will be directed into highway safety \nrather than into road construction.\n  I would just like to set the record straight here, if I might, \nbecause various suggestions have been made.\n  First of all, the Federal Government is already deeply into highway \nsafety. The Federal Government, through the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration, sets all kinds of standards on motor vehicles. \nNo one is suggesting we ought to be able to have an absence of safety \nglass in our automobiles, of course not. That is set, standards are set \nby the so-called NHTSA, the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration.\n  They set standards for brakes and bumpers, safety belts, airbags, all \nof those things are by the Federal Government. Why? Because the Federal \nGovernment cares about the safety of our people. And, furthermore, let \nus never forget the cost to the Federal Government if people are \ninjured. This particularly goes to those who are riding motorcycles \nwithout helmets who suffer severe head injuries that could have been \nprevented.\n  Do we only get into the vehicle itself when I am talking about safety \nglass and seatbelts and airbags and so forth? Or do we get into the \nrider or the driver? Of course, we get into that in the minimum \ndrinking age. We now have a provision in the law that says every State \nhas to enact a minimum drinking age of 21 or else they will lose some \nfunds. As a result, every State has enacted that, and there is nobody \nwho gets up on the floor and says that is the wrong way for the Federal \nGovernment to go, we should not be doing [[Page S 8749]] this, that \nthis is big, bad Federal Government, it is coercion.\n It is a fine measure.\n\n  Yesterday, we kept the provision in there dealing with seatbelts. \nIndeed, we kept the provision dealing with helmets. But the seatbelt \none has been dropped, as I mentioned. There is a suggestion that we \nshould not be doing this. What is the Federal Government doing in this \nthrough the Senate and the House of the United States? Leave it to the \ndemocratic process. Well, I do not understand that. Is there a \nsuggestion that State legislators are democratic and the Congress of \nthe United States is not? I do not follow the argument that it is \nperfectly all right for a State to do it, but somehow it is wicked for \nthe Federal Government to do it.\n  But the principal point I want to get back to is the Federal \nGovernment, the Federal taxpayers, pay the bills when these horrible \ninjuries occur. And there is not anybody here who has spoken to a \nphysician or a nurse who has worked in an emergency room who will not \ntell you, that individual will give horror story after horror story of \nwhat has happened to individuals they see in the emergency room who \nsuffer terrible injuries in a vehicle when they did not have their \nsafety belt on, or were riding a motorcycle when the individual did not \nhave a helmet on.\n  One of the arguments given here is the answer is not to mandate this \nthrough the coercion of losing funds if you do not pass it. But it is \nto have rider education. No one argues against that. Sure, rider \neducation is great. No one objects to that. All the better. But it is \nnot one or the other. I have difficulty following the argument that, if \nyou have rider education, you do not need helmets.\n  We do not say that if you have driver education, as is required in \nthe schools in my State, and I presume in many of the States, or safety \nefforts that are made on the highways. I remember we used to talk about \nthe three E's: education, enforcement, and engineering. All of those \napply: education in the driver training; enforcement, with the police \nmaking sure there is not excessive speeding; and engineering in the \ndesign of our highways. But it is not those and not something else. \nSure, in addition to all of this, we have seatbelts for those in \nautomobiles. And we ought to have motorcycle helmets for those who are \nriding motorcycles, and the passengers likewise.\n  The argument somehow is made it does not do any good. I do not think \nanybody is serious about that. Nobody knows better than these riders \nthat the helmet is a preventive measure. It is a safety measure.\n  I listened carefully while the Senator from Maine read the letter \nfrom the head of the motorcycle association. And yesterday I said that \nthe motorcycle association in its sanctioned meets requires a helmet to \nbe worn. The letter that was read, as I understood it--and I stand to \nbe corrected--did not refute what I said. It said that is arrived at in \na democratic process. But that does not get around the point.\n  The point I was making is that those who are fighting this so \nvigorously, their own activities require it. It is not up to the choice \nfor each motorcyclist to do what he wants, freedom of expression, the \nchance to have the wind blowing through his or her hair. It is \nrequired, and it may be through a democratic process. But it could well \nbe that there are 51 votes for it and 49 votes against it. But it is \nrequired. And if the Senator from Maine finds I am wrong in the way I \ninterpreted what she said, I would be pleased to learn that because my \nunderstanding is--we have checked this before--that in the sanctioned \nmeets by the motorcycle association, helmets are required. It makes no \ndifference that it is arrived at in a democratic process. This is a \ndemocratic process. We are voting here on the floor.\n  There is another suggestion that seems to be made here that this is a \nwicked thing we are doing, or have been doing, because after all, this \nlaw has been on the books for nearly 4 years because it costs the \nStates money. It does not cost the States money. We do not take money \nfrom the States, from the amounts that they are allocated under the \nhighway legislation. They get the same amount of money.\n  The only thing is that in 1991, we said in the so-called ISTEA \nlegislation, the Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, that if \nyou do not pass a law mandating the use of helmets and seatbelts, then \na certain proportion of that money, an increased proportion, must be \ndevoted to safety measures, to education and safety training. That has \nbeen done in many States. Over 22-odd States that do not have this \nlegislation have to put that money into education. That is their \nchoice. They made that choice. If they want the highway money, they can \npass the legislation.\n  They say that is coercion. Well, I do not think it is. It seems to me \nthat if you are paying the bill, as the Federal Government is doing \nthrough Medicaid, over 50 percent in every instance, taking care of \nthese people who are so severely damaged as a result of the absence of \na helmet, we have a right to levy some requirements.\n  Do helmets save lives? I do not think anybody questions that. That is \nnot to say that education does not, or driver training and experience \ndoes not save lives. But so do motorcycle helmets.\n  Over the past 10 years, motorcycle helmets have saved over 6,400 \nlives and prevented over 25,000 serious injuries. If every motorcyclist \nwore a helmet, nearly 800 lives would be saved every year. Unhelmeted \nmotorcyclists involved in collisions are three times more likely than \nhelmeted motorcyclists to incur serious head injuries that require \nexpensive and long-lasting treatment. No one will argue with that. I \nmean, that is common sense.\n  These are two experienced riders. I would be interested if they, one, \nwear helmets; and, two, if they think helmets are useless and do not do \nany good.\n  Second, the cost of overall motor vehicle crashes, including \nmotorcycles, is staggering to the country. The only reason I combine \nautomobiles and motorcycles in this particular statistic is because we \ndo not have figures broken down by the National Highway Safety \nAdministration. But motor vehicle crashes cost over $137 billion each \nyear.\n  Even for somebody from Washington, $137 billion is a lot of money. \nOver the past 10 years, motorcycle helmets have saved over $6.4 billion \na year, according to the statistics I have.\n  Let me just give you a little instance. I have used this statement \nbefore. But it is one that I am familiar with because it came up in my \nState. We have in our State hospital an individual who, through an \nunhelmeted accident, has been in a coma for nearly 20 years, and 24 \nhours a day has to be cared for, fed and cared for, at a cost to \ntaxpayers of over $2.5 to $3 million.\n  What do we do? Here we all are in the Senate and in the House, always \ntalking about preventive measures, always talking about the \nskyrocketing costs of medical care in the United States. We have to do \nsomething about Medicare and Medicaid. We have to do something about \nhospital costs. Here is about as effective a way as possible.\n  Is this going to solve all the health cost problems of our country? \nOf course, it is not. But every little bit counts.\n  Here is a statement from a doctor from the Centers for Disease \nControl.\n\n       We are unaware of any evidence that demonstrates that \n     testing or licensing or education alone leads to anywhere \n     near the improvement in helmet use that mandatory laws \n     produce.\n\n  What he is saying here is do not leave it up to the States to do what \nthey want, because what will happen is we will not have the laws.\n  Now, there is objection by the Senator from Maine to the suggestion I \nmade that State legislatures and State legislators are more subject to \npressure than we are. And that is true. I served in a State \nlegislature, so I know something about it. The motorcyclists of the \ncountry are a very, very dedicated single-issue group, and they will \ndescend on a legislator and put on a full-court press. And that is the \nissue that they will vote on. It is the epitome of the single-issue \nvote. And that legislator in his or her district frequently, in their \ndesire to be reelected, which is nothing unique, nothing unusual in our \ncountry, says OK, if you care so much about it, I will go along. I will \nvote against any effort to mandate motorcycle helmet use.\n  How can I say that? Because in 1966, we enacted a law right here in \nthe Federal Government that said you had to have helmets, and in 1976 \nwe repealed it. As soon as the Federal Government [[Page S \n8750]] repealed that incentive, the 28 States likewise repealed what \nthey had on the books, including my own State of Rhode Island, and we \nhave not been able to get that back on the books yet in my State \ndespite the presence of this law and despite the fact that we \ndesperately need highway funds.\n  Now, has it worked when we have passed this legislation and States \nhave adopted it? Has it worked? Well, I will quote California again. I \nsuppose there are more motorcycle riders in California than in any \nState in the Nation--total. Maybe not per 100,000 people but total \nriders. The number of fatalities in California, after they enacted a \nmandated helmet law, dropped by 36 percent. The number in Maryland, \nafter they adopted it, dropped 20 percent. Of course, there are \nmillions of dollars in savings by the States once these accidents and \nfatalities had been reduced.\n  So, Mr. President, I very much hope that we will not approve this \namendment of the Senator from Maine.\n  I have a question I would like to ask the Senator from Maine. That \nis, one, does she agree that there are substantial costs involved in \nthe accidents that come to those unhelmeted riders? That is the first \nquestion. Second, are those costs to a considerable degree borne by the \nFederal Government? Those are the two questions I have.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I appreciate them. In response to the Senator's questions, \nfirst of all, as I said in my statement earlier, when I have ridden a \nmotorcycle, I have always worn a helmet, and I certainly would advise \nanybody who is riding a motorcycle to wear a helmet.\n  The question is, Who should decide when someone wears a helmet? \nShould the Federal Government decide it or should the State decide it? \nThat is the question we are trying to determine here today. It is a \nbasic philosophical question that needs to be addressed. I do not \nhappen to think the Federal Government should be the determining factor \nin who is going to wear a motorcycle helmet.\n  The second question is in terms of incurring costs, and I mentioned \nyesterday, where do we draw the lines in terms of personal and social \nbehavior and what impacts Federal health care costs? That is a basic \nquestion. Because, first of all, we know there is behavior that could \nresult in more costs in the Medicaid Program, for example. If somebody \nsmokes, it leads to cancer. If somebody does not engage in a good diet \nor engage in regular exercise, it leads to heart disease. Or chewing \ntobacco. Whatever the case may be, that results in more health care \ncosts.\n  Where do we at the Federal level draw that line? That is also a \nquestion that needs to be addressed here today.\n  To even answer the Senator's question more specifically, I would like \nto mention a study that was conducted at the Harbor View Medical Center \nin Seattle, WA. They reported that 63.4 percent of the injured \nmotorcyclists in the trauma center relied on public funds in order to \npay their hospital bills. According to testimony by the director of the \ntrauma center, 67 percent of the general patient population also relied \non taxpayer dollars to pay their bills.\n  A study that was conducted by the University of North Carolina \nHighway Safety Research Center found that 49.4 percent of injured \nmotorcyclists had their medical costs covered by insurance, while 50.4 \npercent of the other road trauma victims were similarly insured.\n  So I think, first of all, we are being selective here in who do we \ndetermine is impacting health care costs. But secondly, the question is \nwhether or not the Federal Government should intrude to such an extent \nas to require States to pass laws. And the Senator mentioned that it \ndoes not cost the States any money. Well, technically the Senator is \ncorrect. But that money is transferred to programs that are already \nwell-funded.\n  Does it make sense for my State to have to pay twice as much in \nsafety programs when it has already determined that it is not \nnecessary, that $500,000 is sufficient, not $1.3 million? That is not \nmoney they can spend on other things that are also essential to the \nwell-being and the welfare of the residents of my State.\n  So I would suggest to the Senator that by singling out motorcycle \nriders and saying that they are having the greatest effect on our \nmedical costs in the country is certainly not a fair characterization. \nI just do not happen to think that this is an appropriate area for us \nto be governing here in the Congress.\n  I, too, was in the State legislature in the State of Maine for 6 \nyears, and I do not think the pressures on a State legislature are any \ndifferent than the pressures we face by any one group by serving in the \nSenate or the House of Representatives. I doubt anybody would believe \nit if you suggested differently.\n  The fact is, looking at the merits of this question, 24 States had \nalready adopted helmet laws before the ISTEA penalties took effect--24 \nStates. They had already decided in their own wisdom that it was \nimportant for the residents of their States to have that requirement. \nSo they decided it on their own, to their credit.\n  The Senator mentions the State of California. Well, again that is \nanother example. The State of California passed its law prior to ISTEA \npassing in the U.S. Congress in 1991. It took effect before ISTEA was \neven passed in the Congress. So they determined it in their own wisdom. \nThey do not need the Federal Government telling them what to do. That \nis what the whole issue is all about.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Well, Mr. President, I do not think that is what it is \nall about. Everybody can define the issue as they wish. But the real \nquestion is does the Congress have any interest in the safety of its \ncitizens riding its roads. And I believe we do. We have a deep \ninterest. We have a deep interest because of the pain and suffering \nthat arises but also because of the costs.\n  The Senator from Maine is familiar with the letter that came from the \nEastern Maine Medical Center, which she herself received. It is a study \nof the Medicaid costs that arise with those who are unbelted or with no \nhelmets. It is a very, very persuasive study that was done.\n  What are we talking about when we are talking Medicaid? We are \ntalking Federal dollars. And so for that reason alone--never mind the \nsuffering that arises. I have seen it. I am sure the Senators from \nColorado and Maine have likewise visited their rehabilitation centers \nand seen individuals who were so severely damaged because of head \ninjuries as a result of not having helmets, some who end up in comas, \nsome who end up in terrible physical condition. These could have been \navoided.\n  I just cannot understand that we go backward. It is on the law now. \nIt is not resisting the presence of the law, the enactment of the law. \nIt is repealing the law. And yesterday, thank goodness, we rejected the \neffort to repeal the seatbelt requirement, and I hope we will reject \nthis effort to repeal the motorcycle helmet effort.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I would like to respond to a few of the comments my \nfriend, Senator Chafee, has made.\n  First of all, since I come from the State of Colorado, I can tell him \nthat I called the State agencies to try to find out if there was any \nagency in our State that kept track of people who are being paid \nbecause they were incapacitated under what is commonly called the \n``public burden theory.'' The public burden theory, as I mentioned \nyesterday, basically says that if you are injured and you have no \ninsurance and no way to pay for your hospital bills, the public picks \nup the cost. In the State of Colorado there are no numbers whatsoever \nthat define which people are incapacitated by automobile injuries, by \nmotorcycles, by skiing or anything else. If they are injured, they do \nnot have an insurance policy and they do not have finances to take care \nof themselves, they are put in a pool. That is what I am told by the \nState of Colorado.\n  I would also like to point out that we are concerned that the Federal \nGovernment sometime or other is going to get involved in defining all \nforms of personal behavior that have some element of risk. That may \ninclude skiers in my State. We had something like five deaths this year \non the slopes of Colorado. None of them were wearing a helmet. Perhaps \nwe should mandate that they do because it is on Federal ground and, \ntherefore, the Federal Government has some kind of a vested interest. [[Page S \n8751]] \n  In the State of California, since my colleague mentioned that a \nnumber of times, I would tell him that bicycles recently in the State \nof California came under a State law that requires everyone to wear a \nhelmet that rides a bicycle. But the Federal Government did not mandate \nit. It let the State of California make its own decision. And if that \nis what the people of California want, and the legislature, their \nelected officials want, then that probably fits all right in the State \nof California. I do not think we would want it in Colorado. But clearly \nwe let them make the decision.\n  Now, I mention California because there is over 100 times more head \ninjuries and automobile accidents than there is on motorcycles and over \nten times more deaths.\n  Recently--several years ago, in fact--there was an assemblyman named \nDick Floyd of Hawthorne, CA, who told a radio audience in Los Angeles \nthat he favored a helmet law for automobile drivers and was thinking of \nintroducing a bill to mandate that everybody that drives an automobile \nin California wear a helmet, even though there have been instances \nwhere the California Highway Patrol have given citations for people \nthat were wearing a helmet in automobiles. And the reason they gave \nthem is because they cut down hearing and visibility. Mr. Floyd's \ncomments came during a debate during appearances concerning a helmet \nbill which he introduced in California, and did pass, by the way, for \nmotorcycles. Mr. Floyd was not reelected. So he is no longer in the \nState legislature, probably for a good reason, because I think he \nbelieved in taking away personal choices and personal freedoms.\n  There is another thing I would like to say. I hope that my colleague, \nSenator Chafee, does not imply that within States where people elect \ntheir own legislators they do not have elected officials that can make \ndecisions for their own constituents and that we should overrule them \nat the Federal level, because I think that is absolutely wrong.\n  He mentioned something about who pays the bills under the highway \nusers trust fund, the gasoline tax. But we have 3.5 million people in \nColorado, most of whom drive, who pay money every time they buy a \ngallon of gasoline in any gas station, as your State of Wyoming does, \nthe State of Maine does, where my colleague, Senator Snowe, is from. \nThat money goes into a pool, the highway users trust fund, that people \nin those States have every right to expect to be paid back for \nconstruction in the States. There was nothing, to my knowledge, in the \nenabling bill, the bill that originally set up the highway users trust \nfund, that said we are going to collect a tax from you, however we are \nonly going to give it back if you comply under this condition or that \none, which may be a mandatory helmet law. The money is supposed to go \nback to the States for construction. As it is now, under the mandatory \nsection of ISTEA that did pass--and we are trying to get repealed--they \nsimply do not have that option. It is simply a Federal blackmail of the \nState governments.\n  Now, we can stand, I guess, here all day and hear some of the horror \nstories, the public burden theory, who was injured, who was not, and we \nshould have mandatory laws dealing with them about their recreation. \nBut I would point out that the Federal Government simply cannot get \ninvolved in every form of behavior in which there is some risk. \nMelanoma is a skin cancer from sunbathing that kills more people than \nmotorcycle accidents, yet we do not outlaw sunbathing or require they \nhave certain kinds of Sun screen on, or tell them we will deny some \nfunding under Medicaid or Medicare if they do not.\n  Swimming and diving accidents cause more quadriplegics each year than \nmotorcycling, yet we have not outlawed swimming and diving. I think it \ngets beyond ridiculous when we tell States that we are going to require \ncertain things that take away fundamental rights and deny them money \nthat they have every right to if they do not comply with what we think \nthey should be doing with their recreation in private states.\n  With that, I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I have here a document from the Colorado \nDepartment of Transportation, University of Colorado, Health Sciences \nCenter. It is a news release dated February 15, 1994. And it says here, \n``In the past three years--1991-93--134 motorcyclists have been killed \nin traffic crashes in Colorado. Ninety-six of the victims--72 percent--\nwere not wearing helmets.'' So whatever is happening in Colorado, \napparently it is not encouraging the use of helmets very much, as of \nthe date of this, anyway. ``Young riders are overly represented in the \nmotorcycle fatality figures. Sixteen to 20-years old represent about 4 \npercent of the licensed motorcyclists in the state, yet during the past \nthree years they have accounted for 15 percent of the deaths. Twenty of \nthe motorcyclists killed--1991-93--were aged 16 to 20.''\n  And then a quote from Dr. Steve Lowenstein, associate director of the \nUniversity of Colorado Health Sciences Center.\n\n       Motorcycle crashes almost always have dire consequences.\n       In 1991 and in 1992, there were 3,668 crashes involving \n     motorcycles in Colorado. Of those, 80 percent resulted in \n     either the death or injury to the motorcycle rider. Helmets \n     could have prevented many of those injuries, saving taxpayers \n     millions of dollars in health care costs.\n\n  And then it goes on to point out in 1991 and in 1992, just 2 years, \n2,824 motorcyclists were injured in crashes in Colorado with about 600 \nof those riders suffering traumatic brain injuries. The 1993 injury \ndata was not yet available.\n\n       Studies have documented that unhelmeted motorcycle riders \n     sustain serious to critical head injuries three to five times \n     more often than helmeted riders.\n\n  So I do not think this should be an argument about States rights or \nthe Federal Government imposing demands, requirements. We are dealing \nhere with human beings, human beings all across our country. And these \nyoung people or those who are not so young could have been maintained \nin far greater health and prevented terrible injuries that could have \nbeen prevented with the presence of helmets. And we should do \neverything we can to encourage helmet use. I think we should do that. \nSo, Mr. President, I would very much hope that this amendment would not \nbe approved.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I will ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a letter from the Colorado Department of Transportation that \nlists the three highest priorities for the Colorado Department of \nTransportation, one being the repeal of the mandatory section of ISTEA \nwhich the Snowe amendment does. I would like to point out again for my \nfriends who are watching this debate in their offices on television, \nthis is not a question of whether you should or should not, as my \ncolleague implies.\n  It is a question of who makes the decision, whether it should be done \nin the U.S. Senate or whether it should be done at the State level.\n  There also is no question that we are getting sidetracked a little \nbit, because it seems to me that his statements imply that somehow \nhelmets prevent accidents. They do not. They do not prevent accidents. \nThey may prevent some deaths, but clearly we have a number of studies \nalso that say rider education training prevents more.\n  So somewhere along the line, we have to define what it is we are \ntalking about, and we are not talking about whether you should or \nshould not, we are talking about who makes the decision.\n  I do not want to monopolize the time. I see my colleague from South \nDakota on the floor, so I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If my friend will yield.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. If the Senator can speak on his own time.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would like to discuss briefly the \nimportant issue of motorcycle safety. I have been a motorcyclist for \nmany years. I had a motorcycle when I was a second lieutenant in the \nArmy, and have ridden many times over the years. In fact, I am the \nowner of a Harley-Davidson Heritage Softail Classic. I enjoy riding [[Page S \n8752]] it on the weekends when I am home in South Dakota.\n  While much debate has focused on the safety of motorcycle helmets, I \ndo not want us to overlook another very important issue: motorcycle \nrider training. In my view, proper motorcycle training is even more \ncritical to safety.\n  To update my license, I recently completed one of the motorcycle \nrider training courses endorsed by the National Motorcycle Safety \nFoundation. This 2\\1/2\\-day course--which took place Friday evening, \nand all day Saturday and Sunday--consisted of both classroom and hands-\non instruction. It is a very rigorous course designed to teach even a \nbeginner how to handle a motorcycle safely. I must say, I learned a lot \nof things about motorcycles that I did not know, and about safety.\n  Mr. President, according to statistics, about 62 percent of all the \naccidents involving motorcycles involve some sort of use of alcohol. I \nalso want to point out the accident rate is very low in those States \nwhere motorcyclists have completed motorcycle safety courses. That is \nbecause the training courses strongly emphasize safety. Congress should \nemphasize safety education too.\n  In South Dakota, motorcyclists are urged to take rider training \ncourses. I think that is a very important. Across the Nation, if we had \nmore people taking motorcycle training courses, we would have more \nskilled riders. In my judgment, Congress can best promote safety by \nencouraging motorcyclists to enroll in motorcycle rider training \ncourses.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the Sturgis motorcycle rally is held \nin my home State every summer. We have thousands of motorcyclists \ncoming to South Dakota for this annual event. Some wear helmets and \nsome do not. We do not have a helmet mandate. It is a matter of \nindividual choice.\n  So I join with my friend from Colorado in the remarks that he has \nmade, and I hope to soon ride my new Harley-Davidson Softail with him.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, the Senator from South Dakota added an \nelement that has not been discussed, and that is the financial \nimplications.\n  I point out--he probably already knows this--according to the South \nDakota Tourism Council, motorcyclists put $57 million a year into the \nSouth Dakota economy. Three years ago, a study was done by the town of \nSturgis that he mentioned, at which about 150,000 to 200,000 people \nshow up every summer for a big celebration. The Chamber of Commerce did \na study of the people that were there 3 years ago, and they asked the \npeople that came to South Dakota if they would come back to South \nDakota to Sturgis if the State of South Dakota had a mandatory helmet \nlaw.\n  I do not have the exact statistics, but the number was very close to \n50 percent said they would not come back to South Dakota if they passed \na mandatory helmet law.\n  There are a lot of other elements to the financial picture, too. My \nfriend from Rhode Island mentioned California--he mentioned that \nseveral times--and the reduction of deaths after helmets were \nintroduced. What he failed to mention was that it was also at the same \ntime that the same training that my colleague from South Dakota went \nthrough was implemented and expanded in California. It is one of the \nleading States for motorcycle training. So deaths also went down \nbecause of the training.\n  In addition to that, he also failed to mention in the 3-year period \nof time, registrations of new motorcycles in California dropped by 50 \npercent. There were simply fewer people riding fewer miles, so that \nalso would have an impact on the injuries and deaths. I point that out \nbecause it is something that has not been discussed in this whole \ndebate about choice. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I just want to make a couple of additional \npoints. I think a lot of the debate has centered on many of the issues \nthat also were raised yesterday and are important to reiterate. But I \nthink it is important since we are talking about the issue of safety, \nin terms of the statistics that have been given with respect to \nmotorcycle safety.\n  According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in \n1993, the motorcyclist fatality rate per registered vehicle has \ndecreased by more than 50 percent since 1966. Senator Pressler \nmentioned, and Senator Campbell, who has taken the rider education \ncourse, how effective and valuable it is, and that is why the States \nhave decided unilaterally, without any coercion by the Federal \nGovernment, to establish those programs because they know it is \nessential to reducing fatalities and accidents on the road.\n  I also would like, as I did yesterday, because I do think it is \ncritical, since the chairman is from the State of Rhode Island, to read \npart of a statement that was given by a State senator before his \ncommittee back in March. He says in his statement that:\n\n       In a year when unfunded mandates are a target of Federal \n     legislation, it may be said that section 153 is an unfunded \n     suggestion.\n       Section 153 also has a negative economic impact on the \n     State of Rhode Island. The Federal Highway Administration has \n     stated that every $1 billion in highway construction monies \n     creates 60,000 jobs. Although the funding is not being \n     rescinded, the transfer of funds will result in the loss of \n     approximately 40 construction jobs. These are difficult \n     economic times, and Rhode Island has been hit hard by defense \n     cutbacks, as well as national recession. If each job paid \n     $30,000, the impact on the Rhode Island economy could be \n     greater than $1.2 million.\n\n  The State senator goes on to talk about how there has been a dramatic \nreduction in fatalities and accidents in Rhode Island. He said:\n\n       . . . the number of deaths related to motorcycle accidents \n     have declined significantly in proportion to the number of \n     motorcycle riders on the road. In 1976, the last year that \n     the motorcycle helmet law was in effect, there was more than \n     1 death per every thousand riders. In 1994, there was less \n     than .5 deaths per thousand riders. . . .\n       In 1993, the number of fatalities per 10,000 registrations \n     was lower in Rhode Island than in many States with motorcycle \n     helmet laws. Massachusetts, which applied strict helmet \n     wearing standards for motorcycle riders, has a fatality rate \n     a full point higher than Rhode Island. . . .\n       Much of the success can be attributed to motorcycle rider \n     education programs, which were first implemented back in \n     1980. . . .\n       Furthermore, Rhode Island also had the second lowest rate \n     of all motorcycle accidents per 10,000 riders, behind only \n     Oregon, which has a helmet law in place.\n\n  So I think it goes to show that the experiences in various States \nthat have been through the rider education program in making a \ndifference and having an impact on highway safety with respect to \nmotorcycle riding.\n  I also would like to read a paragraph from the Bellevue News \nDemocrat, in Illinois, from September 14 titled ``Independent of \nBlackmail, Summed Up the Issue\":\n\n       If the Federal Government is so hot on motorcyclists \n     wearing helmets, why doesn't it adopt a national policy? \n     Because it realizes this is the type of decision that \n     rightfully belongs to the individual States, as long as the \n     decision is the one that the Federal bureaucrats want, that \n     is.\n\n  I think that appropriately sums up the problem we have here today \nwith these kinds of penalties. It will not end here. It will continue, \nsomehow thinking that we know more than the States in terms of what is \noccurring on their highways.\n  I also will mention that the States have debated these issues at \ngreat length. There were 109 bills introduced on helmet laws and zero \nadopted, since ISTEA penalties became effective--109 different bills. \nSo it was adequately debated in the States. They will determine their \nown wisdom whether or not they should adopt a helmet law. That is where \nthat decision belongs.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Gregg from New Hampshire, \nSenator Wellstone from Minnesota, and Senator Brown from Colorado as \ncosponsors of my amendment, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. At the proper time, I will ask to table the amendment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  [[Page S 8753]]\n  \n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to cosponsor the \nSnowe-Campbell amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we have heard a lot of debate. I think we \nare pretty close to a vote. I do not think there is anybody on this \nfloor who is not worried about highway safety, or about deaths of \nmotorcycle riders from head injuries. But that is not the issue. The \nissue we are deciding here is, who should make these decisions? Should \nit be the U.S. Federal Government by way of the U.S. Congress that \nshould decide whether people should wear helmets? Or should it be State \nlegislatures, the Governor, and the people in their own jurisdiction?\n  I think the time has come, Mr. President, where it is important to \ngain public confidence in Government. I think a lot of people today \nfeel alienated from Government. They feel Government is too distant, \ntoo remote, maybe arrogant and heavyhanded. I do not think there is \nmuch doubt about that. That is a more prevalent feeling in America \ntoday than in the last 10 to 15 years.\n  Why has that happened? There are a lot of reasons. One reason is \nbecause the world is much more complex. The cold war is over, which \ncaused a certain anxiety in this country. A lot of people are concerned \nabout their jobs, and there are a whole host of reasons why people tend \nto be a little bit alienated from and inclined not to believe their \nGovernment is doing what should be done.\n  This amendment is one opportunity for us to address a small part of \nthat. We can give the decision making ability on helmets to the States. \nLet the people decide for themselves whether they want to live free or \ndie. Let people decide whether they want to wear a helmet. Let people \ndecide, according to the State legislatures, what they want to do. They \nwill debate this issue and come to a reasonable conclusion. Some of us \nmay not agree with that conclusion, and some of us may agree with that \nconclusion. Different States will reach different conclusions. But at \nleast the people at home in the States we represent will be a little \ncloser to the decision that is made.\n  We are not going to solve all of our country's problems today--not \neven a large portion of our country's problems. We have to take each \nstep at a time. Today we are faced with a very small step, but \nimportant step. Let people in our own States decide for themselves \nwhether there should be a helmet law. It is that simple.\n  The issue is not whether we are concerned about safety on the \nhighways. That is not the issue. The issue is not whether--with all due \nrespect to my good friend from Colorado--there is a greater incidence \nof bike fatalities with persons who do not wear helmets compared with \nthose who do. We should not be debating that issue today. The issue is: \nWho should decide, the Congress or the States? I believe it is an issue \nfor the States themselves to decide.\n  I am glad the Senator from Maine is offering this amendment. I think \nit is an opportunity for people in our States to get a little closer to \nthe decisions that are made, and maybe in a small way help restore a \nlittle bit of confidence they have now in Government generally.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this amendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana. He \nenjoys great respect in this body and is looked to by many of the \nMembers for his leadership. I think he has spoken in very clear terms \non what this debate is all about. It is really a State rights issue. An \nimplication has been made that if we repeal this mandatory section of \nISTEA, there is going to be a pell-mell rush by States to repeal \nwhatever they have in place now. Some States have helmet laws for \neveryone; some have it for 18 and under; some have it for under 1 year \nof experience. It is a hodgepodge of things now. Very clearly, 25 \nStates do not have full compliance. I do not see them changing.\n  I think that in a number of States, they have dealt with this over \nand over, and they simply see this as a Federal blackmail system, and \nthey are not going to give up. I can tell my colleagues on the other \nside of this issue that I do not intend to give up, and I am sure \nSenator Snowe will not. The people who believe in States rights and the \n10th amendment will not give up.\n  We talked almost 3 hours on this issue yesterday, and another 2 hours \ntoday. I say to my friend, the Senator from Rhode Island, that I am \nwilling to stay here all night, and I am sure others are, too. I would \nlike to ask the Senator from Rhode Island if he will consider some kind \nof a time agreement on which we can end this debate and have a vote.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. We are ready to vote now. If this amendment is adopted, \nit is absolutely clear that the States, just as they did in the period \nof 1976, will repeal the mandatory helmet laws they have on the books. \nThat is the next objective of the motorcycle association. They will be \non every legislator's doorstep pressuring, demanding, and the result \nwill be that the States that have it will repeal their helmet laws. And \nthe result of that will be increased deaths on our highways from \nmotorcyclists not wearing helmets, not having helmets. I think it is a \nvery unfortunate step.\n  If the Senator is through speaking, I will move to table.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, first, I wanted to ask unanimous consent to \ninclude somebody as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include Senator \nCohen of Maine and Senator Thomas of Wyoming as cosponsors of my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in \nsponsoring an amendment to eliminate the penalties on States that do \nnot require the use of motorcycle helmets. I do not support efforts to \nforce States to institute helmet laws, particularly States like \nMinnesota that already have effective motorcycle safety education \nprograms.\n  I would have preferred to join in an alternative amendment that would \nhave repealed current requirements that States enact helmet safety laws \nand replaced it with a requirement that States enact helmet safety \neducation programs. However, that alternative amendment, which had been \nprepared by one of my colleagues, was not actually offered. I am \ntherefore supporting the amendment before us, and as I pointed out, \nMinnesota does have a motorcycle safety education program.\n  Mr. President, Minnesota had a mandatory helmet law for 10 years--\n1968-1977. Proponents in favor of this law stated, ``A mandatory helmet \nlaw will dramatically reduce motorcycle fatalities.'' During the 10-\nyear period Minnesota had a mandatory helmet law, fatalities did not go \ndown per 10,000 registered vehicles. In fact, fatalities continued to \nincrease almost every year.\n  Mr. President, Minnesota has not had a mandatory helmet law for 10 \nyears. Our 1993 fatality rate plummeted an incredible 72 percent in \nspite of doubling the number of licensed motorcyclists. Since the \ninception of Minnesota's Rider Education and Public Awareness programs, \nmotorcycle fatalities have been reduced 54 percent.\n  Mr. President, the Minnesota legislative body has analyzed and \ndebated the helmet law issue many times in the 18 years since the \nhelmet law was repealed. Legislators have repeatedly concluded; \nMinnesota does not need a mandatory helmet law.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I now move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable.

Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. CHAFEE], for himself and \n     Mrs. Hutchison, proposes an amendment numbered 1443 to \n     amendment No. 1442.\n       Before the period at the end of the amendment insert the \n     following: ``and inserting `a law described in subsection \n     (a)(1) (except a State that by law assumes any Federal cost \n     incurred in providing medical care to treat an injury to a \n     person in a motorcycle accident, to the extent that the \n     injury is attributable to that person's failure to wear a \n     motorcycle helmet) and' ''.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, let me explain this amendment, if I might.\n  This is an amendment to gratify the hearts of all the believers in \nstrong States rights and get the Federal Government off our backs and \nout of things.\n  This amendment says that the current law involving the dedication of \ncertain funds for highway funds for safety and training will go into \neffect unless that State passes--and seatbelts and motorcycle helmets \nwill be required--unless that State passes a law saying that none of \nthe medical care to treat an injury to a person in a motorcycle \naccident, to the extent that the injury is attributable to that \nperson's failure to wear a helmet, no Federal funds will be used to pay \nfor that health care.\n  In other words, what we are saying, and I said right along here on \nthe floor, is that the Federal Government should not be caught with the \ncost if the State does not want to mandate motorcycle helmets. Other \npeople say it ought to be left to the States. That is fine. But let us \nnot have the Federal Government caught with the cost. So this means \nthat the Federal share will not be payable if a State does not enact \nsuch a helmet law.\n  It seems to me that it is a very fair thing. We are saying if we pay \nthe piper, we ought to have some say. But people do not want that. They \ndo not want the Federal Government to have any say requiring motorcycle \nhelmets. So we say, OK, you do what you want, but we, the Federal \nGovernment, will not pay our portion of the Medicaid, principally, and \nit will apply to Medicare likewise.\n  So, Mr. President, I think it is a good amendment. The Senator from \nTexas has been active in this. I commend her for it.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of this amendment. I \nvoted not to table the Snowe-Campbell amendment because I do believe in \nStates rights. But I also have a concern about the States lifting this \nhelmet law and then expecting the Federal Government, through Medicaid \nor through other public grants, to pay for the cost of their lifting. I \nam a States righter. I think this should be a State issue. But I also \nthink that with the right comes the responsibility.\n  So, if the States decide within their rights to lift the laws \nrequiring the use of helmets on motorcycles, I then think it is \nincumbent on the States to take the responsibility if the person does \nnot have private health insurance.\n  The statistics show that 64 percent of the inpatient charges for \nmotorcycle-related accidents are provided for by private health \ninsurance. But that leaves 19 percent for public, and 17 percent from \nother sources, including Medicaid.\n  So you can see that there is a large percentage of these injuries \nthat could be publicly paid for. I think people do have the right to \nenact State laws that govern how people on highways perform and how \nthey protect themselves and what kind of safety issues you should have. \nI am a believer in States rights, and I also think with that right goes \nresponsibility.\n  So I am cosponsoring the amendment, and I appreciate the work that \neveryone has done on this issue. I thought this might be acceptable to \nboth sides. But I think maybe it is not. I would like to reserve a \nlittle time at the end of the debate to finish in closing.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nColorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, before I make any comments, I would like \nto make a parliamentary inquiry. If the Hutchison amendment is adopted, \nthen is this further subjected to a second-degree? Does this become a \nfirst-degree?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Snowe amendment, as amended, if this were \nto prevail, would then be open to further amendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Further question: Are we to assume that it would then \nbe open to further amendments dealing with Medicare or Medicaid?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised that the relevancy of \nfurther amendments would be determined by the Chair on a case-by-case \nbasis.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I tell you, with all deference to my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Hutchison, for whom I have great admiration and \nrespect, I think, very frankly, this is a terrible amendment.\n  First of all, if we are trying to deal with helmet use, we do not \nwant to fool around with the money that goes through our Medicare \nsystem to States. I think it is a real mistake to open up that issue \nbecause we would have to have a whole bunch of amendments dealing with \nthat. I can tell you that I am not a constitutional attorney, but I \nthink when you discriminate against one class of people, when you tell \nthem that they will be denied funding under these programs because they \ndo not wear helmets, but they will not be denied the same money if they \nget injured through any other kind of pursuits. I think in the courts \nit would be fairly unconstitutional. I look forward to finding that \nout, if this amendment does pass.\n  Second, I do not know where it would leave the 25 States that are not \nin compliance now. Are we going to tell millions, if not hundreds of \nmillions of Americans, in those 25 States that we are going to add \nanother burden and we refuse to grant them some kind of Federal help \nunder these services if they do not comply with the mandatory helmets \nunder ISTEA?\n  So I just tell you, I think it is a terrible mistake, and opens up a \ncan of worms that could be amended further and further dealing with all \nkinds of recreational pursuits.\n  I hope that my colleagues will reject it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to speak to this amendment.\n  I would be in opposition to the amendment, it seems to me, for these \nreasons, unless it can be clarified: If a motorcyclist were simply \nstopped at a light and a car made an illegal turn or in some other \nmanner struck him, or her, as the case may be, then I understand this \namendment would apply.\n Would that be correct?\n[[Page S 8755]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. No, it is my understanding of the amendment, if the \ninjury is attributable to the person's failure to wear the motorcycle \nhelmet.\n  Mr. WARNER. Suppose they did not have a helmet on. They are standing \nthere motionless and a car violated some law and struck the person.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I think it would be very easy to determine if the \nperson was injured by not having a helmet on or not.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, they might go off the bicycle and, indeed, suffer a \nhead injury. That person then would fall within the statute?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If a helmet would have prevented the injury, \nabsolutely, and that is the purpose of helmet laws.\n  Mr. WARNER. Even though the cyclist is totally innocent of \nmalfeasance or negligence?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The reason that some States do have helmet laws--and \nthis is, of course, I believe, a State issue--is because it is a \nprotection. Whether you are hit or whether you fall or whether you are \nthrown from a motorcycle, the purpose is to try to keep down the \ninjuries because you do not have the protections of a car. So \nregardless of fault, if you are injured because you did not have a \nhelmet on, yes, you would fall under this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, if the injuries were a combination of head injuries \nand, say, torso or limb injuries, you could get the Federal \nsubsidization through Medicare or Medicaid for the injuries other than \nthe head injuries, would that be correct?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes, I think so. We are talking about the States \ntaking the responsibility for not having a helmet law for what might \nhappen for people who do not use them.\n  Mr. WARNER. So a cyclist could receive compensation, Federal \ncompensation for any injury other than a head injury?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes, I would say so.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would say to my two good friends here, \nit seems to me we had what I would characterize as an honest, fair \ndebate on the underlying amendment, and with some reluctance, because I \nhave always tried to myself be concerned about the expenditures of the \nFederal taxpayers for these types of accidents, I support the \nprevailing side on this amendment. I do so because it seems to me this \nis a clear question of States rights to this Senator, and I find that \non the other votes on this bill, where I stood toe to toe to try and \nprotect the Federal speed limit and stood toe to toe to protect the \nrequirement to wear seatbelts, even though I am a strong States rights \nperson, in this instance it is different.\n  Why is it different for this Senator? Because in the case of speed \nlimits and seatbelts, I find there is a direct correlation to other \ndrivers of automobiles, because they could be injured innocently as a \nconsequence of excessive speed by another driver or that driver in \nanother vehicle not wearing a seatbelt and thereby losing some control \nover the vehicle and causing injury to an innocent person.\n  We lost on that speed limit. But it seems to me this is a case where \nwe let the States decide, like let the riders decide to wear or not to \nwear a helmet. And therefore I find the amendment, in my judgment, \nbegins to open up a series of legislative moves in an attempt to \nundermine the underlying amendment when we had a perfectly fair and \nopen fight and discussion and debate on the underlying amendment.\n  Therefore, I would have to associate myself with those who will be in \nopposition, I regret to say to my distinguished chairman. We are both \nchairmen. He is the chairman of the committee. I am the chairman of the \nsubcommittee. But at this point, he is in the chair.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, throughout the discussion yesterday on the \namendment of the Senator from New Hampshire and the amendment today of \nthe Senator from Maine, there was great accent on freedom, freedom to \nchoose--we should respect the State legislatures in that they will do \nthe right thing and that the Federal Government should get out of it. \nAnd the Federal Government was chastised in many of the remarks made \nhere as a big, overpowering force; that we should do everything to \navoid bringing the Government closer to the people.\n  That was the argument. All right. But the argument we were making on \nthe other side was that the Federal Government has to pay the bill \nfrequently through Medicare and Medicaid. In every instance in \nMedicaid, the Federal Government is paying more than 50 percent. So \nthat argument was blown away by a very, very heavy vote.\n  Now what we are saying is, OK, let the States decide, let the States \nforgo the so-called mandatory helmet bill, but if they do, then the \nFederal Government will not step in and pay the medical costs of an \nindividual injured as a result of not wearing a helmet.\n  So this is a very, very simple amendment. I should think it would \nthoroughly satisfy the States righters because they get everything they \nwant, and indeed they are avoiding the problem of the big Federal \nGovernment coming in and paying some of the bills, if that presents a \nproblem.\n  So all we are saying is that where there is an injury attributable to \nthat person's failure to wear a helmet, and the State does not have a \nhelmet law, the Federal Government should not have to pay either \nMedicare or Medicaid. Let the States pay it. I think it is a very fair \ndeal.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It \nreminds me of something a very famous journalist, H.L. Mencken, once \nsaid. He said for every complicated problem, if there is a simple \nsolution, it is usually wrong. This is a very simple solution, but I \nthink it raises a lot of important questions. I would like to ask if \nthe Senator from Texas might respond to some of these questions.\n  As I understand it, this amendment deals with the treatment of States \nthat do not have a helmet law. For those States, that do not have a \nhelmet law, that State could not use Federal Medicaid funds to pay for \nunhelmeted riders injured in motorcycle accidents. Is that correct?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. No. It goes toward the State that decides to make \nthat decision to also take the responsibility for injuries caused by \nmaking that decision.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No, no. As I read the amendment, it says in the last \nwords in the last few lines ``to the extent that the injury is \nattributable to that person's failure to wear a motorcycle helmet.''\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is correct. But we are putting the \nresponsibility on the State, if they decide not to have a helmet law.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Let me ask another question. What happens if a person who \nis injured is not wearing a helmet and the physician then has a hard \ntime determining the degree to which the injury the person suffers is \nattributable to not wearing a helmet, and then other injuries that \nwould otherwise occur. Let us say it is a neck injury; let us say this \nperson is thrown from the bike, for example, and falls on the pavement. \nIt is partly a head injury; it is partly a shoulder injury; there may \nbe another injury. So is the doctor then supposed to write out a form \nas to what percent of the cost is attributable to the head injury and \nwhat percent of the cost is attributable to the other injuries that \noccur?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I think it would be very reasonable to do that \nactually. I think whether you have a head injury or do not have a head \ninjury is easily ascertainable. And yes, I think you could devise a----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Let us ask the next question. Let us say there is a \nsuperficial head injury, a cut, but the person goes into shock, and the \nhospital bills are very extensive but there appears to be just a \nsuperficial scrape to the head.\n  Now, which portion of the hospital bills would be paid and which \nportions not?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I think a doctor is going to be able to easily \ndiscern what is caused by not wearing a helmet. I do not think that is \ngoing to be a big deal for a doctor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. But it is true that, if this amendment were to pass, the \nhospitals, nurses, doctors, and other health care providers involved \nwith this patient would have to go through a lot of hurdles in \ndetermining what portions of the injuries are attributable to not \nwearing a helmet. This [[Page S 8756]] will require a lot of paperwork \nto document all this. Is that not correct?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. No. I think you are obviously making something that \nis not there because you do not think this is a good amendment, which \nis your right. But I think the issue here is, if a State wants to pass \na law that says people do not have to wear motorcycle helmets, they \nhave the right to do it. All we are saying is, they also have the \nresponsibility to pay for it. I think that is fairly simple. I think it \nis fairly clear.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Let us think about the additional paperwork required to \nmeet the demands of this amendment. Paperwork for hospitals, doctors, \nand nurses.\n  Has the Senator made an assessment of how much more paperwork this \nwould cause?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The State has the option. This is not something we \nare forcing them to use. The States have the option. They can decide to \nnot have a helmet law and take the responsibility for the injuries, or \nthey can have a helmet law and try to prevent those injuries. It is \njust a matter of whether the Federal Government is going to pay for \nthis State right. You know, I am very much for States rights. I am very \nmuch against unfunded mandates. But I think it is very important when \nyou are dealing with the highways and safety on the highways, which we \ndo with seatbelts and helmet laws, if States are going to take the \nresponsibility to make the decision, which I think they have a right to \ndo, I think they should have the responsibility to pay for it rather \nthan send the bill to the Federal Government.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I agree with that. As I read this amendment, it would \napply to injuries that might occur due to lack of a helmet whether the \nmotorcyclist was riding on the interstate highway or on private \nproperty.\n  I ask the Senator from Texas, there are a lot of wide open spaces in \nTexas, a lot of ranches. Would this apply to someone on a ranch in \nTexas who is out on his place trying to chase down a stray steer, not \non any road? He falls off his bike on his own place and gets a head \ninjury. Would this amendment apply to that person as well?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The underlying----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is how I read it.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I think it depends on what the State does. I think \nthe State has a right to say that you need to wear a helmet on a \nhighway but private property is exempt, or the State can also require \nit on private property. I doubt it would apply on private property. But \nthat is a State right. And I would think that probably private property \nis exempt.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the Senator's \nresponses. I think that, to be totally candid, this is an amendment \nwhich is well meaning and well intended. But has not been thought \nthrough enough. It opens up horrendous difficulties. No. 1, it is an \nimpossible burden to place on the doctor, nurse, or provider to \ndetermine the portion of total injuries, which is often very difficult \nto do.\n  For instance, there may be a massive head injury and not much other \ninjury to the body or maybe massive injuries to other parts of the \nbody. It may be a head injury, and it may be a head injury that is \ncausing the huge medical bills or it may not. It is very difficult for \na doctor or nurse to determine and answer that question.\n  Second, Mr. President, it is the incredible paperwork that it will \ncause. This is a horrendously complex issue. I think the answer that \nthe Senator from Texas said, ``It is up to the States,'' the way this \nis written, ``to the extent the injury is attributable to that person's \nfailing to wear a motorcycle helmet,'' does not seem to give a lot of \ndiscretion to the States.\n  If it gives discretion to the States, the Senator is making our \nargument. This is States rights. Let us give discretion to the States \nand give discretion for what makes sense for them in their own States.\n  And to the private property point. As I read this amendment, it does \nnot appear to give the State discretion to limit it to injury to \npersons without a helmet on public roads. As I read this amendment, it \nsays, ``To the extent that the injury is attributable to that person's \nfailure to wear a motorcycle helmet.'' And that is just another problem \nI see with this amendment. But if we are going to go down this road and \nlimit Federal dollars, we might as well say, ``OK, States, why not? We \nare going to limit your Federal dollars if you don't pass handgun \nlegislation outlawing the use of handguns.'' We all know that handguns \ncause some deaths in this country. Many emergency rooms in hospitals \naround this country see patients because of gunshot wounds. Does the \nSenator from Texas think we should apply the same logic to legislation \nof that kind?\n  What about passive smoke? Some people think that more people get \ncancer because they breathe passive smoke. Are we to say there should \nbe no public funds to States if they did not pass legislation \nrestricting public accommodations for passive smoke?\n  There is no end to this. I know this is a well-meaning amendment, but \nI think it is very complex. I think it would be wise for us, Mr. \nPresident, to summarily vote it down.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, there is an old technique in debating and \narguing, if you will, to get into analogies. And pretty soon you are on \nthe analogy instead of the basic point. In other words, suddenly we are \non handguns here. There is no suggestion of handguns in this \nlegislation. This is very simple.\n  And I commend the Senator from Texas and join her as a cosponsor, as \nhas been pointed out. What she is saying is, if everybody wants the \nState to have all its rights, and they do not want to subscribe to a \nFederal law which says you have got to wear a motorcycle helmet, fine. \nThat is the ultimate of States rights. What we voted on here today, \nthey do not want any of those Federal people interfering.\n  What she is saying is, if we cannot have any control over what takes \nplace, why should we have to pay the bill, any portion of the bill? And \nthat is all it does. And you can get into all kinds of arguments about, \n``Oh, who is going to decide?'' We have decisions made all the time in \nconnection with health care. There is no problem there. The whole \nMedicare system is based upon a doctor making a decision, categorizing \nthe extent of the illness. That is the way all the charges are done. \nThis is not anything unique. It is very, very common. It is the same \nwith Medicaid and the eligibility requirements for Medicaid. They are \nall there. And so I do not think we want to get bogged down.\n  If he is not wearing a helmet in a stationary position getting \ninjured, does it count? Of course, it counts, because he ought to have \nbeen wearing a helmet under the law. If the State does not have that \nlaw, OK, fine. And there is no requirement that they have the law. And \nthere is no requirement for the Federal Government to pay anything \neither.\n  So, Mr. President, I think this is--I thought we might get this \namendment accepted. I thought every States righter would think this is \ngreat. And perhaps they will. Perhaps the distinguished Senators from \nMaine and Colorado will say, ``This is good. This is what we like.'' I \nlook for a favorable response.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President. Well, I do not blame the \ndistinguished chairman for not wanting to get into the details of this \namendment because once you do and understand the implications and the \nimpact, it certainly would be unprecedented from a Federal standpoint.\n  I ask the Senator from Texas, why stop here? Why just stop with those \nwho do not wear helmets? Why do we not deny individuals who are on \nMedicaid any medical care if they smoke and end up getting cancer? Why \ndo we not deny people who are on Medicaid and do not engage in \nexercise, good diet, and do not get preventive medical checkups on an \nannual basis? Why do we not deny them medical care?\n  I mean, we can go on with endless possibilities. Why do we not deny \nthose who ski and do not wear a helmet when they get injured? Why do we \nnot deny them medical care? How about those who go rollerblading? If \nthey do not wear a helmet, do we deny them medical care? [[Page S \n8757]] \n  I think the Senator from Virginia raised a very important point. If \nsomebody is riding a motorcycle and does not happen to be wearing a \nhelmet because that person is abiding by the State law because they are \nnot required to wear a helmet and they get broadsided by somebody who \nmight be intoxicated or driving recklessly, that person who is driving \nrecklessly or intoxicated would be eligible for Medicaid if they were \nin that category.\n  But the person who was a law-abiding citizen riding the motorcycle \nand gets broadsided by that individual who is driving recklessly would \nbe denied medical care. I do not think that is the approach we want to \nadopt in Congress, sort of a two- and three-tiered system as to who is \ngoing to be denied or who is going to have access to medical care.\n  I think, and I said before, when the Senator from Rhode Island raised \nthe issue about, well, this is going to add to our costs, I would ask \nthe Senator, why not offer legislation that denies medical care for \nanything we think is going to affect health care costs to the Federal \nGovernment? Why are we stopping with just wearing helmets? I ask either \nthe Senator from Texas or the Senator from Rhode Island that question. \nWhat about horseback riding? Rodeos?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Can I give an answer to that?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I will be glad to yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The measure before us is a bill dealing with helmets, \nmotorcycle helmets and seatbelts. That is the legislation. We do not \nhave legislation before us dealing with skiers or with rollerbladers or \nwith horseback riders.\n  So what the Senator from Maine has done, if her amendment is \nadopted--by the way, her amendment has not been adopted but what she is \nstriving to do is to change the law. The current law says that a State \nmust pass legislation to mandate the use of motorcycle helmets and \nseatbelts, except if they choose not to, then they suffer certain \npenalties. You are the one who brought up the legislation, not us.\n  Ms. SNOWE. This Senator, in hearing the Senator's answer to the \nquestion, then assumes the Senator supports denying all these \ncategories for access to medical care on other pieces of legislation.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. No, I have not said anything to that effect.\n  Ms. SNOWE. That is the question I am asking because this is the kind \nof precedent that this amendment is establishing. What is the point?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. We will worry about precedents later on. The matter \nbefore us is motorcycle helmets.\n  Ms. SNOWE. So the Senator is not prepared----\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator from Maine seeks to change that, and I am \nsaying if you change that and are unsuccessful, why should we have to \npay the bill?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I reclaim my time.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. We are not saying anything about denying hospital care or \nmedical coverage. States can do that.\n  Ms. SNOWE. The States can do that at great cost, as the Senator well \nrecognizes, and it was the Senator from Rhode Island who raised the \nquestion of medical costs. So let us discuss the issue of medical \ncosts. I think it is a very relevant issue, and if it is right for \nmotorcycle riders, then it should be right for everybody else in all of \nthese categories, if we are talking about medical costs. It was the \nSenator who raised that issue.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Will the Senator yield? Is it the Senator's \nunderstanding, as it is mine, if this amendment is adopted, it then \nbecomes amendable?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Absolutely.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. What is to stop amending it saying anyone not wearing \nseatbelts is denied Medicaid or what is to stop amending it to say we \ndo away with Medicaid altogether, or something of that nature?\n  Ms. SNOWE. That is correct. There would be endless possibilities in \nterms of what could be offered here to deny medical care to people in \nvarious categories, in various forms of personal behavior.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. A further question. The Senator mentioned a drunken \ndriver. Let me see if I have the scenario right and maybe the Senator \ncan inform me.\n  Let us say there is a man driving down the road and is dead drunk and \nruns over 10 people. One he happens to run over is a motorcyclist \nparked by a stop sign who does not have a helmet on. The drivers are \nalso injured in all these wrecks. As I understand the Hutchison \namendment, the drunk that runs over the 10 people is going to get \nMedicaid, if he needs it, because he is injured, but the guy he ran \nover who was just sitting there will not because he does not have a \nhelmet. Is that the way the Senator from Maine reads it, too?\n  Ms. SNOWE. That is the way I interpret this amendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. In my opinion, this opens up Pandora's box of \namendments we do not want to deal with. I have to tell you, as I \nunderstand the amendment of the Senator from Texas, it would deny \nMedicaid to people who are not wearing a helmet. I am going to prepare \nan amendment to hers, if it is adopted, that simply would require \nMedicaid for everybody who is riding with a helmet, if we are going to \nopen up that Pandora's box. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator for his comments, because I think his \namendment would be very relevant under the rules of the Senate, and I \nthink that it does, as the Senator from Colorado indicates with his \namendment, open up all kinds of possibilities. This is unprecedented. \nWe will start determining who will have access to medical care \ndepending on their personal or recreational choices. That is the \ndecision we will be making with this amendment.\n  I also suggest it is a strange form of States rights that almost does \nnot pass the straight-face test.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Will the Senator further yield? I know the Senator from \nMaine has a pretty considerable background of law. I do not. Does the \nSenator also see this as a singling out of one class of people that \ncould question the constitutionality of the amendment?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I say to the Senator, I am not a lawyer, but I certainly \nthink that would have a great impact. It certainly would, in my \nopinion, in terms of the impact it would have on a specific category of \nrecipients, potential recipients if they are eligible for any of our \nmedical programs in the Federal Government.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. SNOWE. But I would say, I mentioned earlier that it would be a \nvery strange form of States rights. We are saying to the States, ``You \ndecide whether or not you want a helmet law.'' However, if somebody who \nis abiding by the fact that their State does not have a helmet law, so \nis not wearing a helmet and gets in an accident, regardless of whether \nor not it is his or her fault, they will be denied medical care; is \nthat what we are really saying and want to say by adopting this \namendment? I hope not, because I think you would all agree there are \nother areas that we could examine, as far as having a tremendous impact \non medical care that adds to the cost year in and year out.\n  So I hope that we reject this amendment, because otherwise, as the \nSenator from Colorado, Senator Campbell, has mentioned, there will be \nother amendments to address these very issues that come within the \nscope and relevance of the amendment that has been offered by the \nSenator from Texas, Senator Hutchison.\n  Mr. President, I ask for a recorded vote on the underlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The yeas and nays have already \nbeen ordered on the underlying first-degree amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have listened to this debate with \ninterest, curiosity, and amazement, because what I hear is, ``If you do \nthat, I'm going to punish you. If you do that amendment, I'm going to \npunish you with other amendments.''\n  This floor is wide open. You can make as many amendments as time will \nallow, and no one ought to be cowed or frightened by the prospect of \nanother amendment that drags in some extraneous issue. We are now \ndiscussing whether or not these benefits apply universally and whether \nwe will be able to take it away if someone stubs their toe in a \nbathtub. [[Page S 8758]] \n  The fact of the matter is that what these discussions are about did \nnot get on the books willy-nilly because someone had it in for \nmotorcycle riders or someone had it in for nonseatbelt users or someone \nhad it in for speeders. These things developed because this was the \nsafest way for our country to operate.\n  For those of us who are not regular motorcycle riders--I say regular. \nThe first time I rode a motorcycle was when I was 17 years old, which \nwas more than 20 years ago.\n I got a few pieces of gravel in my knee and my arm. My father talked \nto me, as only fathers and sons used to talk in those days; it was \ndirect, no exceptions. He did not mind striking a blow for intelligence \nand maturity. I listened carefully. That was the end of my motorcycle \ncareer.\n\n  But the fact of the matter is that this is not a vendetta against \nmotorcycle riders. What it is is a carefully thought out program to \nsave us money--all of the American taxpayers. Motorcyclists, as a \nclass, have more accidents and more costly accidents than do automobile \nriders. And, thusly, we are saying, hey, if you want us to make \ncontributions, to pay into the pot for Medicaid, then please take some \nprecautions. Even if you do not use a seatbelt in the car, you are \nprotected by the frame and structure of the car, and now by airbags in \nalmost every car. But you see it almost automatically--people buckle \nup. Machismo says: I do not buckle up; I ride free and easy. Well, that \nis up to the individual. I went through a story yesterday about my \nvisit to a trauma center, which was an urban trauma center in a very \npoor, high-crime city, and the doctor in charge of the center said that \nthe only thing that exceeds disastrous injuries from motorcycles are \ngunshot wounds. And we know that needs attention of and by itself.\n  But, in this case, what we are saying is that helmets ought to be \nused because it saves society money. Those who choose to run the risk, \nobviously, they are the ones who decide how much pain their families \nwill have, how much anguish their loved ones will have; they are the \nones who will decide that the risk is worth the ride. That is up to the \nindividuals.\n  But I say, if you want to use Federal roads, then you ought to do the \nthings that guarantee a modicum of safety. I think the Senator from \nTexas has come up with a brilliant idea, which says that if there are \nadditional expenses involved as a result of your not taking appropriate \nprecautions, then do not ask us, the Federal taxpayers, to pay the \nbill. That is standard in almost everything in life that we do. We are \na Nation of laws. If you obey the laws and something happens, \ntypically, it does not cost you anything, other than that which you pay \nin the normal array of taxes. But if you fail to obey the laws, if you \nwant to jump out of an airplane in a parachute in the middle of a city \nand you cause all kinds of disruption, today you are going to pay a \nprice for it. If you choose to violate the rules for safe passage in \nthe mountains or in the oceans and you require service from the Federal \nGovernment, you pay for it. We, the citizens and taxpayers, are not \nrequired to do that.\n  So when we talk about what it is that centers this focus on helmets, \nwe have to ask ourselves: What was the mission of the law as it was \noriginally developed? The mission was not to punish States. The mission \nwas not to add expense to the operations of State or local government. \nThe mission was to save lives. And yesterday, we heard a fairly \nastounding statement, which when thought about carefully, suggested \nsomething. The suggestion was that if we slow the cars enough on our \nhighways, we would save lots and lots of lives. But that was implied, \nand that was, therefore, a calculated risk. So that if we increase the \nspeed limit a little bit more and a few more people die, as they say in \nFrance, ``c'est la vie''--that is life. That is the price you pay for \nmore speed.\n  If one wanted to extend that argument, one could say that when this \nairline is scheduled to leave at 9:05 in the morning from Newark \nAirport, regardless of whether the skies are crowded or not, that plane \ntakes off. It is the most ridiculous proposal anyone could conjure up. \nBut it is the same as saying, well, sure, if you want to make things \nmore efficient, you simply slow down the traffic, and the reverse of \nthat--if you want to get someplace, then you may lose some lives. That \nargument hardly holds water when it comes to discussing a tragic \nresult, whether it is a motorcycle rider or car rider or somebody \nfalling down and getting hit by the car. It does not matter. The cost \nrelates to lives. That is what we are discussing here--whether or not \nwe are interested in saving lives, or whether the mission is to save \nthe States dollars that do not want to comply with the rules.\n  We have had a vote and it was very clearly established that the \nmajority here prefers that helmet laws be revoked. But I think that the \nproper response to that, having seen that overwhelming support, is that \nif more costs result from injuries that obtain from no helmets, and the \nFederal Government ought not to have to pay for that. If a State \nchooses to remove the requirements for helmets, then the State ought to \npay for it. There ought not to be Medicaid for it. Private insurance is \nanother thing. But there ought not to be public insurance for those \nStates that violate sensible safety rules.\n  So I commend the Senator from Texas. I think she has an excellent \nidea. I rise as a cosponsor. I ask unanimous consent that I be included \nas a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I hope our colleagues will see the \nwisdom of her recommendation and that we will respond to what is an \nattempt to remove the safety precautions and replace it with a ``if you \nwant to play, you pay'' kind of thing. I think that is quite normal and \nI think that is quite acceptable.\n  I will close by saying that I do not think this opens up a Pandora's \nbox or other things. If we want to discuss other things, we are going \nto discuss them, regardless of the outcome of this amendment.\n  I hope that this amendment is agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey. I \nappreciate the fact that he wants to be added as a cosponsor of this \namendment, because I think it is a good, sound amendment. There was one \ntechnical answer that I wanted to give to the Senator from Montana in \nhis request for information, and that is, the underlying helmet law \napplies to public roads.\n  Private property is really not an issue here. It is a matter of what \nwe do on public roads.\n  I was a member of the National Transportation Safety Board at one \ntime. I am very safety conscious. There is no question about that. I \nwould like to encourage people to wear helmets, because I know that \nmakes a difference in safety.\n  Safety belts make a huge difference in injuries in car accidents. I \nthink that is so well settled that the Senate showed overwhelmingly \nyesterday that they did not want to lift the safety belt requirement.\n  The issue of helmets is a closer call. I think it really is a States \nright issue. Yet, I do hope that the States will think very carefully \nbefore they enact a law that would do away with the helmet law, because \nI do think it is a safety issue.\n  We do not want to hamper the rights of States in this instance. In \nfact, the American College of Emergency Physicians also believes this \nis a good amendment, because they see the effects of the differences in \ninjuries when a person does not have a seatbelt or is not wearing a \nhelmet while riding a motorcycle.\n  When people choose to ride motorcycles, as my wonderful friend the \nSenator from Colorado does, and we are proud that he does--when a \nperson chooses to do that, that person is choosing to ride a vehicle \nthat does not have the same protections as an automobile. A person \nshould have that right.\n  I also think that there is an issue of, if you are going to do that \nunprotected, without a helmet, which we know will not only save lives \nbut have far fewer injuries, I think that there is a responsibility \nthere.\n  I just think that if a State decides that it is going to do away with \nthe helmet law on public roads, that State should also take \nresponsibility. This is not hampering States rights, but it is [[Page S \n8759]] saying that when you have the right and you choose to exercise \nthat right, you also take the responsibility for that action, rather \nthan having the Federal Government do it.\n  I think it is a very simple issue. I think it is an issue of States \nrights and State responsibilities. I am a cosponsor of the amendment \nthat would not allow the Senate to send costs to the States. I think \nthis is just a reversal of the same treatment.\n  If the States decide they do not want to go with a national policy \nthat has been set, they have the right to do it, but they should pay \nfor the consequences of exercising that right. Thank you.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Colorado \nwould respond to a question. We are trying to get a time agreement here \nand wind this up. I was wondering if the Senator would agree to a \ncertain length of time?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. No, not without my colleague. I would like to retain my \ntime.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from New Jersey is still here. Senator \nLautenberg talked about missions and our mission here.\n  I can say that missions change, because when the 55-mile-an-hour \nspeed limit was implemented, it was not to save lives. It was to save \ngasoline--everyone knows that--because of the energy crunch. Somehow \nthe mission changed as people began to look at their relationship to \nspeed and safety. Missions change.\n  I would like to point out what I guess in my old-fashioned way is \nstill considered to be the original mission of this body, and that was \nto uphold the Constitution. As I read the 10th amendment--not having \nthe background and a lot of the legal skills as some of my colleagues \ndo--the 10th amendment still says: ``The powers not delegated to the \nUnited States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States \nare reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.''\n  There is nothing here that says we will mandate helmet laws. Nothing \nsays we will be punitive and deduct money that they paid in their gas \ntax if they do not comply with some kind of an arbitrary rule we set \nback here. It does not say anything like that. It says we will not take \naway the States' rights to decide. That is the original mission. That \nis why we are here.\n  I think that the Hutchison amendment opens up a Pandora's box of any \nfurther amendments. If her amendment passes, it can be amended. Is \nsomebody going to offer an amendment that, if they do not have a \nhelmet, we do away with their food stamps? Or we do away with their \nfarm subsidies? If they are not wearing a helmet, they will not receive \nmoney under the crime bill? The list can be endless. That is why this \namendment is a killer amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment or to table it \nwhen that motion is offered. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the comments made \nby the Senator from Colorado, because I think some of the questions \nthat have been raised with respect to the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Texas really does embark the Senate on a different course \nwith respect to, for example, the Medicaid Program.\n  The Medicaid program is a State-Federal Program. States design their \nprograms within the Federal guidelines. Do not underestimate for a \nmoment that we will not be pursuing a different and an unprecedented \napproach with respect to our medical programs. Once we decide that \nbehavior is going to dictate whether or not an individual has access to \nmedical care costs, we have opened, as the Senator from Colorado said, \nPandora's box.\n  It will not stop here. I know the Senator from Rhode Island would not \nanswer the question as to whether or not he would support other forms \nof social, personal, or recreational behavior as a determining factor \nfor an individual eligible for our medical programs to receive those \nmedical benefits.\n  I now would ask the Senator from Texas as to whether or not the \nSenator thinks that we should adopt a standard of behavior that will \ndetermine whether or not an individual should receive medical care in \nthis country. I ask the Senator, does the Senator think that we should \ndraw the line, for example, on what people do--whether they are skiing, \nskateboarding, rollerblading, smoking, improper diet, lack of exercise? \nWe could go on in terms of the number of critical choices that are made \nas to how we will spend our money. And those people who are recipients \nof these programs could be denied based on this amendment. This is \nsetting a precedent.\n  Does the Senator think that we should design our Medicaid or Medicare \nprograms according to people's personal and social and recreational \nbehavior?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, in a way, we do that in many \ninstances. I think it is well settled that the U.S. Congress has the \nright to make laws as they affect our public roads and highways. If a \nState gets Federal funding, then we have certain laws that we must \ncomply with.\n  There are safety laws in the way we construct highways. Insurance \ncompanies do have standards that are adopted by States, very often, on \nwho can get insurance and who cannot. I think we have to take \neverything on a case-by-case basis.\n  I certainly think the Federal Government has the right and has made \nlaws that are contingent upon receiving--Federal funds are contingent \non those laws for States to receive those Federal funds. I sort of \nmessed that up, but basically there are standards that have been set.\n  I do not think it is out of line at all. I think we have a Federal \nlaw. We have set a Federal standard. We are giving States the right to \ngo against that standard, just like we did on the speed limit \nyesterday.\n  So I think we have just said if the States exercise the right, they \ntake the responsibility.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Getting to specifics, I think it is important, because we \nare talking about medical costs.\n  We are saying if somebody does not wear a helmet and gets in an \naccident, regardless of whether or not it is that individual's fault, \nthey will not have access to medical care if they happen to be eligible \nfor a Federal program.\n  Now, we know that smoking is a cost. Does the Senator think that if \nsomebody who happens to be on the Medicaid or Medicare Program, \nsmoking, and happens to get lung cancer, do we deny that individual \nmedical care?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Maine is \nasking for a personal opinion when, in fact, there very easily could be \nMedicaid standards that say if you smoke, you do not get treatment.\n Now, whether I think that we should have those standards or not is \nreally irrelevant here.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. No, I think it is relevant. I reclaim my time. I think it \nis relevant because the Senator's amendment is setting up drawing \ndistinctions for the first time. I think it is very relevant.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I think the Senator is doing what Senator Chafee \nmentioned earlier, and that is using a debate tactic. I think it is \nwell within the rights of an insurance company or the Federal \nGovernment, under Medicaid, to set standards for when you will receive \nthat care. Absolutely, it is within their rights.\n  Ms. SNOWE. We know its within their rights.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. We are saying in this instance we think the State \nshould pick up the responsibility if they are going to exercise their \nright. It is very simple.\n  Ms. SNOWE. This is not a hypothetical amendment. It is reality. That \nis, what we are talking about is a very real possibility that will open \na number of doors in terms of who will be eligible and who will be \nineligible for medical care. We know the Federal Government has every \nright in the world and every prerogative to design the programs the way \nwe see fit. But that is not the point.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Well, it is the point. That is absolutely the point.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Let me have--it is my time.\n  The point is in terms of what is right. Now we are saying that, \nbecause somebody happens to be abiding by their State law--and my \ncolleague calls it a States rights issue, and I find that a very \ninteresting interpretation of States rights because it is no different \nthan what we are trying to fight over the helmet law or even the \nseatbelt law. We are saying let the States determine it but do not \npenalize us with transportation funds. [[Page S 8760]] \n  So now the Senator's amendment is penalizing States in a different \nway. She is saying we are not going to give you medical care costs if \nsomebody gets in an accident because you are not adopting that \namendment. That is the bottom line of her amendment. Because now she is \ngiving the States the choice, if you do not pass that helmet law, and \nif something happens to an individual abiding by the State law that \ndoes not require them to wear a helmet, they will not have access to \nmedical costs. The Senator knows the State is going to have to pick up \nthe tab, so it is an unfunded mandate and she is a cosponsor of the \nunfunded mandate bill--but this is an unfunded mandate.\n  The hospitals are not going to deny that care to that individual. The \nSenator would not suggest a 16- or 17-year-old on a motorcycle who gets \nin an accident is going to be denied medical care because they were \nabiding by the law of their State?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I hope that is not the approach we are taking with this \nlegislation because it opens up, I think, very incredible questions \nabout the propriety of procedures in a policy from the Federal \nprospective.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  Ms. SNOWE. It is my time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask if the Senator will yield?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I think the Senator is raising a red herring here \nbecause the issue is, if we are going to provide the service, we have \nthe right to set the standards. If we are going to say the States can \nexercise their rights, we have a right to also give them the \nresponsibility.\n  I am glad we are going toward eliminating unfunded mandates to the \nStates, but I think if we are going to give States the rights to do \nthese things, they are going to have to pick up the responsibility, \ncoming the other way, just as we are giving them the right not to have \nunfunded mandates from the Federal Government.\n  Ms. SNOWE. To answer the Senator's statement, yes, we do have the \nright. But the question is, what is right? I do not think the Senator's \napproach is the right approach. I do not think it is appropriate for us \nto begin to determine in a number of different areas how we are going \nto provide that medical care because we decide on what is appropriate \nand what is inappropriate.\n  If we are going to do that, then I think it is only fair to look at a \nwhole host of areas that have an impact on the cost to the Federal \nGovernment of medical care. That is what this amendment is suggesting. \nThat is the door it is opening.\n  It is everybody's right to interpret how this amendment is going to \nbe applied. It is not a hypothetical situation. It is very real. While \nthe Senator might think she is granting States the right to make those \ndecisions, it is not any different than what we are trying to fight \nwith this legislation. We are saying to the States, you ought to make \nthose decisions. We have decided in our wisdom that something should be \ndecided rightfully by the States. That was the vote we just had on my \namendment, to allow the States to make those decisions, not to penalize \nthem through transportation funds. But the Senator is coming through \nthe back door and saying, all right, if you do not adopt this amendment \nthen you are going to be denied medical care cost reimbursements by the \nFederal Government.\n  Yes, it is definitely going to be an unfunded mandate, but I think it \nraises some other very serious questions about exactly how far we are \nwilling to go to begin to make those distinctions on medical care costs \nand who is going to have access.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. The Senator from Texas referred several times to \nFederal funding.\n  Is it the belief of the Senator from Maine, as it is mine, that there \nis no funding here, that this money that is here comes from the \ntaxpayers?\n  Ms. SNOWE. That is absolutely correct. The Senator raised that \nearlier in terms of the transportation funds.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. That was the point I was going to make. Is it my \ncolleague's belief, as it is mine, that people who pay into the highway \nusers trust fund under the gasoline tax, whether it is Texas or Maine \nor Colorado or wherever, if they have the right to get that money back \nunfettered? They paid it in. Do they have a right to get it back \nwithout us putting a whole bunch of strings attached to it before they \nget their money back?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I say to the Senator, he is exactly correct. My colleague \nis exactly right. Providing strings and requirements to the money \nbefore it is returned to the States or otherwise, they do not really \nget it because they cannot use it for the purposes they require. It is \nonly the purpose which the Federal Government, the Congress, requires, \nbut not for what the States need.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I hope, as I conclude my own remarks with respect to this \nissue, that we reject this amendment because, while some would say this \nis a red herring, it is not. We all too often find that we have \namendments that have real implications. This certainly is one of them.\n  We are saying on the one hand the States have the right to make \ndecisions about their helmet laws, but on the other hand, if you do and \nit is not the right decision, we are not going to allow eligible \nrecipients to have access to medical care if they abide by that law. It \ndoes not stop there.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Does the Senator have a problem?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I was appealing to the Chair for time. I thought the \nSenator was finished.\n  Ms. SNOWE. The fact of the matter is, we are going to be denying \nindividuals medical care under this amendment. But it will not stop \nhere. It will go on into other areas. As the Senator from Colorado has \nindicated, he will offer an amendment. There will be other amendments, \nthere will be other legislation, and we will be continuing to draw \nthose lines in terms of who will be able to get medical care.\n  It can go on and on, because there are a number of behaviors that \npeople engage in that have implications to our medical costs. I cannot \nimagine we are saying now, if somebody is skiing or skateboarding or \nrollerblading, playing touch football, and has a head injury and is not \nwearing a helmet, and may be on Medicaid--that has implications, too.\n  But what we are doing is isolating a certain group and imposing a \npunishment on them because they are abiding by State law. So I hope we \nwill reject the amendment that has been offered by the Senator from \nTexas, Senator Hutchison.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the occupant of the chair for \ngiving me recognition.\n  I listened carefully to the Senators who are opposed to this \namendment and I am struck by the response to what I think is a very \ncarefully thought out, very specific amendment that addresses a problem \nthat is going to be created.\n  What I heard was that the 10th amendment says that powers not \nrelegated to the Federal Government are relegated to the States. What I \nheard is that, if this happens, ``I promise you I will have amendment \nafter amendment after amendment'' that will kind of ``make you pay'' \nfor supporting her amendment. I heard that this opens Pandora's box, \nthat we are going to be discussing all kinds of things that relate to \ntaking away people's benefits. I remind our distinguished friends that \nit has been the tradition in promoting safety in this country that you \nget incentives or that you get penalized by not complying because we \nare, after all, a Federal Nation.\n  Yes. We can debate how much of a particular issue is a State issue \nexclusively or the Federal Government issue exclusively. But the fact \nis that we are an inextricably linked society, and that we have \ntransportation programs that transcend State borders one after the \nother.\n  I cannot tell how many requests I have gotten from the State of Maine \nover the years when I was chairman of [[Page S 8761]] the \nTransportation Subcommittee to have Amtrak extend to Maine to get this \nlittle bridge fixed up to there, to get that little road fixed up \nthere. Never was it said in these requests, ``Now I know that we are \nasking for more than we should based on what we paid into the fund.'' \nThe request was a legitimate one to the Federal Government.\n  Colorado--I know Colorado well. It is a State I love and have visited \nmany times. I have recommended funding for Colorado highways, \nviaducts--the 23d Street viaduct in Denver, CO, because it was \nrecommended. I recommended supporting the funding there. And it goes on \nplace after place after place.\n  So this sudden shock that suggests that, ``Well, you want the States \nto pay for their miscreants? You want States to pay for their deeds \nthat they commit that cost the Government money?'' Yes. Of course. \nEverybody pays their fair share. That is the way the game gets played. \nWe are not talking about taking away food stamps or farm subsidies. We \nare talking about a very specific thing related to a very specific \ngroup which has a high incidence of injury and death relative to other \ntypes of transportation--very high incidence, often long-term illness, \nlifetime in many cases, for whom we pay extraordinarily high costs.\n  What the amendment of the Senator from Texas says is, if you do not \ntake the appropriate precautions, that is a right that apparently is \nyours. But you have no right to assess the rest of the country bills \nfor decisions that you make that cost us money. We have all kinds of \nlaws regulating behavior.\n  I am surprised that we are debating this. We have laws against \ndrinking and driving. We have laws against driving without a license. \nWe have all kinds of laws that say this is the way society ought to \nconduct itself. We are, I remind my friends, a nation of laws. That \nmeans that there is a structure of conduct of behavior, to use the term \nof the Senator from Maine. There is a structure of behavior that you \nhave to have in a society that has 250 million people, many with \ndifferent interests, different backgrounds, different ideas about how \nwe ought to conduct ourselves.\n  So we are a nation of laws. As a consequence of that we are going to \nbe subject to some laws that we do not like. We are going to be subject \nto some restrictions that we may disagree with. But it is an essential \nfactor in a complex society, in a complex world.\n  So we can disagree on a particular thing or another without \nsuggesting that the sky is falling down, and that, if you do one thing, \nit is going to hurt everything else. Each one of these subjects is fair \ngame. If someone wants to propose an amendment that would have \npenalties for not using sensible safety rules within a State, they have \nthe right to do it. That is the nature of things. But let not the \nSenator from Texas be cowed by the threat that perhaps there will be \nother amendments to follow.\n  We are here. We are here to do what we have to do in the interest of \nthis highway bill. And if these amendments affect that, then I think we \njust have to proceed ahead.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8745-4", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to take a couple of \nminutes to finish and answer just a couple of things that were said.\n  First, in relation to what the Senator from New Jersey said, I do not \nthink that we need to talk about what other areas might arise from some \ninnovative approach to this amendment. This amendment is very simple \nand very straightforward. We are not talking about penalizing the \nStates. We are talking about letting them do as they wish, do something \nthat could add to the medical costs because we know this is a safety \nissue, and if they decide to exercise that right that they take the \nresponsibility for it.\n  I think it is pretty simple. I think that Members are going to start \nseeing as we go down the road pursuing the unfunded mandates theory, \nand as we are turning things back to the States, the States are going \nto take responsibility for what they do. That is part of returning the \npower to the States, which I think is right thing to do.\n  So I support the underlying amendment. This is not a gutting \namendment at all. It is an amendment that I think is the correct \nthing--that, if the States decide that they are going to opt out from \nthe Federal helmet laws, they take the responsibility for doing that. I \nthink it is very simple and straightforward.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Just very briefly in response to what the Senator from New Jersey was \ntalking about, that we have laws with respect to the drunk driving. The \ninteresting part is how this amendment would not have an impact on \nsomebody who is drunk while driving, or reckless driving, or somebody \nwho overdoses on drugs, and all of these categories. They happen to be \neligible for Medicaid, and Medicare. They still will get medical care. \nBut a motorcycle rider who may not be wearing a helmet, abiding by \nState laws, gets in an accident, may not be any fault of their own, but \nwould be denied medical care because they were not wearing a helmet \neven though they were abiding by that State's law, I do not think that \nis the approach that we should adopt.\n  I urge Members of the Senate to reject the amendment offered by \nSenator Hutchison.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I make the motion to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Maine to lay on the table the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Texas. On this motion, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and \nthe clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 60, nays 39, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 275 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--60\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Leahy\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pressler [[Page S 8762]] \n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--39\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Dodd\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mack\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Specter\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n                                     \n                                 McCain\n                                     \n\n  So, the motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 1443) was \nagreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the majority leader. I am prepared to have a voice \nvote on the underlying amendment. I ask unanimous consent to vitiate \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nMaine.\n  The amendment (No. 1442) was agreed to.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n                           amendment no. 1437\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent last evening, \nattending the high school graduation of my son, Randy.\n  I would have voted against the Smith amendment lifting penalties \nagainst States for not having helmet or seat belt laws.\n  This issue for me, comes down to the simple question of safety. An \nissue that is bipartisan and noncontroversial. In fact, a recent \ncomprehensive consume survey shows that 82 percent of Americans support \na strong Federal role in safety.\n  How can we then support a step backward against the giant gains we \nhave made in highway accident and injury prevention. According to the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration, from 1983 to 1993, \nsafety belts saved more than 40,000 lives and prevented $88 billion in \neconomic losses by reducing health care costs and productivity losses. \nIn 1993 alone, motorcycle helmet laws in 25 States saved 515 lives, \nprevented 2,035 moderate to serious injuries, and saved $513 million in \neconomic losses.\n  As a former State senator, I understand State's rights, but let us \nlegislate on the side of safety and human life.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to engage my colleague from \nRhode Island in a colloquy on Federal oversight of the design of \nprojects in Vermont that are on noninterstate portions of the National \nHighway System [NHS].\n  First, Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge the hard work that \ncommittee staff, my staff, the U.S. Department of Transportation and \nthe Vermont Agency of Transportation have put in on the NHS-design \nissue. All the parties have acknowledged that Vermont's mountainous \nterrain and historic villages present a unique challenge when designing \nhighway and rural road improvements. It has been the goal of the \nparties to come up with solutions that do not adversely affect \nVermont's small communities and rural landscape.\n  Mr. President, the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \nAct placed control for the design of highway improvements off the NHS \nin the hands of the individual States. It has been our experience in \nVermont that this has improved communications with local citizens on \nhighway projects and lowered project costs. it is the Vermont Agency of \nTransportation's desire to assume primary responsibility for the \nmanagement of its transportation system, including those non-interstate \nroads proposed for the National Highway System. Representatives of the \nU.S. Department of Transportation have assured Vermont transportation \nofficials that such control and flexibility can be provided for the \nnon-interstate NHS roads through existing provisions of the United \nStates Code, title 23.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator from Vermont is correct.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Vermont has been assured by the U.S. Department of \nTransportation that under section 117, United States Code title 23, the \nVermont Agency of Transportation can be granted the authority to \nprovide design exceptions at its discretion on non-interstate NHS \nroads. Further, Vermont has been assured that it may determine the \nscope of non-interstate NHS projects. These projects include simple \nroad and bridge resurfacing, while more comprehensive improvements \nundergo the necessary planning and design process.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator's understanding is correct.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. To ensure that a common understanding exists on the \nabove matters between the U.S. Department of Transportation and Vermont \ntransportation officials, Vermont has been assured by the Federal \nHighway Administration's Deputy Administrator Jane Garvey and other \nhigh-level Federal highway officials that she and these officials will \nvisit Vermont in the near future to discuss these matters. Following \nthis visit and drawing on the provisions of section 117 of the United \nStates Code, title 23, Vermont has been assured that an agreement will \nbe executed that will grant Vermont the authority required to assume \nprimary responsibility for the management of its transpiration system, \nincluding the non-interstate roads on the NHS.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator accurately states my understanding of the \nintent of the agreement between the U.S. Department of Transportation \nand the Vermont Agency of Transportation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island.\n                             Change of Vote\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on rollcall vote 271, I voted ``yes.'' \nIt was my intention to vote ``no.'' Therefore, I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be permitted to change my vote. This will in no way change the \noutcome.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President while we have the two leaders on the floor, \nI wonder if we might explore the possibility of finishing the pending \nmatter tonight.\n  I wish to advise the Senate there are 26 amendments pending. Of that \nnumber of amendments, it is my assessment that only four will require \nrollcall votes, and the balance can be resolved, hopefully, by the \nmanagers.\n  I see present on the floor a number of the Senators associated with \nthe amendments that could require rollcall votes. If I might identify \nthe Members: Senator Roth has an amendment; the distinguished former \nleader, Senator Byrd; and the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan. \nThose are the amendments that I feel will require votes.\n  If we could get time agreements and finish those amendments, I think \nwe can work out the balance of the amendments. This bill would be ready \nfor final passage late tonight, or whenever the leaders desire \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. DOLE. I have not had a chance to discuss this with my colleague, \nSenator Daschle, the Democratic leader, but I hope we can finish it \nthis evening if we can obtain time agreements. Four amendments would \nnot take that much time. We had a short night last night because of two \nor three very special events which presented conflicts for many of our \ncolleagues.\n  I would certainly be willing, and I do not think the Senator from \nSouth Dakota has any objection.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I have no objection, and I would like to continue to \nwork.\n  I know a number of Senators are prepared to offer their amendments. \nThey are here on the floor. I think we ought to proceed.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will await the return of my comanager, \nthe Senator from Montana. But seeing three of the proponents on the \nfloor, I ask the Senator from Delaware if a period of an hour and a \nhalf equally divided would be suitable for the disposition of the \namendment, together with Senator Baucus; is that correct?\n[[Page S 8763]]\n\n  Mr. ROTH. That would be most satisfactory.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator for his cooperation. I now ask the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, with respect to his amendment \nif an hour equally divided would meet his requirements?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, an hour equally divided would be agreeable \nto me. However, if I am going to be 9 o'clock tonight calling up my \namendment, having an opportunity--I have been here all day and I \nindicated yesterday I would be ready to call up my amendment the first \nthing today. As I understand it, there is a kind of lineup.\n  I know what my rights are. Under the rules I can get recognition to \ncall up my amendment any time. I want to cooperate with the managers \nand therefore I have no objection to one or two others going first, but \nI do not want to have an agreement on my amendment and then call it up \nhere at 9 o'clock tonight.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we will work with the sponsors of the \namendments as to the sequence and timing, either today or should the \nleadership grant us time in the morning, to do it then. But I thank the \nSenator for indicating the time within which presumably the Senator \nfrom Montana and I might be able to get a time agreement--just as to \nthe time of the amendments. The sequencing would be left open.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I do not like sequencing, generally speaking. I like \nto follow the rules of the Senate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  Mr. BYRD. But may I say to the Senator, if we are not going to finish \nit today, if we are going to go over to tomorrow, I would prefer to go \nover to tomorrow now that it is 4:30 in the afternoon.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is a matter the leadership will have \nto decide.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  I now ask the Senator from North Dakota with respect to his \namendment, the amount of time required to be equally divided?\n  Mr. DORGAN. What amount of time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would agree, as I previously discussed with the Senator \nfrom Virginia, to 40 minutes, 20 minutes on each side.\n  If the Senator from Virginia would be inclined to accept my amendment \nI would do it in 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. At this time, I say to my good friend, Mr. President, I \nwill look at it but I am not able to assure him.\n  If I could put down 40 minutes equally divided for the amendment \nsponsored by the Senator from North Dakota?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Fine.\n  Mr. WARNER. It gives the managers some area in which they can work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1444\n\n  (Purpose: To permit States to use Federal highway funds for capital \n improvements to, and operating support for, intercity passenger rail \n                                service)\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth] for himself, Mr. \n     Biden, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n     Kerry, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Moynihan, Mrs. Murray, \n     Mr. Specter, Mr. Pell, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. D'Amato proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1444.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1  . INTERCITY RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT.\n\n       (a) Interstate Rail Compacts.--\n       (1) Consent to compacts.--Congress grants consent to States \n     with an interest in a specific form, route, or corridor of \n     intercity passenger rail service (including high speed rail \n     service) to enter into interstate compacts to promote the \n     provision of the service, including--\n       (A) retaining an existing service or commencing a new \n     service;\n       (B) assembling rights-of-way; and\n       (B) performing capital improvements, including--\n       (i) the construction and rehabilitation of maintenance \n     facilities;\n       (ii) the purchase of locomotives; and\n       (iii) operational improvements, including communications, \n     signals, and other systems.\n       (2) Financing.--An interstate compact established by States \n     under paragraph (1) may provide that, in order to carry out \n     the compact, the States may--\n       (A) accept contributions from a unit of State or local \n     government or a person;\n       (B) use any Federal or State funds made available for \n     intercity passenger rail service (except funds made available \n     for the National Railroad Passenger Corporation);\n       (C) on such terms and conditions as the State consider \n     advisable--\n       (i) borrow money on a short-term basis and issue notes for \n     the borrowing; and\n       (ii) issue bonds; and\n       (D) obtain financing by other means permitted under Federal \n     or State law.\n       (b) Eligibility of Passenger Rail as Surface Transportation \n     Program Project.--Section 133(b) of title 23, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``, railroads,'' after \n     ``highways)''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (2)--\n       (A) by inserting ``, all eligible activities under section \n     5311 of title 49, United States Code,'' before ``and publicly \n     owned'';\n       (B) by inserting ``or rail passenger'' after ``intercity \n     bus''; and\n       (C) by inserting before the period at the end the \n     following: ``, including terminals and facilities owned by \n     the National Railroad Passenger Corporation''.\n       (3) in paragraph 6(a), by inserting ``, and for passenger \n     rail services,'' after ``programs''.\n       (c) Eligibility of Passenger Rail Under Congestion \n     Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program.--The first \n     sentence of section 149(b) of title 23, United States Code, \n     is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (2), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (3), by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting ``; or''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) if the project or program will have air quality \n     benefits through construction of and operational improvements \n     for intercity passenger rail facilities, operation of \n     intercity passenger rail trains, and acquisition of rolling \n     stock for intercity passenger rail service, except that not \n     more than 50 percent of the amount received by a State for a \n     fiscal year under this paragraph may be obligated for \n     operating support.''.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the amendment which I am offering today on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Biden, as well as several other Members of \nthe Senate, has a very simple and important purpose and that is to give \nStates the much needed flexibility to use their CMAQ and STP funds for \nAmtrak passenger rail service.\n  Since late last year, Amtrak has begun a much needed restructuring. \nThe restructuring has required substantial participation by State \ngovernments in determining which rail lines will stay in service. While \nStates currently have wide authority in allocating Federal \ntransportation dollars--whether it be on pedestrian walkways, bikeways, \nbuses, light rail, highway, and other intermodal and commuter-based \ntransit needs, a damaging double standard exists which, by law, \nprevents States from utilizing these funds to improve, expand or simply \nmaintain vital Amtrak service if they so choose.\n  My legislation would eliminate this double standard and give States \nmore flexibility in the way they use their transportation dollars.\n  My amendment addresses a number of realistic and sensible ways States \ncan be given this flexibility.\n  Under my proposal, States would be allowed to use funds available in \nthe Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program (CMAQ] for passenger \nrail service.\n  This program, created in the Intermodal Surface Transportation and \nEfficiency Act, provides an incentive to focus on transportation \nalternatives which reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality and \nlower fuel consumption.\n  Amtrak passenger rail service clearly meets these criteria, \npotentially better than any other transportation alternative currently \navailable. My amendment would allow CMAQ funds for passenger rail \nservice.\n  Second, States would be allowed to use their Surface Transportation \nProgram [STP] dollars for Amtrak passenger rail service. STP gives \nStates and localities unprecedented flexibility in moving Federal \ndollars between modes. Currently, States are using these funds for \ncarpool projects, parking facilities, and bicycle and pedestrian \nfacilities. [[Page S 8764]] \n  My amendment simply ensures that this flexibility is extended to \nStates to use for Amtrak passenger rail service.\n  In addition to these provisions, Mr. President, my amendment would \npermit States to enter into interstate compacts in support of Amtrak \nservices. We know that it requires coordinated efforts among a number \nof States to make a regional passenger rail route possible. Those \nStates could use Federal funds from the programs I just listed, or make \nuse of bonding authority under the compact to support intercity rail \nservices.\n  Mr. President, the need for flexibility is clear. I have here, a \nletter signed by Governor Dean of Vermont, Governor Thompson of \nWisconsin, Governor Engler of Michigan, and Tom Carper, Governor of my \nState of Delaware, both Democrats and Republicans. This letter supports \nmy amendment.\n  Let me read this letter. This letter went to Senator Baucus and to \nSenator Chafee, the chairman of the committee.\n  This is from the four Governors, and it says:\n\n       As you proceed with consideration of S.440, we want you to \n     be aware our strong support for the right of states to use \n     their federal transportation funds for rail passenger \n     service. The amendment being offered by Senators Roth and \n     Biden has our full and enthusiastic support.\n       Under present law, we are not able to make use of our \n     federal highway or transit funds for rail passenger service. \n     This has posed a number of difficulties for our state in \n     forming partnerships with Amtrak for these purposes, even \n     when investments in rail passenger service would produce \n     clear public benefits and improve the service quality of \n     other modes of transportation.\n       Adoption of the proposed amendment will provide states with \n     the ability to decide what transportation system best meets \n     their needs and to allocate their federal funds accordingly. \n     In this time of severe budget constraints at all levels of \n     government, it is essential that we empower state and local \n     officials to make the best use of scarce federal resources. \n     This is clearly a states' rights issue.\n       We view this adoption of the Roth/Biden provision as part \n     of S.440 as an extremely positive step in the direction of \n     achieving a higher level of state choice and a more balanced \n     transportation system. We look forward to working with you to \n     ensure this result.\n\n  As I said, this was signed by Governor Dean of Vermont, Governor \nThompson of Wisconsin, Governor Engler of Michigan, and Governor Carper \nof Delaware.\n  These Governors have already committed their own States' general \nrevenues to support intercity rail routes, at the same time they have \nsurpluses in Federal transportation programs that they are prohibited \nfrom using to maintain Amtrak services. These Governors have confirmed \nthe need for more flexibility.\n  California, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, \nand Vermont have also confirmed the importance of Amtrak.\n  Mr. President, Congress has recognized the need for States to have \nflexibility with Federal subsidies in important local transportation \ndecisions. In fact, the increased flexibility provided by this \namendment is consistent with the major goals of the bill before us \ntoday. In an important sense, this amendment simply removes an \ninconsistency in earlier legislation.\n  When ISTEA was enacted in 1991, a major premise of that legislation \nwas to remove the unnecessary hurdles in the way of a national \ntransportation policy.\n  Fundamental to that landmark legislation was the realization that all \nthe components of our transportation system must be allowed to work \ntogether, each making its own appropriate contribution.\n  ISTEA provided unprecedented flexibility to States and localities to \nmake use of Federal transportation funds to provide the mix most \nappropriate for local transportation needs.\n  Adoption of my amendment would extend the irrefutable logic of that \napproach to passenger rail service.\n  Mr. President, this legislation calls for no new spending. It does \nnot change Federal transportation allocation formulas, nor does it \nmandate that States spend their Federal transportation dollars on \npassenger rail service.\n  As I have said, it simply gives States the ability to spend Federal \nCMAQ and STP money as they see fit and in ways which have been \nrepeatedly found to be good for them and good for the country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak to this amendment.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from Delaware and I are often suspect \nwhen it comes to Amtrak since we are such daily users. So I want a full \ndisclosure to acknowledge that, if I had my way, we would be dealing \nwith Amtrak in a way far beyond what this amendment does.\n  I think we should be setting up a trust fund for Amtrak. I think we \nshould be dealing with it very differently than we are. But, Mr. \nPresident, the amendment that the Senator from Delaware, Senator Roth, \nand I have is much more modest in its approach, and it is not designed \nto be a long-term solution for Amtrak's financial problems. They are \ngoing to have to come from the internal restructuring which Senator \nRoth referred to that is already under way and from a clearly defined, \nin my view, dedicated source of funds to support its capital needs the \nway we provide capital for highways and airports in other systems.\n  I would just like to note for the record that we subsidize airports \nand highways on a per passenger basis considerably more than we do \nAmtrak. It is not even close. And the single most environmentally sound \nthing we could do and, from a safety standpoint, the single most \nsignificant thing we can do is have a real passenger rail service \nsystem in the United States. I might add there is not one single \npassenger rail service system in the world that is self-sufficient; not \none in the whole world.\n  But that is another argument. We are not here today to correct the \nproblems of Amtrak. We are here to try to deal with an inequity that \nexists that in effect prejudices Amtrak in a way no other means of \ntransportation, including pedestrian paths and bike paths, are \nprejudiced.\n  I believe there has been some misunderstanding about the proposal \nwhich Senator Roth and I have, and possibly we will see some of that in \nthe debate today.\n  But let me begin by briefly explaining what this amendment will not \ndo. It will not spend a dime of additional money. It will not spend a \ndime of additional money, State or Federal. It will not require any \nState in the Nation to spend any funds on Amtrak.\n  There is no mandate, no requirement. It will not change any formula \nfor the allocating of transportation funds among the States. It will \nnot affect the amount of annual Federal transportation funds that \nStates now receive. It will not do any of those things.\n  So that your State, for Senators who are listening and the staffs who \nare listening, will not in any way be affected in terms of the amount \nof money, percentage of money, source of money that is now received.\n  But let us look at what it will do.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that this amendment simply permits \nthe States to use funds they already qualify for in a way that is not \ncurrently permitted.\n  Under this proposal, States will be given the discretion to include \nintercity rail service, which is another way of saying Amtrak, among \nthe transportation options available to their citizens. Current \nrestrictions on the use of Federal transportation funds will be \nremoved, and Governors around this country will be able to use those \nfunds that they now get under the present formula as they see fit, \nincluding supporting intercity rail service provided by Amtrak if that \nis what they choose to do.\n  In very congested areas, particularly in the urban corridors along \nthe east and west coasts, but also in other areas, adding some more \nhighways is simply not an economic option. For example, in our State of \nDelaware, were Amtrak to shut down, the idea of building another I-95 \nthrough our State--our State is not wide enough to take another I-95. \nWe cannot handle another system that is that large in terms of our air \nquality, in terms of our land resources available to us, and in every \nother way. It makes no sense.\n  By the way, I might add, I will put in the Record at a later time \nwhat the effect on my State and the Northeast corridor would be if \nthere were no Amtrak and what the effect would be on [[Page S \n8765]] the airports of the east coast were there no Amtrak.\n  The fact is that this option is not only an option that should be \nmade available to States with a great deal of congestion--keeping an \nAmtrak route open on an existing rail right of way is much more cost \neffective, safer and cleaner than buying land and constructing even one \nmore lane on a major interstate highway. The interstate highway is \nalready there. It is called the right of way that Amtrak has. There is \nalready a rail bed. And what is happening now because of cost \ncontainment, we are cutting the number of trains we put on that rail \nbed. We are cutting them, reducing the number of people who can use \nthat mode of transportation and putting them on highways or in planes, \nboth of which cause additional congestion.\n  The increased flexibility provided by this amendment is fully \nconsistent with the major goal of the National Highway System bill \nbefore us today and with so-called ISTEA, the landmark legislation that \ncalls for a National Highway System designation.\n  Mr. President, the need for this enhanced State flexibility is clear. \nIn recent months, under the leadership of Amtrak's president, Tom \nDowns, Amtrak has undertaken, as Senator Roth has said, a major \ndownsizing and restructuring to reduce and eventually eliminate its \ndependence on Federal operating subsidies.\n  Now, again, I wish to make it clear I do not think it should have to \ndo as much as it is doing. I think it is counterproductive. But the \nfact is they are given a mandate. They are told, by the way, this all \nends in a year certain. And Downs has gone out there and done what he \nhas had to do. He has fired thousands of employees. He has cut the \nnumber of trains going into various States. He has reduced costs.\n  This is a mandate set out in both the House and Senate budget \nresolutions, which, I might add, I voted against, but it is there. That \nis likely to be the law.\n  The first stage of this progress made by Mr. Downs was announced last \nDecember with major route eliminations taking effect in April. And \nPresident Downs heard from an awful lot of folks on this floor saying: \nWhy did you cut the train out of my State? Why did you cut it out of my \nState? Why do I not have this access? And the answer is because we \ndecided that we are not going to have the national rail transportation \nsystem that we should have. We are cutting the budget.\n  Well, he did his part. He has cut and eliminated routes. Frequency \nreductions on selected routes throughout the country will be completed \nby this coming October. That is a euphemism for saying if you have \nthree trains coming through your State now, you may have one coming \nthrough your State by October. These steps have reduced by 20 percent \nthe route miles previously served by Amtrak. And as a result many \ncommuters across the country find themselves with little or none of the \nAmtrak service that they once had depended upon. All of a sudden \nGovernors who thought this was a good idea and even some of my \ncolleagues in the Senate who thought it was a good idea are realizing \nhow important Amtrak was to them. The Governors of those States where \nthese cuts took place know that intercity rail is an important option \nfor small towns without air service as well as for congested commuter \ncorridors. They know that intercity rail supports commerce as an \nimportant component of the modern national transportation system and in \nsome States particularly their tourism.\n  That is why States are seeking ways to use the funds, the CMAQ funds \nreferred to earlier, to meet congestion mitigation and air quality \ngoals, to support Amtrak rather than to deal with having to build more \nhighways. Under current law, that is not an option. Under current law, \nthey are not allowed to do that.\n  I have here, Mr. President, a letter from Governors Dean of Vermont, \nThompson of Wisconsin, Engler of Michigan, and Carper of Delaware, \nwhich I will not repeat. It was already put into the Record by my \ncolleague from Delaware.\n  Mr. President, among the authors of this letter are Governors who \nhave already committed their own State's general revenue to support \nintercity rail routes at the same time they have surpluses in Federal \ntransportation programs that are prohibited because they are prohibited \nfrom using Amtrak services.\n  In other words, their citizens pay into the highway trust fund x \namount of dollars. They get them back. Because they do not want to \nbuild more highways, they cannot use them so they have to send them \nback to the trust fund, not to the taxpayers, not to those folks--back \ninto the trust fund. And they say, why can we not use that money to \nmeet the needs in our State, the transportation needs and the air \nquality needs, et cetera?\n  States that have confirmed the importance of Amtrak runs include \nCalifornia, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, \nVermont--the list goes on.\n  Mr. President, virtually every advanced industrial nation in the \nworld has found intercity passenger rail service to be essential. All \nof our major competitors and trading partners provide some level of \nfinancial support to assure that the benefits of passenger rail, which \ninclude less congestion and less construction of highways and airports, \nare available to them.\n  There are tourists here listening to this today from other countries. \nOne of the often heard marvels is, well, I was in Paris; I was in \nTokyo; I got in a spotless train that went 190--in one case 300--miles \nper hour and it got me from A to B, and it was economical, and it \ncould, and it worked, et cetera. Why does the greatest nation in the \nworld not have that?\n  Well, the greatest nation in the world does not have that because we \nhave devalued intercity rail service.\n  Our amendment today does not solve the overall problem, but it does \nprovide those Governors that I mentioned and others the means, if they \nchoose, to support Amtrak routes important to their States. With the \ntools provided by this proposal, States will be empowered to make more \nefficient decisions about the mix of transportation services that best \nmeet their citizens' needs.\n  Now, if the Governor of a State says, ``I do not want any part of any \nAmtrak service,'' fine. That is up to the State. Let them make that \nchoice. Mr. President, this amendment would help those States and \nothers maximize the effectiveness of their transportation dollars. \nSpecifically, it makes Amtrak an eligible use for funds from the \nfollowing areas:\n  The surface transportation program. Right now those funds may be used \nfor most kinds of roads and highways as well as for capital costs, for \nbus terminals, for carpool projects, for bicycle and pedestrian \nfacilities, for hiking paths, for bike paths. They can use the highway \nfunds for all those things, but they cannot use it for Amtrak passenger \nrail service.\n  Our amendment would add intercity rail to that list, consistent with \nthe aims of the program to support a fully integrated transportation \nnetwork. This amendment also makes intercity rail an eligible use for \nthe so-called CMAQ funds. This program--congestion mitigation and air \nquality is what the acronym stands for--this program is designed to \nhelp urban areas come into compliance with the Clean Air Act \nrequirements.\n  Mr. President, Amtrak can cut down on congestion and carry the same \nnumber of people with less pollution than cars on the highways. Surely \nthis would be an appropriate use of those funds, a use currently denied \nthe States.\n  In addition to those provisions, Mr. President, this amendment would \npermit States to enter into interstate compacts in support of Amtrak \nservices. Logically, it may require coordinated efforts among a number \nof States to make a regional passenger railroad possible. Those States \ncould use the funds from the program I just listed or make use of \nbonding authority under the compact to support intercity rail services. \nIn every instance, this proposal is consistent with the goals of the \nISTEA, so-called ISTEA. And in an important sense, this amendment \nsimply removes the inconsistencies in the earlier legislation.\n  When ISTEA was enacted in 1991, Mr. President, the major premise of \nthat legislation was to remove inefficient and unnecessary hurdles in \nthe way of our national transportation policy. Fundamental to that \nlandmark legislation was the realization that all of the [[Page S \n8766]] components of our transportation system, all of the various \ntransportation modes, must be allowed to work together, each making its \nown appropriate contribution according to what the States believe are \nneeded to do that.\n  In the end, ISTEA provided unprecedented flexibilities to States and \nlocalities to make use of Federal transportation funds to provide the \nmix most appropriate for local, State and regional transportation \nneeds.\n  The amendment we are offering here today extends the irrefutable \nlogic of that approach to intercity rail service making it eligible for \nFederal transportation funds. By opening up more options to State and \nlocal officials, by relieving congestion on our highways and in our \nairports, this amendment is fully consistent with the goals of ISTEA. I \nurge my colleagues to keep in mind that the very highway interests who \nargue against this amendment argued against all those other changes as \nwell.\n  And I want my colleagues to please keep in mind, when they vote on \nthis amendment, what this amendment does not do. It does not add a dime \nof additional money to State or Federal funds. It will not require the \nStates to spend a single dime on Amtrak. It will not change any formula \nallocating transportation funds to your State. And it will not affect \nthe amount of annual Federal transportation funds that your State will \nreceive. It will merely give your State greater flexibility.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to the \nSenators from Delaware in support of this amendment. It has a lot of \nsurface appeal. But I think, in the interest of disclosure, in the \ninterest of common sense, it is important for Senators to think through \na lot of other ramifications that have not all been discussed. If one \nthinks a little more deeply about this, I think one will realize maybe \nthis is not a good idea after all.\n  Several points. First of all, this is essentially an amendment to rob \nPeter to pay Paul. We are going to rob our highway funds to spend money \non Amtrak. I do not know if that is something we want to do. Frankly, I \ndo not know if it is something that the Governors really want to do, \nthe State legislatures really want to do. I would guess that most \nGovernors, most State legislatures would rather have what they have \ntoday, a current, dedicated highway account to decide how to allocate \nthe highway dollars among the States and not have to decide, of the \ndollars they get, how much is going to go for highway and how much is \ngoing to go for Amtrak. Rather, it would be better to have a separate, \ndedicated Amtrak account separate from a separate, dedicated highway \naccount.\n  I have an idea how we can accomplish that, which I think is a much \nbetter idea to meet our Amtrak needs than the idea that is contained in \nthis amendment.\n  It is also important to know that there are tremendous road and \nbridge needs in our country. About $212 billion are necessary to get \nour highways up to grade. There are a lot of highways in America. There \nare a lot of potholes and roads that are just in bad shape and not up \nto standards, up to snuff. The Federal Highway Administration estimates \na total of about $212 billion of unmet highway needs. Then there are \nthe bridge unmet needs. The Federal Highway Administration estimates \nthat is about $78 billion, about $78 billion of bridge disrepair, that \nis, bridges that just are in bad shape in our country.\n  For example, if you take the State of Arkansas--I am going down some \nStates alphabetically--37 percent of the bridges in the State of \nArkansas are deficient. Let us go down to Georgia. Twenty-one percent \nof the bridges in Georgia are deficient, that is, either functionally \nobsolete or structurally deficient, as estimated by the Federal Highway \nAdministration. In the State of Iowa, 31 percent are deficient. In the \nState of Louisiana, 40 percent are deficient. In the State of Michigan, \n35 percent are deficient. In the State of Nebraska, 38 percent are \ndeficient. In the State of South Dakota, 31 percent are deficient. Let \nus look at Delaware. In the State of Delaware, 25 percent of the \nbridges in Delaware are deficient, that is, either functionally \nobsolete or structurally deficient. In the State of New Jersey, Mr. \nPresident, that figure is 47 percent. The averages, as we go down this \nlist are around a high of 66 percent. That is the State of New York. \nThe lowest I see on this list is 11 percent for Arizona. But the \naverage is about 30 percent, 40 percent. So I wonder if we want to take \nmoney away from bridge construction and repair, in the way of highway \nconstruction and repair, and spend it on Amtrak? I just do not think we \nwant to do that, particularly if there is a better way to accommodate \nthe needs of Amtrak.\n  Another problem. Highway planning takes years. Anyone who has spent \nany time talking with the State highway departments, essentially to \ndetermine which roads to construct, which repairs are to be put in \nplace and which bridges are to be repaired, knows that it takes time. \nIt takes about 5 years.\n  You have to go through the environmental impact statements and public \nhearings. You have to have rights-of-way hearings, what is the right-\nof-way going to be for a certain road, even for bridge construction. It \ntakes a long, long time.\n  There is a backlog of highway projects in most States. Basically, it \nis because the needs are so great and the dollars are so few. That puts \na lot more pressure on planning and proper planning of highway \nprojects, whether it is roads or bridges, or whatever it might be. And \nit means if they are not done right, they are litigated, lawsuits are \nfiled, because the EIS process is not fully complied with.\n  I am just saying, Mr. President, if we have this already fairly \nconvoluted process determining which highway projects are to be pursued \nin each State, then layered on top of that the possibility that all of \nthat is going to be disrupted because we are going to divert some \nmoney, perhaps, in a State to Amtrak, it is going to be chaos and \ndifficult to plan. It is hard enough to plan for a project, hard enough \nfor people to know if they are going to get their highway project. This \nis going to make it that much more uncertain, that much more complex, \nand that much more difficult. Basically, we are doing people in our \nStates quite a disservice, if there is a better alternative--I think \nthat is a pretty important point to make--if there is an alternative to \ndeal with Amtrak.\n  Another problem with the amendment is, basically, as I understand the \namendment, it says that a State, according to its own discretion, can \ndivert some of the highway money it gets to pay for Amtrak. I am not \nsure it is going to work. Why might it not work?\n  The problem is this: There is a provision in the proposed amendment \nwhich provides for interstate Amtrak compacts, but that is all \nvoluntary. Let us take the northern-tier States, the State of \nWashington, then Amtrak's route follows Washington, Idaho, Montana, \nNorth Dakota, over to Minnesota, down to Illinois, and into Chicago. We \nhave Amtrak problems. Amtrak service has been reduced from 7-day \nservice to 4-day service. We would love to have full 7-day service of \nAmtrak in Montana along the northern tier, just as I am sure other \nStates that face reduced service would like to be restored to full \nservice, even better service.\n  Let us say we in Montana say, ``You bet; this amendment is the law. \nWe are going to, even though we don't like it, make the Hobson's choice \nof diverting some money away from highways,'' and believe me, we have \ngreat unmet highway needs in Montana. Let us say we make the Hobson's \nchoice and we painfully, after much gnashing of teeth in our State \nbetween those who want to ride Amtrak and those who want to meet \nhighway needs, make some decision to divert away from highways to \nAmtrak. What is that expenditure going to be? Is that going to be a \ncapital expenditure? Are we building better roadbeds? Are we going to \npay money to hire more conductors and other personnel?\n  Let us say we do it. We are going to have Amtrak. It is going to \nwork. Suppose folks in Montana want to go someplace; they want to go to \nthe Pacific coast, they want to see the ocean, or go in the other \ndirection to Minneapolis and Chicago. Let us say the adjoining State \ndoes not do anything. [[Page S 8767]] If North Dakota, in its wisdom, \nor Idaho, in its wisdom, or Washington, in its wisdom, say, ``Well, \nwe're not going to divert any money,'' what is going to happen?\n  We have this spruced up service in Montana, we go rushing off to the \nborder, and what happens? Is the train going to stop as we wait for the \n2 or 3 more days because Idaho only has alternate day service, or do we \nhave to get off our train in Montana--we have a superliner going \nthrough Montana which zips along at 150 miles an hour. We get to that \nold border and the train stops. Everybody gets off the train and gets \non a little dinky, bumping-along Idaho train on Amtrak to get over to \nWashington. I do not know, but I do think the probability of all States \nagreeing on a capital expenditure program or all States agreeing to \nspend money for operating expenses, whatever it is, is probably zero. \nIt is probably zero.\n  So, as a practical matter, I do not think this is going to work. It \nsort of sounds good on the surface: Oh, we are going to divert money \nfor Amtrak. It may turn into an intercity rail program only within the \nState. We have a mass transit program for that that will not turn into \nan interstate national Amtrak system. It will not work. It just will \nnot work. I think we probably should not spend our time, frankly, \nadopting something which, as I said, just will not work.\n  Another point. There is some, not a lot, of support for a Federal \ngasoline tax--some, not a lot. People do not like paying gasoline \ntaxes, but they are willing to pay a little bit because they know that \nthat money, the gasoline tax, is going to go to the highway trust fund, \nand from the highway trust fund, it is going to be spent on highways.\n  It is true, we are not simon pure here. Some of the highway trust \nfund money now goes to related purposes. Some goes to bike ways, some \ngoes to safety programs, highway safety and related programs, and even \nsome of it goes to mass transit. But, still, Mr. President, I do not \nknow that we want to further dilute the purpose of the gasoline tax.\n  There are a lot of people in our country who pay gasoline taxes for \nhighways. They do not want to pay gasoline taxes for Amtrak. If we are \ngoing to work on public confidence in Government, we will to do better \nif we keep the purpose for which money is raised directly related to \nthe person who is paying the money--user fees, if you will. I just \nthink it is very worrisome if we go down the road and start raising \ngasoline taxes, as I said, and spending it for other purposes.\n  What might be a better idea? Let me suggest one. This gets a little \ncomplicated, but bear with me.\n  The long and the short of it is, under the law today, about--in fact \nexactly--2\\1/2\\ cents of the Federal gasoline tax goes to the highway \ntrust fund; 2\\1/2\\ cents of the current gasoline tax and diesel tax \ngoes to the highway trust fund.\n  In 1996, just a year from now, that 2\\1/2\\ cents that currently goes \nto the highway trust fund will go for a different purpose. Two cents of \nit goes to the highway trust fund and one-half cent goes to the transit \ntrust fund. I am suggesting that we take that half cent, which in 1996 \nis scheduled to go to the transit trust fund, and instead dedicate it \nto Amtrak, about $600 million.\n  The beauty of that, Mr. President, is it takes nothing away from mass \ntransit. The mass transit trust fund account today is already at a $5 \nbillion surplus. Currently, out of the gasoline tax, about one-half \ncent goes to the transit trust fund. I am suggesting we keep the same \namount that is now going to the transit trust fund--as I said, it is a \n$5 billion surplus; it is already paying for mass transit. The one-half \ncent I am talking about does not now go to the transit trust fund; not \nyet. It is scheduled to go to the transit trust fund in 1996. I am \nsuggesting we take that one-half cent and spend it on Amtrak. Is it new \ntaxes we have to raise? None whatsoever. But it is one-half cent \navailable to spend on Amtrak. That raises $600 million.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Just a second. We cannot do that on this bill. We cannot \nprovide that amendment on this bill because that is a revenue measure, \nand it will be blue-slipped by the House of Representatives. That is, \nthey will just not consider it, because as a revenue bill, it did not \noriginate in the House. When we get to reconciliation, we then have an \nopportunity to include this provision in reconciliation, which I think \nis the way to solve the Amtrak problem.\n The deficit in Amtrak is about $1 billion a year. We have to make a \nlot of changes in Amtrak, spruce it up, and make it more efficient and \nso forth. But here is a way to provide $600 million a year without \nincreasing taxes, and because Amtrak is so important to our country--it \nis vitally important throughout America. There are only two or three \nStates that do not have Amtrak service, but the rest do. I suggest that \nthe better way to handle this whole problem is to pursue the \nalternative I am suggesting, which solves the Amtrak problem, rather \nthan the amendment before us which I think will cause a lot of \nheadaches and heartaches and will not even begin to solve the problems \nthat we have to deal with regarding Amtrak.\n\n  I yield to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Senator from Montana essentially answered the question \nI was about to ask--that we could not do that on this bill. I agree \nthat that would be a significant and important change. Granted, it only \ncomes out of the mass transit fund, which, right now, is in surplus. \nBut it does not come out of the highway money. I would rather see a \nhalf-cent come out of that 2 cents going to the highway fund. But it is \nvery important.\n  I want to respond very briefly to the four basic points the Senator \nmade. I will really focus on one. He talked about this being--that we \nare robbing Peter to pay Paul. That is a judgment for Peter to make, \nwhether he wants to give it to Paul. ``Governor Peter'' can decide \nwhether or not he wants to suggest that it go to Paul. If Governor \nPeter wants it to stay where it is, you do not have to rob anybody. It \nstays where it is.\n  This notion of the need for bridges and repairs, obviously, if the \nStates conclude the bridges are more important to them than Amtrak, \nthen they will make that judgment. We are only talking about one \nportion of the highway trust funds that go into the State, which rough \ncut is about 25 percent of the moneys that the States get, that is the \nonly portion they could use.\n  No. 3 is this notion of disruption. I have great admiration for my \nfriend from Montana, and I mean that sincerely. He knows that if you \ncan paint a picture for someone that makes the proposition look a \nlittle ridiculous, it is very compelling. His idea of going 150 miles \nan hour through Montana to the border of Idaho and getting off the \ntrain and getting on this chugalug train that is going to take you \nthrough Idaho, is a very disruptive picture. That is why Senator Roth \nplaced in the legislation this compact that no Governor is going to in \nfact decide to divert money to Amtrak from their highway trust fund \nmoney if in fact they know that train is going to stop at the Idaho \nborder.\n  So the reason for the compacts are allowing the States of Washington, \nIdaho, Montana, and the Dakotas, to sit down and say, does it make \nsense for us all to do that? If they cannot get it done, they are not \ngoing to do it. It is a very colorful picture to paint of this train \nspeeding and going through Coeur d'Alene, ID, and then coming to a \nscreeching halt. It is not realistic and not likely to happen.\n  I will end by saying that my friend from Montana has been very, very \nhelpful in the past regarding the need to set up a dedicated fund for \nAmtrak, just like there is one for highways, recognizing the national \nneed. The point, though, is that if the States conclude that it is \nbetter to use that small portion of their highway funding for Amtrak, \nand if they want to do that in conjunction with other States in their \nregion, we should allow them. We allow them to do that for bicycle \npaths now, Mr. President, and we allow them to do that for walking \npaths. We allow them to go out and buy buses, and we allow them to make \ncapital investments for other means. The only thing we do not allow \nthem to do is deal with it with regard to intercity rail service.\n  I was intrigued by the Senator's remarks, and I am heartened by his \ncommitment to taking a half-cent of the gasoline tax, which is now \ngoing in one [[Page S 8768]] direction but will revert to the way in \nwhich he suggested--coming up with $600 million for capital for Amtrak \nwhich, by the way, would meet Amtrak's capital needs on a yearly basis. \nHe is correct, it would essentially put them in the black. They would \nbe able to run in a very efficient way and increase service, not \ndiminish service. I thank him for his suggestion. I look forward--if he \nis still willing--to working with him on the reconciliation bill to do \nthat.\n  In the meantime, I think this does not create the inconvenience he \nsuggests would be created. In large part, the most compelling argument \nhe made is disruption, and I think Senator Roth was farsighted in \nlaying out in the legislation the compact capability for States, and \nthat is the reason for that provision of the legislation.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to support \nthis important amendment. The Roth amendment will grant States the \nflexibility to use highway funds to maintain and revitalize intercity \npassenger rail service. At a time when we are shifting responsibility \nfrom Washington to the States, we should also allow individual States \nto chose how they would allocate Federal transportation funds and \nselect transportation systems that best meet their needs for the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, my own State of Vermont spent the winter working to \npreserve our link to the national passenger rail system. In December, \nAmtrak announced that all passenger rail service to Vermont would be \nterminated. But in April, after extensive negotiations, the State of \nVermont and Amtrak announced the establishment of the Vermonter, a new \nday train traveling from Washington, DC, to St. Albans, VT. The key to \npreserving this rail service was that the State of Vermont was willing \nto pay, out of general funds, the operating costs of this train. This \nis how important rail service is to Vermont.\n  Earlier in this debate a number of Senators referred to a letter in \nsupport of this amendment from four Governors, including Governor Dean \nof Vermont. The letter clearly illustrates that States want the \nflexibility to use Federal transportation funds as they chose. Vermont \nwould use these funds to support the Vermonter and possibly other \npassenger rail in the State, including a proposed route from White \nHall, NY, through Rutland to Burlington, VT. Clearly, Vermont and other \nStates should have this option. I commend Senator Roth for his \ndedication to this issue and I urge my colleagues to vote for this \nimportant amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Montana, \nthe comanager of the bill, and I at this time would like to see if we \ncan get a unanimous consent request with regard to time limitations on \nthe three amendments.\n  We start with the amendment now under consideration. It was indicated \nto the managers earlier that Senators Roth and Biden would agree to \n1\\1/2\\ hours equally divided. We can calculate the amount of time that \nhas expired thus far and then determine the time at which the 1\\1/2\\ \nhours would be completed.\n  I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, will the Senator again go through the \nlist?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, I am happy to do that. Mr. President, the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia indicated that on his \namendment, he would be agreeable to 1 hour equally divided. The \nSenators from Delaware, Mr. Roth and Mr. Biden, indicated 1\\1/2\\ hours \nequally divided. The Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, said 40 \nminutes equally divided on his amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Reserving the right to object. Would the manager on \nthe Republican side be able to tell me, or would the Parliamentarian be \nable to tell us, how much time remains on the hour and a half at this \njuncture?\n  Mr. WARNER. The pending Roth-Biden amendment. We put that question to \nthe Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-six minutes have been consumed on that \namendment up to this point.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the distinguished Senator from Virginia be \nwilling, if Senator Roth is inclined to agree, to divide the remaining \ntime? I ask that before a unanimous consent is agreed to. Frankly, I \nwould like a chance----\n  Mr. WARNER. I think I have an easier solution. The Senator from \nMontana has expressed my views very clearly. I associate myself with \nhis remarks and thereby with the exception of maybe 2 minutes, I will \nforgo such time as I may require or would have required otherwise. So I \nsuggest let us agree to the hour and a half--first, how much time does \nthe Senator from New Jersey want?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will have to ask the Parliamentarian how much time \nremains on the Roth-Biden amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator indicate how much time he desires?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I think we ought to have 20 minutes to further \ndiscuss the issue, if that is acceptable to Senator Roth.\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest that we amend the time agreement and say that \nthe pending amendment would be completed in 35 minutes, 20 minutes of \nwhich would go to the Senators from Delaware, with a due allowance to \ntheir colleague from New Jersey and the 15 minutes would be divided \nequally between the Senator from Montana and myself; that we may then \nproceed to the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] \nwho desires an hour on his amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that be ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Lastly, the Senator from Montana and I now pose a \nunanimous-consent request that the amendment of the Senator from North \nDakota [Mr. Dorgan] be concluded in 40 minutes, equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is the hope of the managers of the bill that the \nSenator from West Virginia could proceed following the disposition of \nthe amendment of the Senators from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Delaware. Perhaps I will use \nless than that. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to mention to my colleagues, \nthe Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] would like the unanimous-\nconsent agreement to provide that there be no second-degree amendments \nto his amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I join the Senator from Montana in that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, while the Senator from Montana and I are \nup, we are making great progress in resolving the other amendments.\n  I urge all Senators who have pending matters to send their staffs \nover at this time to complete the amendments which are outstanding. As \nfar as I know, the Senator from Montana and I only know of these three \namendments subject to time agreements which will require rollcall \nvotes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President I would like to echo that statement. We are \nclose to finishing this bill. It behooves Senators to come over quickly \nand work on their amendments so we can finish this bill tonight. I \nthank the Senator.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Roth-Biden amendment, \nperhaps to no one's surprise, because I have long had an interest and \nan association with Amtrak.\n  This amendment is fairly simple. I think it has been well stated by \nboth of the distinguished Senators from Delaware. The central purpose \nof the amendment, as I see it, is to provide the States with \nflexibility--something we constantly urge around here--to use funds \nprovided on two of the major Federal transportation formula programs \nfor the cost of interstate rail passenger service.\n  The thrust of this amendment closely resembles a provision that \npassed the Senate that I sponsored during the debate on the Intermodal \nSurface Transportation Efficiency Act, which we call ISTEA.\n  Under the amendment, Governors and State transportation officials [[Page S \n8769]] would be granted the flexibility to use funds provided under the \nsurface transportation program [STP], the Congestion Mitigation and Air \nQuality Program called CMAQ, for the costs of intercity rail passenger \nservice.\n  I want to make one thing quite clear. This amendment does not mandate \nthat even one cent of highway or transit formula funds will be spent on \nAmtrak service. The only way one penny can even be used for Amtrak, is \nif the Governor and the State transportation officials want it to \nhappen.\n  When the Congress adopted ISTEA, we made great strides toward \nenhancing the flexibility of State transportation planners in directing \nFederal funds to the types of transportation projects that best suited \ntheir needs.\n  However, in the final conference report, there was a glaring \nomission. That was the flexibility to direct Federal formula funds to \nthe cost of intercity rail service.\n  The Senate-passed version of ISTEA did include such flexibility for \nthe surface transportation service. However, jurisdiction over rail \nprograms at the time was under the House Commerce Committee. As such, \nit was very difficult to get members of the House Public Works \nCommittee to accept the provision.\n  We now have a new opportunity to address this issue, since the House \nhas moved jurisdiction over rail matters to our companion committee in \nthe House, the newly-named Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.\n  All Members are aware that Amtrak has been facing especially \ndifficult financial times over the last year. Amtrak has been required \nto announce several service cuts and route eliminations to reduce or \neliminate an operating deficit that exceeds $200 million.\n  These service cuts and eliminations impacted many States, including \nmy own. We heard the distinguished Senator from Montana talk about how \nvaluable he viewed Amtrak service in the State of Montana. They have \nhad what to some would appear to be a modest cut, yet it was apparently \ndeeply felt.\n  In the wake of these service cuts, numerous States have been \nscrambling to find their own funding to maintain Amtrak service. Many \nof these same States have asked Members to explain why they can use \ntheir Federal formula funds for transit purposes but may not use them \nfor intercity rail service.\n  I do not believe that any Members have a good answer to that \nquestion. Amtrak's delicate financial situation was brought about \nlargely through underinvestment, over a great many years, in our \nnational rail network. Our national passenger rail corporation, Amtrak, \ncovers a higher percentage of its operating costs than any other \npassenger railroad in the world. It benefits from an operating subsidy \nlike every other passenger rail system in the world, but at a smaller \nsubsidy per passenger than any of the others. Compared to our \nindustrial competitors, we spend a pittance on our national rail \nnetwork.\n  Within the next 5 years, France plans to spend nearly $125 billion on \nintercity rail enhancements. If anyone has a chance to see the TGB and \nsee it zip along the countryside at a cool 180 or 200 miles per hour in \ncomfort, speed, attracting lots and lots of passenger, one would see \nwhy the investment is justified.\n  Germany will spend over $70 billion during the same period. By the \nend of this century, Sweden, a relatively tiny country, plans to invest \nas much in rail enhancement as it does in highways.\n  Just within the European Community, high speed rail investment is \nlikely to top $100 billion by the year 2000. On average, European \ncountries invest between 1 and 1.5 percent of their GDP in intercity \nrail. That compares with our country where we invest roughly five one-\nhundredths of one percent on our national passenger rail service, \nAmtrak.\n  No one is suggesting we use highway funds to embark on a major rail \ninvestment program. However, Amtrak's recent financial difficulties \nmake it clear that we must take action to ensure the future of a \nnational rail network, to ensure that our Nation has a balanced \ntransportation system.\n  This amendment takes a small step to allow the Nation's Governors--\nand we are talking about flexibility, and we are talking about \ndecisions made within the State--the option of preserving a balanced \ntransportation program in their States. If they do not want to use any \nof it for Amtrak, they need not do it.\n  Throughout our recent political debates over the role of the Federal \nGovernment, there has been increased attention to the benefits of \ngiving States enhanced responsibility while simultaneously giving them \nincreased flexibility. This model, it is assumed, will provide for a \nmore efficient public service transportation system.\n  This is clearly one area where this model can benefit the traveling \npublic across the Nation by giving Governors access to the full range \nof transportation options.\n  I want to speak about the region of the country I come from, the \nNortheast. I can tell my colleagues--and Senator Biden and Senator Roth \nare only too familiar with this--that in my part of the country, Amtrak \nis absolutely indispensable. It is one of the most cost-effective \ninvestments of Federal transportation dollars in the region. Fully half \nof Amtrak's ridership travels on the Northeast corridor, the most \ncongested transportation corridor in the United States.\n  Now, all the highway spending in the world could not overcome the \nlack of adequate right of way to construct enough lane miles to \naccommodate all Northeast corridor Amtrak traffic. There is simply not \nthe capacity in the already congested airports of the Northeast to \naccommodate an additional 11 million passengers annually.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I think, to underline the point made by my \ndistinguished colleague, it is important to understand, for example, in \nthe case of New Jersey, the ridership in 1994 was 1,369,000; in \nMaryland, 1,448,000; in my little State of Delaware, 607,000.\n Is there any way we could replace that travel by building additional \nroads?\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. There is no way on Earth, as they say, to provide the \ncapacity for additional highway lanes. But, further, I say to the \ndistinguished Senator, Amtrak currently carries half of the combined \nair-rail market between New York and Washington, DC. Were Amtrak \nservice to disappear, listen to this, it would add the equivalent of \n10,000 fully booked DC-9's to the already congested air traffic in the \nNortheast. There is not enough room on the highways or on Earth. And \nthere is not enough room at the airports or in the skies to accommodate \nsuch growth.\n  What a disaster it would be for the economy of the Northeast as well \nas the country as a whole. It is already almost impossible to move on \nour highways and get in and out of the airports during the peak holiday \nseasons. The noteworthy ones, Thanksgiving, Memorial Day, Labor Day, \nFather's Day--you name it, it would be a disaster. If you eliminate \nAmtrak service in the Northeast, traffic on the highways and at the \nairports will come virtually to a dead stop. So we need to find ways to \nexpand our passenger rail infrastructure, not to kill it. I am pleased \nto hear the Senator from Montana talk positively about Amtrak. We have \nto find the funding for it.\n  The GAO estimates that productivity losses due to highway congestion \neach year cost our Nation $100 billion, each year. DOT estimates that \nin our 39 largest cities, traffic congestion costs $44 billion \nannually. And absent any effort to expand our rail capacity and other \nnonhighway alternatives, highway use is expected to grow at such a \nrapid rate that all the increased highway spending that we could muster \ncould not handle the growth and the congestion.\n  The Senator from Montana made a good point. He said if you do not \nclaim your highway use, the construction and so forth, enough in \nadvance, you could wind up with a patchwork quilt of things. So it is \nwith Amtrak. That is why I think the Senator from Delaware provided for \na compact arrangement between States, to be able, hopefully, to agree \non a program that fits the needs of the several States in the area.\n  The situation is just as bad at our Nation's airports. Winglock, \ncongestion at our airports, costs our economy roughly $5 billion a \nyear. It is expected air travel delays will only worsen over the next \nseveral years. Within the next [[Page S 8770]] 5 years, most major \nairports will exceed 80,000 hours of annual flight delays each year. In \nshort, it is a major, major problem.\n  Completing the electrification of the Northeast corridor, which is \nvirtually underway, though not specific construction--but a lot of \nengineering, a lot of the planning and some of the equipment has been \nordered--is expected to attract 3 million additional passengers \nannually between New York City and Boston to our rail system, taking \nthem off already congested highways and airways.\n  Completing the electrification will alleviate the need for creating \nhighway capacity for 324,000--the numbers are staggering--324,000 \ndrivers each year and the cost of expanding aviation capacity to \naccommodate 50 daily New York-Boston flights. The cost of this rail \nproject is, as we say, peanuts compared to the Federal funds that would \nbe required to be invested to achieve the highway and aviation capacity \nthat would be otherwise needed.\n  The prospect of expanding Logan Airport in Boston runs into multiple \nbillions of dollars just in that one place.\n  I am in contact, and have been in contact, with Governors along the \nNortheast corridor, almost all of them--almost all of them--Republican. \nThey recognize the critical value of Amtrak to our region. They \ncurrently have the opportunity to use discrete amounts of their Federal \nformula funds for costs associated with transit service in the region, \nand Amtrak service should be no exception.\n  In sum, it is very obvious that those who think in detail about \ntransportation needs--to those who come from the northeastern part of \nthe country, those who come from all parts of the country, because \nthere are not any Senators that I have had a chance to talk to where \nthere is some Amtrak service who do not want to either expand it or \ncontinue it--I have not heard any of them volunteer to eliminate the \nAmtrak service, as sparse as it may be within their State.\n  So I hope we will be able to provide this flexibility. We are not \ntaking anything away from anybody. If the question is put, is there \nsufficient funding for bridges? Heck, no, there is not sufficient \nfunding for bridges in our society. Even to repair those that are \nfunctionally obsolete, there is not enough money for it.\n  Is there enough to maintain the highways in the condition we would \nlike to see them? No, there is not. But if we lose Amtrak and we lose \nthe infrastructure that is associated with national rail passenger \nservice, we will be in far worse shape because at least if we keep the \nintercity railroad going, we have a chance to buck the trend and be \nable to accommodate the traveling needs of the public.\n  I hope this amendment will carry. I commend Senators Roth and Biden \nfor bringing it to this point. I think it is timely. There are so many \nservices that we would like to see operating in the transportation \ninfrastructure network of our country that are just not going to be \nable to be funded. I know for some Senators in some of the Western \nStates, something called essential air service is a critical factor. We \nwant to try to fund it wherever we can.\n  All of these are competing for funding. All of these modes are \ncompeting for funding, but this one, national rail service, national \npassenger rail service, is an essential factor if we are going to think \nabout a balanced transportation network in this country of ours.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Roth-Biden amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will make a couple of points that I \nthink are worth knowing about this amendment.\n  First of all, this amendment is opposed by a lot of groups. Let me \nread a letter from Keep America Moving. It is an organization \ninterested in our highways. I will just read the relevant part:\n\n       The undersigned organizations believe the National Highway \n     System is vital to America's economic and defense needs. We \n     urge you to support prompt passage of the NHS and oppose any \n     efforts to subsidize Amtrak with highway funds.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Automobile Manufacturers Association.\n       American Bus Association.\n       American Consulting Engineer Council.\n       American Movers Conference.\n       American Petroleum Institute.\n       American Portland Cement Alliance.\n       American Road and Transportation Builders Association.\n       American Trucking Associations.\n       Ashland Inc.\n       Associated Builders and Contractors.\n       Associated General Contractors.\n       Highway Users Federation.\n       National Asphalt Pavement Association.\n       National Association of Manufacturers.\n\n  There are a lot more. There is a lot of opposition, I might say, to \nthis amendment.\n  Second, I wondered what the donor States think of this amendment. Mr. \nPresident, about half of the States of our country are so-called donor \nStates. They just get the willies when they realize they are spending \nmore money on gasoline taxes than they are getting back in highway \nfunds. Now, what are they going to think, the donor States--here is a \nwhole other opportunity to spend their money on another State?\n  I frankly think the donor States would not be very happy about this \namendment. The donor States, about half of our States, would get very \nnervous, in fact upset with the idea of spending more of their money on \nsome other State, in this case for Amtrak.\n  Also, let me sum up by saying this is not going to work, this \nproposal. There are 46 States in our country that have Amtrak. As I \nhear the proponents of this amendment, there are 46 different horses \nbefore the Amtrak cart; 46 different States have an idea how to improve \nAmtrak, 46 different States. Capital expenditures, operating \nexpenditures--who knows what?\n  Amtrak is a national system. It is not a separate 46-State system, it \nis a national system. That is why I again come back to the idea I \nproposed earlier. I want very much to help the Senator from New Jersey \nby taking that half-cent that is, in 1996, scheduled to go to the mass \ntransit account which already has a $5 billion surplus, and say \ndedicate that half-cent instead to Amtrak. It is $600 million. That is \na national solution to a national problem, rather than a 46-State \nsolution to a national problem.\n  I understand the provisions in the amendment--compacts and all that. \nBut those compacts are not going to work. States are not going to agree \nto those compacts. If they do not work, then they do not work. Then we \nare not solving the problem.\n  I think, frankly, it is an idea that has surface appeal and it is an \nidea that is not going to work, and I suggest we therefore agree to \nthis amendment. Dig down, agree to it, get the amendment agreed to that \nI am suggesting, namely that half-cent dedicated to Amtrak.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. How much time do I have left, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes and 22 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield 2 minutes?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 2 minutes to my distinguished colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, everything my friend from Montana said up \nto a moment ago was basically correct when he said how are the donor \nStates going to feel having another way to spend more money? No more \nmoney can be spent for this amendment, No. 1. No. 2, we are a donor \nState. We are for it. No. 3, the idea that somehow there are other ways \nto spend the money meaning that we are going to be taking money from \none State and spending it another State is not accurate. I do not think \nhe meant to say that. He may have left that impression.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate that. If the Senator will yield, what I \nmeant to say is that it is not more money, but a donor State spending \nmoney for more purposes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. We are a donor State. We like that opportunity.\n  Lastly, the list from the cement manufacturers to the highway people, \nit seems like 100 years ago when I first got here in 1973 and was on \nthe committee that the Senator is now the ranking member. Then every \none of those interests were against anything that had to do with \ntransportation other than highway. They always will, they always were, \nthey always will be, and they always have. They were [[Page S \n8771]] against the ISTEA provision that is related to transportation \nother than highways. They are against anything that does not lay \ncement, macadam, or concrete. It is real simple. Do not blame them. It \nis all there, the naked self-interest which is the way this place runs. \nOK, but the idea that they are against this, they never have been for \nanything at all progressive that related to any mode of transportation \nother than laying concrete, so help me goodness.\n  I yield the 10 seconds I probably have left.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If the Senator will yield for one question, does he \nthink the automobile manufacturers are not objecting when they want to \npreserve all of the funding that we could muster for highways?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I think the automobile manufacturers--my \nfather having been an automobile salesmen his entire life--are \nhonorable, decent people who know their self-interest, and I respect \nthem for that.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I want to emphasize once more that the Roth-\nBiden amendment requires no new spending. It does not change any \nFederal transportation formula. It does not require a State to spend \nany money on Amtrak or intercity rail. It simply provides States with \nthe flexibility to support Amtrak with funds they already qualify for, \nand it responds to a real need, a real need expressed by Governors \naround the country who are seeking the means to support Amtrak services \nthat have been cut back. It promotes State responsibility in support of \nour national transportation system.\n  Current prohibitions against using Federal funds for Amtrak frankly \nskews public policy away from a cleaner, cheaper option--intercity \nrail. Highway user fees, gas taxes, already go to fund many other \nsurface transportation options from mass transit to hike and bike \ntrails. Only intercity rail is cut off from those funds. States cannot \nnow choose to support Amtrak with those funds.\n  At the same time that they are losing Amtrak services, many of our \nStates find themselves with unused surpluses and programs they do not \nneed.\n  So the goal of our highway bill is to increase State and local \nflexibility to improve the efficiency of our national transportation \nsystem.\n  This amendment would promote that goal and remove what I believe to \nbe an arbitrary restriction on States' transportation choices.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have done a great deal of work on this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Roth-Biden amendment to \nmake Amtrak activities, including operating expenses and acquisition of \nequipment, eligible for National Highway System funds.\n  If the amendment before us is adopted, it will reverse the momentum \nand progress of the National Highway System and the purpose of this \nbill. It would drain the gas out of our tank.\n  The NHS will ensure that our surface transportation network performs \nto maximum efficiency. In order to meet this maximum level of \nefficiency, the highway trust fund must remain in tact to meet the \nfunding requirements needed to meet our urgent number of highway and \nbridge needs.\n  The American taxpayer pays into the highway trust fund through gas \ntaxes. We must ``keep faith'' with our citizens to ensure that existing \nroads are maintained and where necessary new roads are constructed. \nThose who have paid into the highway trust fund expect that their fuel \ntaxes will be available to respond to our highway needs.\n  While there is no doubt that Amtrak has started to make some needed \nrestructuring improvements in their day-to-day operations, it is clear \nthat a complete overhaul of the system is necessary.\n  As the Federal Highway Administration has stated that the highway \ntrust fund cannot begin to meet existing highway and bridge needs, it \nis not wise to dilute the effectiveness of these limited dollars. It is \nestimated that $290 billion is needed to fund the backlog of repairs \nand improvements to the current highway system. By diverting any of the \n$6.5 billion annual authorization for the National Highway System to \nAmtrak, we would be placing our roads and bridges in jeopardy.\n  At a time when transportation infrastructure dollars are so \nconstrained, priority funding should go\n to those areas of transportation which will move the largest number of \ngoods and people across the country. The NHS roads carry about 40 \npercent of all highway traffic and 75 percent of all commercial truck \ntraffic. Over 80 percent of intercity passenger miles are traveled on \nour highway system, not on Amtrak. In fact, Amtrak carries less than 1 \npercent of all intercity passenger rail miles.\n\n  I have in the past and will continue to be a supporter of Amtrak. It \nis undeniable, however, that Amtrak currently carries a very low \npercentage of all intercity passenger miles traveled in comparison to \nour Nations highways. The highway trust fund, to which rail passengers \nhave made no contributions, must not be used for this purpose.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record certain \ndocuments relating to my comments.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 1995.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: On behalf of the U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce Federation of 220,000 businesses, 3,000 state and \n     local chambers of commerce, 1,200 trade and professional \n     associations, and 72 American Chambers of Commerce abroad, I \n     urge you to oppose any effort to include Amtrak routes in the \n     National Highway System (NHS).\n       Senators Roth, Biden, Murray, Moynihan, Jeffords, and Leahy \n     have introduced legislation (S. 733) that would provide \n     states with the flexibility to shift Highway Trust Fund \n     dollars to Amtrak's capital and operating budgets. We are \n     concerned that portions of this bill may be offered as an \n     amendment during the Environment and Public Works Committee \n     markup of S. 440, the ``National Highway System Designation \n     Act of 1995.'' Given that the United States is investing \n     significantly less than the amount needed to maintain our \n     roads and bridges, a subsidy for Amtrak, via Highway Trust \n     Fund dollars, would be an affront to many of our members who \n     expect their fuel taxes to be spent for their intended \n     purpose.\n       In these times of budgetary cutbacks and competing demands, \n     the NHS represents good government. It gives priority funding \n     to those roads that are most important to our commercial and \n     personal commuting needs. In fact, the NHS only accounts for \n     four percent of America's total system mileage, yet will \n     carry 40 percent of all travel and 75 percent of all \n     commercial vehicle travel. Also, 95 percent of all businesses \n     will be within five miles of the NHS. Moreover, the NHS \n     represents a bottom-up approach, whereby state and local \n     officials played an instrumental role in formulating the \n     Department of Transportation's designation map.\n       However, if an Amtrak amendment is successful, the \n     Chamber's support for S. 440 would be in serious jeopardy. In \n     particular, we are very concerned about the findings \n     contained in a February 1995 General Accounting Office report \n     on Amtrak which shows that:\n       Not a single Amtrak route is profitable when capital costs \n     are taken into account; revenues cover only 65 percent of the \n     cost;\n       Amtrak will need $4 billion in capital investment just to \n     maintain its equipment and facilities;\n       Over the next five years, Amtrak will accrue a $1.3 billion \n     operating deficit, despite its revenues and its $1 billion-\n     per-year federal subsidy; and\n       Despite service cutbacks and other cost-cutting measures, \n     Amtrak is unlikely to close its deficit gap.\n       The September 30, 1995 deadline for passage is coming \n     quickly. The needs of the transportation infrastructure are \n     too important to let this opportunity pass by. Failure to act \n     will mean losses of $13 billion in NHS funds to states for \n     fiscal 1996 and 1997, which could translate into fewer \n     economic benefits for the economy. Because the NHS \n     designation represents a long-term commitment to our \n     country's productivity and competitiveness, the Chamber urges \n     passage of a bill that focuses on the designation and \n     respectfully requests the defeat of any weakening amendments, \n     such as language contained in S. 733.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    American Road & Transportation\n\n\n                                         Builders Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 1995.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Transportation & Infrastructure, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: The 4,000 members of the American Road \n     & Transportation Builders Association commend you for your \n     leadership in moving to secure Senate approval of S. 440 \n     designating routes of the National Highway System. We \n     strongly support [[Page S 8772]] prompt enactment of this \n     legislation to avoid any possibility of missing the September \n     30 deadline and the resulting loss to the states of a \n     substantial part of their federal highway funding.\n       We fully agree with your statement at the time you \n     introduced S. 440 that nothing should stand in the way of its \n     enactment. We are concerned, however, that other legislation \n     being prepared for introduction would constitute an \n     impediment to the NHS bill. That legislation, expected to be \n     introduced by Senators Roth and Biden, would make the Amtrak \n     passenger rail system eligible for NHS funds. Inclusion of \n     Amtrak funding eligibility in the NHS bill would cause ARTBA \n     to seriously reconsider its support of this legislation and \n     would result, we believe, in a general erosion of support by \n     other key groups.\n       The NHS is designed to be the principal focus of federal \n     highway investment well into the next century. This system \n     carries a large proportion of the nation's commercial and \n     personal traffic. It needs billions of dollars of investment \n     to allow it to perform this mission effectively and \n     economically. The resources of the Highway Trust Fund already \n     are inadequate to meet highway and bridge needs, estimated in \n     1993 by the Department of Transportation at $290 billion. Any \n     further diversion of user fees paid by the nation's highway \n     users would be totally unacceptable.\n       Amtrak is an important component of the American \n     transportation system. Congress should provide it with \n     financial assistance--from the general treasury--to the \n     extent it deems necessary and prudent. The Highway Trust \n     Fund, to which rail users make no contribution, should not be \n     used for this purpose.\n       Mr. Chairman, ARTBA is ready to work with you in securing \n     enactment of NHS designation legislation. We strongly oppose, \n     however, the inclusion in that bill of any provision that \n     would dilute trust fund revenues by making them available to \n     Amtrak or for any other use not currently authorized.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   T. Peter Ruane,\n     President and CEO.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 American Trucking\n\n\n                                           Associations, Inc.,\n\n                                      Alexandria, VA, May 5, 1995.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Environment and Public Works Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: On April 27th, Senator Roth (R-DE) \n     introduced S. 733, legislation that would add Amtrak routes \n     to the National Highway System, in effect, making the rail \n     system eligible for capital and operating subsidies funded \n     through Highway Trust Fund receipts. This proposal is bad law \n     and bad policy and should not be added to NHS approval bill, \n     S. 440. Adding S. 733 would create a contradiction to the \n     committee's long-stated goal of passing a clean NHS bill. \n     Further, this diversion would create unsafe highways, not \n     meet national transportation needs, and would undercut \n     capital funding.\n       I urge you to reject this amendment for the following \n     reasons:\n       It would create unsafe highways. According to the Federal \n     Highway Administration, there is not enough money in the \n     Highway Trust Fund to meet existing highway and bridge needs. \n     Specifically, $290 billion is needed to fund the backlog of \n     repairs and improvements to the system. Diverting funds from \n     these needs creates a real safety problem, such as when the \n     I-95 bridge in Connecticut failed in 1983.\n       It would not meet national transportation needs. The \n     intercity rail passenger system only carries .3% (one-third \n     of one percent) of intercity passengers. It does not move any \n     of America's freight. Diverting funds to pay Amtrak expenses \n     will not significantly benefit auto congestion. It would also \n     establish a major highway user subsidy unfair to companies \n     that carry intercity passengers--the bus and aviation \n     industries.\n       It undercuts capital funding. The Roth bill would allow up \n     to $3.25 billion a year of capital funding to be used for \n     Amtrak salaries and operating costs. Faced with an imminent \n     and unplanned loss of a state's intercity rail service, a \n     state would be under extreme political pressure to \n     shortchange its multi-year capital improvement program and \n     pay the operating costs. The future suffers.\n       The Roth proposal fails to solve Amtrak's underlying \n     problems. In fact, it seems to sustain them. Amtrak was \n     conceived with the objective that it would meet its expenses \n     from operating revenues. Instead, it has sought ever \n     increasing federal and state subsidies and has slashed \n     services. While recognizing that some intercity routes truly \n     make sense, replacing the General Fund subsidy to Amtrak with \n     a highway user subsidy fails to solve its dilemma.\n       Please join me in preserving the use of highway user \n     revenues for highway users. I look forward to working with \n     you and your staff on this important issue. If you have any \n     questions, please call\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Thomas J. Donohue,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                  National Asphalt\n\n\n                                         Pavement Association,\n\n                                       Lanham, MD, April 25, 1995.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: The National Asphalt Pavement \n     Association (NAPA) opposes the Roth/Biden bill to make Amtrak \n     part of the National Highway System (NHS). This proposal \n     constitutes an enormous potential diversion of highway user \n     fees into subsidized passenger rail service that, according \n     to Amtrak's own estimates, will post a $1.3 billion operating \n     deficit over the next five years.\n       The NHS is designed to focus federal highway dollars on \n     highways and bridges that are most important for safely \n     moving people and goods in interstate commerce. The nation's \n     highway users should not be tapped to pay the bill for a \n     passenger rail system that provides limited transportation \n     value.\n       NAPA is the national trade association exclusively \n     representing the Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) Industry. We have a \n     membership of nearly 800 corporations, most of which are HMA \n     producers and paving contractors. The majority of our members \n     are small businesses, and our member firms produce \n     approximately 70 to 75 percent of the total HMA produced in \n     the United States annually.\n       NAPA urges you to oppose the Roth/Biden proposal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Mike Acott,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                     Highway Users Federation,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 27, 1995.\n     Hon. John Chafee,\n     Chairman, Environment & Public Works Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Ranking Democratic Member, Environment & Public Works \n         Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Senator Baucus: The Highway Users \n     Federation strongly opposes any effort to include Amtrak \n     routes in the National Highway System (NHS). Senators Roth, \n     Biden, Murray, Moynihan, Jeffords, and Leahy have introduced \n     S. 733 to do just that, and we understand elements of their \n     bill may be offered as an amendment during Environment and \n     Public Works Committee mark up of S. 440, the ``National \n     Highway System Designation Act of 1995.'' In my judgment, if \n     such an amendment were approved, the current widespread \n     support for the NHS in the private sector would be seriously \n     eroded.\n       The NHS is intended to focus federal highway dollars on \n     those roads that are most important for meeting America's \n     personal, commercial, and defense mobility needs. S. 440 \n     designates the routes identified by Transportation Secretary \n     Federico Pena, based on the recommendations of state and \n     local officials. These roads carry 40% of all highway traffic \n     and 75% of commercial truck travel. Over 80% of intercity \n     passenger miles are traveled by highway, and NHS routes carry \n     the bulk of that passenger service.\n       In stark contrast, Amtrak carries just three-tenths of one \n     percent (0.3%) of all intercity passenger miles traveled. \n     Ridership and revenues continue to fall, according to a \n     February 1995 General Accounting Office (GAO) report, and \n     even in the Northeast Corridor where the railroad gets its \n     heaviest ridership, revenues cover only 65% of costs. Not a \n     single Amtrak route is profitable when capital costs are \n     taken into account, GAO says. Over the next five years, \n     Amtrak will accrue a $1.3 billion operating deficit--even \n     after accounting for both its revenues and a billion dollar-\n     per-year federal subsidy. In addition, the railroad will need \n     $4 billion in capital investments just to keep its facilities \n     and equipment in working order.\n       It's clear why Amtrak's leadership and supporters would be \n     looking for a financial prop. GAO says, however, that even \n     the service cutbacks and other cost-cutting measures recently \n     instituted by Amtrak are unlikely to close the deficit gap, \n     and Congress should consider whether the railroad's \n     ``original mission of providing nationwide intercity \n     passenger rail service'' is still appropriate.\n       Whatever decision Congress makes with respect to Amtrak, \n     the Highway Trust Fund should not be tapped for the subsidy. \n     The U.S. already invests about $13 billion per year less than \n     the amount needed just to maintain conditions on our roads \n     and bridges, according to the Federal Highway Administration. \n     This under-investment has resulted in a current backlog of \n     $290 billion in needed road and bridge repairs. There simply \n     is not enough money to meet our fundamental transportation \n     needs, let alone enough to subsidize a passenger rail system \n     that shows no promise of ever paying its own way.\n       Along with other organizations participating in the Keep \n     America Moving coalition, an alliance of businesses, trade \n     associations, and consumer groups dedicated to prompt \n     enactment of the NHS, we are building constituent and media \n     support for the NHS. We believe the bipartisan list of S. 440 \n     cosponsors, including 15 Environment and Public Works \n     Committee members, reflects the widespread public support for \n     the NHS, and we hope the legislation ultimately reported by \n     the committee will enjoy the same breadth and depth of \n     support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   William D. Fay,\n                                                        President.\n     [[Page S 8773]]\n     \n     \n                                                                    ____\n                            American Portland Cement Alliance,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1995.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     Chairman, Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear John: The American Portland Cement Alliance (APCA), \n     which represents virtually all U.S. cement production, would \n     like to thank you for your leadership on S. 440, the \n     ``National Highway System Designation Act of 1995.''\n       In light of positive developments, APCA has become aware of \n     an amendment which Senator Roth may offer to make Amtrak \n     routes eligible for federal highway funds. APCA strongly \n     opposes the Roth amendment.\n       Motorists' fuel taxes paid into the highway trust fund \n     should be used to construct and maintain our nation's \n     highways and bridges--not to subsidize passenger rail \n     service. The nation's highway system has a $290 billion \n     backlog of road and bridge needs and cannot afford to spend \n     limited dollars for other than their intended purpose.\n       In addition, Amtrak carries only three tenths of one \n     percent (0.3%) of all intercity passenger miles traveled and \n     no freight. In contrast, highways carry over 80% of intercity \n     passenger miles and nearly 80% of the dollar volume of all \n     freight moved in the United States.\n       APCA urges you to continue your support for prompt passage \n     of S. 440, and to oppose an amendment to subsidize Amtrak \n     with highway funds.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Richard C. Creighton,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do not feel that the various \norganizations in opposition to this amendment have in any way tried to \nstate their case other than in a straightforward way. I have received--\nperhaps the other managers have--a letter from the chamber of commerce.\n  They state very succinctly in here the following:\n\n       However, if an Amtrak amendment is successful, the \n     Chamber's support for S. 440 would be in serious jeopardy. In \n     particular, we are very concerned about the findings \n     contained in a February 1995 General Accounting Office report \n     on Amtrak which shows that:\n       Not a single Amtrak route is profitable when capital costs \n     are taken into account, revenues cover only 65 percent of the \n     cost;\n       Amtrak will need $4 billion in capital investment just to \n     maintain its equipment and facilities;\n       Over the next five years, Amtrak will accrue a $1.3 billion \n     operating deficit, despite its revenues and its $1 billion-\n     per-year federal subsidy; and\n       Despite service cutbacks and other cost-cutting measures. \n     Amtrak is unlikely to close its deficit gap.\n       The September 30, 1995 deadline for passage is coming \n     quickly. The needs of the transportation infrastructure are \n     too important to let this opportunity pass by.\n\n  They continue, I think, in a very responsible, straightforward way.\n  I do not find that those petitions to try to intervene on behalf of \nthose of us who feel that this amendment is not wise have in any way \ngone beyond the facts and how they interpret their facts in terms of \ntheir own interests.\n  So, I conclude by saying that the statements by the Senator from \nMontana, particularly those referencing the gas tax--and the citizens \ngo up to the tank. I happen to be from a donor State and represent a \ndonor State. They pay that Federal gas tax knowing or hoping that an \nequal percentage would come back to the State, the Commonwealth of \nVirginia. Regrettably, it does not. We do not get back in my judgment \nall that we ought to in a fair proportion. But that battle is for \nanother day, and I will join others in waging it.\n  Consequently, when a rider for Amtrak goes down and gets on the train \nhe or she does not pay a similar tax as does the driver of an \nautomobile.\n  So this amendment, in effect, would let Amtrak back up to that \ndriver's gas tank and drain out the gas. It would take the gas out of \nthe momentum that we now have for this particular highway program, and \nwe have good momentum. I do not want to see that happen. This bill will \nadd to that momentum.\n  So accordingly, Mr. President, I will suggest and urge my colleagues \nnot to accept this amendment.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the managers, we yield back our time.\n  Mr. President, I move to table and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to table.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, leadership requests a quorum call be \nplaced, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by my \ncolleagues from Delaware. This amendment reinforces the flexibility \nthat the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, so-called \nISTEA, gave to the States in setting the States' transportation \npolicies.\n  That landmark legislation allowed States and local officials, for the \nfirst, time to determine how they want to spend their money. They can \nspend it on highway projects or transit facilities or other alternative \ntransportation methods, even to the extent of bikeways and pedestrian \nwalkways.\n  The amendment by the Senators from Delaware builds on this \nflexibility by enabling the States to direct their so-called congestion \nmitigation and air quality and surface transportation program funds to \nintercity passenger rail.\n  Passenger rail service is an important national resource. It is \nparticularly important to the region of the country that includes my \nState, Rhode Island. I cannot imagine what the transportation situation \nwould be on the east coast without passenger rail service, other than \ntotal gridlock. The highways and airways are already extremely \ncongested and there is little room to build more highways and airports. \nThe cost of building major new facilities in this part of the country \nwould be prohibitive.\n  We have one example now in this part of the country--the central \nartery in Boston. The cost of improving 3.5 miles of highway and \nbuilding a 3.5 mile third harbor crossing is now estimated at $8 \nbillion and rising--over $2 billion a mile. Imagine what kind of \npassenger rail service we could have for $8 billion.\n  Yet, we are clearly in danger of losing passenger rail service in \nthis country, and I believe that would be a terrible mistake.\n  Over the past year, Amtrak has been in the process of restructuring \nits operations. So far, the results are encouraging. Thomas Downs, the \npresident and chairman of the board of Amtrak, testified before the \nSurface Transportation Subcommittee last Friday that Amtrak is ahead of \nschedule in achieving a net savings of $173 million for fiscal year \n1995. Amtrak is also working on innovative financing options, such as \npartnerships with State and local officials.\n  Amtrak has a pivotal role to play in the Nation's transportation \nsystem. Intercity passenger rail is a vital link between automobile, \nbus, transit, and aviation transportation. Although the bill before us \nis entitled the National Highway System Designation Act, the NHS \ndesignation is a part of a multimodal national transportation system. \nWe must not forget the big picture.\n  I want to point out just a few of the benefits of passenger rail.\n  First, passenger rail travel has made a significant contribution to \nthe economic growth and prosperity of our Nation. Rail service in the \nNortheast corridor, for instance, has contributed to a major expansion \nof economic opportunities in the areas of Boston, New York, and \nWashington. It has also given other smaller cities like New Haven, CT; \nTrenton, NJ; and Providence, RI, the ability to take advantage of \neconomic development opportunities that they would not otherwise have.\n  Second, Amtrak provides travelers with a fuel efficient alternative \nto crowded highways and airways. As our highways and airways become \nmore and more congested, travelers need more choices in mobility. Rail \nprovides an environmentally sound alternate mode of travel to the \nautomobile.\n  Finally, there is the larger issue of State flexibility. One of the \ncentral principles of the surface transportation law is that State and \nlocal officials should have as much flexibility as possible to spend \nFederal-aid funds on their highest priorities.\n  Another important ISTEA principle is that the best transportation \nsystem [[Page S 8774]] is an intermodal system. All modes of \ntransportation must be considered when funding decisions are made. The \nSenators' amendment will give States the flexibility to consider the \nneeds of passenger rail when they make their transportation funding \ndecisions.\n  The amendment of the Senators from Delaware is in keeping with the \nflexibility that is so important for the success of the surface \ntransportation law. It does not require the States to spend any of \ntheir ISTEA money on passenger rail. It simply provides the States with \nanother tool to provide passenger rail service if they choose to do so.\n  It is my hope that the amendments by the Senators from Delaware will \nbe approved.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to propose the following \nunanimous-consent request: That the present amendment be laid aside, \nand that the Senate then proceed to the amendment by the Senator from \nWest Virginia, and if the yeas and nays are ordered on it, that the \nvote be set aside, and the Senate then proceed to debate on the \namendment of the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], and at the \nconclusion of that all three votes occur in sequence but that should \nnot occur before the hour of 7:40 p.m.\n  I now yield to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I inquire of my good friend and colleague \nfrom Virginia, I wonder if that could be further amended so that there \ncould be other amendments considered prior to the time indicated in the \nevent not all time is used on those two amendments, that is, the \namendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia as well as the \namendment offered by the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I did not understand the Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is possible that not all time will be used.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. And if there is a period of time \nfollowing the sequence of these amendments, then the Senate could turn \nto consideration of other amendments but the understanding is no votes \nwould occur before the hour of 7:40 p.m.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Right. Correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, will the vote \non my amendment be up or down--up or down on the amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would recommend that that be the case.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request, as so \nmodified? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require \nfrom the time allotted to me.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1446\n\n  (Purpose: To require the withholding of Federal highway funds if a \nState fails to provide that any minor in the State who operates a motor \n vehicle and has a blood alcohol concentration above a specified level \n shall be considered to be driving while intoxicated or driving under \n                       the influence of alcohol)\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

I ask unanimous consent that I might \nadd the able Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, one of the most important and pressing \nproblems on our Nation's highways is teenage drunk driving. Today I am \noffering an amendment that seeks to address this persistent, serious, \nand tragic problem. My amendment would require that the States adopt a \n``zero tolerance'' standard for drivers under the age of 21. If States \nfail to adopt a driving-while-intoxicated [DWI] or a driving-while-\nunder-the-influence [DUI] policy of .02 percent of blood-alcohol \ncontent for minors, they will lose 5 percent of their Federal highway \nconstruction funds in fiscal year 1998, and 10 percent of their Federal \nhighway funds every year thereafter.\n  My amendment builds upon one of the most important--and successful--\nFederal initiatives related to alcohol and minors--a 1984 requirement \nthat States adopt laws prohibiting the possession or purchase of \nalcohol by anyone younger than twenty-one years of age. Any State not \nin compliance by September 30, 1985, forfeited 5 percent of its Federal \nhighway construction funds for that year and 10 percent of its Federal \nhighway construction funds for each year of non-compliance thereafter. \nBefore enactment of this law, only 18 States had a 21-year-old minimum \ndrinking age. Today, all States have 21-year-old drinking age.\n  So that single action by the Congress and the States has \nsignificantly helped to reduce the carnage on our Nation's highways. \nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA] has \nestimated that the 21-year-old drinking age has saved 8,400 lives since \n1984. Further, in 1993, the last year for which statistics are \navailable, the 21-year-old drinking age requirement is estimated to \nhave saved $1.8 billion in economic costs to our society.\n  The Congress should now take the next step, and explicitly state, as \na matter of law, that minors are not allowed to drink and drive. My \namendment is simple and straight forward--since it is illegal for \nminors under the age of 21 to possess or purchase alcohol--that is, \npublicly possess or purchase alcohol--any level of consumption that is \ncoupled with driving should be treated, under the requirements of each \nState's laws, as driving while intoxicated.\n   [[Page S 8775]] This amendment sets the right example, and tells our \nNation's youth that drinking and driving is wrong; that it is a \nviolation of law; and that it will be appropriately punished according \nto the laws of each State. To oppose this amendment is to send exactly \nthe opposite message: namely, that it is acceptable and legal for a \nminor, who has been drinking, to drive a car, as long as that minor is \nunder the DWI or DUI blood alcohol level for an adult over the age of \n21.\n  In other words, my amendment corrects a glaring loophole in Federal \nlaw. Consider the example of a State that follows Federal law to the \nletter, and has made it illegal for a minor under 21 years of age to \npublicly possess or purchase alcohol. That same State, let us say, has \na typical driving-while-intoxicated standard of a blood alcohol level \nof 0.10 percent. A minor in that State could consume alcohol in a \nprivate residence, and then legally drive an automobile, as long as the \nminor's blood alcohol level registers below 0.10 percent.\n  Under my amendment, the message to that minor is clear: you cannot \ndrink and drive. Period. And, hopefully, this type of tough and \nabsolute requirement in the law will encourage our young people not to \ndrink at all.\n  As I explained, the passage of the Federal 21-year drinking age in \n1984 led to the enactment of that standard by all 50 States. It is my \nexpectation and hope that if my amendment were adopted, it would have \nsimilar results and increase the number of States that have zero \ntolerance laws from the current 24 States and the District of Columbia, \nto all of the States.\n  This zero tolerance amendment will save lives, and the life saved may \nbe yours. It will save lives in the single most vulnerable group of \ndrivers, namely teenagers. For the simple fact is that alcohol, when \nmixed with teenage driving habits, is a lethal combination.\n  First, let us examine the driving record of teenagers. As the chart \nto my left shows, of the percentage of drivers in fatal crashes who are \nexceeding the speed limit or traveling too fast for road conditions, \nteenagers are far more likely to be involved. This happens because \nteenagers are more likely, compared to older drivers, to engage in \nrisky driving practices. A teenager's lack of experience and over-\nconfidence can lead to accidents that often have fatal results, not \nonly to teenagers, but also to their passengers or to pedestrians or to \nindividuals in other automobiles, other innocent victims.\n  Teenagers are also involved in far more crashes than older drivers. \nAs the chart to my left shows, a much higher percentage of teenagers \nthan any other group is involved in police-reported crashes per million \nmiles traveled.\n  Adding alcohol to this situation can make it a deadly combination for \nteenagers and for other drivers on the road. Quite simply, teenagers \nwho drive while consuming alcohol are far more likely to speed, to be \ndistracted by other passengers, to disregard road signs and conditions, \nand to drive recklessly.\n  As a result, according to NHTSA, 40 percent of the traffic fatalities \nin the teenage group are alcohol related. Forty percent of the traffic \nfatalities involving drivers, ages 15 to 20, are alcohol related. The \nresult is carnage on our Nation's highways. Twenty-eight percent of 17- \nto 19-year-old drivers who were killed in 1993 crashes had high blood \nalcohol concentrations.\n  But our concern should not only be for the teenage drivers, but also \nfor the innocent, law-abiding victims who are killed and maimed by \nteenage drunk drivers. In 1994, approximately 2,200 people were killed \nbecause of minors who were drinking and driving, and of that group, \n1,600 were young people themselves.\n  Teenagers are generally inexperienced at both drinking and driving, \nso even small amounts of alcohol combined with driving can result in \nserious accidents and death. Approximately one-third of the 15- to 20-\nyear-old drinking drivers in fatal crashes had blood alcohol content \nlevels of less than 0.09 percent.\n  I would like to repeat that fact, as it underscores the importance of \nmy amendment: one-third of all fatal crashes involving teenage drunk \ndrivers involved a blood alcohol level below the DWI level used in most \nStates, and even below a 0.08 or 0.09 DUI standard of some States. In \nfact, teenage drivers with blood alcohol levels of 0.05 to 0.10 percent \nare far more likely than sober teenage drivers to be killed in single-\nvehicle crashes--18 times more likely for males, 54 times more likely \nfor females.\n  My amendment requires a ``zero tolerance'' policy, which is already \nthe law in 24 States and the District of Columbia. I am advised that \ntwo other States have enacted legislation to provide for zero \ntolerance, but the legislation has not yet been signed into law, but it \nis expected to be within the course of the next week or so. This \namendment recognizes that when teenagers drink, regardless of the \namount, they have significantly increased the probability that their \nbehavior will result in an accident, and a serious one at that. Perhaps \nfatal. My amendment recognizes that teenagers and alcohol--any amount \nof alcohol--is a dangerous, and often lethal, combination. We must be \nconsistent, and condemn any level of drinking and driving by minors. To \ndo anything less is to condone the illegal use of alcohol by minors.\n  The record shows that zero tolerance saves lives. As I have stated, \n24 States have already enacted the zero-tolerance law which is called \nfor in my amendment and it has proved to be very effective.\n  In Maine, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and New Mexico, which have \nadopted zero tolerance laws, lower blood alcohol limits for minors \nresulted in a 34 percent decline in nighttime fatal crashes among \nyounger drivers. Various studies have shown that these zero-tolerance \nlaws can reduce fatal accidents, and they will reduce fatal accidents. \nA 1992 Federal study in Maryland found that car accidents involving \ndrivers under the age of 21 who had been drinking, declined eleven \npercent after the zero-tolerance law was adopted. Further, there was a \n50 percent drop in accidents in areas where the penalties were promoted \nwith a publicity campaign.\n  Whenever we lower the accident rate on our Nation's highways, we also \ndirectly lower costs to society. When someone is injured in a car \naccident, we all pay a price, either in the form of increased health \ninsurance premiums, or more directly through Medicaid and other forms \nof State and Federal government assistance. This important point should \nnot be ignored: At the very time that we are trying to lower the \ndeficit, we should not leave a loophole in Federal law that allows \nteenage drunk drivers to cause accidents that increase Federal health \nand income-support costs.\n  The abuse of alcohol continues to be one of the most pressing \nproblems of our society, and the consequences can be felt throughout \nour Nation--at home, at work, and in public places. While our society \nhas made great strides in recent years, we have barely begun to deal \nwith the problem. And there is no better place to start than with our \nNation's youth.\n  Our Nation's young people are encouraged and tempted to consume \nalcohol by the movies they see, by the TV commercials, by the magazines \nthey read, and by the huge flow of print advertisements for alcoholic \nbeverages.\n  But it is adults who must set the example for what is appropriate \nbehavior. And the adults are foremost the parents of these young \npeople. We have a responsibility to the Nation's youth to help prevent \ndrunk driving by adopting this amendment. We should take this positive \nstep--a step that involves clear and decisive action, and not just \nrhetoric--and help get teenage drunk drivers off the roads.\n  When it comes to substance abuse in this Nation, alcohol is our \nbiggest scourge. Almost 14 million Americans over 18 are alcoholics. \nAnother 1.3 million suffer alcohol dependency. Overall, close to 8 \npercent of adults have a problem with liquor, costing the economy an \nestimated $100 billion every year in lost productivity and in health \ncare costs.\n  So the very least we can do as a Nation that purports to care about \nthe health, safety, and well-being of its people is to try to nip this \nalcohol plague in the bud by discouraging the early drinking that often \nresults in later addiction or alcohol dependency.\n  We have heard a lot of debate during consideration of this \nlegislation about personal freedoms and States rights. But if we, who \nclaim to be national [[Page S 8776]] leaders, decline to try to set \neven bare minimum standards and guidelines for behavior which is \ndangerous, destructive, and unacceptable for our young people, why have \nwe chosen national public service as a vocation in the first place? At \nthe very least, we should not abdicate our leadership role when it \ncomes to our Nation's most precious resource, its young people. If we \ndo not have the courage to take a stand on this most obvious of \nissues--drunk driving by minors--we will have surely failed, not only \nin our official capacity, but also in a larger moral sense as well.\n  I commend President Clinton for speaking out on this matter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter transmitted to me today signed \nby the President, and also other materials that are relevant to the \nsubject about which I have been speaking, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, June 21, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Robert: Drinking and driving by young people is one of \n     the nation's most serious threats to public health and public \n     safety. I am deeply concerned about this ongoing tragedy that \n     kills thousands of young people every year. It's against the \n     law for young people to drink. It should be against the law \n     for young people to drink and drive.\n       As you know, earlier this month, I called on Congress to \n     make Zero Tolerance the law of the land. I support your \n     amendment to the National Highway System Designation Act, \n     which would achieve this goal.\n       A decade ago, we decided as a nation that the minimum \n     drinking age should be 21. In 1984, President Reagan signed \n     bipartisan legislation to achieve this goal, and today all 50 \n     states have enacted such laws. Our efforts are paying off--\n     drunk driving deaths among people under 21 have been cut in \n     half since 1984.\n       But we must do more. Twenty-four states and the nation's \n     capital have enacted Zero Tolerance laws that consider a \n     driver under age 21 to be ``driving while impaired'' after \n     just one full drink of alcohol. These laws work--alcohol-\n     related crashes involving teenage drivers are down as much as \n     10-20 percent in those states. If all states had such laws, \n     hundreds more lives could be saved and thousands of injuries \n     could be prevented.\n       I commend your efforts today, and I urge the Senate to pass \n     your amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Clinton.\n                                                                    ____\n\n     From Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety.\n     Re zero tolerance for youth fact sheet.\n\n       Federal law (the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984) \n     requires every state to make purchase or public possession of \n     alcoholic beverages by those under age 21 illegal, or the \n     state loses a portion of its federal highway funds. As a \n     result, all states passed laws making 21 the legal drinking \n     age.\n       The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) \n     credits increases in the legal drinking age with preventing \n     close to 1,000 traffic deaths a year. (Public Health Reports \n     Nov-Dec 1994, Hingson, Heeren and Winter)\n       As of April 1994, 29 states and DC passed lower blood \n     alcohol concentration laws for youthful drivers. 26 states \n     and DC have zero tolerance (.00, .01 or .02) laws.\n       Youths have a lower tolerance for alcohol than adults and \n     their driving is impaired with any consumption.\n       Motor vehicle crash injuries are the leading single cause \n     of all injury-related youth fatalities, followed by homicide; \n     In 1993, 5,905 youths age 15-20 died in motor vehicle \n     crashes. 2,364 of those deaths were alcohol-related.\n       The National Institute on Drug Abuse reports that almost \n     one-third of high school seniors binge drink.\n       A 1994 study published in the November-December issue of \n     Public Health Reports comparing 12 states with lower \n     tolerance laws for youth to neighboring states without such \n     laws showed that zero tolerance laws are likely to reduce \n     youth fatalities significantly whereas lower tolerance laws \n     (.04 or .06) do not.\n       A comparison of drivers involved in single vehicle fatal \n     crashes revealed that each .02 percent increase in blood \n     alcohol concentration nearly doubled the risk of fatal crash \n     involvement for all drivers. (Public Health Reports)\n       According to NHTSA seven percent of licensed drivers are \n     ages 15-20. But 15 percent of drivers in fatal crashes are \n     between the ages of 15 and 20, and 21 percent of deaths in \n     crashes involve a driver of that age.\n       A study of the first four states to have reduced legal \n     blood alcohol concentration for youths, comparing them to \n     four neighboring states which did not reduce youth legal BAC \n     revealed a 34 percent decline in night fatal crashes among \n     adolescents in those states with reduced legal BAC for \n     youths.\n       Teen drivers are inexperienced. They are more likely to \n     speed and take other risks on the road. Their inexperience \n     and risk taking combined with impairment from alcohol \n     consumption markedly increase their chances for crashes.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I urge the Senate to adopt my amendment. I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Byrd's \namendment to the national highway system bill relating to zero \ntolerance for under-age drivers.\n  In 1984, I sponsored legislation that required States to enact laws \nmaking it illegal for anyone under the age of 21 to purchase and \npublicly possess alcoholic beverages.\n  I sponsored this legislation for one simple reason--our children were \ndying on our highways. And they were dying for the sake of a drink.\n  Studies have shown that alcohol--even at very low levels--can cause \nyoung people to lose their judgment and behave without regard to the \nrisks of driving at about twice the rate of drivers 21 or older.\n  Mr. President, since the national 21 drinking age was enacted \nnationally, 9 thousand lives have been saved.\n  And since 1975, when States first started enacting laws like this one \nlocally, as estimated 10,000 lives and over $30 billion in economic \ncosts have been saved.\n  In 1993 alone, 2,364 youths--young people between 15 and 20 years \nold--died in alcohol-related crashes.\n  And 23 percent of the 15- to 20-year-old drivers who were involved in \nthese fatal crashes had some alcohol in their blood.\n  So how do we keep our children from killing themselves when studies \nshow that over 95 percent of American adolescents will have \nexperimented with alcohol by the time they are seniors in high school?\n  I believe Senator Byrd's amendment can help us do just that.\n  Mr. President, there is mounting evidence which demonstrates that \nblood alcohol concentration levels as low as .015 can impair a person's \nability to make the kind of judgments needed to operate a motor vehicle \nsafely.\n  And as I indicated before, the evidence is clear: young drinking \ndrivers behave differently from older drinking drivers. For young \npeople, more than adults, alcohol--even at very low levels--may cause \nthem to lose judgment and behave without regard to the inherent risks \nof driving at about twice the rate of drivers 21 years or older.\n  But despite the evidence, many States still use the same standards to \ndetermine if a young person is under the influence as they apply to \nolder drivers.\n  That does not make sense.\n  At present 24 States and the District of Columbia have laws which \nallow zero tolerance for those under 21 who are caught drinking and \ndriving.\n  These laws consider young drivers in violation the law if they are \ncaught with a .02 BAC level or more. A .02 or .01 BAC level is \nconsidered zero tolerance given the present level of technology of \nalcohol breath-testing devices.\n  There are an additional eight States that have laws which set zero \ntolerance for drivers less than 18--or have laws that set lower \nallowable BAC levels for underage drivers.\n  A Maryland study showed a 21-percent reduction in alcohol-related \ntraffic accidents involving youth under the age of 21 after it enacted \nits .02 BAC law for younger drivers. When Maryland combined the .02 BAC \nlaw with a public information campaign, alcohol-related traffic \naccidents involving youth under the age of 21 dropped by 50 percent.\n  These are impressive statistics. They demonstrate the kind of impact \nthat Senator Byrd's amendment will have on the safety of the American \npublic, particularly young Americans.\n  The human tragedy of teenage drunk driving is measured in the \nfunerals of too many bright and promising young people who made the \nfatal decision to drink and drive--and too many funerals of law-abiding \ncitizens who were victimized by drunk drivers. [[Page S 8777]] \n  The national 21 minimum drinking age was a step in the right \ndirection. We need to keep going. The Byrd amendment does that. It will \nsave lives--young lives.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the Byrd amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the distinguished Senator from Montana \nand I have conferred as managers. We see no one who wishes to speak at \nthis time on the Byrd amendment. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the time remaining on the Byrd amendment be 20 minutes, and that \nit be equally divided between the Senator from West Virginia and the \nmanagers of the bill.\n  Then the Senate would now proceed to the amendment of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I will not \nobject, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1445\n\n(Purpose: To require the transfer of certain Federal highway funds to a \n    State highway safety program if a State fails to prohibit open \n    containers of alcoholic beverages and consumption of alcoholic \n           beverages in the passenger area of motor vehicles)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, my understanding of the legislative \ncircumstances are that we have set aside the amendment offered by the \nSenator from West Virginia, in which case I send an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1445.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent further reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I listened with interest to my \ncolleague, the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, and I have \nadded my name as a cosponsor to his amendment. I think it is good \nlegislation. I think it will save lives. I am pleased to support him \nand I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will vote for the \nlegislation he has offered.\n  I offer an amendment dealing with the same subject, the subject of \ndrinking and driving. My amendment deals with the subject of open \ncontainers of alcohol in vehicles.\n  Sunday was Father's Day in our country, a day that many remembered \nfondly with our families. Sunday was also a day in which eight people \nwere killed on a California highway, two of them toddlers, four of them \nchildren, two adults: a 2-month-old named Antonia, a 2-year-old named \nCarina, a 3-year-old named Suleima, a 9-year-old named Jairo.\n  These children were in a car last Sunday on a California highway. I \nread about it Monday morning. A drunk driver came down the highway and \ncut into the back of the car that these children were in at a high rate \nof speed, apparently, in a reckless manner, according to the newspaper \naccounts. The car began to flip and became a fireball. These six \nchildren died on Father's Day in that accident.\n  The person that pulled in apparently was driving a pickup truck, \naccording to the newspaper accounts, and was drunk. The driver of the \ntruck had been convicted previously of drunk driving and was driving \ndrunk on Father's Day without a license, and kills six children and two \nadults.\n  I point this out only because I read about it Monday morning and \nunderstood, again, the horror of it. It happens every day, all day, all \nacross this country. Every 30 minutes someone else gets a telephone \ncall or a knock on the door saying, ``Your loved one has been killed \nbecause someone in this country was driving drunk.''\n  I received a telephone call at 10:30 in the evening telling me that \nmy mother had been killed in a drunk driving accident by a fellow who \nwas fleeing from the police. Never in my life will I forget that \ntelephone call and how I felt about it. I had received calls before. My \nsister's son, a pizza delivery boy, was also killed. That call came \nlate at night. My cousin's son was killed a couple of weeks ago, the \nweekend of his high school graduation. He did not cross the stage \nbecause he was in a car that was hit by a train, driven, apparently, by \nsomeone who also had been drinking.\n  Everyone understands the pain and the agony of losing friends, \nacquaintances, and loved ones in accidents on America's roads. And all \ntoo often we understand the pain of losing someone in an accident that \nis caused by someone, also, who drank.\n  This is not some mysterious disease for which we do not understand \nthe cure. We understand what causes these deaths and we understand how \nto stop it. People who drink and drive commit murder in this country. \nWe ought not just blithely ignore it any longer.\n  I do not think my colleagues, know that according to the Department \nof Transportation, there are six States in America where you can get \nbehind the wheel of your car, use your right hand to put the key in the \nignition, and close your left hand over the bottleneck of a bottle of \nwhiskey and drive [[Page S 8778]] on down the road and drink your \nwhiskey and be perfectly legal. It is not a problem, because it is not \nagainst the law to be able to drink and drive in those States. In over \nhalf the States in this country, if the driver cannot drink, the rest \nof the folks in the car can have a party and pass the bottle around as \nthey drive down the street.\n  My own view about drinking and driving in this country is that we \nought to decide to separate the act of drinking from the act of \ndriving.\n  I had hoped one day that this Senate will decide to develop an \nattitude about drinking and driving like the Europeans have. In most \nEuropean countries, if you go out and see others out at a bar \nsomeplace, or a pub, you can be sure that one person out of those five \nor six people that are together is not drinking.\n  Why? Because they understand the penalties are far too severe to risk \ngetting picked up for drunk driving. You just do not dare chance it. \nMost of those countries will not tolerate it. You do not even want to \nthink about the penalty for drunk driving. In our country, all too \noften, it is a slap on the wrist, and then back to the road.\n  I was in a car with my late daughter that was hit by a driver so \ndrunk he could not drive after he hit us. He totaled our car. \nFortunately, neither of us were hurt. After hitting our car he kept \ndriving and drove about half a block more into a streetlight, where his \ncar stopped. He was too drunk to get out of the car.\n  Of course, he was not hurt because most often in those accidents it \nis the other people who are killed. The people who are drunk, by and \nlarge, do not get hurt very often.\n  But the point is, we all understand what is happening on our roads. \nIt is carnage on America's roads.\n  Now, I do not want to go on a vacation and I do not want the Senator \nfrom West Virginia or the Senator from Montana to go on vacation, and \ndrive from one State line to another State and discover that on the \npublic roads in this next State that you are driving into, built in \npart with Federal funds, we have folks driving toward us who are able \nto drink in the car. Or we have folks driving toward us with four or \nfive other people in the car, having a party, and that State finds that \nit is fine.\n  It is not fine with me. When we spend the billions of dollars to \ninvest in our road system in this country, we ought to decide it is a \nnational purpose to tell the people in this country that it does not \nmatter which line you have crossed, what State you are moving through, \nin this country we made a decision, you shall not have open containers \nof alcohol in your car, in your vehicle. It is a national decision. \nThis is a national problem.\n  My amendment, Madam President, is fairly simple. My amendment would \nrequire the States in this country to enact open container laws that \nprohibit open containers in vehicles.\n  If a State does not comply within 2 years, then 1.5 percent of its \nFederal highway construction funds would be transferred to the State's \nallocation amount for highway safety programs. It does not take the \nmoney away from the State. It simply does what we have done previously \nin the seatbelt laws and says if you do not conform, then 1.5 percent \nmoves from the construction program over to the highway safety program.\n  If the State does not comply after September 30, 1998, then 3 percent \nof the money would be transferred to the safety program.\n  This amendment utilizes the identical incentives to encourage States \nto prohibit open containers of alcohol as it does on the seatbelt \nissue.\n  I know we will likely hear from some who come to this Chamber later \n100 reasons why this should not be done. We have always heard reasons \nwhy we should not interfere.\n  This country must soon wake up and decide, as other countries already \nhave in many parts of the world, to tell people who drive drunk that \nthey are murdering people on our highways and we will no longer permit \nit. We think there should be certain sanctions, tough sanctions, tough \npunishment for people who drive drunk. I am suggesting that no State \nshould be able to tell the citizens in its State or elsewhere that it \nis fine, when you enter our State line, to drink and drive. Or it is \nfine to have alcohol in the car and have other people drinking. At \nleast, it is not fine with me.\n  We are heading, now, toward the Fourth of July weekend. It is one of \nthe deadliest alcohol-related traffic holidays in our Nation. That is \nthe case every single year. Madam President, 55 percent of the total \ntraffic fatalities on July 4, 1993, the last year for which we have \nstatistics, were alcohol related.\n  From 1982 to 1993--I came to the Congress in 1981; the person in the \nchair from Maine I suspect came in 1980 or 1982, somewhere in that \nperiod, to the U.S. House of Representatives--since that time, roughly \n266,000 Americans have been killed in alcohol-related traffic \naccidents; 266,000 Americans in an 11-year period. It ought not \ncontinue. We ought to stop it and we ought to decide to have the \ncourage as a Congress to tell everybody in this country do not even \nthink about driving if you are drinking. Alcohol and driving do not mix \nand will not be tolerated anywhere in this country--anywhere in this \ncountry.\n  If the Congress would this evening enact the legislation I am \nproposing, we would, I think, send a signal in this country that we \nintend to be tough with respect to this issue. Madam President, 26 \nStates do not have open container laws at the present time, according \nto the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. I mentioned that \nsix States do not have laws prohibiting drinking and driving at the \nsame time by drivers. I think there is a way for us to speak to that, \nand I hope we will.\n  There are as many reasons as there are people around here to find \nthem that we should not do this. There are 266,000 reasons, 266,000 \ndead Americans in the last 11 years, whose memory we probably ought to \nhonor today by passing this legislation. I cannot claim how many \nAmericans we will save, how many lives we will save if we do the right \nthing in our country and tell people you cannot drink and drive; you \ncannot have open containers in your vehicle. But I know in my heart we \nare talking about tens of thousands of people, year after year, who \nwill not lose their lives because someone was driving drunk.\n  There are at least six children in a morgue tonight who died on \nFather's Day who should not have died: Carina, Antonia, Suleima, \nFidela, Jairo, and Omar. I name only six because it would take too long \nto name the number of people who died from alcohol-related accidents \nsince Sunday, because it is every half hour, every hour of every day \nsomeone is killed because of a drunk driver. We can stop it if we will \ndecide to exhibit the courage to stand up on a national basis and say \nthis is our national message: Do not drink and drive in this country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I would like to make a couple of \ncomments on the amendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia.\n  I first want to commend the Senator from West Virginia. This is a \nvery good amendment. It goes to the heart of the problem of teenage \ndrinking. I commend him for offering this amendment. This amendment \nwill help us reduce some of the slaughter on our Nation's highways, \nparticularly the tragic deaths of teenagers.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I am \nvery pleased to have him as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator. I might say to the Senator, we are \nvery proud in Montana, particularly in Yellowstone County, of a program \ncalled It's Your Choice. It is sponsored by the Yellowstone County \ncommissioners who provide the funding. A fellow named Dick Taylor, who \nis the head of the former ambulance service in Yellowstone County, saw \nso many deaths he finally said, ``I need to do something about all \nthis, particularly the deaths of teenagers.'' This program, It's Your \nChoice simulates crashes, including the police and ambulances coming to \nthe scene of an accident. It is all realistically reenacted in high \nschools in Billings, MT.\n  As a consequence, the number of teenage deaths attributable to \nalcohol in traffic accidents has been reduced. Also the State of \nMontana has recently passed legislation providing the blood alcohol \ncontent cannot be more than .02 percent for teenagers.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is leading the effort for a national \n.02 alcohol content for youthful drivers, and I commend the Senator for \nhis efforts.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator, and I also thank the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I join my distinguished colleague from \nMontana in commending my distinguished colleague from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be temporarily laid aside so I might be able to call up \nanother amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \npending amendment is set aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1447\n\n    (Purpose: To strike the section repealing restrictions on toll \n                              facilities)\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for himself and Mr. \n     McConnell, proposes an amendment numbered 1447.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 28, strike line 15 and all that follows \n     through page 29, line 14.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this amendment is offered on behalf of \nmyself, as well as Senator McConnell. As I am sure my colleagues know, \nmany of us are very pleased with the progress on this bill. It is a \nvital step in developing a national transportation strategy. It makes \nimportant gains in reducing some of the regulatory burden in our \nStates, something we are all interested in doing.\n  But there is one item here in this bill which concerns me regarding \ntolls. The amendment I am offering today is very simple. It seeks to \nmaintain current law which prohibits States from converting toll-free \ninterstate highways into toll roads.\n  Let me explain why this is needed. Current law says States cannot put \ntolls on an interstate highway unless it was built without using \nFederal funds. Current law also allows States a little more flexibility \non noninterstate highways. They can impose tolls on those roads, but \nonly if it is done in conjunction with major repair or reconstruction.\n  The theory is you should get something for your money. Unfortunately, \nthe language in the bill removes both of these restrictions. The bill \nwould allow States to place tolls on any Federal highway, including the \ninterstate highway system, regardless of whether or not the road is \nundergoing repair work.\n  I think that is a mistake. My amendment strikes this language from \nthe bill. States planning major repairs to interstate highways can \nstill place a toll on that road and use the revenue to pay for the \nrepairs. That makes sense. Once a State pays for the repairs using \ntolls, further toll revenues can be used for other transportation \npurposes.\n  My amendment would prevent States from using toll roads as cash cows; \nthat is, putting tolls on the road just to generate revenue. Drivers \nalready pay a pretty steep gasoline tax in most States, and combined \nwith the Federal-State portion it gets pretty high. I do not think we \nneed yet another tax on top of that.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters supporting the amendment from \nthe American Trucking Association, the Highway Users Federation, and \nthe National Association of Truck Stop Operators be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         International Brotherhood\n\n\n                                                 of Teamsters,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: The International Brotherhood of Teamsters \n     urges you to support the effort by Senators Baucus and \n     McConnell to strike section 117 of the National Highway \n     System Bill (S. 440). Section 117 would allow states to \n     impose tolls on interstate highways.\n       Section 117 is an unnecessary tax increase on the trucking \n     industry and the motoring public. Highway users already pay \n     millions of dollars in taxes annually into the Highway Trust \n     Fund for the construction and repair of interstate highways. \n     Consequently, passage of Section 117 would put the Senate on \n     record as supporting the ``double taxation'' of highway \n     users. Passage of this additional highway tax will place an \n     economic burden on both the transportation and tourism \n     industries. We encourage you to vote to strike Section 117.\n       We also encourage you to vote for the amendment likely to \n     be offered by Senator Exon that would establish standards for \n     truck trailer lengths under the NAFTA. We support the \n     Senator's proposal to limit single trailer lengths to fifty \n     three feet. It is imperative that U.S. highway safety \n     standards are not compromised during negotiations to \n     establish common truck safety standards under the NAFTA. \n     Senator Exon's proposal is a critically important step in \n     ensuring that we preserve the highest highway safety \n     standards possible in North America.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         William W. Hamilton, Jr.,\n     Governmental Affairs Department.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                     Highway Users Federation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Baucus: The Majority Leader moved to \n     consideration of S. 440, the ``National Highway System \n     Designation Act of 1995,'' this afternoon. With fewer than 50 \n     congressional working days remaining before the September 30 \n     NHS funding deadline, prompt action on this measure is \n     urgently needed. We want to inform you of our views on two \n     specific amendments that may be offered during floor \n     consideration of S. 440.\n       Tolls--we understand Senators Baucus and McConnell will \n     offer an amendment to strike the section of S. 440 that would \n     allow tolls to be placed on existing, free Interstate \n     highways, We strongly support the Baucus/McConnell amendment. \n     The prohibition against tolls on Interstate highways has \n     existed for 40 years. Nearly 100% of the Interstate System is \n     completed and open to traffic, paid for by highway users. To \n     allow tolls now on existing, free Interstates is akin to \n     charging a homeowner rent. Highway users have paid for \n     construction of the Interstates and continue to pay for \n     Interstate maintenance through Federal and state user fees. \n     In addition, tolls on Interstate highways would seriously \n     restrict the flow of interstate commerce and the mobility \n     that American families and businesses depend on and have come \n     to expect.\n       Amtrak--we understand Senator Roth may offer an amendment \n     to make Amtrak routes eligible to receive Federal highway \n     funds. We would strongly oppose the Roth amendment. Amtrak \n     carries just three-tenths of one percent (0.3%) of all \n     intercity passenger miles travelled and no freight. By \n     contrast highways carry over 80% of intercity passenger miles \n     and almost 80% of the dollar volume of all freight moved in \n     the U.S. With a $290 billion backlog of road and bridge [[Page S \n     8780]] needs, it makes no sense to subsidize passenger rail \n     service with our limited highway dollars.\n       The NHS is vital to America's economic and defense needs. \n     We hope the bill approved by the Senate will garner the \n     broad, bipartisan support that this important program \n     deserves.\n           Sincerely,\n     Thomas J. Donohue,\n       President & CEO, American Trucking Associations, Inc.\n     William D. Fay,\n       President, Highway Users Federation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                  NATSO, Inc.,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, June 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Baucus: On behalf of NATSO, Inc., the \n     professional and legislative representative of America's \n     travel plaza and truckstop industry, I am writing to express \n     grave concerns about a provision in S. 440 that would allow \n     states to establish tolls on the Interstate highway system. I \n     understand that you and Senator McConnell are offering an \n     amendment to delete this provision, and the eight NATSO \n     member locations in Montana as well as the more than 1,070 \n     member locations nationwide strongly support your efforts.\n       NATSO opposes this provision for several reasons. First, \n     highway users have already paid for the Interstate system. \n     Every time fuel is purchased, motorists pay a tax into the \n     highway trust fund that goes to support the Interstate \n     system. Allowing the states the opportunity to collect tolls \n     from Interstate travelers is nothing more than a new tax on \n     the highway user. The Interstate traveler should not be \n     forced to pay again for something already purchased.\n       Also, this provision will undoubtedly shift traffic from \n     Interstate highways, proven to be the safest and most \n     efficient, to secondary roads that have not been designed to \n     handle large volumes of traffic. This proposal will increase \n     congestion and traffic accidents. It will also devastate the \n     truckstops, travel plazas and thousands of other roadside \n     businesses that provide goods and services to the Interstate \n     traveler.\n       Finally, if more transportation funds are needed, we \n     believe that Congress should spend down the $19.6 billion \n     languishing in the highway trust fund.

We will gladly provide \n     assistance to you in your efforts to pass this amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  W. Dewey Clower,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the managers are going to accept this. I \nsee the presence of the cosponsor of the amendment on the floor. \nFollowing his remarks, I will then speak to the pending amendment.\n  So I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I thank my friend from Virginia, and \nI want to commend the Senator from Montana for the amendment he has \noffered of which I am the principal cosponsor.\n  I think he has adequately described the rationale for the amendment. \nEssentially, it is that we do not want the States to turn the \ninterstate system into a way to raise revenue for themselves. That is \nnot the basis upon which the Interstate Highway System was constructed.\n  This amendment would guarantee that could not happen. I am proud to \nbe the principal cosponsor of this amendment.\n  Madam President, this amendment would strike section 117 of this \nbill. The provision I would like to remove is one that repeals the \nprohibition against States imposing tolls in Federal-aid highways, \nincluding the Interstate System.\n  To put it more simply, my amendment continues the ban on State \ntolling of federally built highways. Or to say it even more plainly, if \nyou gave at the office, you should not have to give again on the road.\n  The Interstate System had helped to open up this vast country, \nremoving all limitations on mobility. However, if section 117 is not \nremoved from the bill, it could potentially turn our Interstate System \ninto a heavily milked cash cow, where States squeeze additional dollars \nout of road that have already been paid for, through the excise tax on \ngasoline.\n  From sea to shinning sea, we could find our Federal highways \ntransformed into elongated parking lots, bisected at regular intervals \nby toll plazas.\n  For the past 39 years, highway users have contributed to the highway \ntrust fund, perhaps begrudgingly, but with the knowledge that these \nfunds would be used for the construction and upkeep of the Nation's \nhighway infrastructure. This national contract with highway users was \nestablish in 1956, with the Federal-Aid Highway Act. As we all know, 90 \npercent of trust fund revenues comes from the ever-increasing excise \ntax on gasoline. But it is fed by other revenue sources as well, \nincluding a sales tax on tires, trucks, and buses, as well as taxes on \ntruck usage.\n  In short, Madam President, if it moves on a highway, we have already \ntaxed it--and we've taxed the gasoline it runs on. America's drivers \nare not exactly suffering from a dearth of taxes and user fees.\n  Since 1956, when the highway trust fund was first established, \nAmerican motorists have contributed $278 billion in net revenue to the \nfund. In return, highway users have been afforded free access to the \nInterstate System, unencumbered by a gauntlet of toll plazas. Congress \nshould honor the contract it made with motorists--and eliminate the \nloophole contained in section 117.\n  My amendment will ensure that our Interstate System remains free from \nthe double taxation of tolls, which would disproportionately affect \npoorer Americans.\n  Aside from my strong opposition to the double taxation of highway \nusers, I also believe this toll provision is bad economic policy. It \ncould potentially ruin hundreds of small businesses that cater to \nhighways users. Should States decide to exact their pound of flesh at \nevery highway exit, communities and business will be severely harmed as \nthey are cut off from their customers.\n  As someone who has personally traveled thousands of miles on Kentucky \nroads, I am all too familiar with the impact of highway tolls. In \nKentucky, economic development adjacent to highways and parkways did \nnot occur until these roads became toll-free. Only then did businesses \nblossom to meet the needs of tired, hungry, and road-weary motorists.\n  Not only would many small businesses be crippled, but motorists and \ntruckers would no longer benefit from highly competitive roadside \nservices. Instead, users would essentially be forced to accept the \noverpriced gasoline and food concerns which would be given virtual \nmonopoly rights at tolling areas.\n  This provision will of course add to the cost of trucking, travel, \nand commerce--all of which would be reflected in bottom-line prices at \nthe grocery store and elsewhere.\n  To suggest that tolls are paid only by highway users is a gross \neconomic oversimplification. Toll roads add to the cost of any goods \nshipped cross-country. These same costs will hit the tourist industry \nof every State hard, as families are forced to stay closer to home or \nforego travel altogether.\n  I know that, in Kentucky, tourism would be substantially reduced by \nState tolling of Federal highways, for our State is a crossroads for \ninterstate travel.\n  Ever since the 1950's, when the United States embarked on its mission \nof establishing the Dwight D. Eisenhower Interstate Highway System, \nthese roads were meant to be toll-free. If toll booths were suddenly \nerected on Federal highways, traffic would snarl up, thereby adding to \nthe cost and travel time. Anybody who has traveled a toll road can tell \nyou that exists are not always located at every crossroad.\n  In fact, on many toll roads, it is not uncommon for exits to be \nseparated by 20 miles or more. If tolls are permitted on Federal \nhighways, the communities and businesses that have developed around \nhighway access points could be cut off. The network of roads, exits, \nand intersections are a vital part of the national highway contract. It \nis unacceptable--and potentially disastrous, to change the terms of our \nFederal agreement.\n  Finally, tolls could result in an increase in air pollution. It is \nwidely accepted that vehicles operate more efficiently at steady \nspeeds. Long lines and stop-and-go traffic caused by toll plazas will \nneedlessly pump greater amounts of pollution into the atmosphere.\n\n[[Page S 8781]]\n\n  We are told that proponents of toll roads are developing new, high-\ntechnology methods of collecting tolls--without the safety, congestion, \nand pollution problems caused by toll roads. I do not know whether such \nan idea should be met with admiration or alarm. The notion that the \nGovernment could stick huge barcodes on every vehicle, which then would \nbe read by high-speed laser scanners at checkpoints, does not exactly \nelicit cheers of enthusiasm for the advances of modern technology.\n  Frankly, whether a toll is taken by a live human being or a high-\ntechnology scanner is a bit like making a distinction between holding \nup a bank in person or embezzling funds via computer. In either case, \nthe loss of funds is felt just as acutely.\n  Madam President, I am not alone in this view. This proposal is also \nstrongly opposed by motorists. In fact, a 1994 poll taken by Triple-A \nfound that fully two-thirds of its members opposed this toll idea. I \nhave letters from both the Louisville and Lexington chapters of Triple-\nA opposing this measure.\n  Madam President, I appreciate the arguments of toll proponents that \nthere is a real need to insure funding for our infrastructure needs. I \ndo not think there is a Member in the Senate who does not believe our \ntransportation infrastructure is of the utmost importance to national \ncommerce and competitiveness.\n  However, this toll provision is an underhanded money grab that breaks \nthe contract with motorists established through the Intrastate System. \nThis single provision will cripple our ability to transport goods in a \ntimely and cost-effective fashion.\n  There are other ways to fund infrastructure development that will not \nrequire taxing motorists again for something they have already paid \nfor. Congress needs to provide for the full funding of ISTEA and put an \nend to the gas tax diversion. The $9 billion in gas tax revenue that \nhas been diverted elsewhere in the budget would go a long way toward \nimproving the condition of our roads, bridges, and tunnels.\n  America has paid for these roads. Let Americans use them--without \nadded, hidden costs. Let us strike section 117 out of the bill, and \nprotect motorists from new and ingenious ways of extracting more \nrevenue from our Federal Highway System.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that several letters from \nvarious groups in support of the amendment that Senator Baucus and \nmyself have offered be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              American Automobile Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of AAA's 37 million \n     members, I urge you to introduce an amendment to S. 440, The \n     National Highway System Designation Act of 1995, that would \n     repeal the provisions allowing tolling of existing highways.\n       ``The American Automobile Association is against toll roads \n     as a general principle . . . believing all highway facilities \n     should be toll-free. AAA particularly objects to the \n     imposition of tolls on any existing toll-free highway . . . \n     .'' (AAA Policies, April 1995-96)\n       Our opposition to tolls is longstanding:\n       We must have roads suitable and adequate for the movement \n     of modern motor traffic with safety. There must be multiple-\n     lane highways with opposing traffic streams divided. They \n     must be free and not toll roads. . . .

Mitch McConnell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the 118,000 AAA \n     members we serve in central and eastern Kentucky, AAA Blue \n     Grass/Kentucky supports S. 440 which would establish a \n     National Highway System. However, we strongly object to any \n     toll provision in the bill.\n       We oppose a toll provision for several reasons:\n       Excessive cost.--Historically, toll-free roads have cost \n     the motorist about one cent per mile; new toll roads will \n     cost about 10 cents per mile. Admittedly, all new road \n     construction is going to be more expensive, but toll roads \n     will probably cost 3 to 4 times as much as toll-free roads \n     because of bond interest charges and toll collection costs.\n       Double taxation.--If gas taxes are used to construct new \n     toll roads, motorists will pay twice--once at the pump, and \n     once at the toll booth.\n       Breach of Trust.--Highway users have paid literally \n     hundreds of billions of dollars to construct the nation's \n     highway system; they should not now be charged a toll to use \n     it.\n       Collection Inefficiency.--Currently 10-20% of toll revenues \n     are needed for the collection process while only one percent \n     of motor fuel taxes are devoted for that purpose.\n       Inconvenient Access.--Toll roads often provide few \n     entrances and exits in order to minimize the number and \n     therefore the costs of toll personnel. Users can't get off \n     the road at convenient places and people in small communities \n     cannot use toll roads built right next to them.\n       Motorist Irritation and Delay.--Congestion at toll plazas \n     often causes long lines of cars, much to the consternation of \n     the motoring public.\n       Closed System Economics.--Toll road users are locked into \n     higher-price gas stations, food establishments and other \n     services.\n       Toll facilities are self-perpetuating.--Agreements to make \n     facilities toll-free after debt service is paid seldom are \n     implemented. For instance, there are still 4,700 miles of \n     toll roads, bridges and tunnels on the interstate system, \n     with little likelihood that many of these facilities will \n     become toll-free.\n       Neglect of the toll-free system.--Inevitably, construction \n     of toll roads will lead to toll-free roads not being built in \n     the same transportation corridors. Maintenance of free roads \n     parallel to toll roads may also suffer.\n       Undermining the Federal Highway Trust Fund.--Increased \n     tolls would weaken pressure on Congress and the \n     administration to spend the money in the Highway Trust Fund.\n       We appreciate your consideration of our views.\n           Regards,\n                                                      Kathy Gross,\n     Manager, Marketing.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 AAA Kentucky,\n\n                                                    June 15, 1995.\n     Hon. A.M. ``Mitch'' McConnell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: AAA Kentucky, serving over 300,000 \n     members in our state, strongly supports an amendment removing \n     the toll provision in S. 440, ``The National Highway System \n     Designation Act of 1995''. Our opposition to allowing tolls \n     on federally financed highways is rooted in four basic \n     beliefs:\n       The motorists we serve do not want tolls;\n       Tolls are economically regressive;\n       Tolls hurt travel and tourism;\n       Tolls on federally financed highways are an unfair form of \n     double taxation\n\n\n                      motorists do not want tolls\n\n       According to AAA's 1994 National Legislative Survey, two-\n     thirds of AAA members oppose imposing tolls on existing \n     interstates/highways to fund highway maintenance or \n     improvements. Locally, we are tabulating our most recent \n     legislative state survey and the results are running sixty-\n     eight percent against tolls as a method to increase revenues.\n\n\n                   tolls are economically regressive\n\n       According to the Congressional Budget Office, new toll \n     roads would impose per-car charges of 8 to 10 cents per mile \n     on travelers. This translates into an effective tax rate of \n     an additional $1.60 to $2.00 per gallon of gasoline used. In \n     addition, tolls are an inefficient form of taxation. For \n     instance 15 percent of toll revenue is needed just for tax \n     collection compared to only 1 percent of motor fuel taxes \n     being used for collection. These factors combined to \n     illustrate the point that tolls should be the last place we \n     look for additional revenue.\n\n\n                           tolls hurt travel\n\n       As a simple tenant of economics, the more expensive an \n     action becomes, the fewer people will take that action. Toll \n     roads illustrate this axiom by discouraging travel over the \n     tolled section of highways. For example, here in Kentucky the \n     Western Parkway was a toll highway until nine years ago, when \n     tolls were removed. In a conversation with a Kentucky State \n     Trooper, he said he felt that traffic has increased on the \n     road over 25 percent since the tolls were lifted. Similarly, \n     during peak travel times, congestion and delays at toll \n     booths also breed frustration and further discourage travel, \n     increase costs and harm the environment.\n\n\n                  tolls are a form of double taxation\n\n       The promise the Federal government makes to motorists every \n     time they pay the gas tax at the pump would be broken with \n     the introduction of tolls. Literally, America's motorists \n     have paid hundreds of billions [[Page S 8782]] of dollars to \n     construct and maintain the nation's highway system. To change \n     the rules now and ask them to pay again as they use the \n     system is clearly a form of double taxation.\n       For these reasons, AAA Kentucky strongly supports the \n     removal of the toll provision from S. 440. It is vital to \n     pass the NHS Bill as the earliest opportunity. However, while \n     it contains such provisions, AAA finds it unacceptable.\n       Thank you for your efforts on behalf of Kentucky's, and the \n     nation's, motorists.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Roger Boyd.\n     Director, Public Affairs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                        NATSO,\n\n                                                    June 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of NATSO, Inc., the \n     professional and legislative representative of America's \n     travel plaza and truckstop industry, I am writing to express \n     grave concerns about a provision in S. 440 that would allow \n     states to establish tolls on the Interstate highway system. I \n     understand that you and Senator Baucus are offering an \n     amendment to delete this provision, and the 32 NATSO member \n     locations in Kentucky as well as the more than 1,070 member \n     locations nationwide strongly support your efforts.\n       NATSO opposes this provision for several reasons. First, \n     highway users have already paid for the Interstate system. \n     Every time fuel is purchased, motorists pay a tax into the \n     highway trust fund that goes to support the Interstate \n     system. Allowing the states the opportunity to collect tolls \n     from Interstate travelers is nothing more than a new tax on \n     the highway user. The Interstate traveler should not be \n     forced to pay again for something already purchased.\n       Also, this provision will undoubtedly shift traffic from \n     Interstate highways, proven to be the safest and most \n     efficient, to secondary roads that have not been designed to \n     handle large volumes of traffic. This proposal will increase \n     congestion and traffic accidents. It will also devastate the \n     truckstops, travel plazas and thousands of other roadside \n     businesses that provide goods and services to the Interstate \n     traveler.\n       Finally, if more transportation funds are needed, we \n     believe that Congress should spend down the $19.6 billion \n     languishing in the highway trust fund. Instead of being used \n     for its intended purpose, the highway trust fund is currently \n     held hostage to make the federal deficit appear smaller. \n     Asking the highway user to pay more--at a time when tax money \n     already collected is not being spent--is wrong.\n       Again, NATSO strongly supports your amendment to delete \n     this toll provision from S. 440. We will gladly provide \n     assistance to you in your efforts to pass this amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  W. Dewey Clower,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                         International Brotherhood\n\n\n                                                 of Teamsters,\n\n                                                    June 21, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: The International Brotherhood of Teamsters \n     urges you to support the effort by Senators Baucus and \n     McConnell to strike section 117 of the National Highway \n     System Bill (S. 440). Section 117 would allow states to \n     impose tolls on interstate highways.\n       Section 117 is an unnecessary tax increase on the trucking \n     industry and the motoring public. Highway users already pay \n     millions of dollars in taxes annually into the Highway Trust \n     Fund for the construction and repair of interstate highways. \n     Consequently, passage of Section 117 would put the Senate on \n     record as supporting the ``double taxation'' of highway \n     users. Passage of this additional highway tax will place an \n     economic burden on both the transportation and tourism \n     industries. We encourage you to vote to strike Section 117.\n       We also encourage you to vote for the amendment likely to \n     be offered by Senator Exon that would establish standards for \n     truck trailer lengths under the NAFTA. We support the \n     Senator's proposal to limit single trailer lengths to fifty \n     three feet. It is imperative that U.S. highway safety \n     standards are not compromised during negotiations to \n     establish common truck safety standards under the NAFTA. \n     Senator Exon's proposal is a critically important step in \n     ensuring that we preserve the highest highway safety \n     standards possible in North America.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         William W. Hamilton, Jr.,\n                                   Governmenal Affairs Department.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I thank my friend from Virginia. I am \npleased that this amendment is going to be accepted.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, both sponsors of this amendment have been \nquite persuasive. There were concerns certainly on our side for a \nperiod of time. But that persuasiveness has carried the day, since we \nare prepared to accept this. It I think goes back to the original \nsituation which ensures that the National Highway System provides for \nthe free flow of commerce. That was the objective of both of the \nsponsors.\n  I might also add that during the course of the discussions in the \nconsideration of other amendments on this bill, I find the truckers \nhave been very responsible in the area of supporting the continuation \nof the speed limit objective that I had and will continue to have, and \nalso in objecting to a differential between cars and trucks. I likewise \noppose any differential.\n  So while criticism is often directed toward them, I think certainly \nin the consideration of this bill in the three areas, they come up in a \nvery responsible manner.\n  So if the distinguished Senator from Montana wishes, I believe the \njunior Senator from Montana wishes to be added as a cosponsor, the \nPresiding Officer. I ask unanimous consent on behalf both Senator \nBaucus and myself, that the junior Senator, Senator Burns be added as a \ncosponsor of this measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there further debate? If not, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment of the Senator from Montana.\n  The amendment (No. 1447) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could get the attention of my \ncomanager, there may be some amendments. We are still working on a list \nof amendments that we might clear at any time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, my understanding is that time remaining on \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia is 20 minutes \nequally divided. What is the time remaining on the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from North Dakota?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 3 minutes \nand 30 seconds. The manager in opposition has 12 minutes and 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask that the time on the amendment \noffered by the Senator from West Virginia be yielded in its entirety, \nand that 10 minutes of that be transferred to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield myself such time as I may consume on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1445\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, at 7:40 we begin a series of three votes, \none of which will be on the amendment I offered. My amendment is one \nthat, again, would establish a national standard to say that States \nshall enact statutes that call for the prohibition of open containers \nof alcohol in vehicles. My amendment is not likely to attract \nsufficient votes to pass, I am guessing, if history is a lesson here.\n  Some will come to the Chamber and decide, ``Well, my State does not \nhave the prohibition for open containers, so I don't want to provide \nany leadership in Washington.'' Others will say, ``I do not think \nWashington ought to be telling anybody anything, so I will vote against \nit.''\n  So we have a circumstance where we have a bill described by the \nmanagers to have a national strategy on transportation. But I must say \nthat any bill [[Page S 8783]] that describes itself as a bill of \nnational strategy that fails to provide the leadership necessary to \nsend a message to this country that drinking and driving do not mix is \na bill that falls far short on national strategy. It is not much of a \nstrategy, in my judgment.\n  We now have in this country a requirement that you wear seatbelts. \nApparently the message would be, if my amendment does not pass, ``Go \nahead and get in the car, buckle up, and then go ahead and take a swill \nof bourbon.'' It is fine with some. They do not mind if you drink. Just \nmake sure you have your seatbelt on if you drink. I guess it is a \npolicy position that might be attractive to some, but not to those who \nthink clearly.\n  It seems to me that Senators should understand that in this country \nevery year there are 1 million people injured from drunk driving \naccidents. Every 25 minutes or so another American is killed from a \ndrunk driving accident. In 11 years, 1982 to 1993, for which we have \nstatistics, 266,000 Americans were killed as a result of alcohol-\nrelated accidents.\n  As I said before, this is not some mysterious disease. We know what \ncauses it and how to stop it. The Europeans know how to stop it \nlargely. They tell people, ``Do not even think about drinking and \ndriving. It is not funny. Do not even think about it. If you get caught \ndrunk driving, you are in deep trouble.''\n  There are parts of this country where, if you get caught drunk \ndriving, you get a little slap on the wrist and people grin at you, \n``You must have been having a good time.''\n  It is not a good time to turn a car into a weapon of murder. That is \nwhat happens in this country if we do not have the strength to develop \na national standard to say to people, part of the responsible use of \nour highways in this country is to understand you cannot drink and \npeople in your car cannot drink and you cannot have open containers of \nalcohol in your car. There is nobody here that can come to the floor \nand claim a national strategy for the national transportation system \nuntil we provide a national strategy to tell Americans that you cannot \ndrink and drive, you cannot have open containers of alcohol in \nvehicles. Until that happens, no one can reasonably come to the floor \nof the Senate and say we have a responsible national strategy on \ntransportation or a responsible national strategy with respect to \nhighways.\n  It is disgusting to me that in this country there are still six \nStates where it is legal to drink and drive, and there are 26 States in \nwhich you can have an open container of alcohol in a vehicle. One way \nor another--one way or another--someday, somehow, we are going to fix \nthat. And we are going to learn the lessons that others in the world \nhave already learned, notably European countries, to tell Americans \nthat part of driving responsibly is to understand you do not drink and \ndrive in our country. That is what my amendment is intending to do.\n  I suspect there will not be sufficient votes for my amendment because \npeople will come here and decide that they are not interested in \nproviding national leadership on this issue. And the result will be \nmore Americans will die. And until one day when sufficient numbers will \ncome to the floor of the Senate and the House and decide that the \ncarnage really ought to stop and there is something we can do to stop \nit, then we will pass an amendment of this type.\n  Mr. President, I yield whatever time I have remaining to the Senator \nfrom New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 8 minutes 35 seconds.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Presiding Officer. Mr. President, I rise \nbecause there is a confluence of amendments and ideas being put forward \nat this time that come together to me in a very meaningful way. All of \nus--all of us, I am sure--have known someone who lost a family member \nor who themselves were lost because someone was casual about booze and \ndriving.\n  Perhaps the thing I am most proud of--I am honored to be elected to \nthe Senate; I am honored to have had that opportunity in my life--but \nthe thing that I am most proud of is that I am the father of four \nwonderful children and two of the most beautiful grandchildren to ever \nwalk the face of the Earth. I am so taken by them that my thoughts are \noften consumed by the view of the world in which we live and concerned \nabout things that, again, concern all parents--fathers, mothers--that \nis, the violence in our society, the destruction of young lives \nneedlessly, about the family that we know where a 14-year-old boy was \nriding in the passenger seat in a car in Florida. The 16-year-old boy \nwas driving. He had open containers of beer in the car.\n They hit a telephone pole going 70 miles an hour. My friend's son was \nincinerated. We do not know whether he died before he was burned or \nwhether it was after, but the thought, the notion, the vision of this \nchild--a bright, beautiful young man--was so vivid that it seared the \nthinking of the community for years after. There have been memorials, \nthere have been testimonials, but nothing--nothing--can ever remove the \nmemory of that tragedy.\n\n  But I am also considered the father of the 21-drinking-age bill, not \nquite like fatherhood in the real sense, but something in which I take \na significant measure of pride as well. That law was written in 1984. \nPresident Reagan was in office. Elizabeth Dole was the Secretary of \nTransportation. They were Republicans, devoted Republicans. And yet, \nthroughout that debate, they were very positive. I was invited to be at \nthe signing in the Rose Garden when President Reagan signed the 21-\ndrinking-age bill.\n  That bill was almost forced on us by the anguish and the grief of \nparents across the country, of young friends across the country, high \nschool kids--SADD was their organization, MADD was the Mothers Against \nDrunk Driving, who came here brokenhearted at the loss of a child, \ntypically to drunken driving.\n  So we worked hard, and we got that bill through. The rewards come \nevery year when we get reports from the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration, when they say that we are saving about a thousand kids \na year from dying on the highways--a thousand kids.\n  It does not sound like something fantastic in the abstract, because a \nthousand families that do not have to mourn do not know that they \nescaped the pain. They do not know that they did not lose a child \nbecause there is a law on the books that encouraged the appropriate \nkind of behavior.\n  Here we are, some 10 years later, 10,000 young people saved from \ndying on the highways, and I feel very good about the effort that is \nbeing made throughout my State and many States in the country to reduce \ndrunk driving, ever more harsh in the punishment of those who abuse the \nprivilege and the opportunity to get behind the wheel of a car and \nforget about it only too quickly.\n  I am a strong supporter of Senator Byrd's amendment, which was \noffered before this, to continue to make the public and the driver more \naware of the fact that when they drive and they drink that there is a \npenalty to be paid, a penalty far less--far less--than the ultimate \npenalty of winding up a statistic or a phone call in the dark of night \nor a police officer at the door.\n  So when we look at legislation, as we consider the national highway \nbill, and we try, as we develop this 160,000 miles more of supervised \nor constructive road development, that we focus on the safety issues.\n  One of the things that is apparent to anyone who has ever seen people \ndriving with a drink container, a glass, a bottle in their hands, or a \ncan, bottoms up going along often at a fast rate of speed, it seems to \nhave particular attraction for young men and often people in the prime \nof life. They just do not understand that it is not cool, that it is \nnot macho, that it is not anything but disgusting, because if they make \na miscalculation, the ball game is over.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I was listening to the Senator's arguments, as well as \nthe arguments of the Senator from North Dakota. I think they were very \neloquent about the problems we are facing with drinking while people \ndrive.\n  I guess a philosophical question I ask the Senator from New Jersey, \nbecause I think the Senator from New Jersey supports the theory that on \nthe use of highway funds for transportation purposes that the States \nshould have a [[Page S 8784]] maximum degree of flexibility--if they \nwant to use highway funds, for instance, instead of building highways, \nthey should have the right to use them for Amtrak and rail systems--how \ndoes that square with the argument I think the Senator is making now \nwith regard to standards for when people drink within a State that the \nFederal Government knows better in that area, but the State knows \nbetter in the area of what type of transportation system is better \nwithin the State? We are going to tell you what to do when it comes to \nsetting limitations on drinking, but we are not going to tell you what \nto do with how the money is spent for transportation purposes?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. To me, it is a fairly simple differentiation, and \nthat is, in the case of decisions about where funds are spent on \ntransportation, we have agreed in an amendment that we just dealt with \nthat within the State legislature, the Governor and transportation \nofficials within the State are qualified to make decisions about where \nthey put their money--bridges, roadways, railroads, as I see it, mass \ntransit. I think that is one kind of consideration.\n  But I never believed--never believed--that when it came to the safety \nof our children, when it came to the helmet law, when it comes to \ndrinking and driving, I do not believe that the Federal Government dare \nwalk away from its responsibilities any more than we ought to walk away \nfrom equipping our service people with adequate resources if they are \never in combat, with equipping our people with the best education that \nthey can get, equipping our young people with the best health \nconditions they can get with proper nutrition. I think that is a \nresponsibility of Government. I think we ought to step forward on all \nissues affecting people on our roads to try to reduce the danger.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield further? Suppose the State says \nthat is their responsibility, as well; let them make that decision?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. In this case, obviously, I am not one who is going \nover the cliff on behalf of all States rights. I think States ought to \nhave some flexibility in some areas, and in others, I think that there \nought to be a national policy that is consistent.\n  One of the problems that we had--and I know the Senator knew this \nvery well because he was in Washington at that time--one of the \nproblems we had when we tried to develop the 21 drinking age was that \nthere were States, and some of these, not the most rural States, by the \nway, as one might often think, that refused to raise the drinking age \nbecause business was pretty good.\n  By the way, one of the places was right here in the very Capital of \nour country. Washington, DC, was one of the last. They made a \ncalculated decision as to whether or not they would raise the drinking \nage to 21 because Georgetown sells a lot of booze, and there is a lot \nof money spent there. So they were almost willing to trade bucks for \nlives, but the legislation forced them, because they would have lost a \nfair amount of their transportation money.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield to me?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I might respond in part to the Senator from Louisiana by \nsaying this is a question, in part, of whether there ought to be a \nnational standard, not a question of whether the States can do it \nbetter. It is a question of do you think there should be a national \nstandard on whether one should drink and drive.\n  If one takes the position, I think some States ought to say you can \ndrink a little and drive, and another State can say you can drink a lot \nand drive--because in our State there is a feeling you can drink a lot \nand drive--and in another State they say we do not think you ought to \ndrink and drive at all, my own view of those three different choices \nStates made is I think it ought not be a State choice. I think we ought \nto have a national standard on the fundamental question of is it \nappropriate on the national highways of the United States to drink and \ndrive. The answer to me is no.\n  Now, one can reach a different conclusion, and I will respect that. \nBut I view this as the question of, should we have a national standard? \nThe answer, clearly to me, is yes. Nowhere in this country should \nanyone ever believe, under any circumstance, that it is appropriate to \nget behind the wheel of a car, start the engine, and drive away \ndrinking whiskey. That is totally, always, in every part of this \ncountry, inappropriate. I hope that we will have a national standard \nthat will say that.\n  Mr. BREAUX. If the Senator will yield, I think the discussion is \ngood.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I say to the Senator from North Dakota, in discussing \nthis, we have a national transportation highway system, and yet, some \nwould argue, with a lot of eloquence, that the States should have a \nright to determine whether it is going to be a highway made of concrete \nor whether it is going to be a rail system that is used to transport \npeople. The State ought to have a right to make that decision.\n  I have a lot of sympathy that States should make that determination, \neven though it is a national highway transportation bill. But then when \nit comes to setting standards for when someone within a particular \nState should have a right to drink, well, some who make the argument \nthat the States ought to have the flexibility on determining whether \nthey are going to build highways or rail systems, then we are going to \nsupersede you and we are going to determine in Washington what the \nproper standard is.\n  In one case, we are saying the States have the right to make that \ndetermination, and in another area we say you are not smart enough to \nmake the right determination, and we have to do it here in Washington. \nI am bothered by the inconsistency.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I appreciate the Senators' interests and comments. I \nsay this: If, in Louisiana, a decision was made to build a highway, \nbridge, or a rail spur, that does not necessarily present any danger or \nany problems for people in the neighboring States.\n  However, if State ``A'' has an open, or has no restrictions on \ndrinking and driving, no open container law, and does not enforce the \n21 drinking age law, it invites disaster, because young people from \nState ``B''--we call those blood borders. That is why the 21 drinking \nage bill was put into place in the first place. These are young kids. I \nhave it in my State. It happened between New Jersey and New York and \nbetween Wisconsin and Illinois. There are a lot of instances around the \ncountry. Young people in New Jersey --at one point, we had an 18-year-\nold drinking age. When the law turned to 21 because we were losing too \nmany kids on our highways, New York State invited them over. They would \ngo over and they would come back and come down ``slaughter alley,'' a \nparticular road and often would not make it home. Boy, that convinced \nme, and I said we ought to have a standard that applies all over. What \nyou do in one State can seriously affect the lives and well-being of \nothers in other States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chair advises the Senator that his time \nhas expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Is there any more time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have 7 minutes on the other side of the \naisle.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator from Montana and the \nSenator from Virginia would be willing--I know we are headed toward a \nvote, and I was willing to agree to the shortest time agreement. I \nwonder if they would permit an additional 5 minutes prior to the vote \nso that the Senator from Arkansas might speak on this issue.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator restate the request?\n  Mr. DORGAN. We have apparently 5 or 6 minutes before the votes will \nbegin. I would like some time for the Senator from Arkansas to speak.\n  Mr. WARNER. How much time does the Senator desire?\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator would provide 4 or 5 minutes so the \nSenator from Arkansas can have some time, along with the Senator from \nNew Jersey.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would 6 minutes be agreeable? We will yield 7.\n  Mr. President, I make a unanimous consent request that the Senator \nfrom North Dakota have 7 minutes under his control.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I very much appreciate the generosity. [[Page S 8785]] \n  I yield to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator. I will wrap up my comments by \nnoting that around this place lately we have been talking about values, \nabout family, about structure, about behavior. And while we do not \nregulate behavior here, we talk often about models, examples, and about \nconduct. One of the worst ways for any child growing up to get a \npicture of what he or she ought to do in adulthood is someone moving \ndown the road with a beer can, pouring it down their throat at the same \ntime that they are driving. It is not a good image, and it is not a \ngood result. I hope that in the final analysis, the amendment by the \nSenator from North Dakota will prevail. It is an excellent amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator. We are all victims of our own \npersonal experiences. So I will tell you about mine. I was a freshman \nat Northwestern University Law School in Chicago. My brother was up at \nHarvard Law School. Both of us were there on the GI bill because I \npromise you my father could not afford that kind of education for us. \nOne Sunday evening, I got this phone call that my mother and father had \nbeen in a car wreck, and the message was obviously tempered. But I got \non a plane the first thing the next morning and flew home. It was tough \nto get home to Fort Smith, AR, from Chicago back in those days.\n  But to shorten the story, my father owned a small farm over in \nOklahoma, just across the Arkansas River from where we lived. He and my \nmother and a couple next door had gone over to look at the spinach, \nwhich was coming up, and they were going to start harvesting it the \nnext day. They were coming back and were 10 miles west of Fort Smith, \nAR, on what is now I-40--this is the transportation bill. They were on \nan 18-foot narrow highway with no shoulders, and they came up over a \nslight hill, just a slight incline, at about dusky-dark--the wrong \ntime, wrong place--roaring drunk, whom a cop had been chasing, but he \nhad a flat tire and he lost him. He went over on my father's side of \nthe road and, blam, our neighbor next door was killed instantly, and my \nmother died 2 days later. And my father died 5 days later.\n  I have often wondered about how we establish death penalties in this \ncountry. You could not have taken an AK-47 and more deliberately killed \nmy mother and father than to get behind the wheel of an automobile \nroaring drunk and, in a split second, destroy our family. So I have no \nproblem supporting this amendment, the Byrd amendment, and any other \namendment that anybody wants to offer dealing with this subject.\n  As I was about to say a moment ago, this is a transportation bill. \nAlmost precisely where my mother and father were killed, today is I-40. \nIf I-40 had been there then, my mother and father would have lived a \nnormal lifespan and we would have had the happiness that should have \nbeen ours for at least another 20 years.\n  So I speak in favor of these magnificent highways we have today that \ngive us some protection. As you know, the death rate on interstate \nhighways is about 80 percent less than it is on all the other two-lane \nhighways, because you do not have to worry about some drunk coming over \na hill on the wrong side of the road. So I am pleased that we are \ntrying to improve our highways in this country and give people like my \nfather an opportunity not to have to face drunken drivers who do not \nhave any better judgment than to get roaring drunk. And, as I say, \nsurely as if he had an AK-47 in his hands, he could not have killed \nthose three people any more efficiently.\n  Why not the death penalty? I have always struggled with the death \npenalty, I admit it. I voted for it. It has always been a problem. But \nI have never been able to see the distinction between the people we \nprovide the death penalty for and the guy who served 5 years in the \npenitentiary for killing my mother and father and their best friend \nnext door.\n  I will yield the floor and say that I strongly support the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, and I strongly support the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I just wish to say that there are moments \nin the life of the U.S. Senate that one shall always remember, and I am \nprivileged to have had a long, personal relationship with my good \nfriend from Arkansas, predicated on many, many things that we have done \nand shared together.\n  Tonight, the Senator has deeply touched this Senator, as I am sure \nmany others, showing the courage to come over here and share with the \nSenate that story. I shall not forget it.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the comanager, the Senator from Montana, \nand I have several amendments which we will now clear with the Senate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1448\n\n(Purpose: To require the Secretary of Transportation to cooperate with \n  the State of Wyoming in monitoring the changes in growth along, and \ntraffic patterns of, certain road segments in Wyoming, for the purpose \n of future consideration of the addition of the route segments to the \n                        National Highway System)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] for Mr. Thomas, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1448.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent further reading be dispensed \nwith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 8, line 3, insert ``(a) In General.--'' before \n     ``Section''.\n       On page 10, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n       (b) Routes Segments in Wyoming.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Transportation shall \n     cooperate with the State of Wyoming in monitoring the changes \n     in growth along, and traffic patterns of, the route segments \n     in Wyoming described in paragraph (2), for the purpose of \n     future consideration of the addition of the route segments to \n     the National Highway System in accordance with paragraphs (2) \n     and (3) of section 103(c) of title 23, United States Code (as \n     added by subsection (a)).\n       (2) Route segments.--The route segments referred to in \n     paragraph (1) are--\n       (A) United States Route 191 from Rock Springs to Hoback \n     Junction;\n       (B) United States Route 16 from Worland to Interstate Route \n     90; and\n       (C) Wyoming Route 59 from Douglas to Gillette.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. This is an amendment on behalf of the Senator from \nWyoming, [Mr. Thomas].\n  The amendment does not add new routes, nor does it provide any funds. \nIt encourages the Federal Highway Administration and the State of \nWyoming to monitor growth changes in the Wyoming National Highway \nSystem.\n  I urge its acceptance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we have examined this amendment and have \nno objections.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1448) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1449\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof the two Senators from South Dakota, Mr. Pressler and Mr. Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] for Mr. Pressler, \n     for himself and Mr. Daschle, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1449.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent further reading be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Insert ``(a)'' immediately before ``Notwithstanding'' on \n     page 32, line 17.\n       Insert a new subsection (b) after page 32, line 25, to read \n     as follows:\n       ``(b) Upon receipt of a written notification by a State, \n     referring to its right to provide notification under this \n     subsection, the Secretary of Transportation shall waive, with \n     respect to such State, any requirement that [[Page S \n     8786]] such State use or plan to use the metric system with \n     respect to designing, preparing plans, specifications and \n     estimates, advertising, or taking any other action with \n     respect to Federal-aid highway projects or activities \n     utilizing funds authorized pursuant to title 23, United \n     States Code. Such waiver shall remain effective for the State \n     until the State notifies the Secretary to the contrary. \n     Provided further, a waiver granted by the Secretary will be \n     in effect until September 30, 2000.''\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, my amendment concerns the issue of \nmetric conversion. It makes clear that in this era of significant \nbudgetary pressures, expenditures on metric conversion does not deserve \npriority. We must preserve Federal and State transportation funds for \nmore important needs. Let me explain.\n  The Federal Highway Administration, by regulation, is requiring \nmetric conversion of internal processes for all States by September 30, \n1996. If a State is not in compliance, Federal-aid highway funds will \nbe lost. What would such internal conversion entail?\n  In addition to engineering and planning concerns, this would require \nStates to rewrite their highway and transportation design procedures as \nwell as to rewrite their motor vehicle and drivers license manuals. \nTheir procedures for the purchase of materials and equipment would need \nto be altered and they would need to provide retraining to workers. All \nthis and more by September 30, 1996.\n  Would a better approach not be to give States adequate time to \nallocate resources and provide for internal metric conversion based on \ntheir own unique funding priorities? It would.\n  Mr. President, infrastructure needs and costs continue to increase \ndramatically. While I am not at all opposed to metric conversion, I \nbelieve it could best be accomplished at the discretion of each State. \nAfter all, should not each State be allowed to consider their unique \nfunding needs? They should. And that is what my amendment would allow.\n  Specifically, my amendment would allow the Secretary of \nTransportation to waive, upon the receipt of a written notification by \na State, any requirement that such State use or plan to use the metric \nsystem with respect to designing, preparing plans, specifications and \nestimates, advertising, or taking any other action with respect to \nFederal-aid highway projects or activities. The waiver would be in \neffect until September 30, 2000.\n  Mr. President, my amendment has no budget impact. However, it would \nhelp States with limited resources to deliver more services to their \ncitizens. Should that not be our primary objective? I urge my \ncolleagues to support my amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. On behalf of Senators Pressler and Daschle, the managers \nsend this amendment.\n  We accept the amendment to provide States until the year 2000 to \nconvert their internal working documents to the metric measurements.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we accept this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1449) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1450\n\n(Purpose: To clarify eligibility of a Luzerne County, Pennsylvania rail \n    freight acquisition and improvement project for certain federal \n                         transportation funds)\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished \nchairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works a question of \na clarifying nature regarding the provision in S. 440 which identifies \nand establishes the Alameda transportation corridor in my State of \nCalifornia as a ``high-priority corridor'' under section 1105 of the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from California \nfor a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me begin by first commending Senator Chafee, the \ncommittee chairman, Senator Warner, chairman of the Subcommittee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure, and my ranking member Senator Baucus \nfor their support in recognizing the Alameda corridor as a project of \ncritical importance not only to California's but to the Nation's \neconomy.\n  In recent months, the attention of Congress has been focused on how \nto reduce our budget deficit and how to restructure infrastructure \nspending. As important as these goals are, it remains critical in this \nnew era in the Federal budget process to support infrastructure \nprojects which have national significance. I support innovative \nsolutions to meet our transportation infrastructure needs.\n  The Alameda transportation corridor is one of the most critically \nimportant infrastructure projects for the Nation. The project will \nstreamline rail and highway transportation between the ports of Los \nAngeles and Long Beach, and intermodal connections in downtown Los \nAngeles. The rail portion of the project will consolidate the \noperations of three freight carriers into one higher speed corridor and \neliminate conflicts with highway crossings. Highways will also be \nimproved to provide better access from the ports to the freeways. The \nincreased transportation efficiency will provide the added benefit of \ndecreased air pollution.\n  Last year the ports handled $74.3 billion in exported or imported \ngoods. That amount represents 27 percent of the national value of \nexports and imports. This volume of shipments produces more than $17.3 \nbillion in Federal, State, and local taxes nationwide. With completion \nof the project, these figures will substantially increase. The ports \nestimate that the project will increase national economic output by an \nestimated $170 billion annually and will increase total Federal \nrevenues by approximately $32 billion.\n  The Alameda corridor will mean billions in increased trade for the \nUnited States, hundreds of millions in new tax revenue to State and \nlocal governments throughout the country, and the addition of hundreds \nof thousands of jobs nationwide.\n  Recognizing the national significance of the project, Mr. President, \nI would like to pose the following question to Senator Chafee: As I \nunderstand section 1105 of ISTEA, the designation of the Alameda \ntransportation corridor as a ``high-priority corridor'' under this \nsection will enable the Secretary of Transportation to work \ncooperatively with the project sponsors on using creative financing to \nadvance the project, including eligibility for a line a credit. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes. The designation of the Alameda transportation \ncorridor as a ``high-priority corridor'' reflects the committee's \ndetermination that the project merits an ongoing Federal role based \nupon the long-term potential benefits to interstate and international \ncommerce. The Alameda corridor is, indeed, a project of national \nsignificance.\n  Under section 1105, high-priority corridors are eligible for creative \nfinancing with the Secretary. This eligibility includes participation \nin the Priority Corridor Revolving Loan Fund, the establishment of a \nline of credit, and other methods of financing. The section 1105 \n``high-priority'' designation allows the corridor project to help \nitself by making it eligible for these innovative financing options.\n  I would encourage the Secretary to work with the project sponsors to \nidentify and pursue those creative financing options that will assist \nthe timely completion of the project.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the chairman. I appreciate the clarification and \nagain commend him for his assistance in moving this project forward.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly about several \nvotes on amendments to the National Highway System Designation Act of \n1995. These votes did not reflect a lack of support for helmet and \nseatbelt laws or speed limits on our highways. They reflected a choice \nas to the appropriate level of government to make those decisions. I \nbelieve these decisions are better decided, not by the Federal \nGovernment, but by each individual State, taking into consideration \nlocal conditions and local demographics.\n  Issues involving highway safety have always been important to me, \ndating back to my years as Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia. I \nknow the members of the Virginia General Assembly and the citizens of \nmy State care very deeply about these issues as well.\n  Mr. President, existing Federal requirements forcing States to impose \nsafety belt and helmet laws have had their intended consequences. Most \nStates have enacted helmet and seatbelt laws. In my view, the time has \ncome to remove the Federal Government from issues which properly fall \nwithin the province of the States. In the spirit of devolving non-\nFederal responsibilities to the States, I think we can start with \nending the Federal role in setting traffic laws. At some point, we must \ntrust the States on issues which fall particularly within their areas \nof expertise and for which they bear the full responsibility of \nenforcement.\n  To conclude, Mr. President, my votes yesterday were not to repeal \nsafety laws or speed limits. I personally support helmet laws and \nseatbelt requirements. My votes were to allow Virginia and other States \nto use their own expertise to determine the laws that will best serve \ntheir citizens and enhance their safety.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today as a cosponsor of \nS. 440 to encourage the adoption of this legislation designating the \nNational Highway System. This bill contains significant reforms that \nare important to Kansas and our country's transportation system.\n  There has been a great deal of support for the designation of the \nNational Highway System. The 159,000 miles identified in this bill \nrepresent each State's primary routes connecting major population \ncenters, transportation facilities, and other intermodal efforts. Our \nhighway system is a network whose maintenance and upkeep are crucial to \nour economy. As new technological developments for intermodal \ntransportation are created, the interconnectivity of our country's \ntransportation system becomes increasingly important. This designation \nwill allow for much needed funds to flow to our States directly.\n  I appreciate the efforts of Senator Warner and Senator Chafee to \naddress specific areas of concern for Kansas. The designation of the I-\n35 corridor identifies an existing route from Texas to Kansas to \nMinnesota that is a valuable link between Mexico and Canada. The \ndemands on these transportation routes connecting Canada, the United \nStates, and Mexico will only increase. As our demand for trade among \nthese countries grows, so will our need to develop and maintain these \ntransportation routes.\n  Several issues addressed in this bill have long been in need of \nattention. The repeal of the crumb rubber mandate, removal of metric \nmeasurements requirements, and hours of service clarifications are of \ngreat interest to many Kansans. Although we did not pursue the repeal \nof Davis-Bacon in this legislation, the repeal of this outdated law \nwill continue to be a high priority. Throughout this debate, efforts \nhave been made to give the States a greater role in setting their own \ntransportation policy. The issue is not whether there should be a \nspeed-limit or mandatory helmet or seatbelt law. The issue is who \ndecides: is it Congress or each of the respective States?\n  In addition, I would like to thank Senator Chafee for joining with me \nin addressing the concerns of water-well [[Page S 8790]] drillers and \nthe hours-of-service regulations. The language in S. 440 resolves an \nunintended problem by requiring the drivers of water well drilling rigs \nto comply with the same hours of service regulations currently provided \nto drivers of vehicles in oilfield operations while maintaining safety \npriorities.\n  I believe the National Highway System designation, as well as other \nprovisions contained in S. 440, provide a positive step forward in \naddressing our Nation's transportation needs.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in support of S. 440.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the legislation before us, S. 440, the National Highway \nDesignation Act. This is landmark legislation because it expands the \nexisting Federal Interstate Highway System into a national system that \nincludes the major roadways in every State. The identification of these \nimportant State highways and their eligibility for Federal highway \nfunding is a significant step forward in strengthening the \ntransportation network of our country.\n  As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and the \nsub-committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I have been very \ninvolved in the drafting of many sections of this bill, the repeals of \nthe crumb rubber and national speed limit mandates and, most \nimportantly to me personally, funding authority for the National \nRecreational Trails Program. The trails program was established in the \noriginal ISTEA bill but has not been fully implemented due to an \ninconsistent funding source. In this bill we have finally authorized \ncontract funding authority to provide moneys from the Highway Trust \nFund to design, build and maintain a national trail system for both \nmotorized and non-motorized recreational uses.\n  I think that the committee amendment is good legislation. It reflects \nmany hours of diligent and thoughtful effort by the committee members, \nand I want to particularly acknowledge the efforts of the \nTransportation Committee Chairman Senator Warner and his staff.\n  The committee draft includes several provisions that are of critical \nimportance to both the Nation and my home State of Idaho. These \nimprovements share the common themes of deregulation and \ndecentralization as we streamline and, in some cases, eliminate \nexisting Federal transportation regulations and mandates. Some of these \nchanges to present law revolve around the restoration of States rights \nin determining how to fund, construct and manage the highways in their \nindividual States. My own State of Idaho has struggled in the past with \nthese very issues because we also believe that these decisions are \nbetter left to be resolved by State legislatures. Federal bureaucrats \nin Washington, DC seldom, if ever, have a better sense of what is \nappropriate in the 50 individual States than those folks who are \nelected locally.\n  We have seen over and over again that rules and regulations drafted \nin Washington, DC which are designed to deal with specific regional \nproblems, but which have national application, often times are too far \nreaching and burdensome to a majority of the country. Prime examples of \nthese types of mandates presently in highway legislation include the \nnational speed limit mandate, the financial penalties for noncompliance \nwith mandatory helmet and seat belt laws and the financial penalties \nfor noncompliance with the crumb rubber requirement.\n  It is not reasonable to assume that highway conditions and demands \nare the same in a predominately urban and heavily populated State as \nthey would be in a primarily rural State like Idaho. For example the \nneeds of Atlanta, Idaho, which has a population of just 200, a single \nroad, one bridge, and plenty of wide open spaces are quite different \nfrom the needs of Atlanta, GA which has a population of 500,000.\n  The application of the crumb rubber minimum utilization requirement \nmay work in some geographic areas that do not have great temperature \nvariations and light commercial truck volume but, in the high mountain \npasses of Idaho, this mandate was a failure and resulted in a waste of \nboth Federal and State highway dollars. This Idaho crumb rubber pilot \nproject was on U.S. 30 at the Fish Creek Summit which is situated at an \nelevation of 5,000 feet. Mr. Brent Frank, the Idaho DOT District 5 \nengineer, reported that the section of highway where crumb rubber was \nused displayed severe wheel rutting of up to 3 inches in depth after \njust 1 year. Normal wear of conventional paving materials would be 1 \ninch of rutting in 10 years. And, although Mr. Frank is reluctant to \nplace the total blame for the accelerated deterioration on the recycled \npaving material, the Idaho DOT has suspended a second project that was \nto use the recycled material. There simply was not sufficient research \nand study conducted on this process prior to implementation of the \nmandate.\n  The good news is that each of the examples I have cited has been \naddressed to one degree or another in the committee bill. Several \nadditional amendments will be offered which afford even more \nflexibility and discretion to local authorities to design programs that \nfit the needs of their constituents. I have co-sponsored two of these \nwhich deal with the repeal of financial penalties for noncompliance \nwith Federal seat belt and helmet laws. Do I personally always use seat \nbelts? Do I require that our children always wear seat belts? \nAbsolutely. But I believe that this is a decision that should be made \nby the individual State legislatures.\n  These types of issues should not be decided by congressional studies \nor surveys, but rather on the constitutional grounds of the 10th \namendment. I am unconditionally opposed to Federal edicts and mandates \nto the States, particularly in matters such as these where the Federal \nGovernment imposes financial penalties on States by redirecting moneys \nfrom a trust fund that was paid for by the very citizens that are being \npenalized.\n  I am hopeful that a majority of our colleagues will join in the \neffort to return these decisions where they belong--to the individual \nStates.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, once again the managers would like to \naddress the Senate in the hopes that we can tonight ascertain the full \nlist of amendments that will be considered on this bill. The list as it \nnow stands of Senators is as follows: Senator Frist, Senator Cohen, \nSenator Smith, Senator Inouye, Senator Hatfield, Senator McCain, \nSenator Johnston, Senator Ford, Senator Grams, Senator Wellstone, \nSenator Stevens, Senator Murkowski, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Ford, \nSenator Exon, Senator Boxer, Senator Chafee, Senator Nickles, and the \namendment by the managers.\n  I ask my colleagues. Are there further amendments?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Might I ask my good friend and colleague from Virginia? \nDoes he have Senator Stevens?\n  Mr. WARNER. We have Senators Stevens and Murkowski.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Johnston?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Three amendments by Senator Exon?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. John Kerry?\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest you add him--he was on and struck off--if you \nwish to put him back on.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Two Boxer amendments?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Sarbanes?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. And the managers?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is the list.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is the list as we know it.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that that constitute the remaining \namendments that can be brought up on this bill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, because \nof our inability to resolve an issue that affects our State, not having \nthe assurance that we can resolve this, even though I arranged for a \nmeeting to take place tomorrow morning relative to the concerns that we \nhave concerning that issue, I feel I must object.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I remind the Senator that we have his \namendment on this list. We can add a second amendment. So he can have \ntwo amendments on this list.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I might also remind the Senator that there \nis no time agreement. So I think the Senator is fully protected.\n[[Page S 8791]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is fully protected. But it would enable the \nleaders in the Senate and the managers to get this bill through.\n  So I once again ask unanimous consent.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am sorry. This is of such importance \nto us. I appreciate the patience of the floor managers and the fact we \nare going to proceed with this tomorrow. But we have been at this for \nsome 15 years since statehood, and we are so close to it now that \nunless we can reach some kind of an accord, I feel compelled to raise \nan objection at this time.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I could say one thing to my colleague at this time, \nlet us make it clear that we have accepted one amendment from Alaska. \nWe are going to clear it tonight. The second one, of which the Senator \nspoke, the Committee on Environment and Public Works has no \njurisdiction whatsoever.\n  Am I not correct?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is a matter that rests before the committee of which \nthe distinguished Senator is the chairman.\n  Given those facts, would the Senator not be fully protected by just \nleaving it on the list and, therefore, we can have a unanimous consent \nagreement that this list constitutes the totality of all amendments?\n  I ask the Senator once again so we can move this bill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I think my friend from Virginia would recognize that \nin the years I have been here I have been most cooperative in trying to \naccommodate various Members. But this is an issue that is as important \nto us as any issue that we have ever had, and it is simply the right of \naccess across Federal lands so that we can get to our private lands in \nthe State, and there is an environmental objection from various groups \nthat have persuaded Members that this is something they simply do not \nwant to see addressed and resolved.\n  We see no other alternative other than to attempt to use every method \nthat we can to try to bring some justice to the contract that was made \nwhen we entered into the statehood compact. The fact that we have been \nat this for so long, the fact that it belongs in this bill--and I \nrecognize the comment made by the Senator from Virginia that some of \nthe objection is within the Energy Committee, of which I happen to \nchair, and I hope that I will be able to prevail.\n  I wonder if the senior Senator from Alaska has any comments relative \nto this.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I do \nbelieve we speak for the State of Utah also that has a similar problem \nwhich is very pertinent to this bill. This is the highway bill. We are \ntrying to preserve our highway rights of way as other western States \nhave. And we now find a new form of discrimination against us because \nwe seek to use the rights of way created by the public over Federal \nlands. I think we are entitled to persist on this as long as we have to \nin order to get our rights recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, might I inquire of the Senators from \nAlaska if there is some other provision we could incorporate in this \nagreement to accommodate them? They are protected. They now have an \nopportunity to offer an amendment. There is no time agreement.\n  I wonder if there is anything else we might consider at this point \nthat the Senators would like to suggest that we could possibly \nincorporate in this agreement so that we can accommodate the Senator's \ninterest.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object again, I am \nwaiting for some information from our State and from our offices in the \nState regarding this matter. I thought we were on our way to settling \nthis earlier today. We are not. We have to get a considerable amount of \nmaterial in. We will not get it in tonight. We do operate on a \nsituation where, you will recall, it is 4 hours earlier in our State. \nBut we still are in the situation where we have to wait until they open \nin the morning and send us the information.\n  I do think it is not an unreasonable request that we be permitted to \nhave the time necessary to deal with this objection. We just heard this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the Senator from Montana made a suggestion, \nif we could agree on the other amendments, to have the Senator from \nAlaska have the right to offer an amendment any time before final \ndisposition of the bill, and that will give them time to decide \nprecisely what amendment, if any, they wish to offer. Of course, the \nmaterials are not here. You are not going to let the bill go to final \ndisposition. At least we would have a partial cap on the amendments.\n  I think the managers are prepared to stay here tonight and not have \nany more votes but to accept some amendments that may be pending.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I shall \nnot object, but it is just simply inconceivable and unacceptable to \nthose of us in Alaska that this basic right that we were guaranteed \nunder the statehood compact that we go out and identify those \ntraditional trails, winter trails, access wagon roads, across Federal \nlands that have been utilized and those that have been completed--some \n500 and some have been documented--and submitted, that we cannot \nconsummate what was guaranteed under the Statehood Act.\n  It is very disappointing to me to find objections from other Senators \nthat are strictly based on the feeling that this is a giant land grab. \nThis is nothing more than the opportunity for the citizens of the State \nto traverse Federal land so they can get to their private land, so they \ncan get to the State land.\n  It is something every single State--at least in the western United \nStates--which had any public land has enjoyed. And we simply cannot \nunderstand why it is not acceptable.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I shall \nnot object, if the suggestion under the majority leader is \nincorporated--in other words, if we are not limited in the solution we \nmay want to offer to this bill to this problem. We do not want to be \ntied down to just one amendment or amendments that might not be in \norder in terms of the circumstances that might be developed under this \nunanimous-consent agreement.\n  My understanding is that the leader has suggested we be permitted to \noffer an amendment or amendments to deal with the problems we have been \ntalking about, and there will be no time limit on the bill under the \ncircumstances of the agreement.\n  I do not object.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I renew the request.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  I have a similar situation. I have two amendments pending. I am very \nwilling to go with this approach. It would be very important to have \nthe request for the amendments of the Senators from Alaska \nincorporated, so that, if we find another way to stop a problem, we are \nnot inhibited from doing so.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I renew the unanimous consent request as \namended by the colloquy between the distinguished majority leader, the \nSenator from Alaska, and the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Reserving the right to object, I have an amendment \nthat I would like considered and I would like it placed on the list as \nwell.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I amend the unanimous consent request to \ninclude the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I also suggest to my good colleague that \nthat request be subject to the usual parameters of the previous \nagreement, that is, the parameters of order No. 114, essentially that \nthe following amendments be the only first-degree amendments in order \nand subject to relevant second degree, et cetera--the same parameters \nthat are contained in order 114 of today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest? [[Page S 8792]] \n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, the managers are prepared to continue \nconsideration of amendments. We have several amendments which can be \ncleared, and we will proceed to do that expeditiously.\n  Mr. DOLE. Is it fair to announce there will be no more votes this \nevening?\n  Mr. WARNER. Correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. There will be no more votes tonight.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1455\n\n(Purpose: To include the Dalton Highway in Alaska in the designation of \n                      the National Highway System)\n\n       Mr. Warner. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment \n     on behalf of the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. Stevens, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1455.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 36, on line 12, strike the quotation mark and \n     second period and insert:\n       ``(24) The Dalton Highway from Deadhorse, Alaska to \n     Fairbanks, Alaska.''.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I believe this amendment has been cleared by the \ndistinguished Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it has been cleared. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am grateful to the managers for \naccepting this amendment. It merely clarifies the status of the road \nthat parallels the Alaska pipeline, an Alaska highway that can be the \nsubject of expenditure of Federal highway funds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe the vote is in order, and I urge \nits adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 1455) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask further proceedings under the quorum \ncall be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1456\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from California, \nMrs. Boxer, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have stated several times my intention to \nmove as soon as possible to the regulatory reform bill. Regulatory \nreform is one of the most important issues this Congress will face, and \nthe American people have made clear that they expect us to act. \nRegulatory reform does not have to be a partisan issue.\n  Democrats and Republicans alike have seen a need to inject common \nsense into how the Federal Government crafts regulations. Democrats and \nRepublicans alike recognize that we cannot continue to bear $500 \nbillion of added costs to the economy. That is why I believe it is \nimportant that we pass a strong regulatory reform bill, with bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Senator Heflin, for example, has provided welcome leadership in \nhelping to craft this bill. I have been working with Senator Johnston \nfor some time to produce a strong regulatory reform package, in order \nto ensure that Congress answers America's call for relief.\n  I am pleased to say that I think Senator Johnston and I have reached \nan agreement on at least a discussion draft, a package that we believe \nwill enjoy broad support. My intention would be to, as soon as the \ndraft is completed, ask that the draft be printed in the Record today \nso that everybody might have an opportunity to see it. Earlier this \nyear, we had a dispute because not all Members had seen a draft on an \nearlier piece of legislation. Hopefully, by Tuesday of next week, we \ncan bring that bill to the floor and try to complete it by the end of \nnext week. We can put that into the Record today.\n  Again, this is a draft. We reached an agreement on this. It does not \nmean it may be the perfect answer or there may not be change between \nnow and next Tuesday. I have talked to some of my colleagues on the \nother side, such as the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, and \nmany are wanting an opportunity to see what the draft is. By printing \nit in the Record, it will be available tomorrow, Friday, Saturday, \nSunday and Monday and, hopefully, we can go to it on Tuesday.\n  I have suggested, and the Senator from Louisiana suggested, that we \nmake that statement on the floor.\n  I yield to Senator Johnston.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank the distinguished leader for his statement. He \nis correct that he and I have agreed upon a draft. It has been arrived \nat after extensive conversations, negotiations and [[Page S \n8794]] writing, and we have worked in over 100 amendments to the \nunderlying text. I hope my colleagues like the result, and I have \nreason to suspect that they will.\n  I would like to emphasize and ask the majority leader, if he does not \nagree with this--that this is, in fact, a discussion draft, and that we \ninvite input from all of our colleagues. By filing this to be printed, \nit is simply a matter of giving notice to colleagues of what is in the \ndiscussion draft. It is not the filing of the bill or the filing of an \namendment. But it is a filing of notice, so that all of those who have \nmeaningful input can work through the process and, hopefully, we will \nbe able to improve the bill, so that by the time a bill or an amendment \nis filed, it will contain the suggestions of our colleagues, if we can \nagree upon those suggestions. Am I correct on that?\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me respond to that. The Senator is correct. I will \nunderscore that this is a very significant effort. I do not want to \ndownplay the importance of the draft, because it is important. It is a \nresult of a lot of work on behalf of a lot of people on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  I do not want to suggest we are going to rewrite the whole thing. It \nis important. It has not been completed, and it could be improved, some \nwould say by making it stronger, or there may be another way to improve \nit.\n  If there is no objection, I will ask unanimous consent later to have \nit printed. It is not completed yet. That will appear in the Record \ntomorrow morning and, hopefully, we can continue discussions tomorrow \nand Friday and again on Monday, so that on Tuesday we might be prepared \nto take the bill up with fairly broad bipartisan support.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his statement. I \nthank him especially for the attitude of cooperation in the drafting of \nthis ``discussion draft'' because the leader did not come in as a man \nwith 56 votes in his pocket, the majority of votes, and do it his way; \nbut rather, the input which I have had from this side of the aisle I \ntried to faithfully follow, and tried to compromise. Not everything \nwent our way, and not everything went the Senator's way.\n  I really believe this is an excellent bill that I can \nenthusiastically support, and I hope my colleagues can improve, \nsignificantly, or in whatever ways they choose.\n  I think we have a draft that is going to attract some wide bipartisan \nsupport. I certainly hope so. From my part, I solicit and welcome any \nsuggestions which I will faithfully try to negotiate to improve the \nbill, if any such suggestions are made.\n  Mr. DOLE. Again, I thank my colleague from Louisiana. He spent a lot \nmore time on this this week than I. I know, for example, the many, many \nhours the Senator from Louisiana spent.\n  I also wanted to recognize the efforts of the Senator from Utah, \nSenator Hatch; the Senator from Delaware, Senator Roth; the Senator \nfrom Alaska, Senator Murkowski; the Senator from Oklahoma, Senator \nNickles; the Senator from Missouri, Senator Bond; the Senator from \nAlabama, Senator Heflin, whom I have already alluded to, and a number \nof others on this side, including the Senator from Georgia, Senator \nCoverdell, who has been working in, I think, a very bipartisan way to \ntry to find something we can agree on.\n  This is very important legislation. We hope we can have a bipartisan \nbill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Senator Dole has laid out his plans \nhaving to do with the next piece of legislation, and I know a couple of \nour colleagues were hoping to comment on that.\n  Mr. DOLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to thank the majority leader \nand the Senator from Louisiana. I think this is a very positive and \nconstructive step, to print the bill as a draft proposal rather than \nenter it as a piece of legislation at this point. I thank them for \ndoing that.\n  I think the key here--as the majority leader has said, this is \ndefinitely one of the most sweeping and important pieces of legislation \nthat we have yet considered--I think it is essential that we have an \nopportunity to try to guarantee that in the next few days, we come \ntogether as a working group to see if the product that will come to the \nfloor as a bill, finally introduced, reflects the maximum amount of \nchanges possible in the good spirit of bipartisan compromise.\n  I note for the majority leader that last year, we passed a cost-\nbenefit definition by a vote of 0 to 8. I was pleased to vote for that. \nI think we ought to be able to, if we work in the next few days, to \napproach this bill with that same concept.\n  One of the fears that some Members have at this point is that there \nis enough layering of judicial involvement here that at a time when we \nare moving forward--securities reform, product liability reform, tort \nreform--we are suddenly perhaps creating a whole new avenue of tort \npossibilities.\n  I will simply ask the majority leader if, in the spirit of printing \nthis, it is also his intention to now engage, in a couple of days, \ntogether with the Senator from Louisiana, with the Senator from \nMichigan, the Senator from Ohio, and others who are interested, in \ntrying to see if we can pare down some of those differences that might \nhelp to truly make the final product introduced a bipartisan effort.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I respond in the affirmative to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  That is why I will ask consent later this evening, when we have the \ndraft completed, so that we would have Thursday and Friday, and staff \ncould have whatever time over the weekend and again on Monday, for the \nprincipals to see if we can come together.\n  We may not be able to come together. Maybe it will not happen next \nTuesday. As I understand, a lot of people have been working on this in \ngood faith, and all have not been in the same room but have been in \ndifferent rooms in different groups.\n  That is based on the suggestion made by the Senator from \nMassachusetts earlier today. I think we agreed that we would not push \nit, we would not try to start on a bill tomorrow, but we would put it \nin the Record, a draft. It may not be the one that is introduced next \nweek. The answer is yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I think that is constructive. I thank the majority leader. \nHe has certainly pledged to try to work in good faith to see if we can \nreach agreements.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I want to add a couple of comments here. I \nthink we have been at this on two tracks. There was a lot of regulatory \nreform legislation put in this year and considered in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. We came out with a bill.\n  Another bill went through the Judiciary Committee process which is \nthe one that the distinguished majority leader is referring to, that he \nand Senator Johnston have been working on.\n  Now there has been a dual track going on. In addition to the \nJudiciary Committee bill, some have also been working on the bill that \ncame out of the Governmental Affairs Committee, and it was voted \nunanimously out of Governmental Affairs with both Republican and \nDemocratic support, a unanimous vote.\n  Now, we have taken that bill and done some work on it, and we think \nwe have made some pretty good improvements.\n  It is ready. I will not submit it today, in view of what the majority \nleader has proposed here. But there have been two tracks. All of the \nwork with regard to regulatory reform has not been centered on just the \none bill that will be submitted today. I wanted to point that out to my \ncolleagues.\n  I am happy to work with the Senator from Louisiana, as well as the \nmajority leader, in trying to work this thing out and get the best of \nall of this legislation together if we possibly can do it.\n Whether that can be done in time enough to bring a completed form to \nthe floor by next Tuesday, I do not know. But we can sure take a crack \nat it and see.\n\n  I just want to point out we do have this other effort. And the bill \nthat we have been working on----\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. GLENN. Just one more comment and I will yield the floor. We do \nhave this other bill ready to go, in case we cannot negotiate these \nthings out. I think it is a pretty good bill. We have given a lot of \nthought to it and have changed some of the things for which I know \nthere was some objection. [[Page S 8795]] \n  With that I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield? Will the Senator from Ohio \nyield?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from Ohio I \nmight say the excellent work he and Senator Roth and the members of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee did was very much a matter of concern \nand negotiation to us on this bill. Particularly the judicial review, \nthe recommendations which will appear in this draft are, really, \nmotivated by the good work the Senator from Ohio and Senator Roth did \nin their bill. So it is not that we considered only the Judiciary \nproduct.\n  To the contrary, the good work that went in the Roth-Glenn bill we \nsought to incorporate in this bill--I hope successfully. But to the \nextent it can be improved we solicit and invite those comments and \nsuggestions.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me just first commend the Senator from Louisiana and \nthe majority leader for the process they are now undertaking. This is a \nprocess which submits a draft to the Congressional Record printer so we \nall can look at it and make suggestions to them for changes before it \nis introduced as a bill. I think that is the right process and holds \nout at least some hope that there could be a broad, bipartisan \nconsensus behind the regulatory reform bill.\n  There is a broad, bipartisan consensus that we need regulatory \nreform. I think almost all of us have voted for it in one version or \nanother. I have worked closely with my friend from Louisiana, as a \nmatter of fact, over the years on some regulatory reform issues. But I \nthink the fact they are going through this discussion draft stage \nfirst, before it is introduced as a bill, with the representation that \nthey are open to suggestions from people on both sides of the aisle \nwith points of view on that draft before they finally agree on a final \nbill, I think is an important step forward. Then, if that does not work \nout there will be, of course, time for alternatives then to be offered.\n  I thank my friend from Louisiana and the majority leader.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, just before we close off on the subject, it \nis my understanding from the conversations that we had privately on \nthis, but I think I am not violating any of them to say that at this \nmoment the expectancy is that whatever does come to the floor will be \ntruly open to the full legislative process and not prejudged in a way \nwe find with just a series of tabling motions and there is no \nlegislative effort. Am I correct in that also?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The Senator is correct. But more than that, we solicit \nthese comments in advance of filing the bill. That is an easier time \nand place to get this done.\n  Mr. KERRY. I could not agree with the Senator more.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I imagine there are going to be a lot of \namendments. This is a huge and vitally important bill where each word \ncarries tremendous meaning and where experts are going to look at it \nand be able to suggest improvements. For my part I think there are a \nlot of improvements that can be made. There are a lot of things I would \nlike to change.\n  For example, we have a $50 million threshold for rules. I think it \nought to be higher. That was a matter of compromise. And I hope we can \ndiscuss that seriously before we get to the floor or at least on the \nfloor.\n  So the Senator is correct, it is open for serious negotiations before \nwe file it, and after it is filed of course it is open for amendment. \nAnd I hope we will do it in a very bipartisan way and expect we will.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \ndraft be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the draft was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Comprehensive Regulatory \n     Reform Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

HENRY FOSTER\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we debated today whether a minority of \nmembers of the Senate will permit Dr. Henry Foster a vote on the \nconfirmation of his nomination.\n  Dr. Foster is qualified to be Surgeon General of the United States. \nHis 38-year career as a physician has reflected his concern for the \nmedically underserved in our society and most clearly for young people. \nHe has delivered more than 10,000 babies and trained hundreds of young \ndoctors.\n  Unfortunately, his nomination has become a pawn in the game of \nPresidential politics. Apparently, some of our colleagues see an \nadvantage in the Republican Presidential nominating process to using \nthe issue of abortion as a rallying cry to frustrate the confirmation \nprocess. If a bipartisan majority of the U.S. Senate is prepared to \nvote to confirm the President's appointment, that vote should occur and \nDr. Foster should be Surgeon General.\n  Pure and simple, the excuse for denying a vote to Dr. Foster is that \nhe has performed a legal medical procedure on behalf of a tiny \npercentage of his patients.\n  Some of my colleagues in the Senate oppose a woman's right to choose \non abortion, and that is their right. As lawmakers, they have the right \nto try to regulate it within constitutional limits and indeed, through \nthe route of a constitutional amendment, they may even try to prohibit \nit. We have debated, and I'm sure we will again, debate that issue in \nthis Chamber.\n  However, we should not try to turn Dr. Foster's nomination into that \ndebate, because doing so is neither fair to the nominee, nor wise for \nthe Nation.\n  I think Dr. Foster's views on abortion echo that of the vast majority \nof Americans. Abortion should be safe, legal, and rare. Now that last \nword rare is important. It's a word many people use when they talk \nabout abortion, but Dr. Foster hasnt just talked about making abortion \nrare--he has done something about it.\n  Dr. Foster's I Have a Future program in Tennessee is considered an \neffective approach to teen pregnancy prevention. Indeed President Bush \nconsidered Dr. Foster's program one of his Thousand Points of Light, an \noutstanding example of Americans taking their own initiatives to make \nour country healthier and stronger. In this program, Dr. Foster has \nfocused on helping young people develop confidence and self-esteem, \nbecause he knows that the teenager who can say ``I have a future'' is \nthe teenager who can say ``I don't want to give up that future by \nhaving a baby.''\n  The qualities of leadership and vision Dr. Foster demonstrated in \ncreating this program will make him a fine Surgeon General.\n  I was moved by Dr. Foster's testimony before the Labor and Human \nResources committee and paid a visit in my State to a program that \nshares many of the goals he has achieved in his I Have A Future \nprogram.\n  At Detroit's Northern High School, the Michigan Metro Girl Scout \nCouncil, with support from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, has developed \nthe Jayhawk Teen Center. The center provides young people with a safe, \nclean, and attractive place to come after school. It's a place to play \na game of checkers' or a game of pool or to use a computer to log onto \nthe Internet. It's also a place where young people learn how to resolve \nconflicts without violence, how to avoid the dead end street of \nsubstance abuse, and how to practice sexual responsibility. A team of \nfour student managers runs this center, and I wish you could see the \npride on their faces when they describe the difference it's made in \ntheir lives and the lives of their fellow student. Here too, young \npeople are realizing they have a future.\n  When I met with these students, I told them about Dr. Foster, the \nwork he had done and why I thought he would make an even greater \ncontribution to our country as Surgeon General. But I also told them it \nwas possible his nomination would not even be allowed to come up for a \nvote. They were puzzled by that. They couldn't understand how a good \nman, a man who had done all Dr. Foster has done, could be denied that \nopportunity. And, I do not think the American people will understand it \neither. They won't understand why Presidential politicking should \nprevent us from considering the nomination of a physician so qualified \nfor this position.\n  Mr. President, I voted to invoke cloture on the nomination. The \nPresident is entitled to his nominee, if a majority of the Senate \nconsent. We should have that vote and find out.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8806-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8806-S8817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   NOMINATION OF DR. HENRY W. FOSTER\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of Dr. \nHenry Foster to be Surgeon General of the United States. Earlier today, \nthe Senate narrowly rejected an attempt to cut off the unconscionable \nfilibuster being waged against him. I want to take this opportunity to \nreview the case in more detail for Dr. Foster.\n  Dr. Foster is a distinguished physician who has dedicated his career \nto improving the quality of health care for women and children. \nThroughout his 38-year career in medicine, he has had a substantial \ninfluence on the quality of health care through his own practice, his \nteaching, and his community leadership.\n  His outstanding record as a physician, community leader, medical \neducator, and public servant make him superbly qualified for this \nimportant position.\n  I am pleased that we have made it this far in the nomination process, \nand that we are on the road to bringing this nomination up for a final \nvote. But opponents to this nomination are intent on a filbuster, and \nwe must invoke cloture in order to get the nomination to a vote. Those \nwho believe that this nomination deserves a vote must vote for cloture \nto make that happen.\n  Cloture is only the first step on the road to fairness. The second \nstep--the step that counts--is the up or down vote on the nomination by \nthe entire Senate.\n  Throughout this nomination process, several Republicans have stated \nthat, in fairness, the nomination should go before the entire Senate \nfor a final vote. Some Members have suggested that by allowing a \ncloture vote, the majority leader will be giving the nomination the \nfair consideration it deserves. They have suggested that a vote on \ncloture is the same as a vote on the nomination. Obviously, that is \nwrong and misleading.\n  Senators who feel strongly about the issue of fairness should vote \nfor cloture, even if they intend to vote against the nomination itself. \nIt is wrong to filibuster this nomination, and Senators who believe in \nfairness will not let a minority of the Senate deny Dr. Foster his vote \nby the entire Senate.\n  We do a disservice to Dr. Foster, the Senate and the Nation as a \nwhole by prolonging this process. The Nation has now been without a \nSurgeon General for 6 months, and there is no justification for further \ndelay.\n  Dr. Foster has demonstrated his impressive qualifications, his \ncharacter, and his vision for the future of health care in this \ncountry. During the committee hearings, he successfully put to rest the \ncharges attacking his character and his ability. He earned the \nadmiration and respect of the committee and the American public.\n  Dr. Foster has developed innovative and effective approaches to some \nof the most difficult medical and social challenges facing communities \nacross the Nation today. He began his unselfish crusade early in his \ncareer, and at every stage, he has been an inspiring example of \npersonal sacrifice and service to others.\n  During the Labor Committee hearings, Dr. Foster ran the gauntlet of \nthe committee and emerged with flying colors. With real and very moving \neloquence, he described his background, his career, and his vision for \nthe future of health care in America.\n  In doing so, he demonstrated his impressive qualifications for \nSurgeon General, and successfully dismantled all of the objections \nraised against him. Dr. Foster had the opportunity to make his case, \nand he did so very well.\n  He developed a model prenatal care program to improve health care for \nexpectant mothers and their babies. He [[Page S 8807]] tried his best \nto confront the problems of infant mortality, mental retardation and \nbirth defects by bringing comprehensive prenatal and postnatal health \ncare to tens of thousands of poor women.\n  During his 38-year career, he has been nationally recognized for his \nleadership and research on sickle cell anemia, infant mortality, \nadolescent health care, women's health care, and teenage pregnancy.\n  He has made a significant difference in the lives and futures of \nthose he has served throughout his career, and there is no question \nthat he will do the same for the Nation.\n  In a sense, Dr. Foster has been a pioneer all his life. In the course \nof his career, he has met and mastered many difficult challenges in \nmedicine, and has had a positive impact in every community and every \nenvironment he has served.\n  Dr. Foster was born in 1933 in Pine bluff, AR. He earned his \nundergraduate degree from Morehouse College, and was accepted to \nmedical school at the age of 20--the only African-American in his \nclass.\n  After earning his medical degree in 1958, Dr. Foster served his \ninternship at Detroit Receiving Hospital in Michigan.\n  From 1959 to 1961, he also served as a captain and medical officer in \nthe U.S. Air Force, and was stationed in the State of Washington. He \ncame to Boston to begin his residency training in 1961, and also served \nin the active Air Force Reserve during that year. In 1962 he went to \nHubbard Hospital in Nashville, TN, for 3 years to complete his \ntraining.\n  He decided to begin his practice of medicine in the rural South. \nDuring that time, few doctors set up practice in the disadvantaged \nrural areas. Young, able, and well-trained in modern medicine, Dr. \nFoster went to Tuskegee to work among the poor, the uneducated, and the \nisolated residents living in racially divided rural Alabama.\n  He practiced there until 1973, when he returned to Nashville as \nchairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Meharry \nMedical College.\n  During his years in Tuskegee, the main local hospital served only \nwhites, except for a few black emergency patients who would be put in \nrooms normally used as closets. So black patients often went to the \nJ.A. Andrew Hospital, where Dr. Foster was on duty and took care of \nthem.\n  During that time, Tuskegee suffered from a severe shortage of \ndoctors, and Dr. Foster filled an urgent need. Most of his patients \nwere poor, black women who had never seen a doctor in their lives \nbefore being treated by Dr. Foster. Most of them lived without \nelectricity, a telephone, and in some cases, running water.\n  Many were forced to deliver their babies at home with lay midwives. \nAccess to prenatal care was nonexistent. Dr. Foster provided this \ncritical service, often in life or death situations and under the most \ndifficult circumstances.\n  Conditions such as these would be a challenge for even a seasoned \nphysician well into his practice.\n  But Dr. Foster took on this challenge at the very beginning of his \ncareer. He took sole responsibility for patients from five counties in \nrural Alabama, with a caseload well into the hundreds. He dedicated \nhimself to providing adequate health care to these women and their \nchildren--sometimes delivering as many as three babies a day. The \ncommunity remembers him as the town baby doctor--a doctor who has, in \nhis 38-year career, delivered literally thousands of babies into the \nworld.\n  As his practice and experience grew, Dr. Foster saw first hand how \nthe lack of adequate health care contributed to an inordinately high \nlevel of infant mortality in the region. To deal with this problem, Dr. \nFoster applied for a grant from the Department of Health to expand the \nmaternity and infant care program at Tuskegee Institute, and he \ndirected this program from 1970 to 1973. Through this initiative, Dr. \nFoster made a significant impact on the effort to reduce infant \nmortality and give children a healthy start in life.\n  He brought together teams of doctors, nurses, social workers, and \nnutrition specialists to provide comprehensive services to women and \nchildren in rural communities. These teams worked to reach women early \nin their pregnancies, and to identify those with high potential for \ncomplications, so that they could receive proper health care throughout \ntheir pregnancy and following birth.\n  In his comprehensive approach to maternal and child care, Dr. Foster \nwas well ahead of his time--so much so that it became a national model \nfor what is now known as regional prenatal care. This kind of care \ninvolved extensive community outreach, specialized services for high \nrisk women, and comprehensive care for mothers and infants both before \nand following birth. Very quickly, Dr. Foster became one of the \nNation's leading experts on maternal and child health.\n  His initiatives helped Alabama women learn to take better care of \nthemselves and their unborn children. He began working with the Robert \nWood Johnson Foundation to extend his health care model to other parts \nof the country. In 1972, primarily because of his revolutionary work in \nthis area, Dr. Foster received the high honor of being elected to the \nprestigious Institute of Medicine.\n  Dr. Foster has served on the Institute of Medicine since 1972. The \nInstitute was chartered in 1970 by the National Academy of Science to \npromote the advancement of the health sciences and the improvement of \nhealth care. It enlists distinguished members of the medical and other \nprofessions in pursuit of these goals.\n  The Institute of Medicine is a highly selective professional body, \nwith only 500 regular members, each of whom must be nominated by a \ncurrent member and elected by the full membership. The institute is \ngoverned by a council of 21 members elected by the entire membership.\n  In 1992, the full membership recognized Dr. Foster's distinguished \nservice for the institute--where he has served on numerous committees \nand boards--by electing him to the council. He was elected to a second \nterm on the council in November 1994.\n  In 1978, Dr. Foster was also appointed by HEW Secretary Joe Califano \nto the Ethics Advisory Board, which was created to examine the moral \nand ethical questions raised by advances in medical science. Dr. Foster \nwas appointed as one of the board's 15 members from a large group of \nnominations submitted by professional associations, scientific \nsocieties, public interest groups, and Members of Congress.\n  Members of the board included such leaders as James Gather, a former \nadviser to President Johnson and subsequent president of Stanford \nUniversity board of trustees; Dr. David Hamburg, a former president of \nthe Institute of Medicine and now president of the Carnegie Corporation \nof New York; Dr. Daniel Tosteson, dean of the Harvard Medical School \nfor the past 20 years; and Dr. Sissela Bok, Harvard ethicist and \nphilosopher.\n  Dr. Foster is also one of 10 members who serve on the Ethics \nCommittee of the Nashville Academy of Medicine. The academy has over \n1,400 members overall. The Ethics Committee acts as a tribunal for the \ndiscipline of academy members when complaints are received by other \nphysicians concerning a member's ethical conduct.\n  According to the academy's executive director, Dr. Foster was chosen \nby the board of directors because of his ``outstanding reputation in \nthe medical community.'' Dr. Foster has served on the committee for 10 \nyears.\n  In the 1970's Dr. Foster also began a crusade to provide quality \nhealth care to adolescents, whom he recognized as having inadequate \naccess to care or to information about their health needs. He was \nchosen by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to direct a multi-million-\ndollar grant program to increase health services for teenagers and \nyoung men and women.\n  Dr. Foster concentrated on young persons between the ages of 15 and \n24, who lived in areas characterized by high rates of teenage \npregnancy, violence, drug and alcohol abuse, and mental illness. Under \nhis guidance, 20 teaching hospitals developed comprehensive health \nprograms to expand services for youths in their own communities and to \ntrain doctors and nurses in the specialized care of high risk youth.\n  As a result of Dr. Foster's initiative, between 1982 and 1986, these \nprograms [[Page S 8808]] provided health services to 306,000 young \npeople.\n  In addition, the program significantly increased the number of \nprofessionals trained in providing health care to adolescents. Formal \ntraining in adolescent care was given to 115 adolescent medicine \nfellows, 974 medical residents, and 753 graduate trainees in nursing, \nmedicine, psychology, and social work.\n  Many of the Nation's first school-based clinics were a direct result \nof this initiative. During this time, Dr. Foster began to develop his \nstrategy for combating the problem that presents perhaps one of the \ngravest dangers to health, opportunity, and the future for adolescents \nin America--teenage pregnancy.\n  Teenage pregnancy has become a crisis of significant proportions in \nthis country. More than a million teenagers become pregnant each year. \nFor every 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 19, 13 become \npregnant--the highest rate of teen pregnancy in the industrial world.\n  In 1987, as chairman of the Obstetrics/Gynecology Department at \nMeharry Medical College, Dr. Foster began a landmark effort to reduce \nthe rate of teenage pregnancy. He went into the community, working with \nparents and community leaders in Nashville to find solutions to the \nproblem. He listened to teenagers themselves, and asked them what they \nneeded to help them do better in school, stay out of trouble, and avoid \npregnancy.\n  The result was the I Have A Future program, which Dr. Foster \nestablished at Meharry Medical College in Nashville. He recognized that \nschool-based clinics were not easily accessible when schools were \nclosed, so he developed a program to reach teenagers where they live, \nduring times when they need it most--after school, on the weekends, and \nduring the summer--when they have free time, need something to do, and \nare at greatest risk of getting into trouble.\n  The I Have A Future program targets teenagers in two public housing \ndevelopments in inner-city Nashville. It works to reduce teenage \npregnancy, while also addressing other serious problems facing inner-\ncity youth--drugs, violence, alcohol abuse, homicide, unemployment, and \nlack of educational opportunity. The program raises participants' self-\nesteem, promotes abstinence, and offers positive options to help \nteenagers make sensible decisions.\n  One of the most important points is that the I Have A Future program \nencourages teenagers to make responsible and sensible decisions. It \ngives them a purpose for abstaining from sex and avoiding high risk \nsexual behavior.\n  It raises their self-esteem and confidence. It gives them incentives \nto delay early sexual involvement and childbearing, and to focus \ninstead on education, job skills, and personal responsibility. In \nshort, the program teaches teens to think hard in advance about their \nchoices and their future.\n  It offers on-going activities, such as after-school tutoring, \ncomputer training, sports, art and dance activities, and other \nrecreation. Because the program is based where teenagers live, it draws \nparents and communities together to provide comprehensive and \ncomplementary services to participants, creating a stable and positive \nenvironment.\n  Dr. Foster has convinced these youths that they have an opportunity \nand a right to positive, productive, and fulfilling futures. As one I \nHave a Future teenager said:\n\n       Dr. Foster has put excitement into learning. Learning could \n     be fun if you do it in a fun way. Dr. Foster is doing a good \n     deed by teaching kids to wait before they have sex. Dr. \n     Foster would rather the young kids not have sex at all, \n     because they still have a lot of things to look forward to in \n     life. The ``I Have A Future'' program teaches you that you \n     don't have to do what everyone else is doing.\n\n  Another teenager wrote:\n\n       I am a three-year participant in the ``I Have A Future'' \n     entrepreneurship program. Dr. Foster's program has greatly \n     helped me. I have developed a positive attitude, good morals, \n     confidence, and the willingness to become a strong, \n     successful, black female through this extraordinary program. \n     Dr. Henry Foster is a caring, honorable man who considers the \n     welfare of others. He takes time out to understand and help \n     those who may not be as fortunate. He is an inspiration to \n     me.\n\n  One need only look at the results to see the program's effectiveness \nin helping students reach their goals for positive futures. The program \nhas had a significant impact on the number of inner-city teenagers who \ngo to college. In 1993, nine I Have A Future participants graduated \nfrom high school, and of this number, seven attended college and remain \nenrolled. In 1994, 24 participants graduated from high school, and 16 \nwent on to college. Another four entered the Armed Forces. The numbers \nin 1995 promise to be even higher.\n  With the help of the program, these students have learned to overcome \nthe considerable barriers to achievement in their inner-city \nenvironments. They have learned that they can achieve goals that they \nonce though were impossible to attain.\n  This program has been so successful, and has had such a powerful \nimpact on the community it serves, that it has been nationally \nrecognized as an outstanding model to combat the problems facing \nAmerican teenagers. It has won the support of prestigious national and \nlocal organizations.\n  It receives funding from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the \nWilliam T. Grant Foundation, Bill and Camille Cosby, the State of \nTennessee Department of Health, the United Way of Middle Tennessee, and \nthe Middle Tennessee Chapter of the March of Dimes.\n  The Tennessee Children Services Commission honored the program and \nnamed it one of six model teenage pregnancy programs in the State. The \nAmerican Medical Association's National Congress for Adolescent Health \nalso gave the program an award in recognition of its success in \npreventing teenage pregnancy.\n  The I Have A Future program was honored by President George Bush in \n1991, who designated it as one of the Nation's Thousand Points of \nLight. As President Bush wrote on March 15, 1991:\n\n       Dear Friends: I was delighted to learn of your outstanding \n     work in behalf of your community. Your generosity and \n     willingness to serve others merit the highest praise, and I \n     am pleased to recognize you as the 404th ``Daily Point of \n     Light.''\n       Since taking office as President, I have urged all \n     Americans to make community service central to their lives \n     and work. Judging by your active engagement in helping \n     others, it is clear that you understand this obligation.\n       We must not allow ourselves to be measured by the sum of \n     our possessions or the size of our bank accounts. The true \n     measure of any individual is found in the way he or she \n     treats others--and the person who regards other with love, \n     respect, and charity holds a priceless treasure in his heart. \n     With that in mind, I have often noted that, from now on in \n     America, any definition of a successful life must include \n     serving others. Your efforts provide a shining example of \n     this standard.\n       Barbara joins me in congratulating you and in sending you \n     our warm best wishes for the future. May God bless you \n     always.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      George Bush.\n\n  In addition to his role as a physician and community leader, Dr. \nFoster has had an illustrious career in academic medicine. In 1973, Dr. \nFoster became chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology \nat Meharry Medical College in Nashville, TN. As chairman and teacher, \nhe trained doctors to work intensively with the communities they \nserved--to treat the whole patient, not just a narrow specialty--to \nunderstand the issues and attitudes of patients, and to identify the \nbarriers that exist to the provision of quality health services.\n  As a medical educator, Dr. Foster made a lasting impact on the young \nphysicians he trained. One of his students, now a practicing \nobstetrician-gynecologist in California, wrote to the committee to \nsupport his nomination:\n\n       I offer a unique perspective to Dr. Foster. He had a \n     tremendous influence on my desire to be an OB/GYN. He taught \n     me while at Meharry, and at our rotation at Tuskegee \n     Institute. His bedside manner was gentle, his surgical \n     technique impeccable, his empathy for these young women \n     having their babies exemplary. I would say it was he who had \n     the most profound influence on me to go into obstetrics.\n\n  This physician goes on to write:\n\n       I offer, also, a unique perspective as I was one of about \n     eight Caucasian students in a class of about 90 Blacks. I was \n     the minority. And yet, I couldn't have felt more comfortable, \n     mainly because of the efforts of men like Dr. Foster.\n       As for the abortion issue, I would only state that he was \n     training me right about the time Roe vs. Wade was in front of \n     the Supreme Court. I am sure he often saw, as I did, the \n     results of women taking medical care into their own hands \n     when abortion was illegal. They would often be left \n     permanently infertile, and some would even die. [[Page S \n     8809]] \n       This man is not only a good man, he is a great man. He \n     represents to me what every student, at whatever level they \n     would be at, should have--a professor who puts his arm around \n     your shoulder, who cares about you both personally and \n     professionally, who takes you under his wing; and as a \n     student, you are proud to be under his wing.\n       I have not seen Dr. Foster since I graduated from Meharry \n     Medical College in June of 1974, but I have often thought of \n     him as I have practiced medicine these past 17 years. To not \n     allow him to serve his country would be a greater loss for \n     our country than it would be for him.\n       Senators, don't blow it, there are too few men like him.\n\n  For the past 21 years, Dr. Foster has trained hundreds of America's \nfinest practitioners. He served as chairman of the Department of \nObstetrics and Gynecology from 1973 to 1990, and went on to become dean \nof the School of Medicine and vice president for health services at \nMeharry from 1990 to 1993. Dr. Foster served as acting president of \nMeharry Medical College from October 1993 until he left for sabbatical \nin June 1994. Since that time, he has been a health policy fellow at \nthe Association of Academic Health Centers.\n  Dr. David Satcher, director of the Federal Government's Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, also served as president of Meharry \nMedical College. He has testified to Dr. Foster's intellect, fairness, \nintegrity, and talent as a medical professional.\n  Among many other of his colleagues, Dr. Louis Sullivan, president of \nMorehouse School of Medicine and the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices under President Bush, testifies to Dr. Foster's ability, \nintellect, fairness and talents as a medical professional. He writes:\n\n       I have known Henry Foster for more than 40 years since our \n     undergraduate years at Morehouse College in Atlanta. In each \n     phase of our long association, I have found Dr. Foster to be \n     an extremely capable scholar, vigorously dedicated to his \n     patients, an inspiring teacher, an innovative administrator, \n     and a trusted friend of young people . . . Dr. Henry Foster \n     would be an able, credible and trusted advocate. His warmth \n     and sincerity make him an ideal spokesperson for good health \n     and behavior change.\n\n  There is no question that Dr. Foster has devoted his life and career \nto improving the health of mothers and infants, reducing teenage \npregnancy, and training skilled doctors in the responsible and \ncompetent practice of medicine. Through his work as a physician, as a \nmedical educator, and as a community leader, he has made significant \ncontributions that have improved the lives of those he has served.\n  Within the field of medicine, Dr. Foster has been recognized by his \npeers as a leader in his profession, a physician of unusual stature \nwhose judgment is trusted in dealing with the most difficult questions \nof medical ethics and medical practice.\n  Any efforts to attack this nomination based on Dr. Foster's \ncredibility are dead wrong.\n  Dr. Foster has had an honorable and distinguished career in medicine. \nHe has been recognized by his professional colleagues and peers, his \ncommunity and his patients as having the highest ability, integrity and \ncompassion worthy of the post of Surgeon General.\n  Dr. Foster's vision for the health care of America is impressive, \ninnovative, practical, and progressive.\n  With this nomination, the nation has an unprecedented opportunity to \ndeal more effectively with some of the most difficult challenges facing \nus in health care today, and to do so under the leadership of an \noutstanding physician and outstanding human being, who has devoted his \nlife to providing health care and opportunity to those who need help \nthe most.\n  Opponents of this nomination continue to raise irresponsible \nobjections based on certain specific questions about Dr. Foster's \nrecord. They have selectively chosen issues on which to base their \nobjections, but they refuse to tell the whole story of Dr. Foster's \ncommitment, credibility, and extraordinary qualifications that make him \nan excellent choice for Surgeon General.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to address these objections \nagain and shed light on the facts that opponents do not want \nilluminated to give the complete story on Dr. Foster's record.\n\n\n                      The Tuskegee Syphilis study\n\n  Some opponents to this nomination allege that Dr. Foster, a black \nphysician in the rural South in the late 1960's, knew about and \nacquiesced in one of the worst abuses ever committed by the U.S. \nGovernment against black Americans since the Civil War. The allegation \nis preposterous on its face. Dr. Foster convincingly refuted it.\n  The committee has documents which clearly show that Dr. Foster was \ndelivering a baby in a complicated procedure at the time of the meeting \nhe supposedly attended in 1969 between the Public Health Service and \nthe Macon County Medical Society.\n  None of the doctors at the meeting, except for one, Dr. McRae, place \nDr. Foster at the meeting. And even Dr. McRae himself has admitted that \nthe Federal officials at the meeting did not disclose that the patients \nin the study were not being treated for their illness.\n  The record gives every indication that the PHS officials glossed over \nthe details of the study, and did not give the local doctors the true \nfacts. So even if Dr. Foster had been there, which he was not, he would \nnot have learned enough about the study to raise suspicion.\n  A physician named Dr. Ira Myers testified in 1974 that he had spoken \nwith Dr. Foster about the study. But the date of their conversation is \nunclear, and there is no evidence that it occurred before, rather than \nafter, the public scandal first broke in 1972.\n  In fact, Dr. Myers has rejected efforts to twist his testimony, and \nhe has publicly supported Dr. Foster's recollection of their meeting.\n  There is ample evidence that Dr. Foster had no knowledge of the study \nuntil it was publicly disclosed in 1972, and that, upon learning of the \nstudy, he was outraged and called for the immediate treatment of the \nsurviving patients.\n  Although it took 8 months for the U.S. Department of Health, \nEducation and Welfare to provide that treatment, it is unfair to blame \nDr. Foster for HEW's delay.\n\n\n                    the ``I have a future'' program\n\n  Some opponents of this nomination have chosen to attack Dr. Foster's \nI Have a Future Program, which he started in order to combat teenage \npregnancy in the urban housing projects in Nashville in 1987.\n  Dr. Foster's opponents are reduced to the unseemly position of \nlooking for bad news with a microscope. But Dr. Foster's program has \nworked. It has given teenagers hope. It helps them to make responsible \nand sensible decisions. It encourages abstinence.\n  In establishing the I Have a Future Program, Dr. Foster went to the \nfamilies and community leaders first, and asked them what programs they \nthought teenagers needed. With the help of these parents and community \nleaders, he developed the program.\n  It gives teenagers a purpose for abstaining from sex and avoiding \nhigh risk sexual behavior. It helps them to focus instead on education, \njob skills, and personal responsibility.\n  In order to promote positive futures for its participants, the I Have \na Future Program provides a wide variety of training, programs, and \nservices. There is training in pre-employment skills; alcohol and drug \nuse prevention; conflict resolution and violence prevention; and family \nlife education.\n  Other activities include an entrepreneurship program, field trips and \ncultural outings, after-school tutoring, sports, art, and computer \ntraining.\n  The program has been criticized because it provides contraceptives to \nteenagers who choose to have sex. Distribution of contraceptives \nconstitutes a small part of the overall program. Opponents must \nrecognize, however, that this is the only responsible course to take in \nan environment where 74 percent of all teenagers have sex before the \nage of 15, and where 91 percent of their parents asked that a teen \npregnancy program make it easier for sexually active teenagers to get \nbirth control to prevent pregnancy and the spread of AIDs and other \nsexually transmitted diseases.\n  Those who say the program has been unsuccessful should talk to the \nteenagers in the program. There is no doubt that they\n think it works, especially when compared to their other options in the \nonly world they know, which is full of violence, drug abuse, schools \nthat to not teach, joblessness and hopelessness.\n\n  The participants are proud of their accomplishments. They have \ngraduated from high school. They have gone on to college. They think \nthey have a future--and in the real world they know, [[Page S \n8810]] thinking makes it so. Dr. Foster has lit a candle in their \nworld--while his critics prefer to curse the remaining darkness.\n  President George Bush thought the program was such a success that he \ndesignated it as one of his well-known ``Points of Light,'' a \nsignificant national honor.\n\n\n                                abortion\n\n  Republican opponents of a woman's right to choose are filibustering \nthis nomination because Dr. Foster, a distinguished obstetrician and \ngynecologist, participated in a small number of abortions during his \nlong and brilliant career.\n  From the beginning, the only real issue in this controversy has been \nabortion. All the other issues raised against Dr. Foster have \ndisappeared into thin air. They have no substance now, and they have \nnever had any substance. Dr. Foster has dispelled all of those \nobjections, and he has dispelled them beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  The die-hard opponents of a woman's right to choose are doing all \nthey can to block this nomination, because Dr. Foster participated in \nthis small number of abortions. But Dr. Foster is a baby doctor, not an \nabortion doctor. He has delivered thousands of healthy babies, often in \nthe most difficult circumstances of poverty and neglect.\n  Dr. Foster has also been charged with misleading the public by giving \nconflicting information about the number of abortions he performed.\n  Dr. Foster has acknowledged that he mistakenly spoke from memory in a \ndesire to provide immediate information. It is clear, and there is no \ndoubt in my mind, that Dr. Foster never intended to deceive the public.\n  He has since reviewed all available medical records, and has \ndetermined the number of procedures for which he is listed as physician \nof record.\n  It is time to end this numbers game. The most important point is that \nabortion is a legal medical procedure and a constitutionally protected \nright. Dr. Foster is an obstetrician and gynecologist, and it should be \nno surprise to anyone that he has participated in this procedure. To \nhave done so is not a disqualification for the Office of Surgeon \nGeneral of the United States. There is no justification for our \nRepublican colleagues to try to make it one.\n  In my view, it is Dr. Foster's opponents who have a credibility \nproblem, not Dr. Foster. They pretend to challenge his credibility on \nabortion, when in reality, as all of us know, they are trying to make \nabortion the issue indirectly, in a way that will not embarrass them. \nOne need only review Dr. Foster's record for the past 38 years to see \nthat his integrity, honesty, and credibility are beyond reproach.\n  Dr. Foster is a highly qualified physician who has devoted his life \nto improving health care for his patients and his community. His \nintegrity and ability shine through all the muck that has been raked \nagainst him. He will serve the Nation well as Surgeon General, and he \ndeserves the chance to do so.\n  He is a talented and passionate physician, a fine human being, and a \nremarkable role model of service to others. He has earned the right to \nhave his nomination considered by the entire Senate, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for cloture and give him the opportunity he \ndeserves.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of President Bush's letter to \nthe I Have a Future Program may be printed in the Record.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that a series of fact sheets on the \nnomination may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, March 15, 1991.\n     Volunteers and staff of the ``I Have A Future'' Program, \n         Meharry Medical College, Nashville, TN.\n       Dear Friends: I was delighted to learn of your outstanding \n     work in behalf of your community. Your generosity and \n     willingness to serve others merit the highest praise, and I \n     am pleased to recognize you as the 404th ``Daily Point of \n     Light.''\n       Since taking office as President, I have urged all \n     Americans to make community service central to their lives \n     and work. Judging by your active engagement in helping \n     others, it is clear that you understand this obligation.\n       We must not allow ourselves to be measured by the sum of \n     our possessions or the size of our bank accounts. The true \n     measure of any individual is found in the say he or she \n     treats others--and the person who regards others with love, \n     respect, and charity holds a priceless treasure in his heart. \n     With that in mind, I have often noted that, from now on in \n     America, any definition of a successful life must include \n     serving others. Your efforts provide a shining example of \n     this standard.\n       Barbara joins me in congratulating you in sending you our \n     warm best wishes for the future. May God bless you always.\n           Sincerely,\n     George Bush.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               Dr. Foster and the Tuskegee Study--Summary\n\n       In 1932, the Public Health Service (PHS) began a study of \n     600 black men in Macon County, Alabama, some 400 of whom had \n     syphilis. The disease was not infectious in the 400 men, but \n     held real health dangers for them. PHS assured the State that \n     it would treat the men, but did not, even when penicillin \n     became available. The men were not informed of the study by \n     PHS, but thought that they were being treated. From roughly \n     1935 to 1945, PHS actively interfered with treatment of the \n     men.\n       By the time Dr. Foster came to Tuskegee in 1965, the Study \n     was far different than in 1935-1945. Barriers to treatment \n     had crumbled, and by 1965 all but one of the men had received \n     treatment from some local doctor or other source outside the \n     Study. PHS obscured the Study, with misleading information as \n     to treatment and consent in medical journals and locally. \n     Even those providing services to PHS, such as X-rays, knew \n     nothing.\n       PHS re-examined the study in February 1969, and arranged to \n     meet with the local Medical Society on May 19, 1969. The PHS \n     officials were acutely aware of the racial aspect of the \n     Study, and the strong evidence is that they did not tell the \n     black Tuskegee physicians that they were withholding \n     treatment from black men without the men's knowledge or \n     consent, or ask the black doctors to endorse such practices. \n     Indeed, the evidence is that PHS told them that all of the \n     men had received effective treatment, and gave a report of \n     procedures for their ``continued'' care. Indeed, PHS finally \n     did begin to provide medical information about the men to \n     their local physicians in 1970.\n       One person, Dr. Luther McRae, has stated that Dr. Foster \n     attended the May 19, 1969 meeting. No other person supports \n     this recollection, and no document places Dr. Foster at the \n     meeting. Official state medical records provide strong \n     evidence that at the time of the May 19, 1969 meeting, Dr. \n     Foster was delivering a baby. These records are far more \n     reliable than the memory of Dr. McRae, whose license to \n     practice medicine was revoked in 1985 for the improper \n     distribution of controlled substances. Nor is there any \n     evidence at all that any Society member at the meeting ever \n     discussed it afterwards with Dr. Foster or any other person. \n     Even Dr. McRae indicates that the PHS presentation was so \n     unremarkable that he never mentioned it to anyone. When the \n     full story of black men misled and untreated came to light in \n     1972, the shock of Dr. Foster and the other Macon County \n     doctors was entirely genuine.\n       The other source of information about the Study was medical \n     articles in specialty journals unlikely to be read by Dr. \n     Foster. The articles are at times misleading, and in \n     themselves did not alert even those national newspapers \n     provided with copies in 1969 to the nature of the Study. To \n     condemn Dr. Foster on the strength of these articles would be \n     to condemn every member of the medical profession who \n     practiced prior to 1972.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                             Fact Statement\n\n       In 1932, the federal government's Public Health Service \n     commenced its ``Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Male Negro \n     in Macon County, Alabama.'' The subjects were not aware of \n     the purpose of the study or even that they had syphilis. The \n     study's purpose was to observe the effects of untreated \n     syphilis, not to treat it.\n       In February 1969, at least partially in response to \n     concerns about the racial, social, and moral implications of \n     the study, the CDC convened an Ad Hoc blue-ribbon panel to \n     consider whether to continue the study. At that meeting, the \n     panel discussed whether to commence treatment of the \n     untreated subjects, and devoted considerable discussion to \n     the fact that treatment at that point was unlikely to do much \n     good and might be dangerous.\n       They agreed to continue the study, but also to try to bring \n     local physicians on board. Communications prior to the \n     meeting as well as the minutes reflect that the CDC was \n     concerned that it had a potentially explosive story on its \n     hands, and several passages suggest that CDC doctors thought \n     obtaining the concurrence of the Macon County doctors would \n     provide protection from criticisms of the study. One comment \n     referred to bringing the doctors on board as ``good public \n     relations.''\n       On May 19, 1969, a meeting was held in Tuskegee, Alabama \n     between the CDC and some members of the Macon County Medical \n     Society. The CDC was represented by Dr. William J. Brown and \n     Dr. Alphonso Holguin. Exactly what occurred at the May \n     meeting is unclear, but what does seem clear is that the \n     briefing was relatively short--the Macon County doctors who \n     recall it estimate that it [[Page S 8811]] lasted between ten \n     and twenty minutes--and that crucial details of the study \n     were not disclosed.\n       Indeed, the Macon County doctors who recall the meeting, \n     never understood the single most important fact about the \n     study--namely that the study was designed to observe \n     untreated syphilis and that participants were not supposed to \n     be treated. Moreover, none of the doctors recalls that the \n     members of the Medical Society were asked, or agreed, to \n     withhold treatment from the subjects.\n       Dr. Settler, the Secretary-Treasurer of the Medical Society \n     in 1969, states that he remembers no discussion of treatment \n     and no consent by the Medical Society to continuation of a \n     study of untreated syphilis. In 1972, the Montgomery \n     Advertiser reported that Dr. Settler had informed the \n     Advertiser that Medical Society ``members agreed to continue \n     the program, but consented under the assumption that the \n     patients were receiving treatment for the disease. `We were \n     never really informed of a project in which people were not \n     being treated,' he said.''\n       The Advertiser also reported in 1972 that Dr. Brown, the \n     former chief of the venereal disease branch of the Center for \n     Disease Control, ``conceded that there might have been a \n     misunderstanding over certain details of the program \n     discussed with Macon County physicians in 1969, but there was \n     no intention on his or Dr. Holguin's part to mislead the \n     society.''\n       Whatever the intentions of the CDC doctors, it seems clear \n     that Dr. Brown's concession was accurate: there was a \n     significant misunderstanding between federal officials and \n     Macon County Medical Society members regarding the nature of \n     the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. Any ``consent'' by the Medical \n     Society to continuation of the study was based on incomplete \n     and inadequate information.\n       Who attended the May 19 meeting is also unclear. Ten \n     doctors have been identified by at least one person as being \n     present at a meeting of the Macon County Medical Society at \n     which a briefing on the Tuskegee Syphilis Study was \n     presented, but half do not remember being present at such a \n     meeting. Most who remember the meeting could not place the \n     meeting in 1969.\n       Of those who recall being present at the meeting, each has \n     memories of the meeting that differ significantly from the \n     memories of the others. Only one--Dr. McRae, President of the \n     Medical Society in 1969--says that he recalls that Dr. Foster \n     was present. Another recalls that Dr. Foster was not present. \n     Moreover, Dr. McRae recalls the presence of other doctors who \n     do not recall the meeting.\n       Dr. McRae's recollections on a number of points ranging \n     from how the May meeting was set up, to the nature of the \n     Study, to Dr. Foster's role following the public disclosure \n     of the Study in 1972 are all inconsistent with the facts as \n     established by the documentary evidence. The confusion and \n     mixing of memories after 26 years is not surprising.\n       The CDC doctors have also indicated that they believe the \n     local Macon County physicians must have known about the \n     Tuskegee Study in 1969, even without the briefing from the \n     CDC. But on March 13, 1969, Dr. Ira Myers, the Alabama State \n     Health Officer, wrote to CDC's Dr. Brown that Dr. Myers had \n     discussed the proposed meeting with Dr. Ruth Berrey, the \n     County Health Officer, ``and she knows of no opposition to \n     the project at this time. She feels that it is not generally \n     known or publicized. She doubts if the Medical Society is \n     aware of its existence but hopes they will be sympathetic \n     with the desires of the Public Health Service'' (emphasis \n     added). This contemporaneous evidence from a doctor who knew \n     the local Macon County physicians clearly refutes the \n     assumption of the federal officials that all the Medical \n     Society doctors knew about, much less understood the details \n     of, the Tuskegee Syphilis Study.\n       This is what Fred Grey, the lawyer who sued the federal \n     government on behalf of the Study participants, says about \n     the local Tuskegee doctors:\n       ``I don't believe they were aware of the details of the \n     study. I think they probably were as much victims as were the \n     participants themselves.'' (CBS Evening News, 2/24/95)\n       ``Our research showed that the only ones who really made \n     decisions were persons connected with the federal government \n     and the (state) health department. Our research showed that \n     none of the local doctors were responsible for the study.'' \n     (The Washington Post, 2/25/95)\n       Broadus Butler, former President of Dillard University and \n     head of the Ad-Hoc Commission appointed by HEW to review the \n     Tuskegee Study, is equally clear that the local doctors had \n     nothing to do with the Study:\n       ``What was clear from our review is that this was a federal \n     government study from start to finish, with no input or \n     participation from local Tuskegee doctors. Any effort to \n     assign blame to the local doctors--most of whom weren't even \n     aware of the study until the very end and then were not aware \n     of critical details--is terribly misplaced.\n       ``There were really only two issues concerning this study: \n     first, whether it should ever have taken place; second, \n     whether it should have been stopped in the late 1940s when \n     penicillin became widely available. These decisions were made \n     solely by the federal government. By 1968, one of the study \n     researchers advised the team and the federal government that \n     treatment was no longer a viable option.'' (2/24/95)\n                                                                    ____\n\n                 Dr. Foster and His Record on Abortion\n\n       Dr. Henry Foster is one of the nation's leading physicians \n     and medical educators. During his 38-year career as an \n     obstetrician/gynecologist, he has delivered thousands of \n     babies and instructed hundreds of young physicians. From \n     1990-93, Dr. Foster served as the Dean, School of Medicine, \n     Meharry Medical College in Nashville, after having served as \n     the Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology \n     and Chief of the Obstetrics Unit of the Hubbard Hospital for \n     seventeen years. Before coming to Meharry, Dr. Foster served \n     as the Chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the John A. \n     Andrew Memorial Hospital at Tuskegee Institute, Alabama, \n     where he also established and was the Director of the \n     Maternity and Infant Care Project. In these programs and \n     through the creation of the ``I Have a Future'' Program in \n     lower-income areas of Nashville, Dr. Foster has worked to \n     prevent unwanted pregnancies.\n       Much debate over the nomination of Dr. Foster to be Surgeon \n     General of the United States has centered on the issue of \n     abortion. Critics charge that Dr. Foster has promoted \n     abortion, provided misleading accounts of his abortion \n     practices, and has encouraged the development of drugs for \n     abortion. This paper examines Dr. Foster's views on abortion, \n     his practices, and his participation in a nationwide clinical \n     trial funded by the Upjohn Company.\n\n\n                       i. statements and writings\n\n       Critics contend that Dr. Foster has encouraged the use of \n     abortion as a contraceptive and has promoted abortion in his \n     speeches, writings and activities such as Planned Parenthood.\n       Dr. Foster has consistently advocated greater access to \n     maternal and child health care, particularly for low-income \n     communities. He also has encouraged both abstinence, as in \n     the ``I Have a Future'' program, and family planning where \n     appropriate.\n       However, he has explicitly disavowed the use of abortion as \n     a contraceptive. In a 1975 presentation entitled ``Family \n     Planning and the Black Community,'' Dr. Foster voiced his \n     belief that women should use birth control measures to \n     prevent unwanted pregnancies, rather than rely on abortions.\n       Dr. Foster also has consistently supported adequate \n     counseling for patients who are considering pregnancy \n     termination. He has vocalized the need for informed consent \n     for a patient to make this personal decision. As the account \n     of one former patient demonstrates, Dr. Foster has in fact \n     counseled women not to terminate their pregnancy.\n       Dr. Foster's association with Planned Parenthood \n     demonstrates his belief that Roe versus Wade struck an \n     appropriate balance between the state's interest in health \n     and the patient's interest in making a decision about her \n     pregnancy. Dr. Foster has repeatedly voiced his concern that \n     women be afforded their constitutional right to choose \n     whether or not to terminate their pregnancies. He has stated \n     that ``abortions should be safe, legal and rare.'' In a \n     speech to Planned Parenthood in 1984, Dr. Foster argued \n     against overly burdensome state-imposed barriers to access to \n     abortion, because they would have encouraged resort to \n     unsafe, clandestine abortions.\n       Thus, an examination of Dr. Foster's statements, writings, \n     and activities shows that he has supported access to \n     abortion, but has not promoted the procedure as a substitute \n     for abstinence, education or family planning.\n\n\n                     ii. participation in abortions\n\n       Dr. Foster has admitted that he made a mistake by guessing \n     the number of abortions he performed without first consulting \n     the medical records. To rectify that problem, he asked \n     Meharry Medical College to search its records to determine \n     the number of abortion procedures that he performed or \n     participated in.\n       As the attached letter form the General Counsel of the \n     Meharry Medical College states, Meharry Medical College/\n     Hubbard Hospital searched its records and found that Dr. \n     Foster had performed or participated in 39 abortions during \n     his tenure from 1973-1990. It should be noted that this \n     period includes the entire post-Roe versus Wade era. \n     Additionally, Meharry Medical College records indicate that \n     for approximately three-quarters of these 39 patients, \n     another physician or resident participated in or performed \n     the abortion procedure.\n       The John Andrew Memorial Hospital in Tuskegee Institute has \n     been closed for several years and records covering Dr. \n     Foster's tenure were not available for a search.\n\n\n               iii. medical research and the upjohn study\n\n       During the 1980's, the Upjohn Company sponsored an FDA-\n     approved, multi-center clinical trial throughout the country \n     to determine the safety and efficacy of a drug--methyl ester \n     prostaglandin--for use in inducing abortions. Upjohn's study \n     tested whether administering this drug in a suppository form \n     could provide a safe and less expensive way of performing a \n     legal, medically accepted procedure.\n       While Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and \n     Gynecology at Meharry Medical College and Hubbard Hospital, \n     Dr. Foster served as the principal investigator for the \n     Meharry site, one of numerous sites for the Upjohn study \n     throughout the country. The clinical trial at the Meharry \n     site was part of a research project conducted in an academic [[Page S \n     8812]] setting. All medical procedures were performed in the \n     university hospital. All patients were volunteers who were \n     legally approved for pregnancy termination in the State of \n     Tennessee.\n       The clinical trial at the Meharry site was subjected to \n     outside oversight and review. FDA regulations require that an \n     institutional review board review and approve all clinical \n     trials such as the Upjohn study. FDA regulations at the time \n     required that the institutional review board consist of lay \n     persons of various expertise and backgrounds. The Meharry \n     site had such institutional review panels overseeing the \n     Upjohn study.\n       Dr. Foster served as the principal investigator or grant \n     administrator for the Meharry site. Residents administered \n     the suppositories. As grant administrator, Dr. Foster did \n     have certain responsibilities. FDA regulations specify that \n     the duties of the investigator include ensuring the \n     consistency of the investigation with the FDA-approved plan \n     and applicable regulations, ensuring proper procedures are \n     followed as well as protecting the rights, safety and welfare \n     of those taking part in the clinical trial.\n       Dr. Foster published in 1985 an article summarizing the \n     results of the administration of the Upjohn product to a \n     group of 60 women who were eight or fewer weeks' pregnant. As \n     discussed in the article, the study criteria for success \n     included safety, efficacy and patient acceptability. Fifty-\n     five of the women had successful results measured by these \n     criteria; four women required hospitalization and follow up \n     procedures. One woman withdrew from the study.\n       Dr. Foster's work as the principal investigator for the \n     Meharry site was consistent with his responsibilities as \n     Department Head to allow opportunities for research into \n     methods for improving legal, medically accepted procedures. \n     Such research projects also are consistent with the standards \n     for accreditation of medical schools. Guidelines published by \n     the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education \n     state:\n       ``The quality of the educational experience within a \n     department of obstetrics and gynecology is enhanced by an \n     active research environment. It is highly desirable that \n     every program encourage each resident to be involved in a \n     research project.''\n\n     Additionally, these guidelines provide that teaching staff \n     should take part in scholarly activity, including research \n     projects that result in publications.\n       As a postscript, it is worth noting that Upjohn eventually \n     determined not to seek FDA approval for the drug that was the \n     subject of the study.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                       Dr. Foster and Credibility\n\n       Dr. Henry Foster's career in medicine has been a model of \n     integrity and commitment to ethical conduct.\n       It is, by now, well known that Dr. Foster has devoted his \n     38 years of practice to improving the health care of mothers \n     and babies, reducing teenage pregnancy and caring for those \n     who too often go without care.\n       What may be less well known is that Dr. Foster has been \n     recognized by his peers, time and again, as a leader in his \n     profession, a man of unusual stature, a physician whose \n     judgment is trusted in grappling with the ethics of medicine \n     and medical practice. If the truest test of professional \n     character is the esteem with which one is held by his \n     colleagues, Dr. Foster stands in the top rank.\n       The Institute of Medicine. Dr. Foster has served on the \n     prestigious Institute of Medicine since 1972. The Institute \n     was chartered in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences to \n     promote the advancement of the health sciences and the \n     improvement of health care. The Institute was designed to \n     enlist distinguished members of the medical and other \n     professions in pursuit of these goals.\n       The Institute is a highly selective professional body, with \n     only 500 regular members, each of whom must be nominated by a \n     current member and elected by the full membership. The \n     Institute is governed by a Council of just 21 members, \n     elected by the entire membership.\n       In 1992, the full membership recognized Dr. Foster's \n     distinguished service for the Institute--where he has served \n     on numerous committees and boards--by electing him to the \n     governing Council. The membership elected him to a second \n     term of the Council in November 1994.\n       The Ethics Advisory Board. In 1978, then HEW Secretary Joe \n     Califano created the Ethics Advisory Board to examine the \n     moral and ethical questions raised by the historic \n     breakthroughs being made in the world of medical science. He \n     appointed Dr. Foster as one of the Board's 15 members from a \n     large group of nominations submitted by professional \n     associations, scientific societies, public interest groups \n     and Members of Congress.\n       The Board was an extraordinary collection of doctors, \n     lawyers, clinicians, researchers and even a leading \n     theologian, Rev. Richard McCormick of Georgetown University. \n     Members included James Gaither, a former advisor to President \n     Johnson and subsequent President of the Stanford University \n     Board of Trustees; Dr. David Hamburg, a former President of \n     the Institute of Medicine and now President of the Carnegie \n     Corporation of New York; Dr. Daniel Tosteson, Dean of the \n     Harvard Medical School for the past 20 years; and Dr. Sissela \n     Bok, Harvard ethicist and philosopher.\n       The Ethics Advisory Board was active from 1978 to 1980. In \n     1980, Congress established its own commission on medical \n     ethics (the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical \n     Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research) \n     and the EAB's appropriations were shifted to this new body.\n       Nashville Academy of Medicine--Ethics Committee. Dr. Foster \n     is one of 10 members of the 1400-member Nashville Academy of \n     Medicine who serve on the Academy's Ethics Committee.\n       The function of the Ethics Committee is to act as a \n     tribunal for the discipline of Academy members when \n     complaints are received by other physicians concerning a \n     member's professional conduct.\n       According to the Academy's Executive Director, Dr. Foster \n     was chosen by the Board of Directors to serve on the Ethics \n     Committee because of his ``outstanding reputation in the \n     medical community.'' Dr. Foster has served on the Committee \n     for 10 years.\n       In short, those opponents of Dr. Foster's nomination who \n     pretend to base their opposition on his lack of credibility \n     or integrity are flying in the face of a career's worth of \n     honorable and distinguished conduct, recognized as such by \n     Dr. Foster's professional colleagues and peers.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                      Meharry Medical College,\n\n                                                    Nashville, TN.\n     To Whom It May Concern:\n       Pursuant to a request by Dr. Henry Foster, Jr., we have \n     undertaken a search of the medical records of Meharry Medical \n     College pertaining to operations performed by Dr. Foster \n     during the years 1973-90. Our records indicate that Dr. \n     Foster participated in or performed 39 abortions, not \n     including termination of tubal pregnancies or follow-up \n     procedures made necessary by incomplete and/or spontaneous \n     abortions. Our records also indicate that in approximately \n     three quarters of these procedures, at least one other \n     physician or a resident performed or participated in the \n     surgery, in addition to Dr. Foster.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                         Richard E. Jackson, J.D.,\n     General Counsel.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                      Dr. Foster and Sterilization\n\n       In the 1960's and early 1970's, Dr. Foster performed a \n     small number of therapeutic sterilizations on severely \n     mentally retarded women. Some people have sought to distort \n     this information by failing to place Dr. Foster's practice in \n     the context of the time and prevailing medical practice.\n       In August 1974, Dr. Foster delivered a paper before a \n     meeting of the National Medical Association that included a \n     discussion of the hysterectomies he had performed between May \n     1963 and May 1973. The paper, which was published in 1976, \n     includes a bar chart showing that, among other seasons for \n     performing hysterectomies to remove normal uteruses, he had \n     performed four such procedures on severely mentally retarded \n     women. Dr. Foster noted that hysterectomies could be \n     performed on women with severe mental retardation ``either \n     for sterilization or to eliminate the menses which is of \n     significant hygienic benefit. . .'' See Henry W. Foster, Jr., \n     Removal of the Normal Uterus, 69 Southern Medical Journal 13, \n     15 (1976).\n       Dr. James Todd, Vice President of the American Medical \n     Association has confirmed that performing hysterectomies on \n     severely retarded women for pregnancy prevention or to \n     eliminate the menses for hygienic purposes ``was thought to \n     be the state of medicine back then.'' So has Dr. Joseph \n     Gambone, Acting Director of Reproductive Endocrinology at \n     UCLA, who indicates that the practice was common at the time. \n     Dr. Luigi Mastroianni, a professor of obstetrics and \n     gynecology who heads the division of human reproduction at \n     the University of Pennsylvania, has said such procedures \n     ``were the most humane method we had to allow people with \n     severe mental deficiency to have any comfort at all.''\n       In that same 1976 article, Dr. Foster stressed that \n     ``obstetricians and gynecologists must guard vigilantly \n     against the injudicious and indiscriminate removal of the \n     normal uterus.'' Dr. Arthur Caplan, Director of the Center \n     for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, has said \n     that Dr. Foster's 1974 paper on this subject ``represents an \n     enlightened and cutting-edge opinion about the need for \n     caution and care with respect to that form of surgical \n     sterilization.''\n       By the late 1970's, medical practice and legal standards \n     had shifted, as had Dr. Foster's views. In 1980, Dr. Foster \n     wrote: ``It is understood if the patient is judged to be \n     incapable of comprehending and thus not able to provide an \n     informed consent, she must not be sterilized.'' See Henry W. \n     Foster, Jr., Ambulatory Gynecologic Surgery, in Ambulatory \n     Obstetrics & Gynecology 399, 416 (George Ryan ed. 1980).\n       At all times, Dr. Foster's practice has been consistent \n     with prevailing medical norms. In many ways, as Dr. Caplan's \n     comments reveal, Dr. Foster has been ahead of his time on \n     these issues.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                   Dr. Foster and Planned Parenthood\n\n       Planned Parenthood is a health care organization which \n     manages nearly 1,000 health centers in 49 states and the \n     District of Columbia. Planned Parenthood serves four million \n     women and men each year, making it the nation's largest \n     provider of comprehensive reproductive health care, including \n     breast examinations, PAP tests, testing and treatment for \n     sexually transmitted diseases, [[Page S 8813]] infertility \n     services, birth control methods and counseling, and \n     comprehensive sexuality education. Dr. Foster has served on \n     local and national Planned Parenthood boards since 1974.\n       Planned Parenthood and Dr. Foster share the mission of \n     resolving our nation's most troubling health crisis by \n     providing effective solutions which focus on prevention and \n     responsibility. Throughout his career, Dr. Foster has been a \n     driving force in the prevention of teen pregnancy and a \n     leader in the field of public health. The highly effective, \n     ``I Have a Future'' program, which Dr. Foster developed, \n     stresses sexual responsibility, self-control, education, and \n     job skills and provides positive alternatives to having \n     children. Similarly, Planned Parenthood's medical and \n     educational services help prevent nearly half a million \n     unintended pregnancies each year.\n       Although Dr. Foster does not advocate abortions as a \n     substitute for family planning, he supports Planned \n     Parenthood's efforts to provide abortion services when a \n     woman chooses to have the legal, constitutionally-protected \n     procedure. Dr. Foster has repeatedly voiced his concern that \n     all women have access to reproductive health care, including \n     abortion. He also has supported Planned Parenthood's efforts \n     to secure the passage of the Freedom of Access to Clinic \n     Entrances Act, legislation designed to protect patients and \n     staff at women's health care centers.\n       While Dr. Foster was a member of the organization's Board \n     of Directors, the Nashville affiliate filed a lawsuit \n     challenging a Tennessee law requiring parental notice before \n     a teenage girl could obtain an abortion. Dr. Foster has \n     sought to involve parents in their children's decisions to \n     obtain contraceptive or abortion services and strongly \n     believes that parents should be involved in these decisions. \n     He has worked to limit the number of abortions performed on \n     teenagers by promoting abstinence and alternatives to having \n     children through programs such as the ``I Have a Future'' \n     program. Dr. Foster realizes, however, that some young women \n     cannot notify their parents, because they come from homes \n     where physical violence or emotional abuse is prevalent or \n     because their pregnancy is the result of incest. Dr. Foster \n     opposed the Tennessee law because it required parental notice \n     for a minor seeking abortion with no exception for minors \n     from abusive homes and no bypass mechanism as required by the \n     United States Supreme Court.\n       To prevent unwanted pregnancies and to provide alternatives \n     to sexual activity, Dr. Foster looks primarily to parents and \n     families. He encourages parents to educate their children \n     about sexuality and reproductive health and to promote the \n     need to postpone premature sexual activity. Dr. Foster also \n     realizes that schools may play an important role in the \n     process and advocates developing age-appropriate educational \n     programs which promote abstinence and which prepare teenagers \n     for responsible sexual involvement as adults.\n                                                                    ____\n\n Dr. Foster and ``I Have A Future'': Using Abstinence to Prevent Teen \n                               Pregnancy\n\n       An examination of ``I Have A Future's'' teaching modules--\n     as well as the many supplemental materials [brochures, \n     videos, games, posters] they utilize--evidences the strong \n     abstinence message that is integral to the program. IHAF \n     promotes abstinence to prevent teen pregnancy in several \n     ways:\n       First, by stressing the value of abstinence and explaining \n     why it is so important.\n       Second, by involving the family and community in promoting \n     this value.\n       Most important, the program does not just say the word \n     ``abstinence'' a few times and leave it at that. IHAF devotes \n     considerable time and effort to giving teens the tools they \n     need to be responsible, to make good decisions and then stand \n     up for what they believe in, and, most importantly, to resist \n     social pressures to engage in sexual activity.\n\n\n                          i. ihaf's curriculum\n\n   A.

LANNING RISHER\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a man who is \nnot only a dear friend, but someone who in the course of his life has \ndone much to serve his State and Nation.\n  Col. Lanning Parsons Risher was born in 1931 to one of the most \ndistinguished and well-known families in South Carolina. His father ran \nthe well-respected Carlisle Military School in Bamberg and was \nrecognized throughout the State for his stature as an educator.\n  Completing his preparatory studies at Carlisle, Colonel Risher felt \ncomfortable in a military environment and decided to pursue his college \neducation at The Citadel, a rigorous and demanding institution with a \nreputation for producing leaders. Upon his graduation from The Citadel, \nLanning chose to serve his Nation in the military, earning a commission \nin the infantry of the U.S. Army.\n  After fulfilling his military obligation, Colonel Risher joined the \nteaching staff of his alma matter, the Carlisle Military School, where \nhe taught for 3 years. In 1958 a new opportunity and challenge \npresented itself to the young instructor and veteran, the chance to \nserve as the headmaster of the Camden Military Academy, a preparatory \nmilitary school. Grabbing the reins, the new headmaster set out to make \nthe Camden Military Academy a success.\n  For the past 38 years, Col. Lanning Parsons Risher has poured his \nvery life's blood into his school, working to not only make the academy \nprofitable, but to ensure that his students received an education that \ncould not be equaled by any other secondary military preparatory \nschool. I am proud to say that my friend has achieved his goals. Over \nthe past almost four decades, literally thousands of young boys entered \nCamden Military Academy and graduated as young men, capable and ready \nfor the challenges of the military, college, or whatever other endeavor \nthey believed to be their destiny.\n  Mr. President, at the end of April, Colonel Risher's long and \ndistinguished tenure as headmaster came to a close. I doubt a visit to \nthe school will ever be the same knowing that Colonel Risher is not \nsitting in his office, administering to the needs of his charges.\n  While I know that Lanning will no doubt miss the duties and \nresponsibilities of running Camden Military Academy, he can take great \npride in all that he has accomplished. Over the years, the colonel has \nreceived recognitions from a number of different groups. Committed to \ncommunity service, Colonel Risher has served as a member and officer of \nan impressive list of organizations which include, but are not limited \nto: a bank; patriotic and veterans groups; civic clubs; and \nprofessional associations. There is no question that the city of Camden \nand the State of South Carolina have benefited from Lanning Risher's \ninterest and commitment to so many worthwhile endeavors.\n  In addition to meeting the demands of running the academy and being \ncivically involved, Colonel Risher also managed to find time to pursue \nand earn a master's degree from the University of South Carolina and \nraise a family. Lanning and his lovely wife, Deane, raised five \ndaughters--Julie, Helen Dean, Virginia, Mary, and, Kathleen--who have \nall grown into fine young women.\n  Mr. President, after a long and full career as a soldier and \neducator, Col. Lanning P. Risher has earned a well deserved rest. We \nare grateful for the colonel's many years of service to his community, \nState, and Nation. Through his work, he has given thousands of young \nmen the skills they require to be successful in their lives, instilling \nin them the values of a sound education, responsibility for themselves, \nand a love for their Nation. His former students are more than grateful \nfor his influence on their lives, and they will always remember the \ncontribution he made to their success.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8817-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8817-S8818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           A LEADER MOVES ON\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Sister Janice Ryan recently announced that \nshe will be giving up the presidency of Trinity College in Burlington \nnext July after 17 years of service. I note this news with sadness, \nthanks and with hope.\n  I am sad because the kind of leadership Sister Janice embodies is \nfound in so few people on this Earth. She has committed her life to \nimproving the lot of others. She has been a tireless advocate for the \ndisadvantaged. She has been an inspiring leader in the field of higher \neducation in Vermont. She has been a stirring role model for the \nthousands of students at Trinity College, most of them young women, who \nhave seen the power and force of a gifted educator and administrator.\n  Sister Janice has done all this with competence, a sense of humor and \nthe grace that comes from a confidence grounded in logic, reason and \nfaith.\n  When Sister Janice Ryan speaks, people listen. She does her homework. \nShe is political in the best sense of the word. She understands the \ncomplexity of the decision making process, and knows how to work to \nchange the system in ways that will further the interests of those in \nwhose name she speaks.\n  Sister Janice is not retiring She is moving on to another chapter in \nher life, which I know will be as challenging and rewarding and \nfulfilling as the chapter that will soon close.\n  We need more people like Sister Janice Ryan everywhere. But we in \nVermont are especially proud to have been graced by the presence of an \nexceptional native daughter of our Green Mountain State.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include a recent article \nand editorial about my good friend Sister Janice Ryan that appeared in \nthe Burlington Free Press. My wife Marcelle, and I wish her Godspeed.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S 8818]]\n\n          [From the Burlington (VT) Free Press, May 16, 1995]\n\n                   Ryan To Retire From Trinity's Helm\n\n                            (By Molly Walsh)\n\n       After 17 years at the helm of Vermont's only women's \n     college, Trinity College President Janice Ryan has announced \n     she will leave the school in July 1996.\n       ``For Trinity and for me it just feels like the right \n     time,'' Ryan, a Roman Catholic nun, said Monday. ``We have \n     truly as a college been blessed.''\n       Friends, trustees and nuns in The Sisters of Mercy, the \n     order that founded Trinity and welcomed Ryan as a fresh-faced \n     farm girl in 1954, praised her vision, determination and \n     energy.\n       ``We would have liked to convince her to stay here for \n     another 17 years,'' said Christopher Weinheimer, Trinity \n     board of trustees chairman and treasurer of Fletcher Allen \n     Health Care. A national search for a successor is underway.\n       During Ryan's tenure, Trinity launched a successful \n     ``weekend college'' degree program, three new masters \n     programs and two major capital campaigns. It also established \n     a model scholarship program to help low-income single parents \n     receive an education.\n       It's the students, most of all, who make Ryan proud as she \n     looks back.\n       ``I've watched the young women over these 17 years and \n     honest to goodness, their abilities never cease to amaze \n     me,'' Ryan said.\n       Off campus, Ryan has served on dozens of boards and \n     community service projects, taking a special interest in \n     mentally retarded people of all ages and children with \n     special needs.\n       Ryan is the kind of person who would always find a way to \n     get un-stranded from the proverbial desert island, said \n     Trinity trustee Joan Sylvester, who has known Ryan for 20-odd \n     years.\n       No problem is too big for her.\n       ``She's like the little Duracell battery that goes on and \n     on,'' Sylvester said.\n       Ryan's resignation is not a surprise. Two years ago, she \n     declined to sign a fourth five-year contract. Trustees \n     persuaded her to stay at least through July 1996 to help \n     oversee a $5 million capital campaign.\n       To date, $4.4 million has been raised and a $1.9 million \n     reconstruction of Delehanty Hall, the college's primary \n     teaching facility, begins today.\n       One of six children in an Irish-Catholic family, Ryan's \n     early education in a one-room school house was followed by a \n     bachelor's from Trinity and a masters at Boston University in \n     1967.\n       Ryan's polished, dressed-for-success image is a contrast to \n     the nun who wore thick glasses with clunky, black frames and \n     the traditional long, black habit in the 1960s while she \n     taught at local parochial schools.\n       And far from the stereotype of a cloistered nun, Ryan is \n     known as an engaging dinner partner and a skilled fund-raiser \n     and networker.\n       Ryan sets a fine example of spirituality in action, said \n     Sister Lindora Cabral, Trinity trustee and president of the \n     Sisters of Mercy, Vermont Regional Community. ``To have \n     people realize that we're part of today's world * * * that's \n     a very important piece for us.''\n       Although she will always love Vermont, Ryan is interested \n     in policy-making work on an international level. ``She will \n     be missed,'' Cabral said. ``But whether she's in the area or \n     not, Trinity will always be a piece of her heart.''\n          [From the Burlington (VT) Free Press, May 18, 1995]\n\n                          Mission Still Undone\n\n       If Sister Janice Ryan doesn't eventually end up in a front-\n     line public service job serving Vermont's disadvantaged, her \n     resignation next year after 17 years as president of Trinity \n     College in Burlington won't just be a loss to the school. It \n     will be a missed opportunity for Vermont.\n       The time couldn't be better for an administrator of her \n     caliber and an advocate for the needy with her energy to take \n     a full turn in government service.\n       Examine the list of citizens likely to suffer the most from \n     federal budget-cutbacks and cost-shifts to states, and it \n     reads like a Who's Who of people Sister Janice has helped \n     before and during her time at Vermont's last remaining \n     women's-only college. Among them: the under-educated and \n     physically and mentally disadvantaged in particular; women in \n     general.\n       Public-service opportunities ahead become even more obvious \n     when you look at the enormous task Vermont state government \n     now faces: implementing welfare reform (whose largest group \n     is now poor, single women) while absorbing federal budget \n     cuts; making affordable the same special education law Sister \n     Janice helped pass in 1972, without undermining its equal-\n     access intent; and, most important, defending the basic tenet \n     of modern government now at risk of being forgotten--\n     retaining a basic level of decency for the disadvantaged, not \n     as a luxury but as a moral and social imperative.\n       In short, Sister Janice's quiet, behind-the-scenes work at \n     both state and national levels on behalf of all such causes \n     isn't just a legacy for Trinity, it's a job description for \n     Vermont state government.\n       As for other women aspiring to leadership--whether within \n     or outside religious life--there are other secrets to be \n     found in Sister Janice's example and long tenure.\n       One: It isn't the loudest voice that wins; more often it's \n     the most persuasive and persistent. Just ask any Vermont \n     legislator who remembers the years of struggle by her and \n     other women to gain equal access to public schools for \n     Vermont's retarded and other mentally disadvantaged children. \n     Or any Vermont bishop who's found her on his doorstep ready \n     to discuss in private her views on controversial church \n     matters.\n       It's also testimony to what can happen when the boss--in \n     this case the Sisters of Mercy--says, both by design and \n     action, that a religious woman's role is, in fact, ``out \n     there,'' where the under-educated and the underprivileged \n     live.\n       Nor is this more public life without the usual pitfalls. \n     Sister Janice's predecessor at Trinity, Sister Elizabeth \n     Candon, found the transition from religious life and academia \n     a rocky one during her own pioneering tenure as human \n     services secretary in the contentious `70s. Yet in that \n     example is another lesson for any political leader today: \n     that it takes more than good intentions to balance the \n     fiercely competing interests of taxpayers and the needy; it \n     also takes an unusually effective mix of political acuity and \n     toughness.\n       While on one hand, education has long been one of the few \n     traditional ways American culture has accepted female \n     leaders, it's taken women like Sister Janice to take such \n     leadership to a new, higher level through innovation and \n     determination.\n       If the next few years produce the kind of budget restraints \n     Congress is calling for--Vermont and small states like it are \n     going to need all the persistent innovators like her they can \n     get.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8817-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8818-S8819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 UNITED STATES-JAPAN AUTO NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the President and Ambassador Kantor in their efforts to open \nJapan's auto and auto parts market.\n  In just 1 week, we are scheduled to impose sanctions on Japanese \nluxury cars. That is a last resort. I hope in these last few days \nJapan's auto companies will show themselves willing to accept a \nreasonable agreement. But if not, we will have no choice.\n\n\n                 STATUS OF UNITED STATES-JAPANESE TRADE\n\n  Japan has always had a good public relations operation. They have \ndone their best to present themselves as the victim in this issue. So \nbefore we look at the details of the auto issue, let us look at the big \nfacts.\n  For decades now, American business has met a Japanese market closed \nin all sorts of sectors. We have negotiated over semiconductors, glass, \ninsurance, apples, oranges, medical equipment, supercomputers, wood \nproducts, beef, and more.\n  In all these areas we had some success. Japan is now our largest beef \nmarket. We have sold a few supercomputers. The detail work has helped. \nBut we are still far away from open trade with Japan. The statistics \ntell the story. Let me include them for the Record.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 Imports\n                                                       Exports    from  \n                                                      to Japan    Japan \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1990................................................      48.6      89.7\n1991................................................      48.1      91.5\n1992................................................      47.8      97.4\n1993................................................      47.9     107.3\n1994................................................      53.5     119.1\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  To sum it up, since 1990 Japan's exports to the United States have \ngrown from $89.7 billion to $119.1 billion--an average of $7.35 billion \nper year. Our exports to Japan, by contrast, did not grow by a penny \nbetween 1990 and 1993. In fact they shrank. Only in 1994 did we improve \nat all.\n  So let us put all the complaints and talk of protectionism from Japan \naside. They are doing fine. If there was protectionism here, their \nexports would not have grown by $12 billion last year. And just today, \nfigures came out showing that in April, Japan sold us a record $2.4 \nbillion worth of cars. The problem is Japan's closed market.\n                       the framework negotiations\n\n  And that is what we began to address in 1993, in the so-called \nframework talks. These had three main baskets, as follows:\n  The United States agreed to cut its budget deficit.\n  Japan agreed to macroeconomic reforms--deregulation in particular--to \nreduce its worldwide current account surplus.\n  And both agreed on talks covering several specific sectors of the \nJapanese market: Insurance, telecommunications, patent law, medical \nequipment, and autos and auto parts.\n  Two years later, we have kept our part of the bargain. We have \nreduced the deficit by $500 billion over the 1993-98 budget years, and \nwe are on track to do even more this year. [[Page S 8819]] \n  In the second basket, Japan has made some halting steps toward \nderegulation. At least in part because of those steps, Japan's economy \nbegan to recover last year and we had a relatively good exporting year.\n  And in the third basket, we have agreements on medical equipment, \ntelecommunications, insurance, patent laws, and flat glass. But autos \nand auto parts remain unsolved. Japan has resisted all efforts at a \ndeal. And that is why we have a deadline next week.\n\n\n                       japan's closed auto sector\n\n  Let us now take a closer look at this issue. Autos and auto parts \naccount for close to two-thirds of our total trade imbalance with \nJapan. And the reason is that our auto and parts companies simply do \nnot have a fair deal in Japan. A coalition of big companies and \neconomic bureaucrats make sure Japanese dealers do not carry foreign \nproducts. And the effects are clear if we review some statistics.\n  In all the OECD countries but Japan, American auto parts average a \n20.4-percent market share. Our share of Japan's auto parts market is \n2.4 percent.\n  And in 1994, the world as a whole was able to export only 300,000 \nvehicles to Japan, where 6.5 million vehicles were sold.\n  This is a result of a deliberate policy to reserve Japan's auto \nmarket for domestic production. It began in the 1950's, when between \n1953 and 1960 the United States share of Japan's auto markets fell from \n60 to 0 percent. That is right. Zero.\n  It continues today, 40 years later. In 1993, for example, Japan's \nFair Trade Commission found that 47 percent of Japanese dealers think \nthey are prohibited from handling competing products, or worry their \ncurrent supplier would retaliate if they sold those products.\n                       autos and the u.s. economy\n\n  This is a critical issue for the American economy. Our automobile \nindustry makes up 4.6 percent of America's GDP. It is our largest \nmanufacturing employer, employing 2.3 million Americans. And it is one \nof the world's most efficient and productive industries.\n  Since 1990, the auto industry has spent $58.3 billion on new plants \nand equipment. Its R spending stands at $44 billion, behind only our \ncomputer industry. Cars like the Chrysler Neon, GM's Saturn or the Ford \nProbe show that this investment has paid off in cars that are the \nworld's standard for quality. There is no reason they cannot sell in \nJapan.\n  And these talks affect more than the automobile industry and its \nparts suppliers. They are critical for electronics, semiconductors, \nsteel, chemicals, aluminum, machine tools and more.\n  Let me give you one example. When you think about autos, you do not \noften think about Montana. But you should. Because the auto industry is \nthe aluminum industry's second largest market, and aluminum is a \ncritical Montana industry.\n  An average vehicle contains about 200 pounds of aluminum. So in 1993, \nthe aluminum industry shipped about 4.2 billion pounds of aluminum to \nthe transportation market. And if American autos sell in Japan, we open \na new export market for American aluminum and reduce some of the \nchronic oversupply on our domestic market.\n  So these talks are important not just in Washington, Detroit, and \nTokyo, but in the Flathead Valley.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  We should also remember that a good deal is good for Japan, too. \nJapanese citizens want cheaper cars. And Japanese surveys show a \nmajority of Japanese dealers want to sell imported cars. If we reach a \ngood agreement this week, both countries will benefit. The time to \nsettle this is now.\n  Finally, I have said before that the ultimate solution to our trade \nproblems with Japan lies not in trade policy, but in Japan's domestic \nregulatory and antimonopoly policies.\n  Broad reform of these areas would solve many problems which now \nappear to us as sectoral trade barriers. It would remove much of the \ntension which has pervaded our trade relationship over the past 20 \nyears. And it would be in the fundamental interest of Japan's consumers \nand domestic economic growth as well.\n  As Singapore's Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew said last May:\n\n       If Japan re-examines its past strategy, its leaders must \n     recognise that conditions have changed so fundamentally that \n     they have to break the mold of the last 50 year. That \n     strategy, which was designed to maximize exports and minimize \n     imports, will not limit Japan's role and damage its growth.\n\n  That is a long-term choice, and it is ultimately up to Japan. Until \nJapan's political leaders, business elite and--most of all--economic \nbureaucrats accept the choice, we will have to be firm, and autos are \nno exception. We have made fair offers, and there is no reason Japan \ncannot accept them. So let us stand behind the President and Ambassador \nKantor, and get the job done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8818-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8819-S8820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO HERBERT P. COLE, JR.\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Herbert P. \nCole, Jr., a great Alabamian and American who recently passed away in \nhis hometown of Mobile, AL.\n  Herb was born in Mobile on January 8, 1919, in an antebellum home \nknown as Oakleigh, which is now a symbol of Mobile and the South. He \nbegan his education at the University Military School and then \ngraduated from the Lawrenceville School in Lawrenceville, NJ, in 1938. \nThat fall he entered Princeton University. The dark clouds of World War \nII were plainly visible and influenced his studies at Princeton. \nDeciding that America's entry in the war was only a matter of time, he \nlearned to fly and joined the civilian pilot training program. In his \nsenior thesis, he combined his love for flying with his major, \neconomics. He concluded that America's aircraft industry could never \ngear up in time to be a factor in the war.\n  Upon graduation in June 1942, he set out to prove his conclusion \nwrong. He immediately joined the Navy as an aviation cadet. He found \nprimary training in Pensacola to be relatively easy since he had logged \nmore hours than his instructor had and, in fact, gave his instructor \nseveral pointers. Following carrier qualification in the Great Lakes, \nhe accepted a commission in the U.S. Marine Corps. When asked why he \nchose the Marines over the Navy, he would explain that the scuttlebutt \nwas that the Navy pilots would be kept State-side to serve as \ninstructors but the Marine aviators would be sent overseas. As was \ntypical of him, he was eager to get the job done and thus joined the \nMarines.\n  Once overseas, he was assigned to VMSB-341, the Flying Turtles, and \nflew the SDB Dauntless dive bomber. His missions included strikes \nagainst enemy ships and ground support against enemy forces on Rabaul \nand Guadalcanal, included missions to locate and destroy the infamous \n``Pistol Pete'' artillery piece. He earned the Air Medal for his \nactions in World War II.\n  Following the war, he returned to Mobile. In 1948, he married Valery \nConverse. He began his career in industrial sales with the Ruberoid \nCo., now known as GAF. Ruberoid moved Herb and his growing family \naround the South, first to Americus, GA, then to Jacksonville, FL, and \nfinally back to Mobile. When Ruberoid threatened to move him again, \nthis time somewhere up North, he quit. He had decided that no where in \nthe world were there any people as fine as the ones he knew in Alabama. \nHe then joined BLP Mobile Paint Co. as a salesman. He eventually became \nvice president for sales.\n  Herb Cole was not all work, though; he found time to enjoy his family \nand life. Rather than say goodbye, he would often leave his family with \nthe admonition, ``enjoy.'' Like many southerners, he was a sportsman. \nHe enjoyed sailing, hunting, fishing, and supporting the Crimson Tide \nof Alabama and the Tigers of Princeton. His greatest sports interest, \nthough, was golf. He was an avid golfer all of his life and shot five \nholes-in-one, including one when he was in his seventies.\n  In 1975, he took an early retirement from BLP Mobile Paint Co. \nAlthough he dabbled in real estate and other business ventures at this \ntime, he saw retirement as a time to continue to give to the community. \nHe served on the vestry at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Mobile, on \nthe board at the YMCA, and as a local representative for Princeton.\n  Probably Herbert's most memorable qualities were his deeply held \nChristian beliefs and his love for St. Paul's Church. The only place \nHerbert could [[Page S 8820]] be found on Sunday mornings would be on \nthe fourth pew from the rear in the chapel at St. Paul's Church, along \nwith his wife and four children.\n  In sum, Mr. President, any measure of a man one could take, Herbert \nCole met. He was intelligent, articulate, a loving and loved husband \nand father, a war hero, a successful businessman, and a devout \nChristian. My colleagues and I send our condolences to ``Miss Valery,'' \ntheir 4 children and 10 grandchildren. To Herbert Cole, I say ``Semper \nFidelis.''\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8819-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     U.S. SENATE PAGES, SPRING 1995\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE.

A bill to commemorate the service of First Ladies Jacqueline \nKennedy and Patricia Nixon to improving and maintaining the Executive \nResidence of the President and to authorize grants to the White House \nEndowment Fund in their memory to continue their work; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n    the white house endowment fund memorial grant authorization act\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, throughout our history as a \nnation the White House has served as a public \n[[Page S 8822]] symbol of the President and the Federal Government. \nDuring countless wars and national crises, we have looked to the White \nHouse for leadership.\n  The growth of our country, and the growth of its importance in the \nworld, has caused the number of visitors and the demands on the \nExecutive Residence of the President--the White House--to grow \nsubstantially. Over 1.5 million people visit the White House annually; \nit's the only Executive Residence in the world that is regularly open \nto the general public.\n  Eventually the burden of constant use and the neglect of our \nhistorical treasures left the White House in disrepair. Until recently \nthe White House was not maintained as a public building suitable for \nexhibiting our heritage and culture to the public.\n  In 1961, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy initiated the White House \nHistoric Preservation Program. The program's goals were to restore the \nhistoric integrity of the public rooms of the White House; to establish \na fine and decorative arts collection; and to establish the White House \nHistorical Association to publish and distribute educational materials \ndescribing the White House and its history.\n  Later that decade First Lady Pat Nixon provided new leadership by \noverseeing the most extensive acquisition of fine and decorative arts \nin the history of the White House. Her plan for refurbishment of the \npublic rooms remains intact after more than 20 years.\n  The fine and decorative arts donated to the White House during the \nleadership of Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Nixon, valued today at tens of \nmillions of dollars, far exceed those received during all other modern \nPresidential administrations combined.\n  With over 1.5 million visitors annually, the Executive Residence's \npublic rooms need constant care and complete refurbishing every 8 to 10 \nyears. To maintain the collection of fine arts, historic pieces must be \nacquired, loaned works must be acquired, reproductions need to be \nreplaced, and repairs need to be made.\n  First Lady Barbara Bush established the White House Endowment Fund in \n1990 to create a permanent endowment of $25,000,000 to maintain the \npublic rooms and collection of the White House. Although substantial \ncontributions have been received from the public, additional funds are \nneeded to complete the endowment.\n  Over the past 2 years we have lost Jacqueline Kennedy and Patricia \nNixon, who were among the finest First Ladies that have served our \ncountry. In recognition of their service in preserving and improving \nthe White House, and in their memory following their recent deaths, \ntoday I am introducing legislation to authorize a memorial grant to the \nWhite House Endowment Fund to continue preservation activities at the \nWhite House.\n  First Ladies Jacqueline Kennedy and Patricia Nixon devoted much of \ntheir service to preserving and improving the White House. They made it \na national showplace of American history, fine arts, and decorative \narts. Bestowing this honor on Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Nixon would be in \naccord with the well-established congressional precedent by which a \ngrateful nation recognizes noteworthy and enduring contributions to the \npublic interest with memorial gifts. I hope all Senators will join me \nin recognizing their work and in preserving it for the future by \nsupporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN:\n  S. 952. A bill to prohibit the taking of certain lands by the United \nStates in trust for economically self-sufficient Indian tribes for \ncommercial and gaming purposes, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n               the indian trust lands reform act of 1995\n\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation \ntoday to return some common sense to one aspect of the Federal \nGovernment's policies regarding Indian lands. My bill, the Indian Trust \nLands Reform Act of 1995, arises out of a problem we have been \nstruggling with in Connecticut for the last couple years, but which, \ngiven the explosive growth in Indian gaming, other States will soon \nlikely face as well.\n  The bill would amend the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 to \nreinforce its original purpose--helping Indian tribes and individual \nIndians hold on to or obtain land they need to survive economically and \nultimately support themselves. Congress passed the 1934 act after the \nlandholdings of some tribes had dwindled down to acres. Tribes and \ntheir members were selling and losing land to foreclosures, tax \narrearages, and the like.\n  The 1934 act gave the Secretary of the Interior the authority needed \nto help tribes hold on to or acquire land on which they could earn a \nliving and, further, to hold those lands in trust for them so they \nwould not be sold or otherwise lost. Once land is taken in trust by the \nUnited States for a tribe through this process, it becomes part of the \ntribe's sovereign lands and is no longer within the jurisdiction of \nState or local governments or subject to taxation or zoning controls.\n  The 1934 act specifically provides the Secretary of the Interior with \nthe authority, ``in his discretion, to acquire, through purchase, \nrelinquishment, gift, exchange, or assignment, any interest in lands * \n* * for the purpose of providing land for Indians.'' The legislative \nhistory of the 1934 act and that specific provision makes clear that \nCongress' purpose was ``to provide for the acquisition, through \npurchase, of land for Indians, now landless, who are anxious to make a \nliving on such land. * * *'' and ``to meet the needs of landless \nIndians and of Indian individuals whose landholdings are insufficient \nfor self-support.'' Senate Report No. 1080, 73d Congress, 2d Session 1-\n2 (1934).\n  Economic conditions for most tribes have improved since 1934 through \na variety of commercial, agricultural, and other enterprises, but many \nare still struggling. Few could be described as rich or even \ncomfortable; far too many still live in poverty. The 1934 act should be \navailable to help those tribes who still need assistance from the \nFederal Government in attaining economic self-sufficiency.\n  Since the passage of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in 1988, of \ncourse, many tribes have established casinos and gambling operations. \nSome have been very successful, others less so. One of the most \nsuccessful gambling casinos in the country is located in eastern \nConnecticut and is owned and operated by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe. \nThe success of the tribe's Foxwoods Casino has been well-chronicled. \nEstablished in 1992, the casino has been open 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-\nweek every since. Whatever one thinks about the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act or gambling, either morally or as a vehicle for economic \ngrowth, the Mashantucket Pequots seized the opportunity presented to \nthem by the Indian Gaming Act. They have developed an extraordinarily \nsuccessful, well-run casino in record time. In 1994, annual casino \nrevenues for the 300-member tribe were said to exceed $800 million. By \nany measure, the tribe has become very wealthy.\n  Given the tribe's financial success, it is not at all surprising that \nit has chosen to use some of those gambling revenues to buy more land \nnear its\n reservation in order to expand upon its success. According to press \naccounts, the tribe owns over 3,500 acres outside of the boundaries of \nthe reservation, in addition to the 1,229 acres that is held in trust \non its behalf within the reservation, and is now the largest private \nlandowner in southeastern Connecticut. Tribal leaders have at various \ntimes talked of building a massive theme park, golf courses, and hotels \non the land it owns outside the reservation. The tribe owns that land \nin fee simple, like any other property owner and so is free to develop \nit like any other property owner might.\n\n  Nevertheless, the tribe has chosen to apply to the Department of the \nInterior under the 1934 act to have some of that land taken in trust on \ntheir behalf. The 1934 act is on the books and available, with \nlimitations, to all federally recognized tribes. The benefits are \nenormous--tax-free land that is not subject to any State or local \nzoning or land-use laws.\n  Their efforts have paid off. In 1992, 27 acres in the neighboring \ntowns of Ledyard and Preston were taken into trust by the Department of \nInterior for the tribe at its request. In January 1993, the tribe filed \nan application to have an additional 248 taken in trust. The legal and \npolicy justifications for that request, as well as the earlier 1992 [[Page S \n8823]] trust acquisition, were immediately challenged by the affected \ntowns of Ledyard, North Stonington, and Preston. Nevertheless, that \nrequest was granted this May by the Department of Interior, subject to \ncertain conditions regarding the land's development and pending \nresolution of lawsuits filed by the towns and the Connecticut attorney \ngeneral. In March 1993, the tribe applied to have 1,200 more acres \ntaken in trust. That request was denied because of legal deficiencies \nin the application. Reapplication by the tribe is possible. Past \nstatements by tribal leaders suggest that more applications may be \nfiled.\n  The effect of these decisions--by the tribe and the Department of the \nInterior--has been unsettling, to say the least, on the tribe's \nneighbors--the residents of the small towns that border the \nreservation. Once the United States takes land into trust on behalf of \na tribe, as it has done here, boundaries change permanently. That land \nis no longer within the jurisdiction of the State or local governments. \nIt is not subject to local zoning, land-use or environmental controls. \nTaxes cannot be collected on the land or on any business operated on \nthe land. And State and local governments may exercise no police powers \non the land unless invited by the tribe to do so.\n  Given the vast financial resources of the tribe and the apparent \nwillingness of the Department of Interior to take land into trust on \ntheir behalf regardless of any evidence that the tribe needs additional \ntrust lands, many residents in the tribes wonder, as do I, where this \nwill all end. I simply do not see any policy justification for the \nUnited States to change the boundaries of three Connecticut towns \nunilaterally so that an extraordinarily wealthy tribe--this one or any \nother--can expand its gaming or other business enterprises, free of \ntaxes and local land-use controls, particularly when that tribe is \nperfectly capable of expanding its businesses on the thousands of trust \nand nontrust land it presently owns. It strains credulity to think that \nCongress intended in 1934 that the law would be used in this fashion.\n  The authority for the Department of Interior to grant the tribe's \nrequest is now subject to review in the courts. The courts will have to \ndecide whether the 1934 act even applies to this tribe and, if so, \nwhether the Secretary acted properly. The courts will have to decide as \nwell whether the 1983 Mashantucket Pequot Settlement Act independently \nprohibits trust acquisition by the tribe outside of reservation \nboundaries.\n  To avoid future disputes and controversy, my bill would amend the \nIndian Reorganization Act to return to its original purpose. It would \nprohibit the Secretary of Interior from taking any lands located \noutside of the boundaries of an Indian reservation in trust on behalf \nof an economically self-sufficient Indian tribe, if those lands are to \nbe used for gaming or any other commercial purpose. It directs the \nSecretary of Interior to determine, after providing opportunity for \npublic comment, whether a tribe is economically self-sufficient and to \ndevelop regulations setting forth the criteria for making that \ndetermination generally. Among the criteria that the Secretary must \ninclude in those regulations to assess economic self-sufficiency are \nthe income of the tribe, as allocated among members and compared to the \nper capita income of citizens of the United States, as well as the role \nthat the lands at issue will play in the tribe's efforts to achieve \neconomic self-sufficiency.\n  My bill does not affect the ability of the Secretary to assist tribes \nthat genuinely need additional land in order to move toward or attain \neconomic self-sufficiency. Moreover, the bill contains explicit \nexemptions for the establishment of initial reservations for Indian \ntribes, whether accomplished through recognition by the Department of \nInterior or by an act of Congress, and\n in circumstances where tribes once recognized by the Federal \nGovernment are restored to recognition.\n\n  Mr. President, many residents of Connecticut applaud the success that \nthe Mashantucket Pequot Tribe has had with its Foxwoods Casino. The \ntribe employs thousands of Connecticut residents in an area of the \nState that was hard-hit by a lingering recession and cuts in defense \nspending. The tribe's plans for economic development of the region, \nwhile not universally liked, have many in the area genuinely excited \nabout future opportunities.\n  I have discovered though that even among residents cheered by the \ntribe's success and supportive of its plans, there is a strong sense of \nunfairness about how the ``land in trust'' process is being used. They \nbelieve there is absolutely no reason why this tribe, or any other in a \nsimilar situation, needs to have the U.S. Government take additional, \nessentially commercial land in trust on the tribe's behalf outside of \nits reservation boundaries. What is at stake here, afterall, is not \npreserving a culture or achieving self-sufficiency, but expansion of an \nalready successful business on lands which are owned by the tribe and \ndevelopable by them, as they would be by any other landowner. Extra \nhelp is simply not needed, and continuing to grant it is unjust and, in \nmy view, ultimately counterproductive for all involved.\n  It is time for Congress to make this common sense clarification in \nthe law. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation, and ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill appear \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 952\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins \nin commemoration of black Revolutionary War patriots; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n  THE BLACK REVOLUTIONARY WAR PATRIOTS COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator \nMoseley-Braun, as well as Senators Simon, Campbell, Pell, and Thompson, \nI am introducing the black Revolutionary [[Page S 8824]] War patriots \ncommemorative coin legislation.\n  In 1986, Congress approved construction of a memorial celebrating the \nlives of more than 5,000 African-Americans who served, fought, and died \nduring our Nation's Revolutionary War. Ironically, many of these brave \nAmericans had never experienced the freedom and independence for which \nthey fought.\n  As a Rhode Islander, it gives me particular pleasure to sponsor this \nlegislation. As few Americans know, of the estimated 5,000 African-\nAmericans who served in the Continental Army, the vast majority were \nfrom New England, and a great number were from my State of Rhode \nIsland. In fact, in 1778, Rhode Island approved the first slave \nenlistment act and the Black Regiment of Rhode Island was formed. This \nwas one of only two all black regiments. The other was the Bucks of \nAmerica of Boston.\n  Not only did these men serve our Nation, they served with \ndistinction. Regrettably throughout our history, their valor has been \noverlooked. Men like Jack Sisson of Rhode Island, who expertly steered \none of five boats involved in the daring capture of British Maj. Gen. \nRichard Prescott at Newport in 1777, are barely mentioned in historical \nreports of the incident.\n  Jack Sisson went on to join a regiment of some 200 black soldiers \nfrom my State, who, at the battle of Rhode Island, held their ground \nagainst several fierce attacks by British-Hessian forces, thereby \nallowing six American brigades to retreat. With scant training, but \nabundant courage, the First Rhode Island Regiment inflicted casualties \nof six to one on the professional troops of the Redcoats.\n  Like African-American soldiers throughout the colonies, however, the \nsoldiers of Rhode Island's First Regiment faced tragedy as well as \ntriumph. In May 1781, the unit suffered a surprise attack by the \nBritish cavalry at Pines Bridge, and 40 soldiers lost their lives. Two \nyears later, the regiment was disbanded unceremoniously in Oswego, NY. \nAccording to the historian John Harmon, the soldiers were told to find \ntheir own way home, and many died while making the trip. Further, \ndespite the promise of freedom which had been made in order to entice \nthem to enlist, some of the soldiers were actually reenslaved after \ntheir return.\n  Valor and fortitude in battle always are worthy of celebration, but \nthey are especially inspiring when one takes into account the hostility \nand oppression that African-American soldiers faced from the Nation for \nwhich they fought. As Harriet Beecher Stowe observed,\n\n       They served a nation which did not acknowledge them as \n     citizens and equals. . . It was not for their own land they \n     fought, but for a land that enslaved them. Bravery under such \n     circumstances, has particular beauty and merit.\n\n  A portion of the proceeds from sales of the coin my legislation will \nauthorize will help to pay for construction of the memorial. The \nPatriots Foundation already has raised $4 million for this purpose, and \nthese additional funds are crucial if the memorial is to be completed.\n  The design for the black Revolutionary War patriots memorial has been \napproved. It will be a 90-foot-long, 7-foot high, curved bronze wall \nlocated some 300 feet from the Vietnam Memorial in Constitution Gardens \nbetween the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. Figures of \nblack soldiers will be sculpted in high and low relief and a black \ngranite arch will be inscribed with historical information.\n  Nancy Johnson has introduced companion legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives, and it is my hope that this proposal will receive \nspeedy approval by both bodies.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATFIELD (for himself and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 954. A bill to authorize the Architect of the Capitol to establish \na Capitol Visitor Center under the East Plaza of the United States \nCapitol, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n          the capitol visitor center authorization act of 1995\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to \nintroduce a bill that will make the U.S. Capitol more accessible to the \nAmerican people. Over the past 200 years the U.S. Capitol has become \nmore than a mere monument or museum. It is a living space, housing both \nChambers of Congress, and hosting hundreds of thousands of visitors \nfrom across the globe annually. Today the U.S. Capitol Building stands \nas a symbol of our American ideals of liberty and freedom as much as it \ndid on September 18, 1793, when President Washington laid the first \nstone into the ground.\n  Mr. President, the Capitol Visitor Center Authorization Act of 1995 \nupholds our Nation's original commitment to citizen involvement in \ngovernment by providing Americans with enhanced opportunities to \nwitness their government at work. Located under the East Plaza of the \nU.S. Capitol, this new addition would ease visitor access to the \nCapitol, allowing the ever-increasing number of visitors to enter more \nquickly and efficiently. Visitors will also be treated to informative \ndisplays about the Capitol as they proceed underground to enter the \nbuilding. And anyone who has ever visited Washington, DC in the summer \nor winter will greatly appreciate the importance of providing visitors \nwith relief from the elements.\n  In this period of scrutinizing government expenditures and balancing \nthe budget, it is important to note that funding for the visitors \ncenter would come primarily from private gifts and donations. \nContributions would be held in the U.S. Treasury under a separate \naccount.\n  Mr. President, above all, this historic legislation should be enacted \nbecause it fulfills the intent of the U.S. Capitol Building by further \nopening it up to the American people. The visitors center would be an \neducational facility to be enjoyed for many years to come. It is my \npleasure to introduce this important legislation and I thank the senior \nSenator from New York, Senator Moynihan, for joining me as an original \ncosponsor.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8821-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8824-S8825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 240\n\n  At the request of Mr. Domenici, the name of the Senator from Georgia \n[Mr. Coverdell] was added as a cosponsor of S. 240, a bill to amend the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 to establish a filing deadline and to \nprovide certain safeguards to ensure that the interests of investors \nare well protected under the implied private action provisions of the \nAct.\n\n\n                                 S. 643\n\n  At the request of Mr. Jeffords, the names of the Senator from \nCalifornia [Mrs. Feinstein] and the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. \nBradley] were added as cosponsors of S. 643, a bill to assist in \nimplementing the plan of action adopted by the World Summit for \nChildren.\n\n\n                                 S. 733\n\n  At the request of Mr. Roth, the names of the Senator from Maine [Ms. \nSnowe], the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Pell], and the Senator from \nNew York [Mr. D'Amato] were added as cosponsors of S. 733, a bill to \namend title 23, United States Code, to permit States to use Federal \nhighway funds for capital improvements to, and operating support for, \nintercity passenger rail service, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 789\n\n  At the request of Mr. Chafee, the name of the Senator from Missouri \n[Mr. Ashcroft] was added as a cosponsor of S. 789, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to make permanent the section 170(e)(5) \nrules pertaining to gifts of publicly traded stock to certain private \nfoundations, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 907\n\n  At the request of Mr. Murkowski, the names of the Senator from \nMontana [Mr. Burns], the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], and the \nSenator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas] were added as cosponsors of S. 907, a \nbill to amend the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 to \nclarify the authorities and duties of the Secretary of Agriculture in \nissuing ski area permits on National Forest System lands and to \nwithdraw lands within ski area permit boundaries from the operation of \nthe mining and mineral leasing laws.\n\n\n                                 S. 917\n\n  At the request of Mr. Stevens, the name of the Senator from New \nMexico [Mr. Bingaman] was added as a cosponsor of S. 917, a bill to \nfacilitate small [[Page S 8825]] business involvement in the regulatory \ndevelopment processes of the Environmental Protection Agency and the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 939\n\n  At the request of Mr. Smith, the name of the Senator from North \nCarolina [Mr. Helms] was added as a cosponsor of S. 939, a bill to \namend title 18, United States Code, to ban partial-birth abortions.\n\n\n                                 S. 940\n\n  At the request of Mr. Leahy, the names of the Senator from Virginia \n[Mr. Robb], the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman], the Senator \nfrom Indiana [Mr. Lugar], and the Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] \nwere added as cosponsors of S. 940, a bill to support proposals to \nimplement the United States goal of eventually eliminating \nantipersonnel landmines;

which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 138\n\n       Whereas U.S. policy calls for a solution to the conflict in \n     Kashmir through negotiations between India and Pakistan \n     taking into account the wishes of the Kashmiri people to \n     choose legitimate representatives to negotiate on their \n     behalf;\n       Whereas India and Pakistan have fought two wars over \n     Kashmir and tensions in the region remain high;\n       Whereas both India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons \n     programs and possess sophisticated means to deliver such \n     weapons;\n       Whereas reports indicate widespread human rights abuses in \n     Kashmir, resulting from the excessive use of force by Indian \n     military and paramilitary forces and acts of violence by \n     Kashmiri militants;\n       Whereas the Indian parliament did not renew the Terrorists \n     and Disruptive Activities Act, thereby improving prospects \n     for the rule of law in Kashmir;\n       Whereas the All Parties Hurriyet (Freedom) Conference was \n     organized to engage in negotiations with Indian and Pakistani \n     authorities without precondition;\n       Whereas in January 1994 the United States Institute of \n     Peace (USIP) brought together representatives from India, \n     Pakistan and Kashmir to engage in a dialogue for peace;\n       Whereas the USIP concluded that, ``It is essential that \n     people of Jammu and Kashmir be central participants in this \n     political process, along with the governments and citizens of \n     India and Pakistan.''\n       Whereas the recent destruction of the mosque and the razing \n     of the town of Charar-i-Sharief in Kashmir have reinforced \n     the urgent need for such a dialogue;\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the use of excessive force by Indian military \n     and paramilitary forces in Kashmir and similarly condemns \n     acts of violence by Kashmiri militants;\n       (2) welcomes the release from detention of Kashmiri \n     political leaders and urges that the government of India take \n     further steps to respond to human rights concerns, including:\n       Prosecuting security personnel involved in abuses of human \n     rights;\n       Permitting international human rights groups such as \n     Amnesty International access to Kashmir; and\n       Permitting international humanitarian groups access to \n     detention and interrogation centers in Kashmir;\n       (3) welcomes the expiration of the Terrorist and Disruptive \n     Activities Act and urges the government of India to take \n     further steps to safeguard the Kashmiri people's right to due \n     process;\n       (4) welcomes steps taken by the government of Pakistan to \n     reduce its support for Kashmiri militants, and urges the \n     government of Pakistan to take further steps, including using \n     its influence with private Pakistani sources, to stop the \n     acts of intimidation and violence by Kashmiri militants;\n       (5) calls on the governments of India and Pakistan to enter \n     into negotiations with legitimate representatives of the \n     people of Jammu and Kashmir to resolve the conflict \n     peacefully;\n       (6) urges the Administration to work to facilitate \n     negotiations for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in \n     Kashmir.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send a resolution to the desk for \nappropriate referral. It addresses the precarious situation growing out \nof two nuclear-armed nations facing each other on the South Asian \nsubcontinent. During the past 50 years, the two nations have gone to \nwar twice, and barely avoided doing so again in 1990.\n  The dispute over the State of Kashmir continues to fester, and India \nand Pakistan are nowhere near resolving their differences. Kashmir \ncould easily ignite a nuclear conflagration, and it would be difficult \nto imagine a greater interest by the United States than preventing such \na terrifying tragedy.\n  Mr. President, exacerbating the tensions in the region is a pattern \nof gross violations of the Kashmiri people's basic human rights. More \nthan 20,000 Kashmiris have been killed in the past 6 years, and the \npeople of Kashmir continue to endure daily abuses, most often at the \nhands of the Indian Army and security forces. The State Department's \n1994 Report on Human Rights lists ``extrajudicial executions, torture \nand reprisal killings'' as common tactics used by Indian Government \nforces.\n  Only last month, Mr. President, a battle between militants and Indian \ntroops in the town of Charar-i-Sharief started a fire that destroyed \n1,000 homes, and a 600-year-old mosque that is Kashmir's most important \nMoslem shrine. The blaze also displaced nearly 25,000 people.\n  The resolution Senator Leahy, Reid, and I are offering speaks \ndirectly to the very serious issues that confront the people of \nKashmir. It decries human rights abuses perpetrated by both Indian \nsecurity forces and Moslem militants. It also speaks to the root of the \nthreat to South Asia and to the United States--the failure to negotiate \na settlement to the Kashmiri dispute.\n  Since 1972, India and Pakistan have worked through the Simla \nframework: bilateral negotiations to resolve bilateral problems, \nincluding Kashmir. After 23 years, it is time to admit failure. \nNegotiations will not succeed without the involvement of the Kashmiri \npeople. The resolution that Senator Leahy and I are introducing today \nasks that the Kashmiri people, through the peaceful voice of their \nHurriyet Council, be represented in any negotiations on the future of \nKashmir.\n  Kashmir must not be ignored; it will come back to haunt us all. I \nurge Senators to support not only this resolution, but more \nimportantly, this cause.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the resolution on \nKashmir submitted today by Senator Helms, which I am cosponsoring along \nwith Senator Reid.\n  The situation in Kashmir has been a continuing concern of mine for \nmany years. I am a friend of India, a country of nearly a billion \npeople with great cultural and religious diversity and a myriad of \nproblems. I have long believed that the United States and India have a \ntremendous amount to gain from closer relations. But I have been very \ndisturbed by the excessive use of force by India's security forces in \nKashmir, which has resulted in the detention, torture, and death of \nthousands of civilians. I am also very disturbed by the Pakistan \nGovernment's continuing assistance to the Kashmiri militants who have \nalso been guilty of atrocities.\n  I am cosponsoring this resolution because I believe it is balanced, \nand because I believe the recommendations it contains are in the \ninterests of India and Pakistan, and the Kashmiri people. It condemns \nacts of violence by both the Indian security forces and Kashmiri \nmilitants, and it welcomes the decision of the Indian Government to \nrelease Kashmiri political leaders who had been imprisoned.\n  Further, it urges the Indian Government to respond to continuing \nhuman [[Page S 8826]] rights violations in Kashmir. Specifically, the \nresolution calls for prosecution of those responsible for human rights \nviolations, since far too often those implicated in abuses have gone \nunpunished, and it requests the Indian Government to permit \ninternational human rights and humanitarian groups access to Kashmir. \nThis is long overdue.\n  In addition, the resolution recognizes the Pakistani Government's \nefforts to reduce its support for Kashmiri militants, and calls on the \nPakistani Government to take further steps including using its \ninfluence with private Pakistani sources to stop the acts of \nintimidation and violence by Kashmiri militants. A recent report by the \nArms Project of Human Rights Watch described the flow of military \nassistance from Pakistan that has contributed to the violence and \nbloodshed in Kashmir.\n  The resolution does not express a position on what the future status \nof Kashmir should be. Rather, we urge the Indian and Pakistani \nGovernments to enter into negotiations with legitimate representatives \nof Jammu and Kashmir in order to resolve the conflict in a peaceful \nmanner. It is widely recognized that there is no military solution to \nthe Kashmir conflict. It is long past time that the various parties \nwith an interest in the future of Kashmir engaged in a serious dialogue \nto end the violence.\n  Mr. President, this is a balanced resolution that seeks to encourage \nand support a search for peace in Kashmir, and I want to thank the \nSenator from South Carolina, the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, for the constructive role he played in the drafting of the \nresolution. Our goal is to diffuse tensions in a dangerous region and \nto help resolve a bloody conflict that has caused enormous suffering \nover many years. The resolution should pass unanimously.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8825-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 139--TO AUTHORIZE THE PRODUCTION OF RECORDS BY THE \n                    SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE\n\n  Mr. DOLE (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, through the years I have found Brent \nScowcroft to be one of the more rational and thoughtful people, when it \ncomes to foreign policy.\n  Recently, he had an op-ed piece in the New York Times titled, \n``Foreign Aid Has Its Uses,'' and it makes eminent good sense. I ask \nthat it be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  What concerns me is that while U.S. leadership abroad is slipping--\nand that should concern all of us--we are accelerating the slippage by \ncutting back on foreign aid.\n  In addition, when we cut foreign aid and increase military spending, \nwe increase the likelihood of the use of the military option rather \nthan other options that could save lives and bring stability.\n  The great threat to the world today is instability.\n  We should heed the words of Brent Scowcroft.\n  The material follows:\n                [From the New York Times, June 12, 1995]\n\n                        Foreign Aid Has Its Uses\n\n                          (By Brent Scowcroft)\n\n       Foreign assistance is again undergoing the ``perils of \n     Pauline'' as it wends through the Congressional gauntlet. \n     This happens yearly, but the dangers today seem especially \n     ominous. With the search for budget economies so desperate, \n     using up funds for what detractors call foreign giveaways \n     when programs to assist needy Americans are being slashed \n     seems unconscionable to many.\n       Foreign assistance, with us since the Marshall Plan, has \n     been perhaps the most unpopular legislation to come before \n     Congress for some years. The increased peril it faces arises \n     mainly from the loss of the justification the cold war \n     provided.\n       The case for foreign assistance is simple, basic--and \n     misunderstood. The core argument is that foreign assistance \n     is a fundamental instrument of foreign policy.\n       There are three main ways through which, separately or in \n     combination, we can exert influence abroad. One is \n     traditional diplomacy. Another is economic or military \n     coercion. When diplomacy alone is inadequate and coercion too \n     extreme or inappropriate, we have to turn to foreign \n     assistance--the use of economic incentives.\n       Why the difficulty in persuading Congress and the nation of \n     its merits? One reason is that some foreign assistance \n     programs, however meritorious, have become so encrusted with \n     activities and outlays that have so little to do with our \n     direct national interests that the main purpose of the \n     programs has become obscured.\n       In the cold war, our aid programs could carry this burden, \n     but now the entire economic assistance edifice is endangered. \n     We must refocus the programs to make them directly relevant \n     to our national interests. For example, we need to emphasize \n     the security requirements of countries of particular \n     concern--Israel and Turkey, for example. We have to \n     strengthen stability in areas of strategic interest: Gaza, \n     Jericho, Poland and Czechoslovakia. We should see the Central \n     American peace process through to its conclusion.\n       We need to suitably compensate countries that provide \n     military installations as well as cooperation and support on \n     issues of particular importance to us. For example, we \n     recently offered incentives to Caribbean countries to accept \n     Haitian and Cuban refugees.\n       We need to be able to respond quickly to unforeseen \n     circumstances and unusual opportunities. For example, right \n     after the ouster of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, we helped \n     Panama pay off its debts to international financial \n     institutions, thus making other economic aid possible.\n       When Fidel Castro leaves the scene, economic assistance to \n     Cuba may be needed immediately to ease the transition. A \n     contingency fund for that purpose would be useful.\n       Support for democracy and for sustainable economic \n     development serve our interests, but they are not top \n     priorities. For example, help for the Development Fund for \n     Africa would flow from the American tradition of compassion \n     and altruism. And while our contributions to such \n     international financial institutions clearly benefit us in \n     the long term, we should base such aid on our wish to promote \n     global prosperity rather than to promote specific American \n     interests.\n       Like it or not, America has inherited the mantle of world \n     leadership. In searching for budget cuts, we must not destroy \n     foreign aid, a crucial means of exercising that \n     leadership.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8829-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 CHISHOLM TRAIL ROUNDUP, FORT WORTH, TX\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, more than 100 years ago, cattle \ndrives made their way across the Texas plains toward the railhead of \nAbilene, KS, along what came to be known as the Chisholm Trail. Within \na span of only 2 decades, the Chisholm Trail not only transformed \nsettlements and towns, like Fort Worth, into major centers of commerce, \nit also produced one of our Nation's most enduring folk heroes--the \ncowboy.\n  Since 1976, the Chisholm Trail Roundup has been held in the historic \nstockyards district of Fort Worth, TX. The roundup celebrates the \nWestern spirit of adventure and perseverance and honors the cultures of \ntribe and nation that forged a new way of life on the American \nfrontier. From native American dances to cowboy gunfights, the roundup \ndisplays all aspects of frontier life and creates an atmosphere in \nwhich learning about our history and enjoying the festival come \ntogether.\n  As one of the country's largest annual festivals, the Chisholm Trail \nRoundup is nonprofit and benefits Western heritage organizations. This \npast weekend, Fort Worthians gathered once again to celebrate the \ncity's rich heritage and to relive one of the most memorable times in \nAmerican history.\n  Mr. President, as the junior Senator from Texas, I would like to \nrecognize the Chisholm Trail Roundup and its efforts to remind us to \nour pioneering heritage. I appreciate the thousands of hours of work \nthat went into planning this event and am looking forward to many more \nroundups in the years to come.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8829-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8829-S8830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nCOMMEMORATING EAST BRUNSWICK HIGH SCHOOL'S AWARD-WINNING PERFORMANCE IN \n THE ``WE THE PEOPLE . . . THE CITIZEN AND THE CONSTITUTION'' NATIONAL \n                                 FINALS\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a \ngroup of young New Jerseyans whose perseverance and achievement warrant \nthe highest praise. These are not heroes or public figures of the usual \nvariety, but a group of high school students who have mastered an \nunderstanding of the basis of our Government, the Constitution. I am \nproud to announce that students from East Brunswick High School in New \nJersey have won second place in the ``We the People . . . The Citizen \nand the Constitution'' national finals.\n  Twenty-three students from East Brunswick High School came to \nWashington this May to compete against teams from all 50 States. After \nextensive study of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and \npreliminary competitions within the State, the students faced a panel \nof judges in a simulated congressional hearing. They were required to \ndraw on their knowledge of the Constitution and American history to \nanswer questions involving the subtleties and complexities of the Bill \nof Rights.\n  I am proud to draw attention to these students, who on May 1 were \nprepared to discuss issues ranging from school [[Page S 8830]] prayer \nto classical republicanism and the natural rights philosophy. The \nachievements of East Brunswick High School serve as an example to \nstudents, educators, and legislators across the country. They remind us \nhow important it is that every member of society, including parents, \nprofessionals, and legislators, participate in the educational process. \nCongressional support is crucial to the growth and development of \nfuture leaders. I am pleased to note that 98 Members of this body \nparticipated in this year's We the People program, which has reached \nmore than 20 million students over the past 7 years.\n  Of those 20 million, I would particularly like to congratulate the \nstudents of East Brunswick High School, under the guidance of their \nteacher John Calimano: David Bagatelle, Michael Barnett, Jessica Boar, \nRoss Cohen, Brian Cutler, Brian Fischer, Marc Gensler, Jonathan \nGoldberg, Cliff Katz, Ken Katz, Michael Katz, Scott Lanman, Keith \nLevenberg, Jennifer LoPresti, Eric Neutuch, Evan Rosen, Jeffrey Seiden, \nGregg Slater, Sheryl Spinner, John Stapleton, Alison Tanchyk, Howard \nWolfson, and Marc Yannaco. These students of East Brunswick High School \nwill lead our Nation into the 21st century, with the knowledge and \ncommitment to understand and defend our Constitution. Success like \ntheirs bodes well for an educated, tolerant, and politically engaged \nAmerica.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8829-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO GENERAL MUNDY\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, on June 30, the U.S. Marine \nCorps and the Nation will say farewell to a valiant warrior, Gen. Carl \nE. Mundy, Commandant of the Marine Corps. I want to add my best wishes \nto General Mundy as he retires after 38 years of public service.\n  General Mundy's personal decorations include the Legion of Merit, the \nBronze Star Medal, the Purple Heart, two Navy Commendation Medals and \nthe Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry. I think the word ``gallantry'' \nexemplifies Carl Mundy's career.\n  The Commandant of the Marine Corps leads the Nation's ``911'' force \nwhich is ready for combat or deployment at a moment's notice. The \nmarines are America's rapid deployment force and in our Nation's \nhistory we have frequently called upon our marines to go abroad, to \nmake a stand, to defend our Nation's interests. Carl Mundy and our \nmarines have never let us down and we all owe a debt of gratitude to \nthese brave and selfless Americans.\n  General Mundy has a long history of defending the interests of the \nmarine's who serve under his command. I think we all have a better \nappreciation of the quality of life issues and their impact on \nreadiness because of the tireless work of Carl Mundy in this area. \nWhile we still have a long way to go to give all of our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen and marines a decent quality of life, Carl Mundy has \nclearly pushed the Department of Defense and the Congress to address \nthese issues and I salute him for this effort.\n  Most of all, General Mundy is a leader and a man of his word. When \nthe administration seemed determined to leave 55 FAST marines stranded \nin Mogadishu for no apparent reason, I asked for a hearing on this \nsubject. Prior to the hearing, I discussed the issue with General Mundy \nand others to get a better feel for the situation. In my discussion \nwith the Commandant, I saw he had only two objectives--accomplishing \nthe mission and the interests of his marines. As it became clear that \nthere was no mission to accomplish, the Senate voted to remove the last \nAmerican military personnel, our 55 FAST marines, from Somalia. I \nappreciate General Mundy's support and guidance during the Senate \nconsideration of this issue.\n  The marine's are a symbol of the strength and character of America. \nThe presence of U.S. Marines overseas is an unmistakable signal that \nAmerica is serious about its commitments and responsibilities. General \nMundy is a symbol of these qualities, he served with a presence, and he \nserved with honor and dignity. I want to thank Carl Mundy for his \ndedicated service to his country and his marines.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8830-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8830-S8831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         THE DEFICIT AND TRADE\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, one of the most impressive leaders I \nhave met during my years in public service is Helmut Schmidt, who \nserved as chancellor of Germany.\n  Recently, he had an article about trade, which is interesting both \nbecause of what he says about trade, and also, because of what he says \nabout our deficit.\n  Listen to these words:\n\n       Every economist knows that the U.S. trade deficit can be \n     eliminated only through a sizable reduction of the budgetary \n     deficit. This fact is also well-known by the White House and \n     Congress. And yet, American politicians continue to pretend \n     to themselves and their people that the Japanese are \n     responsible for their misery.\n\n  I am not saying that the Japanese are perfect in terms of opening \ntheir market to other countries, but there is no question that the \nprincipal reason for our trade deficit is our budget deficit. We have \nshot ourselves in the foot. We have a self-inflicted wound.\n  I ask that the full statement by Helmut Schmidt, which appears in the \nLos Angeles Times, be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n     [From the Los Angeles Times/Washington edition, June 14, 1995]\n\n                    The United States Is Dead Wrong\n\n                          (By Helmut Schmidt)\n\n       Listening to the U.S. trade representative these days \n     evokes sounds of battle, of the adversary's conning and one's \n     own self-righteousness. The recurring topic is automobiles, \n     and everything is directed against Japan. If the overall \n     trade between the two countries is in deficit for the United \n     States, then--obviously--must not it be Japan's fault?\n       In reality, the United States shows a trade deficit not \n     only with Japan but also with the rest of the world. Even if \n     Japan were to buckle under the pressure from Washington to \n     agree to import quotas for American automobiles--which would \n     be in violation of the treaty establishing the World Trade \n     Organization and of the painfully achieved results of the \n     GATT Uruguay Round--the structural illnesses of the American \n     economy would still remain untreated.\n       Every economist knows that the U.S. trade deficit can be \n     eliminated only through a sizable reduction on the budgetary \n     deficit. This fact is also well-known by the White House and \n     Congress. And yet, American politicians continue to pretend \n     to themselves and their people that the Japanese are \n     responsible for their misery.\n       Washington's attempt to impose larger sales of American \n     automobiles on the Japanese constitutes a serious violation \n     of the principle of freedom of trade. Those who believe that \n     punitive import duties of 100% on automobiles imported from \n     Japan would give European cars a better chance are \n     shortsighted indeed. This trade war can spread very rapidly. \n     It can fast affect other areas, such as the aircraft industry \n     and modern information technologies, as well as the \n     television and movie industries.\n       In short, Washington is dead wrong. Its actions can \n     endanger the world economy as a whole. Those Americans who, \n     in spite of paying lip service to the contrary, really quite \n     like the fall of the dollar on the currency markets because \n     they hope to increase exports, should remember this: Whoever \n     weakens the dollar as a leading world currency will undermine \n     America's role as a world power in the long run.\n       Japan's position, however, is also unhealthy in the long \n     run. Over the past 15 years, its production has largely \n     exceeded its domestic consumption and investments. The \n     extraordinary savings of the Japanese have turned their \n     nation into the world's largest creditor. And no overpowering \n     creditor will remain popular for long.\n       The leading officials in the ministries of finance and \n     industry and trade who, in reality, control the Japanese \n     economy have succeeded in structuring an economy oriented \n     exclusively toward consumer self-restraint within and toward \n     expansion in trade abroad. Neither the Japanese people at \n     large, nor even most of the politicians, seem fully aware of \n     this.\n       True, Japan has become a potential world power because of \n     the foreign-policy leverage of its overwhelming financial \n     strength. True, the annual interest and dividends from abroad \n     have reached nearly one-third of the annual surplus of its \n     trade balance. True, the Japanese foreign currency reserves \n     have levels twice as high was those of the United States. \n     Yet, Japanese citizens pay for this nominal wealth with \n     sacrifices in consumption, especially by giving up adequate \n     housing standards.\n       The Japanese markets are a difficult terrain for many \n     foreign sellers. But even if President Clinton's offensive in \n     the automobile trade war were successful, this would change \n     little in the structure of the Japanese economy, which would \n     continue to be oriented unilaterally toward exports. A \n     structural reform to promote domestic expansion would in all \n     likelihood take about one decade, about as much time as it \n     would take to orient American structures toward a balanced \n     budget. Until now, neither country seems to wish such drastic \n     reforms. [[Page S 8831]] \n       Tokyo's political leadership has not yet realized that \n     Japan's increasing economic strength has lead to an \n     increasingly vulnerable foreign-policy position, not only \n     vis-a-vis its only ally, the United States, but also vis-a-\n     vis its many neighbors in East and South East Asia. An Asian-\n     Pacific economic entity under Japanese leadership is even \n     less popular with its neighbors than a European Union under a \n     theoretically conceivable German leadership.\n       In the long run, Japan will remain dependent on a tolerable \n     relationship with the United States. This conflict will \n     benefit no one in the world. America is wrong in today's \n     trade war, which is not to say Japan is right. Restraint is \n     desirable from both sides. Both nations must realize that a \n     structural reform of their economies is a must.\n       Helmut Schmidt, the former German chancellor, co-founded \n     (with former French President Valery Giscard D'Estaing) the \n     annual economic summits of the seven leading industrial \n     countries.

Mr. President, last Friday I introduced S. 940, the \nLandmine Use Moratorium Act of 1995, which seeks to spark international \ncooperation to stop the maiming and killing of tens of thousands of \npeople each year by landmines.\n  I further ask to have printed in the Record a portion of a statement \nissued on June 16, 1995, by the U.S. Catholic Bishops at their semi-\nannual meeting in Chicago, entitled ``Sowing Weapons of War: A Pastoral \nReflection on the Arms Trade and Landmines.'' In that statement the \nBishops call on the United States to lead an international effort to \nban the use of antipersonnel landmines. That is the goal announced by \nPresident Clinton at the United Nations last December, and my \nlegislation aims to move us toward that goal.\n  The statement follows:\n\n Excerpt From Sowing Weapons of War: A Pastoral Reflection on the Arms \n                          Trade and Landmines\n\n       Banning Landmines: An Urgent Task. Finally, we would like \n     to add our voice to appeals of Pope John Paul II and the \n     growing movement to control and eventually ban anti-personnel \n     landmines. The Holy Father has issued ``a vigorous appeal for \n     the definitive cessation of the manufacture and use of those \n     arms called `anti-personnel mines' . . . In fact, they \n     continue to kill and to cause irreparable damage well after \n     the end of hostilities, giving rise to severe mutilations in \n     adults and above all, in children.'' Some 100 million of \n     these hidden killers are strewn around the world, killing an \n     estimated 500 people per week, most of whom are civilians. In \n     Cambodia, one of every 236 people is an amputee because of \n     mine blasts. While landmines can be used responsibly for \n     legitimate defense, they are often indiscriminate in use, \n     especially in the intra-state conflicts which are so \n     prevalent today. Moreover, landmines are indiscriminate in \n     time because, as the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace \n     has pointed out, they cause ``unacceptable damage to civilian \n     populations long after the cessation of hostilities.'' From \n     Cambodia to Angola, large areas have been rendered \n     uninhabitable, preventing refugees from returning to their \n     homes, inhibiting post-war reconstruction, and producing an \n     ongoing threat to innocent life.\n       The United States should lead an international effort to \n     reduce and ultimately ban the use of anti-personnel \n     landmines, just as was done with chemical and biological \n     weapons. The current moratorium on U.S. exports of landmines \n     is commendable; it should be made permanent and should be \n     extended globally. The United States should also take steps, \n     such as those called for in legislation now before Congress, \n     to further restrict its own use of landmines, while it \n     pursues with urgency and persistence international agreements \n     to restrict use globally. The decision to ratify the \n     Conventional Weapons Convention and to seek to strengthen it \n     during its review this year is welcome. Finally, our \n     government should continue to take a leadership role in \n     developing an international effort on the costly and time-\n     consuming process of demining, so important to the protection \n     of innocent life and reconstruction in so many war-torn \n     countries.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8831-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8831-S8833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        WHO CARES ABOUT AFRICA?\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, recently, the magazine America, \npublished by the Society of Jesus, ran an article by its associate \neditor, Father James Martin, titled ``Who Cares About Africa?''\n  Because it contains so much common sense about a continent that we \nare not paying enough attention to, I ask to have it reprinted in the \nend of my brief remarks.\n  The reality is every continent on the face of the Earth is making \ngradual improvement in its quality of life and standard of living, with \none exception: Africa.\n  The irony is as democracies have spread in Africa recently--an almost \ntotally unrecognized phenomenon--instead of helping those fledgling \ndemocracies, we are cutting back on aid in general and aid to Africa \nmore specifically.\n  It is a flawed policy both in humanitarian terms and in political \nterms.\n  I urge my colleagues to read Father Martin's article.\n  At this point, I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                        Who Cares About Africa?\n\n       ``Kwanza begins today,'' the radio announcer said, \n     launching into an explanation of the cycle of January \n     African-American feast days. ``The word Kwanza,'' he said \n     brightly, ``means `first' in African.'' I groaned. He meant \n     Swahili, of course.\n       Can you imagine any reasonably educated person saying that \n     primo means ``first'' in European? But not knowing beans \n     about Africa is taken for granted among many Americans. \n     Before I went to Kenya for a two-year stay, a (well-educated) \n     friend asked me if Kenya was in Nairobi. This is, to continue \n     the analogy, like asking if Italy is in Rome. After I \n     returned to the States, someone mentioned how exciting it \n     must have been to be in Kenya when they elected Nelson \n     Mandela.\n       But on this count, I had been just as guilty. When I began \n     working with refugees in Nairobi, I had to ask them where \n     their home countries were. ``Sudan is, uh, north of here, \n     right?'' I finally bought a map.\n\n\n                           the dark continent\n\n       American interest in Africa, it would seem, is piqued only \n     during times of crisis: Ethiopia, Somalia, Rwanda. Some of \n     this is laudable. Only the most cynical would say that \n     Americans were not moved to compassion after seeing pictures \n     of the Rwandan refugees or starving Somalis.\n       The problem is that once the United States ceases to be \n     involved, we no longer hear anything about it. It's the \n     flavor-of-the-month syndrome. For example, as soon as the \n     United States pulled out of Somalia in March 1994, Somalia \n     dropped out of the news, giving the false impression that \n     things were just fine there. And, just as predictably, when \n     U.S. troops returned to Somalia in March of this year to \n     escort the remaining U.N. troops out, it was back in the \n     news. As a result, the American public's understanding of \n     Africa is based primarily on these short-term involvements. \n     And while U.S. policy mavens may be more well informed, the \n     public's misunderstanding often drives policy makers into \n     responding inappropriately.\n       Even the level of involvement and awareness among African \n     Americans has been a disappointment to Africans. Some Kwanza \n     celebrations, important as they are for fostering a sense of \n     values and cultural continuity, can end up as grab bags of \n     various traditions--Kente cloth from Ghana, Swahili from East \n     Africa, history from Egypt--and may sometimes run the risk of \n     cultural tourism. Many agree. Makau Mutua is a Kenyan who \n     runs Harvard Law School's Center for Human Rights and also \n     serves as chairman of the Kenyan Human Rights Committee. ``I \n     think the knowledge of African Americans about Africa has to \n     be based on fact, not fiction,'' he told me in a recent \n     conversation.\n       But what can we expect? For even the most diligent \n     Africaphiles, it is difficult to find news about Africa in \n     the mainstream media--unless, of course, the United States is \n     involved. They don't call it the Dark Continent for nothing.\n       With the exception of a few major newspapers, and magazines \n     like The Economist, the print media all but ignore the \n     tremendous richness of African cultures, to say nothing of \n     the continent's variegated politics. There are 52 African \n     countries, comprised of thousands of ethnic groups with their \n     own languages, spiritualities, traditions, and arts. Even \n     speaking of things ``African'' is misleading, since that \n     adjective is forced to encompass the long-literate Christian \n     traditions of Ethiopia in addition to those of the semi-\n     primitive, nomadic East African Maasai tribe in addition to . \n     . . well, you get the picture. By any measure it is a \n     fascinating mix of cultures that is, for the most part, \n     ignored.\n       As for television, its coverage runs heavily to the \n     following: famine, poverty, war and especially animals--\n     National Geographic-style. (One example: How many stories did \n     you read about Rwanda before last year that didn't have to do \n     with Diane Fossey's gorillas?)\n       During my first week in Kenya I met a Somali refugee named \n     Amin. I assumed from my prior CNN education that, like any \n     ``typical'' refugee, he was poor and uneducated, probably \n     illiterate. He certainly looked the part: an unkempt, older \n     man wearing a faded blue suit, shiny with age. I had already \n     started a language course, so I asked him if he would be more \n     comfortable speaking Swahili.\n       ``Actually,'' he said in the King's English, ``I would be \n     equally comfortable in English, French or Italian.'' As it \n     turned out, he had received his doctorate in philosophy at \n     the University of Florence. He was, in short, far more \n     educated than I was. Meeting him made me realize how poorly I \n     understood Africa.\n       My point is not that we should all dash out and buy armfuls \n     of books about Africa (although it's not such a bad idea). \n     The point is [[Page S 8832]] rather that this ignorance \n     inevitably affects U.S. responses to the various crises that \n     we say concern us so.\n\n\n                            received wisdom\n\n       Let's take two recent examples: Somalia and Rwanda. As with \n     much of the reporting about Africa, both countries have been \n     viewed through certain lenses, or ``angles,'' replicated over \n     and over by much of the media. Somalia, we were told, is a \n     violent tribal society whose warfare exacerbated a natural \n     shortage of food, causing widespread famine. The United \n     Nations, led by the United States, went in, distributed food \n     and restored some order--that is, until the ungrateful \n     Somalis starting fighting us. Then we had to get out.\n       Similarly, Rwanda was presented as a society divided into \n     violent tribes--Hutu and Tutsi--that degenerated into \n     lawlessness when, after the President's assassination, the \n     people rose up and massacred one another. Fortunately, the \n     West came to help out the Rwandan refugees who had fled to \n     Zaire and Tanzania.\n       This is not the place for a full explication of the \n     complicated politics of Somalia and Rwanda. But it is \n     instructive to review how accurate the received wisdom was--\n     by asking a few experts.\n       First, what about the ``violent'' Somali culture? ``This \n     invocation of `mysterious primordial violence' is \n     repellent,'' said Gregory White, professor of political \n     science at Smith College in Massachusetts and a specialist in \n     African politics. ``Somali culture is certainly not bereft of \n     violence, but the intensity of the violence you see today is \n     a decidedly modern phenomenon. It must be seen within the \n     context of the arms infusions--the modern weaponry--provided \n     by the U.S. and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.''\n       How about another bit of received wisdom--the West's \n     generous and timely response to Rwanda? I asked Timothy \n     Longman, who teaches at Drake College in Iowa. Professor \n     Longman spent 1992 and 1993 in Rwanda finishing his doctoral \n     thesis on church-state relations in Rwanda. He is one of this \n     country's leading experts on Rwanda. What did he think of the \n     West's response?\n       ``It was shameful,'' he said bluntly. ``We could have \n     prevented the disaster and we chose not to.''\n       Clearly this is not the familiar media angle. And his \n     explanation of this particular point demonstrates how far the \n     media stories sometimes stray from a more complex truth. \n     According to Professor Longman, the killings were initially \n     carried out by a very small group of Rwandans and could have \n     been stopped. There were, he noted, U.N. troops already in \n     Rwanda at the time, and they could have expanded rather than \n     shrunk their presence.\n       ``The people I know who were killed were killed some three \n     weeks after the violence started in Kigali,'' he explained. \n     ``The later massacres happened because they got away with it \n     in Kigali. The West's only concern was to protect their \n     nationals and pull them out of the country--though they were \n     never really threatened. So the message given to the Rwandans \n     was that they could literally get away with murder. And \n     because it was so systematic, because it was not random \n     violence, and because it was not spontaneous violence coming \n     from the people, it could have been stopped. That's something \n     the world community had fully within its capabilities. But \n     they chose not to.''\n       Why not? The first reason, he said, derived from our \n     experience in Somalia: not to get involved in a hopeless \n     ``tribal conflict'' with ungrateful people. Smith Hempstone, \n     U.S. Ambassador to Kenya from 1989 to 1993, said in a recent \n     conversation, ``To some degree, I think that's why there \n     wasn't the reaction to Rwanda that there was to Somalia.''\n       Which brings us back to a conflict that, according to some, \n     we may have never understood in the first place. ``I think \n     the lessons we learned from Somalia were the wrong ones,'' \n     said Makau Mutua. In other words, misunderstanding bred \n     misunderstanding.\n       These admittedly isolated examples point out the difficulty \n     of making judgments about the complex environment of Africa \n     based on the simplistic presentations provided by the \n     mainstream press. Once the media-driven ``angles'' take root \n     in the public mind they become difficult to dislodge and \n     force policy to go where it perhaps should not. Our \n     perceptions of Somalia influenced our response to Rwanda, and \n     will undoubtedly influence the U.S. response to other crises \n     on the continent.\n\n\n                             other wisdoms\n\n       One touchstone for all of this, I think, is the \n     identification of African conflicts as ``tribal'' and \n     European ones as ``ethnic.'' Have you ever heard of \n     ``tribal'' violence in Northern Ireland? Well, that's \n     religious, you might say. So how does one define a ``tribe''? \n     And do such groups exist only in Africa?\n       Professor Longman summed up this idea: ``It is viewed as a \n     `tribal conflict' because Africans are basically a \n     `tribalistic' people, because they're seen as `savages'; \n     they're black. Therefore, they're just going to fight one \n     another and there's nothing we can do. And I think it's a \n     mistaken notion.''\n       Why? ``It is a view driven by racism,'' said Makau Mutua. \n     His conclusion was echoed by Professor Longman: ``The more I \n     get into this, the more I interpret it in racial terms, and \n     the more it seems that black people are considered to be \n     expendable. This was what was used to justify colonialism in \n     the first place, and I think the attitudes are still there.''\n       The hard facts show that U.S. support for Africa is \n     shockingly low and may fall even lower. According to Terence \n     Miller, director of the Maryknoll Society's Justice and Peace \n     Office in Washington, D.C., U.S. aid to sub-Saharan Africa \n     (all but five African countries) was $802 million in 1994. At \n     first blush that may sound high, but consider the amount that \n     goes to just two countries--Israel and Egypt--$5.2 billion. \n     In other words, 45 countries in Africa receive about one \n     fifth the amount of aid given to those two countries.\n       Overall, total U.S. aid to Africa represents a paltry one-\n     twentieth of the foreign aid budget, which itself is only 1.3 \n     percent of the Federal budget. And the push in Congress, \n     especially among people like Senator Mitch McConnell (Rep., \n     Ky.), incoming chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, \n     is to reduce even this meager amount, while maintaining aid \n     to the Middle East at current levels. ``The world around \n     Africa is fast coming together, and this continent risks \n     becoming the odd man out,'' said Anthony Lake, President \n     Clinton's national security adviser, in The New York Times on \n     March 17.\n       Is Africa, then, to be consigned to the dustbin? A recent \n     article by William Finnegan in the March 20 issue of The New \n     Yorker focused on the depressing post-U.N. Somalia legacy of \n     no infrastructure, no government, intense poverty and, as his \n     wrenching article points out, no education for an entire \n     generation of Somali youth. He paints the now familiar \n     African scene of crumbling school buildings surrounded by \n     hundreds of idle children, their formative years slipping \n     away like the sand that blows through the empty classrooms.\n       I asked Tim Longman if he planned to return to Rwanda. \n     ``Someday,'' he said. ``But most of the dynamic and inspiring \n     people I worked with are dead.''\n\n\n                             horror fatigue\n\n       At this point, the concerned but skeptical reader might say \n     either ``Well, it really is their own fault'' or ``There's \n     nothing we can do.'' To respond to the first reaction, it is \n     helpful to remember not only the West's role in propping up \n     various dictatorships throughout the cold war and providing \n     arms, but also its earlier imposition of colonial boundaries, \n     which threw traditionally separate ethnic groups together. \n     Here is a thought exercise: Imagine a foreign power \n     conquering Mexico and Texas, and calling this resulting \n     amalgam of two separate cultures, say, Mexas. After 100 \n     years, Mexas gains independence. Do you think the former \n     Mexicans and Texans would get along very well? Probably not.\n       Indeed, when Queen Victoria and Kaiser Wilhelm were drawing \n     the borders of their East African colonies in 1884, both \n     decided they wanted a big mountain. To provide for this, \n     their ministers simply took out a ruler and drew a line \n     between Mt. Kenya and Mt. Kilimanjaro. The line divided \n     various tribal lands; thus were British East Africa and \n     Tanganyika created. These artificial boundaries endure today \n     as Kenya and Tanzania. Tribes that traditionally lived apart \n     were thrown together against their will. So saying the ethnic \n     tension is the Africans' own fault is more than a little \n     simplistic.\n       The second reaction--``There's nothing we can do''--\n     reflects a familiar sentiment. Ambassador Hempstone put his \n     finger on this feeling: ``I think that we may have reached \n     the sort of `horror fatigue' situation in which, when you've \n     seen one starving baby, you've seen them all. And that \n     bothers me.''\n       Certainly the apparent ingratitude on the part of the \n     Somalis engendered indignant reactions from the American \n     public and the press. Some of this represented righteous \n     indignation, as when Somalis dragged the body of an American \n     soldier through the streets. This is barbaric. But much may \n     be a result of the media's incessant focus on Mogadishu, \n     rather than on other areas where the famine-relief strategy \n     helped to save an estimated 300,000 lives.\n\n\n                              Into africa\n\n       What can be done in the future? This is a broad question \n     but one that warrants consideration, given that the African \n     continent is, as the director of the Jesuit Refugee Service, \n     Mark Raper, said recently, ``in a state of chronic collapse'' \n     (Am., 3/25).\n       Many feel that some sort of limited engagement must be part \n     of our future involvement with Africa, and gone is the hubris \n     of ``nation-buidling'' that went awry in Somalia. Ambassador \n     Hempstone, for example, thinks we must confine ourselves \n     largely to humanitarian efforts. ``I think one of the lessons \n     I've learned is that you don't want to try to re-create a \n     society--nation-building and all that. I'm not sure we're \n     competent to do that.''\n       Tim Longman points to another mode of engagement,``I was at \n     a conference a year and half ago with Cardinal Christian Tumi \n     of Cameroon, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other Protestant and \n     Catholic leaders from Africa. Their unanimous agreement was \n     that if the West wants to help Africa, the best thing they \n     could do right now is stop the international arms trade.''\n       Most agree that the mental isolationism that allows \n     Americans to think of Africa as alien has to end. ``I think \n     it's difficult for Americans to be interested in other \n     countries unless they feel that their own futures are \n     interconnected with the futures of others,'' said Makau \n     Mutua. He looks to the various constituencies that have \n     traditionally been concerned with African affairs--church \n     groups, the Africanist community in academia and especially \n     African Americans--to [[Page S 8833]] inform people better \n     about Africa. ``The critical point is that the lack of \n     information in this society about Africa has to be laid at \n     the door of those groups who have the ability to inform \n     people better.''\n       One hopeful sign is that the African-American community is \n     increasingly finding its voice on African politics beyond \n     South Africa. Randall Robinson's TransAfrica lobby, created \n     in 1977, has intensified the influence of African Americans \n     in foreign policy. In March Mr. Robinson created a coalition \n     of prominent African Americans who pledged to put pressure on \n     Nigeria's military dictatorship to restore democracy.\n       TransAfrica also might do well to pressure the media to \n     cover the continent more thoughtfully. A few newspapers \n     already do. The New York Time's Donatella Lorch has provided \n     consistently good coverage of Rwanda, including insightful \n     reporting on the massacre in late April of 2,000 people in \n     the Kilbeho camp. An excellent series of articles in March in \n     The Philadelphia Inquirer, ``Remnants of a Nation,'' focused \n     on Rwanda one year after the genocide of 1994. The reporter, \n     Glenn Burkins, included the standard angles--refugees, ethnic \n     strife--but also discussed lesser-known aspects of the \n     situation in Rwanda, such as the prison system and the urgent \n     need for international aid to the Rwandan Government. The \n     media can help keep Rwanda from sliding back into oblivion.\n       Similarly, the media can help by more fully explicating the \n     problems of current African trouble spots. Thousands are \n     fleeing from ethnic unrest in Burundi; Christians are being \n     massacred (and, recently, crucified) by Government troops in \n     southern Sudan, and 2,000 people have already lost their \n     lives in the past two years in ethnic land clashes in Kenya. \n     Though the Western powers are not yet involved in these \n     crises, learning more from the media could help prevent the \n     sort of spasmodic, misinformed responses to crises that will \n     continue to dog Africa in the future.\n       In the end, the problems of Africa remain our problems. The \n     people are, as Jesus would undoubtedly point out, our \n     brothers and sisters, and many of them suffer tremendously. \n     Fully 54 percent of the people of Africa live in absolute \n     poverty. Furthermore, the West has been, to some degree, \n     complicit in Africa's troubles today, not only because of the \n     colonial past but also because of our recent actions there--\n     the arms trade and our activities in the cold war. Finally, \n     as Professor White pointed out, ``Even if you just want to be \n     self-interested, the concomitant ignorance of Africa is \n     shortsighted, because in the long run, as more problems \n     continue to emerge, our ignorance will come back to haunt \n     us.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8831-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        SALUTE TO GEN. MIKE LOH\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, next week, General Mike Loh, \nCommander of Air Combat Command, will retire after 39 years of \ndistinguished service in the U.S. Air Force. I want to take this \nopportunity to thank General Loh for his unselfish service to the \nnational security interests of the United States.\n  General Loh's career began in the second class to graduate from the \nU.S. Air Force Academy. After graduating with honors, Mike Loh went on \nto serve as a decorated fighter pilot, flying over 200 missions, in \nVietnam. General Loh's awards include the Distinguished Service Medal, \nthe Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster, the Distinguished Flying \nCross, the Meritorious Service Medal and the Air Force Medal with seven \noak leaf clusters.\n  Mike Loh's career reached its zenith when he was selected to serve as \nthe Commander of Air Combat Command. As Commander of ACC, Mike Loh was \nresponsible for most of this Nation's air power and over 250,000 men \nand women. As General Loh retires, the strength, professionalism and \nreputation of Air Combat Command has never been higher. For that, a \ngrateful, more secure nation says thank you.\n  My colleagues and I in the Senate know General Loh best as a \nferocious advocate for a strong Air Force. In repeated testimony before \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, General Loh earned a reputation as \na straight shooter who would tell it like it is. General Loh never hid \nhis views or his feelings and you never left a meeting with Mike Loh \nwondering where he stood on an issue. At my request, General Loh made \nrepeated visits to my office to discuss bomber and tactical aviation \nissues. I came away from each of those meeting more informed about the \nissues, more understanding of the value of air power and more impressed \nwith General Loh's abilities. The Air Force will lose a patriot, an \ninnovator and an articulate spokesman when General Loh retires.\n  I want to thank General Loh for 39 years of loyal service to the Air \nForce and his nation. I want to thank General Loh for his steadfast \nsupport for a strong Air Force and a service that looks out for the men \nand women who volunteer to wear the uniform of the United States of \nAmerica. Most importantly, I want to thank General Loh for his \ncommitment to serve and defend the national security interests of the \nUnited States.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8833-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                LITERACY\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I picked up the spring 1995 issue of \nthe Congressional Institute for the Future and noted the following \nBarbara Bush quotation in it: ``There is really no question that \nliteracy is related to all our social concerns--crime, drugs, and \nteenage pregnancy as well as America's stature in the world, our \ncompetitiveness on the international scene, and our national security. \nLow literacy goes hand-in-hand with unemployment, low productivity, and \nproblems with job retraining in our rapidly changing communities--this \nis a now and future issue. The literacy of parents affects the \neducational chances of children. We are only just beginning to treat \nthis complex, many-sided issue with the care and concerted action it \nrequires.''\n  Barbara Bush provided significant leadership on this issue of \nliteracy, and if we're to have a truly productive country, we're going \nto have to pay more attention to this issue.\n  One complaint I hear about more from heads of major corporations is \nhow poorly prepared American workers too often are.\n  The basics have to be there in the field of education to have a well \nprepared work force. The basics are the old ``reading, writing, and \narithmetic.''\n  People in this country are not more stupid than people in other \nWestern industrialized countries, but the other countries have had the \ngood sense to put a greater stress on basic literacy.\n  We have to do the same.\n  Yes, we ought to improve the schools that we have, but we also have \nto reach out to those who have not been helped by schools, adult \nAmericans.\n  I urge my colleagues to keep in mind Barbara Bush's words of \nwisdom.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8833-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8833-S8834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  FAYE OLASOV: DEDICATED TO CHARLESTON\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me take this opportunity to \nsend birthday greetings to Faye Olasov, a friend from my hometown of \nCharleston, SC. Faye, a long-time activist in Charleston's Jewish \ncommunity who turned 70 earlier this month, soon will be honored for \nall her work to make Charleston a better place to live.\n  Mr. President, quite frankly, Faye is a whirlwind of wonder and joy. \nWhen people throughout the Charleston Jewish community think of a \nperson who embodies family and wholesome values, Faye is the first \nperson whose name comes to mind. She is the engine that has driven the \nJewish Community Center in Charleston. At various times, she has served \nas day camp counselor, activities director, CenterTALK editor, Sherman \nHouse manager, and a newspaper columnist. Last December when she \nretired from the center, she left shoes that are hard to fill.\n  Faye Rabinowitz Olasov was born June 13, 1925, in Charleston. When \nthe Nation was at war in the 1940s, she attended the College of \nCharleston, where she was business manager and editor of the yearbook \nand president of the Dramatic Society. After a distinguished college \ncareer, she graduated in 1946. On top of all her work in Charleston's \nactive Jewish community, Faye and husband Sanford Olasov had four \nchildren--Nathan, Billy, Barbara, and Judy, who my wife Peatsy taught \nat St. Andrews High School.\n  Mr. President, now the communsity is coming together to give back \nsomething to Faye, who has given so much over the years. On July 9 at \nthe Charleston Jewish Community Center, the community will honor Faye \nat a brunch that highlights her achievements and looks back at a life \nfilled with compassion and great memories.\n  Mr. President, if I may be so bold, we should all take a look at \nFaye's life and use it as the model of how to be involved in a \ncommunity. I appreciate this opportunity to recognize the warmth, \nenergy, and lifelong commitment of Faye Olasov--a true community \nleader. Let us all wish Faye a [[Page S 8834]] happy retirement and \nmany more years to come.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8833-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           A CONSUMER'S GUIDE\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, there is a great deal of discussion \nabout the loan guarantee for Mexico, most of it negative because that \nis where public opinion is today.\n  Any careful study of the merits of the issue suggest that the safer \ngamble between doing nothing or having a $40 billion loan guarantee is \nthe $40 billion loan guarantee. I do not like the option, but that is \nthe reality we face.\n  We are being asked to cosign a note, but there is some security with \na note, and if we do not go ahead, the consequences in terms of illegal \nimmigration, loss of export markets and, simply, the suffering that \nwill take place south of our border are much too clear.\n  Tom Friedman of the New York Times has a column which puts another \nperspective on this matter that I think also makes sense. He is not \ninterested in bailing out the bankers who hold some of the Mexican \nbonds, but he is interested in preserving our pension systems, which \nalso hold many of these bonds.\n  What he says makes sense, and I ask that the Tom Friedman column be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n                           A Consumer's Guide\n\n                        (By Thomas L. Friedman)\n\n       Zurich.--One of the hottest topics in finance these days is \n     how to prevent another Mexico from destabilizing the global \n     financial system. Finance ministers will tell you that the \n     subject has been dominating all their international meetings, \n     and you are going to hear a lot of their proposed solutions \n     at this week's G-7 summit in Halifax. This is a Warning: \n     There is more nonsense than common sense among these \n     proposals. Since some of them could cost you money, I offer \n     this survival guide to the I-can-prevent-the-next-Mexico \n     schemes.\n       I. Bad Ideas That Sound Good.\n       The worst of these bad ideas is the proposal to establish a \n     $50 billion standby rescue fund--administered by the I.M.F.--\n     that would be ready as a life preserver to be tossed to any \n     country dragged under the waves by global markets running \n     amok.\n       I call this idea ``The George Soros Memorial Gift Fund.'' \n     In 1992 Mr. Soros, the billionaire currency speculator, \n     mounted a fierce attack on the overvalued British pound, and \n     Prime Minister John Major of Britain spent billions trying to \n     defend his inflated currency against a devaluation. \n     Eventually the pound was broken. But you can bet that if \n     there had been a $50 billion rescue fund available in 1993, \n     Mr. Major would have tapped it. And just as surely, that $50 \n     billion would be in Mr. Soros' pocket today. The more money \n     that government leaders have to defend faulty economics and \n     their own egos, the richer Mr. Soros becomes by exposing \n     their foolishness.\n       Don't get me wrong. I'm for the Mexico bailout. But I want \n     it to be hard. Dangling a $50 billion fund out there only \n     invites buccaneering governments to be reckless. Professors \n     should never begin the semester by announcing when the makeup \n     exam will be. Governments should have to operate on the \n     assumption that there will never be a makeup exam--and if \n     there is one, it will be an extraordinary event.\n       II. Good Ideas That Are Not as Good as They Sound.\n       The best of this lot is the decision by the I.M.F. to \n     intensify its surveillance of financially shaky nations. The \n     I.M.F. used to do only a once-a-year checkup on its client \n     countries. But it was precisely in the months between annual \n     checkups that Mexico went on the wild spending binge that \n     caused its financial heart attack.\n       The I.M.F. has now promised to keep closer tabs on its \n     clients. But this is no cure-all. Remember one thing: Many of \n     Mexico's financial problems, on the eve of its crash, were \n     hiding in plain sight. Public data showed it was running \n     unsustainable deficits and was too dependent on hot money \n     from abroad. These data were ignored because investing in \n     Mexico had become a fad. Too many foreign investors had been \n     to cocktail parties where people were whispering: ``Mexico--\n     you gotta be in Mexico.'' Fads will always trump logic. When \n     the Hula Hoop was hot, no one wanted to hear that it was bad \n     for your hips.\n       III. Small Ideas That Could Make a Big Difference.\n       1. Copy Chile. Chile demands that foreigners who want to \n     buy Chilean stocks hold them for at least a year. That way if \n     your country is practicing sound economics it won't be \n     punished when the next Mexico crashes and jittery investors \n     scream to their brokers: ``Get me out of all emerging \n     markets.'' In Chile's case, investors could not get out, and \n     so Chile, unlike Brazil and Argentina, was not punished for \n     Mexico's sins.\n       2. Save, save and save. If your country has a low savings \n     rate, it will have to rely on another country's savings for \n     growth. That will make your country vulnerable to the whims \n     of global markets and global markets vulnerable to the crazy \n     behavior of your country. (See encyclopedia entry for \n     Mexico.)\n       3. America's next global economic crusade should be to get \n     more developing countries to adopt U.S.-style securities \n     laws--the toughest in the world for financial disclosure, \n     conflict of interest and insider trading. Many of the new \n     stock markets in Asia and Latin America are still rigged \n     casinos, where investors are just begging for trouble. (See \n     encyclopedia entry for Barings Bank, Singapore.)\n       4. Fasten your seat belts, put your tray tables and seat \n     backs in a fixed and upright position and enjoy the ride. \n     Because there is simply too much money, moving around the \n     world too quickly, with too few controls, and too many \n     governments ready to do anything to get slice of it, to \n     prevent another Mexico somewhere over the horizon.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8834-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             JUNETEENTH DAY\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to join my fellow \ncitizens in the State of Wisconsin in celebrating Juneteenth Day, a day \nwhich celebrates the abolition of slavery in the United States. As much \nas any other event in African-American history, the Emancipation \nProclamation was one step in the long struggle which has lasted the \nlast two centuries. This document is an affirmation of freedom and \ndignity, and is also a reaffirmation of the goals, hopes and dreams of \nall African-Americans.\n  The African-American community has given so much to this country, and \nJuneteenth is a day to celebrate the many achievements made by African-\nAmerican men and women. This day is not only a celebration of freedom, \nbut a statement of understanding and pride in the African-American \nculture. History is rich with the contributions made by African-\nAmericans, and they continue to be a valuable part of this society.\n  The Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 was the beginning of a long \nroad for the African-American community which we still continue to \ntravel today. The fight for equality continues and we must push for the \ndream of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. that all children ``not be judged \nby the color of their skin but by the content of their character.'' We \nhave come a long way since the enactment of the Emancipation \nProclamation, but we must persist with the idea that each person in \nthis country be offered every opportunity and there is equality in \nevery aspect of society. I invite my colleagues to join me in \ncelebrating Juneteenth Day, a day of freedom, pride, and dignity in the \nAfrican-American community.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8834-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8834-S8835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  UNICEF ASKS BROADER AID FOR CHILDREN\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, recently, Barbara Crossette had an \narticle in the New York Times titled, ``UNICEF Asks Broader Aid For \nChildren.''\n  The article quotes the new head of UNICEF, appointed by the President \nof the United States, Carol Bellamy, as saying the United States should \ndo better in our response to the needs abroad.\n  I could not agree with her more.\n  I hope we do not diminish the United States contribution to world \nstability by cutting back on foreign aid, as we seem destined to do \nright now.\n  I ask that the Barbara Crossette piece be entered into the Record at \nthis point.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 12, 1995]\n\n                  Unicef Asks Broader Aid For Children\n\n                         (By Barbara Crossette)\n\n       United Nations, June 9--The United States now ranks lowest \n     among 21 industrial countries in the amount of foreign aid it \n     gives in relation to its gross national product, according to \n     a new study by Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund.\n       Although American aid is second only to Japan's in \n     dollars--$9.7 billion as calculated by international \n     organizations using 1993 figures--it represents 15 hundredths \n     of 1 percent of G.N.P.\n       The Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands lead the \n     list, with levels above 80 hundredths of 1 percent, and in \n     those countries, as in the United States, aid budgets are \n     facing new cuts.\n       The general reduction in foreign aid comes at a time when \n     Unicef is urging all countries to look at the situation of \n     children in the broadest terms, including the environments in \n     which their mothers live.\n       ``The child can't really be seen as separate and on an \n     island,'' said Carol Bellamy, Unicef's executive director. \n     ``You can adopt some concrete objectives and go out and seek \n     to achieve them, but the child has to be seen in the broader \n     context of the community.''\n       In an interview here last week before leaving for Berlin, \n     where she released the report [[Page S 8835]] today, Ms. \n     Bellamy said the Unicef board had recently approved clean \n     water and education programs that would benefit whole \n     villages and people of all ages.\n       Taking a broader look, she said, means that programs can be \n     tailored to national needs and levels of development: basic \n     survival in a country like Chad or children's rights in \n     Argentina or Chile.\n       Among its recommendations, the report calls for campaigns \n     to attack vitamin deficiencies and malnutrition, the \n     precursors to disease in many countries, and to ameliorate or \n     end deprivations and social abuses of children that weaken \n     them and ultimately threaten their lives.\n       ``In all regions of the world,'' the report said, \n     ``children continue to be malnourished, to be plagued by \n     preventable disease, to be denied even a basic education.''\n       Unicef says that about 200 million children worldwide \n     suffer from vitamin A deficiency, which impairs the immune \n     system and can lead to blindness and death. One million to \n     two million children's lives could be saved each year by \n     vitamin supplements, the report says.\n       About half of the 13 million children who die each year are \n     victims of three major illnesses: pneumonia, diarrheal \n     disease and measles. While measles is in retreat, the report \n     says, pneumonia, the single largest killer of children, is \n     not. And AIDS is now a threat. About one million children now \n     have the virus that causes AIDS, many in Africa and Asia.\n       With the world population growing fastest in the poorest \n     countries, where children are likely to live in the worst \n     conditions, Ms. Bellamy said the reduction in aid was \n     especially unfortunate.\n       ``None of us benefit if our partners in development are \n     being hurt, because we are actually all in the same \n     development boat,'' she said.\n       Ms. Bellamy, a former Peace Corps volunteer in Guatemala \n     and director of the Peace Corps before she joined Unicef in \n     May, said she had the point of interrelationships driven home \n     when she became City Council President in New York in 1978.\n       ``Here in New York City--the industrialized world--we had \n     not had a full-scale immunization program for a number of \n     years,'' she said. ``A third of all youngsters in New York \n     City schools and close to a half of poor youngsters were not \n     immunized. So we started a program to get all kids immunized.\n       ``There is a direct connection between that investment in \n     aid and health care back here in the United States. If polio \n     breaks out one place in the world it can just come back and \n     spread again.

Mr. President, I rise to offer my gratitude and \nrespect to a long-time member of my staff, Eugene Peters, who recently \nleft my office after 10 years. I will miss Gene, as will everyone who \nworked with Gene on my staff, and his colleagues and counterparts on \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Gene is a member of a very small club here--second-generation Capitol \nHill staffers. His father held several high posts in the House of \nRepresentatives, and Gene worked his way through college, in New \nJersey, by spending summers as an elevator operator in this building. \nBy the time he joined my staff in 1984, Gene had turned to scientific \nand academic pursuits, completing graduate work in both engineering and \npublic policy. But while he may have been taught to think like an \nengineer, he was a natural at the very different and less orderly \ndemands of getting legislation passed. His instinctive, entrepreneurial \nskill was demonstrated by his ability to handle hundreds of issues at \nonce and find opportunities in each one to improve the quality of life \nin New Jersey.\n  Gene Peters deserves not only my thanks, but those of the people of \nNew Jersey. The shore is clean again this summer, because, in part, of \nGene. Open spaces, which are jealously guarded in a State so densely \npopulated, remain pristine, because of Gene Peters. There is less lead \nin the air and soil, and more awareness of its dangers, because of \nGene.

Mr. President, today, I would like to share an \nimportant Chicago Tribune article with my colleagues. It highlights an \ninteresting new program offering healthy alternatives to gang members.\n  Irving Spergel, a University of Chicago professor and national expert \non gangs, has founded a program in the Little Village neighborhood of \nChicago designed to reduce gang violence. The program, which is \nfederally funded, is entitled the Gang Violence Reduction Project. \nProfessor Spergel is building on the many failures and few successes of \npast gang intervention programs. Based on his experience in this field, \nhe is careful not to set his sights too high. He is not trying to \neliminate gangs, nor is he trying to turn them into peaceful entities. \nSuch efforts have been tried, and they have almost always failed. \nInstead, his program focuses on individual gang members who have \nviolent histories, uses simple tools such as jobs, education, and \npersonal attention, and emphasizes community involvement and \ncooperation in the effort.\n  Gang intervention is an inexact science and any success is usually \naccompanied by heartbreaking failures. However, there is some \nindication that this approach is working where others have failed. In \nthe 2 years prior to the start of the project, there were 15 gang-\nrelated homicides in Little Village, compared to 8 such homicides in \nthe 2 years that followed. Aggravated assaults in Little Village rose \n19.4 percent, but skyrocketed 291 percent in a nearby neighborhood with \nthe same profile during the same time period. While these are not the \nkind of statistics that make headlines, in the complicated effort to \nreduce violence, they are indeed promising.\n  But these statistics don't tell the story of this program's success \nas well as the individual examples of the young people it has helped. \nBy the age of 19, Guillermo Gutierrez had already survived two \nstabbings and a shooting, and was a suspect in a drive-by shooting. \nBefore he met Marilu Gonzalez, who runs a new community group called \nNeighbors against Gang Violence formed by the Gang Violence Reduction \nProject, Guillermo believed there was nothing anyone could do for him. \nOne year later, he has earned his high school equivalency certificate. \nEven more importantly, he has discovered his community. Guillermo \nvolunteers as a tutor for elementary school children and at an AIDS \nprevention project.\n  Although Guillermo's story is an example of one of the successes of \nthis program, it is a qualified success. Guillermo recently began a 6-\nyear prison sentence for attempted murder from a nonfatal drive-by \nshooting he committed before he began participating in Professor \nSpergel's project. Many would consider Guillermo a lost cause. Yet, the \nday after his sentence, Guillermo spent 8 hours volunteering at \ncommunity service projects.\n  The story of Little Village is an important lesson for everyone \nconcerned about violence. The causes of violence are complex, and no \nsingle approach will solve the problem. We should not expect violence \nreduction programs to produce miraculous changes in troubled \ncommunities. We should, however, continue to provide the seed money for \ninnovative programs such as the Gang Violence Reduction Project. I ask \nthat the full text of the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n                [From the Chicago Tribune, June 5, 1995]\n\n                Giving Gang Members Options, Not Threats\n\n                          (By George Papajohn)\n\n       ``There's nothing you can do for me.''\n       Meeting the cold glare of the young gangbanger issuing this \n     challenge, Marilu Gonzalez had little reason to doubt him.\n       For his part, Guillermo Gutierrez, a dropout, a heavy \n     drinker, a survivor of two [[Page S 8836]] stabbings and one \n     shooting and the suspect in a drive-by shooting, had plenty \n     of reasons to believe no adult could help him--or would want \n     to.\n       A year later, with Gonzalez's help, Gutierrez can smile at \n     his insolence. He has earned his high-school equivalent \n     certificate, given up drinking and immersed himself in a \n     series of community service projects. When he talks to \n     Gonzalez, he exudes sincerity, not hostility.\n       ``I want to study till my brains fall out,'' says the 20-\n     year-old, who quit high school his sophomore year and still \n     has a bullet in his ankle from a gang shooting.\n       And those days of gangbanging still haunt Gutierrez. On \n     Monday, he's set to begin a six-year prison term for \n     attempted murder from a non-fatal drive-by shooting last \n     summer, committed before he put his trust in Gonzalez.\n       It took an unusual program focusing on the seemingly \n     intractable problem of gangs--and making some demonstrable \n     inroads--to bring Gutierrez and Gonzalez together.\n       For three years, University of Chicago researchers, Chicago \n     police, youth counselors and community activists like \n     Gonzalez have been trying to reduce gang violence in the \n     Little Village neighborhood by refusing to believe that hard-\n     core gang members like Gutierrez are beyond help.\n       Although the changes in Gutierrez seem stunning, they can \n     be traced to a careful plan laid out by one of the nation's \n     foremost experts on gangs, U. of C. professor Irving Spergel, \n     who is trying to build on the many failures and the too few \n     successes of past gang intervention programs.\n       Spergel has no illusions of eliminating gangs in Little \n     Village, a working-class enclave of Mexican-Americans on the \n     Southwest Side. That would be unrealistic, and Spergel, 71, \n     has studied gangs for too long to be naive.\n       His project is not trying to turn the two targeted gangs--\n     the Latin Kings and the Two-Six, both with decadeslong \n     histories of violence--into peaceful entities. That has been \n     a proven recipe for disaster, often serving only to \n     strengthen a gang's organizational structure. Instead, the \n     youth workers try to change individual gang members who seem \n     the most prone to violence.\n       And the project is not aimed at forging gang truces or \n     holding peace summits. That's far too showy and superficial. \n     Instead, it relies on solutions that are startlingly simple: \n     jobs, education and personal attention.\n       But while the name of the federally funded program--The \n     Gang Violence Reduction Project--is mundane, its goals are \n     lofty.\n       Few gang programs across the country can claim to make a \n     difference. Fewer still can prove it through rigorous \n     evaluation.\n       ``You can't wipe out gang violence,'' Spergel said. ``But \n     it looks like something we're doing is working.''\n       He thinks he now has the statistics to back him up.\n       In the two years prior to the start of the project in \n     August 1992, labeled Time I, there were 15 gang-related \n     homicides. In the two years that followed, Time II, there \n     were eight.\n       Gang-related aggravated batteries and aggravated assaults \n     are up, but at nowhere near the pace of similar areas such as \n     Pilsen, another Latino neighborhood with a long-standing gang \n     problem. For instance, aggravated assaults in Little Village \n     rose 19.4 percent but skyrocketed 291 percent in Pilsen.\n       Researchers also surveyed 86 gang members to estimate the \n     number of violent incidents they were involved in during Time \n     I and Time II. The average dropped from 26 to 11.\n       What's clear is that progress in Little Village has to be \n     measured in small increments. Gangs still have a strong grip \n     on the community and its youths, and gang involvement in drug \n     dealing is rising. Little Village still has a very big gang \n     problem.\n       Some local observers, however, say the neighborhood now has \n     something it didn't have two years ago; a blueprint for \n     change, sense of purpose and a glimmer of hope.\n       ``From the outside it might seem like it's status quo, but \n     you don't realize how many lives have been touched,'' said \n     Romero Brown, director of the Boys and Girls Club in Little \n     Village.\n       One of Spergel's tenets is the need for a community to \n     marshal all its resources in an effort to redirect gang \n     members.\n       That has meant that the youth counselors supervised by the \n     university come from the neighborhood and probably still have \n     friends in the gang; it has meant the formation of a new \n     community group run by Gonzalez, Neighbors Against Gang \n     Violence; and it has meant developing a better relationship \n     with police and probation of officers.\n       The youth workers often are the catalysts. One of their \n     responsibilities is to alert police of impending gang \n     attacks.\n       ``We'll let the cops know if there's a planned \n     retaliation,'' Spergel said. ``The police will be out there \n     to prevent it.''\n       A more important and subtle duty, though, is for youth \n     workers to gain the trust of gang members and refer them to \n     Gonzalez. These workers hook gang members up with jobs, get \n     them back into school and even refer them for psychological \n     counseling.\n       Two tactical officers assigned to the area also have gone \n     out of their way to get to know the gang members. They advise \n     the youth workers on who are the best candidates for change. \n     They're still looking to bust the bad guys, but they also are \n     more willing than in the past to identify the good kid gone \n     astray--and they'll encourage a gang member to call Gonzalez \n     or one of the youth workers if he or she needs help.\n       From the youth worker's perspective, the idea is to give \n     the gang member options, not lectures or ultimatums to leave \n     the gang.\n       ``We don't talk about that,'' said Javier Avila, 26, field \n     supervisor for the three youth workers and a longtime \n     neighborhood resident. ``That will happen in time if we do \n     what we're supposed to do.''\n       Said Brown of the Boys Club: ``You can't go in and say, \n     `I'm going to save you.' You have to help them be able to see \n     things for themselves.''\n       In the last year, as new worlds have opened up to him, \n     Gutierrez has learned there's more to life than the street \n     corner. He traveled to Boston for training in the national \n     youth service program and has worked on City Year, the \n     national youth service program, on various community projects \n     throughout Chicago.\n       But his life still is in transition. When pressed, he said \n     he still considers himself a gang member, but not a \n     gangbanger--somebody out wreaking havoc in the community.\n       There's no single way to measure whether a gang member has \n     turned his or her life around. But here's one piece of \n     evidence in Gutierrez's case: The day after he appeared in \n     court to plead guilty and receive his sentence, he showed up \n     at 8 a.m. for his City Year project. The next eight hours \n     would be split between an AIDS prevention project and \n     tutoring grammar-school children.\n       Gutierrez resisted the temptation to stay home and nurture \n     his anger about the prison sentence.\n       ``I'd rather come here,'' he said. ``It's important to me. \n     if I stop doing this, I'm going to get the mentality that I \n     used to have--screw the world, nobody cares, I ain't going to \n     make a difference.''\n       In prison, he said, he hopes he can begin earning college \n     credits. But he also knows that, depending on the prison he \n     is assigned to, gangs may continue to have a heavy influence \n     on his life.\n       All involved in the program have learned, if they didn't \n     suspect it already, that gang intervention is an inexact \n     science.\n       ``You've got to assume that no one approach will work,'' \n     Spergel said. ``Sometimes a guy get a job and has extra money \n     and uses it to buy more weapons.''\n       Avila told the story of another youth who was enrolled in \n     the same service program that helped Guiterrez adopt his new \n     outlook. That youth is no longer in the program or in Little \n     Village, having been arrested in Texas in December on charges \n     of smuggling drugs from Mexico.\n       Avila and Gonzalez took that youth's fall from grace \n     personally. They had believed he was making progress and had \n     invested long hours to help him, sometimes searching the \n     streets late at night to find out where he was.\n       Now, they believe he probably was using them, and they hope \n     they've gained some wisdom from the experience.\n       ``That's the most important thing you learn--who's conning \n     you and who isn't,'' Avila said.\n       Even though the program targeted about 200 gang members \n     three years ago for intervention, some were unreachable and \n     never were referred for jobs or training. Within the past \n     several months, two of those gang members have been charged \n     with murder.\n       Spergel still is compiling an important piece of the \n     project's evaluation: a before-and-after comparison of 140 \n     gang members based on court and police records.\n       Even without knowing the results of the Little Village \n     project, the U.S. Justice Department has been impressed \n     enough by Spergel to finance similar programs in five cities, \n     including Bloomington, Ill., as a test of his theories.\n       The programs, set in cities with emerging gang problems, \n     will be launched later this summer. Like the Little Village \n     program--which also is getting federal funding, funneled \n     through the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority \n     and the Chicago police--the price tag is about $500,000 a \n     year.\n       Gonzalez slowly has been acquiring government grants so \n     that once Spergel finishes his work in Little Village several \n     months from now, the gang program can continue.\n       There's still plenty she thinks can be done for the gang \n     youths.\n       ``They are in many ways lost individuals,'' said Gonzalez, \n     a mother of three. ``They are individuals very desperately \n     seeking something.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8835-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8836-S8837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      DANISH CREAMERY ASSOCIATION\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Lord, Judge Advocate General's [JAG] Corp, U.S. Navy, \nas he retires upon completion of 20 years of faithful service to our \nNation on July 1, 1995.\n  Upon his retirement Commander Lord will be leaving the Secretary of \nNavy's Office of Legislative Affairs where for the past 3 years he has \nserved with distinction as the primary liaison point between the Navy \nand the Congress on some of the Navy's most critical issues, to include \nall issues involving Navy personnel, recruiting, military health care, \nand the Naval Academy.\n  Commander Lord, a native of North Adams, MA, graduated from the U.S. \nNaval Academy in 1975. He was commissioned an ensign and served on \nU.S.S. Marathon (PG-89) as the engineering and weapons officer. \nFollowing decommissioning of the Marathon, Commander Lord served on \nU.S.S. Hewitt (DD-966) as fire control officer.\n  Commander Lord was selected to participate in the Navy's law \neducation program, and in 1981, earned his law degree at the University \nof Virginia. As a Navy JAG officer, Commander Lord served as trial \ncounsel, defense counsel and legal assistance officer at the Naval \nLegal Service Offices in Norfolk and Oceana, VA. In 1983, he served as \nthe first staff judge advocate to commander, Cruiser Destroyer Group 8 \nwhere he was responsible for providing legal advice to the commander of \nthe 42 ship group. He then served as the officer in charge of the Naval \nLegal Service Office Detachment in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In 1987, \nCommander Lord became the legal advisor to the commandant of \nmidshipmen, U.S. Naval Academy. In 1990, he reported to the Military \nPersonnel Division of the Office of the Judge Advocate General where he \nserved as the lieutenant commander detailer until Commander Lord \nreported to his present position in the Office of Legislative Affairs.\n  Commander Lord's awards have included the Meritorious Service Medal--\ngold star in lieu of second, the Navy Commendation Medal--gold star in \nlieu of second, and the Navy Achievement Medal--gold star in lieu of \nsecond. He is authorized to wear the Overseas Service Ribbon.\n  Mr. President, Commander Lord has truly been a great credit to the \nNavy throughout his career. I know that many of my colleagues are \npersonally aware of his hard work over the past 3 years in the Office \nof Legislative Affairs and his significant and direct contribution to \nthe future readiness and success of the Naval service. It gives me \ngreat pleasure to recognize Comdr. Mike Lord and to wish him, along \nwith his wife, Shirley, and their daughters, Tara, Kelley, and Lindsey, \n``fair winds and following seas,'' as he concludes a distinguished \ncareer in the U.S. Naval Service.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8837-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  BANKING PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITIES\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I would like to tell my colleagues \nabout four banks in Illinois that have joined with nonprofit firms in a \npartnership that creates community service projects to serve \nunderdeveloped communities. I am pleased to recognize South Shore Bank, \nUptown National Bank of Chicago, AMCORE, N.A., Rockford, and Magna Bank \nof Illinois for their investment in vulnerable neighborhoods. These \nfour banks have recently been recognized by the Social Compact, an \norganization that promotes private sector firms working with nonprofit \norganizations to relieve impoverished neighborhoods.\n  South Shore Bank has worked in conjunction with The Neighborhood \nInstitute [TNI]. This partnership has allowed South Shore Bank to \ncontribute to the 71st Street Commercial Revitalization Project, an \neconomic development strategy that targets a distressed, one mile \ncommercial strip. The project includes restoring to use three abandoned \nproperties, and assisting 34 small businesses with start up and \ndevelopment expenses. This project funded by South Shore has also \ncreated 70 jobs for local residents.\n  Uptown National Bank of Chicago has worked in conjunction with the \nVoice of the People in Uptown, Inc. This partnership has made the dream \nof home owning a reality for 28 lower income immigrant and minority \nfamilies in the urban Chicago land area. This $2.7 million project has \nallowed new construction as well as rehabilitation of existing sites.\n  AMCORE, N.A., Rockford, has worked very closely with Zion Development \nCorp. [ZDC]. Through their partnership, AMCORE has construction and \npermanent financial loans with flexible terms available, enabling \nconstruction of 21 affordable housing units and added commercial space.\n  Magna Bank of Illinois has worked in conjunction with Winstantley/\nIndustry Park Neighborhood Organization [WIPNO] to provide the capacity \nto meet the needs of the local residents.\n  These four banks have provided something to these communities that \nwas once a dream, but now is reality. They have provided their industry \nwith an example that I hope the rest of the banking industry will \nfollow.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8837-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8837-S8838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     AUTHORIZING PRODUCTION OF RECORDS BY THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON \n                              INTELLIGENCE\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

The Inspector General is \nseeking copies of transcripts of hearings, briefings, and interviews \nthat the Senate Intelligence Committee received on the Ames case last \nyear.\n  Mr. President, these two resolutions would authorize the chairman and \nvice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, acting jointly, to provide \ncommittee records in response to these requests, utilizing appropriate \nsecurity procedures.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8837-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n     NOMINATION OF JOHN P.

For the information of all Senators, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the highway bill tomorrow at 9:30.\n  Rollcall votes can be expected on or in relation to amendments to the \nhighway bill, however there will be no rollcall votes prior to 11:30 \na.m., on Thursday. Senators are also reminded at 12 noon the Senate \nwill resume debate on the nomination of Dr. Foster, with a cloture vote \noccurring on the nomination at 2 p.m. Also to alert Members following \nthe cloture vote and completion of highway bill, it is the intention of \nthe majority leader to turn to the consideration of S. 240, the \nsecurities bill.\n  I would point out, therefore, under this agreement, if we are not \ncompleted with the highway bill, which I do not think we will, because \nwe only have half an hour for votes between 11:30 and 12. Therefore, \nafter the cloture vote at 12 o'clock on Dr. Foster, we will be \nreturning to the highway bill for some time. I hope not too long.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield for a \nquestion? Did I understand him to say that following the disposition of \nthe cloture vote on Dr. Foster, however that turns out, that we move \nback, then, to the highway bill?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is right.\n  Mr. FORD. What about S. 240?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The agreement between the leaders reads as follows, \n``That following the cloture vote and the completion of highway bill . \n. . .''\n  Mr. FORD. All right.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. So, those things will be done before moving to the \nconsideration of S. 240, the securities bill.\n  Mr. FORD. I wanted to be sure about that. There was some discussion \nearlier that we might set the highway bill aside and go to S. 240. I \nthought it would be much better to finish the highway bill and then go \nto S. 240.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator's wishes are attained, because the agreement \nclearly says, ``will complete the highway bill.'' I hope it will not \ntake too long.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/21/senate-section/article/S8838-4", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 8:30 A.M.
