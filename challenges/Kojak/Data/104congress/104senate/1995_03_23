We exclaim with Jeremiah, ``Through the Lord's \nmercies we are consumed, because His compassions fail not. They are new \nevery morning; great is Your faithfulness.''--Jeremiah 3:22-23.\n  Almighty God, we praise You for the constancy and consistency of Your \nfaithfulness in blessing and guiding the Senate of the United States \nthrough the years of our Nation's history. We turn to You again today \nand know that You will be faithful to give the women and men of this \nSenate exactly what is needed in each hour, each challenge, each \ndecision. Often we become burdened with the heavy responsibilities of \nleadership on our shoulders. When we pray: Lord lighten the load or \nstrengthen our backs. Your response is to strengthen us physically, \nintellectually, and spiritually. You never fail us; never let us down; \nnever leave or forsake us.\n  Empower us to emulate Your faithfulness in our responsibilities and \nrelationships today. May we be people on whom others can depend. Help \nus to say what we mean and mean what we say. We want each decision to \nbe guided by how we perceive You would decide. Give us light when our \nvision is dim, courage when we need to be bold, decisiveness when it \nwould be easy to equivocate, and hope when others are tempted to be \ndiscouraged. So we commit ourselves to be Your faithful servants, the \nexamples of patriotism to our people, and the crusaders for Your best \nfor our Nation. In Your holy name Yahweh and through Christ our Lord.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/23/senate-section/article/S4409-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 4, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 4) to grant the power to the President to reduce \n     budget authority.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       (1) Dole amendment No. 347, to provide for the separate \n     enrollment for presentation to the President of each item of \n     any appropriation bill and each item in any authorization \n     bill or resolution providing direct spending or targeted tax \n     benefits.\n       (2) Abraham modified amendment No. 401 (to amendment No. \n     347), to require the Congress to approve the bills prior to \n     transmittal to the President.\n       (3) Levin/Murkowski/Exon amendment No. 406 (to amendment \n     No. 347), to clarify the definition of items of \n     appropriations.\n       (4) Hatch amendment No. 407 (to amendment No. 347), to \n     exempt items of appropriation provided for the judicial \n     branch from enrollment in separate bills for presentment to \n     the President.\n       (5) Daschle amendment No. 348 (to amendment No. 347), in \n     the nature of a substitute.\n       (6) Exon (for Byrd) amendment No. 350 (to amendment No. \n     347), to prohibit the use of savings achieved through \n     lowering discretionary spending caps to offset revenue \n     decreases subject to pay-as-you-go requirements.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, again, just for the information of our \ncolleagues, under a unanimous-consent agreement, we have only until 10 \na.m. \n[[Page S4410]]  this morning for additional amendments to be offered. \nThose amendments must be amendments that have been cleared and are on \nthe list as agreed to by the unanimous-consent agreement. Those must be \noffered by 10 a.m., after which we will turn to 2 hours of debate on \nthe Daschle substitute amendment.\n  So Members can expect votes throughout the day, but need to be aware \nof the fact that the time is fast running out for the offering of \namendments. That time will elapse at 10 a.m. this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the Senator from \nIndiana outlining the procedures which are strictly in the order of \nwhat the agreement has been. Since I know of no person on the floor \nready to offer an amendment, except possibly the Senator from \nWashington, I think it would not be out of order if we would proceed at \nthis time if anybody wishes to offer amendments in order to receive \npriority before 10 o'clock. In lieu of that, I think it would be in \norder for statements to be made for whatever purposes.\n  With that, I yield the floor, as I see my colleague from the State of \nWashington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 388 to Amendment No. 347\n\n    (Purpose: To limit the rescission of items of appropriation to \n                      unauthorized appropriations)\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 388 to amendment No. 347.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 5, line 7, after ``and'' insert the following: \n     ``shall not mean appropriations authorized in a previously \n     passed authorization bill; and,''.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I had intended to offer this amendment, \nbut in the interest of moving this legislation, I will ask unanimous \nconsent, after I make a brief statement, that my amendment be \nwithdrawn.\n  The amendment I was going to offer would have allowed the President \nto rescind all unauthorized appropriations.\n  I feel that this goes to the heart of the concerns of the American \npeople about line-item legislation.\n  Mr. President, we need a commonsense solution to cutting out pork, \nwhile at the same time, protecting those programs the American people \nreally care about. I want to be able to be here and fight for the \npeople I represent.\n  I believe that the amendment offered at the end of yesterday's \nsession by my good friend, the minority leader, and the distinguished \nSenator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], goes a long way in achieving that \ncommonsense solution.\n  Like my amendment, this approach will allow the President to cut all \nthose 11th hour deals in conference committees. It eliminates the back-\nroom wheeling and dealing.\n  Mr. President, without this amendment, the Dole substitute to S. 4 \ngoes too far. It is a radical, unworkable approach to a difficult \nproblem. It gives the President too much power over the American \npeople. It is too complicated. It creates too much bureaucracy.\n  The substitute before us enables the President randomly to veto \nprograms that the people's representatives in Congress debate, and \ncompromise on, and authorize in the name of our constituents.\n  Yesterday I listened very carefully to the debate. I heard the \ncomments of Senator Nunn and I heard the comments of my friend and \nneighbor, the distinguished Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield]. Mr. \nPresident, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee gave a stirring \nspeech, full of wisdom and common sense about why the line-item \nlegislation is bad public policy.\n  In particular, he noted the unprecedented transfer of power from the \npeople to the White House. Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to read \nthe speech made by the Senator from Oregon in the Record. I cannot \nsupport the Dole substitute--it is the breeding ground for abuse and \npolitical horsetrading.\n  I want to give the President the ability to line-item veto all those \nportions of appropriations bills that have not been through the hearing \nand authorization process. All those pork items contribute to our \ndeficit.\n  This is the spending the American people are angry about: the \nunauthorized buildings, the earmarked research, and the special \ninterest projects.\n  But, Mr. President, the American people are not angry about the \nprograms that have been authorized. These come to life under the full \nglare of public scrutiny--everyone is given a chance to weigh in. That \nis why we have public witness hearings in the Appropriations Committee.\n  And, it is our job, Mr. President, to make tough choices and to craft \ncompromises. Just like we do at home.\n  Mr. President, after all the public negotiations, after all the \ncompromises that make up the congressional process--we cannot allow the \npeople's wishes to be subject to the arbitrary veto pen of one person.\n  The Congressional Research Service tells me that it would take them \ndays to compile the list of unauthorized appropriations in the fiscal \nyear 1994 Transportation bill. And, I have another list from the CRS \nwhich shows that nearly $1 in $5 in the military construction account \nwas spent on unauthorized appropriations. That is not insignificant.\n  Mr. President, I intend to vote for the line-item legislation \nproposed by my colleagues from South Dakota and Nebraska. I want to \nmake sure my constituents' wishes are not subject to the arbitrary \nbudget axe of the executive branch. I want to return some rationality \nto this debate.\n  Mr. President, the American people deserve a balanced budget. When I \narrived at the Senate 2 years ago, I faced the daunting task of \nrestoring some fiscal restraint to our budget--it was a budget of \nrunaway spending. It was a budget of misplaced priorities.\n  And, as a member of the Budget Committee, I was tasked by my \nconstituents to correct the way our money is spent.\n  That is the proper role of Congress. We, as the representatives of \nthe people, have the obligation to form a budget. It is not the \nPresident's job to appropriate money--it is this branch's duty.\n  I have learned a great deal about our budget over the past 2 years. I \nhave worked with great Senators, like the former chairman, Senator \nSasser of Tennessee, and the current ranking member, the Senator from \nNebraska [Mr. Exon].\n  Let me say, Mr. President, we are a richer country for the wisdom of \nmy distinguished colleague from Nebraska. I look forward to working \nwith him during the next 18 months, and I will miss his leadership when \nhe retires from this body.\n  Mr. President, my friend from Nebraska knows, as I know, that \ncrafting a budget resolution takes courage.\n  Reducing our deficit takes even more courage. And, I am proud of the \nrecord of the Budget Committee and the administration over the past 2 \nyears--as you know, we have reduced the deficit by nearly $100 billion.\n  We did that by leveling with the American people. By making taxes \nfairer. By cutting more than 300 programs and totally eliminating 100 \nmore.\n  That is the correct way.\n  Trying to attack government spending through a radical, unworkable \nseparate enrollment bill is not.\n  Everyone wants to lower the deficit, which blossomed and grew during \nthe 1980's. And, as I said, we have done a good job of it over the past \n2 years.\n  I am afraid some of these proposals might go too far. We need to keep \nthings in perspective. I am afraid as I look at the rescission \npackage--these are the wrong cuts to the wrong people. And, scoring a \nfew political points in a debate will have dire consequences for \nmillions of average Americans. It might sound good in a debate to \ncontrol the White House, but it won't feel good to the average \nAmericans who sit around the kitchen table in my house.\n  [[Page S4411]] Mr. President, I will support line-item legislation, \nbut not the ill-conceived, radical amendment supported by the majority \nleader.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 388) was withdrawn.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 348 to Amendment No. 347\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, in order to conserve time as much as \npossible and since we have only 10 minutes left, I will be glad to \ninterrupt my remarks to accommodate any Senator with regard to bringing \nup a measure before 10.\n  If not, I thought I would make some statements that I have with \nregard to the matter that we will be going into controlled time on at \n10 o'clock.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the Daschle substitute and urge \nmy colleagues to support it as well. Earlier this year I joined with \nSenator Domenici in introducing S. 14, which then enjoyed the support \nof the majority leader, the minority leader, and, of course, the \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator Domenici. I believed \nthen and I continue to believe now that S. 14, or a similarly crafted \nbill, would be the best course of action. S. 14 is now effectively \nbefore the Senate in the form of the Daschle amendment.\n  As Senators know all too well, passing a line-item veto is only the \nbeginning and not the end of the debate. We will need to go to \nconference with the other body, which has already passed a line-item \nveto bill in the form of an enhanced rescission bill quite similar to \nS. 4.\n  The facts are, the Daschle substitute essentially is S. 14 and \ncertainly is, in my view, far superior to the Dole substitute proposal \nthat is before the body. Unlike the Dole proposal, it was not crafted \nin a matter of a day or two. Unlike the Dole proposal, it has seen the \nlight of day and was not devised primarily as a means to obtain party \nunity. In fact, S. 14 enjoyed bipartisan support from the very \nbeginning, and it thus represents the middle ground in this very \nimportant debate.\n  In my statement yesterday, I outlined some of the concerns that I \nhave with the Dole substitute. These concerns remain today. Those of \nyou who may have been listening last night heard an excellent \npresentation from Senator Levin about the difficulties that will be \nfaced by the cutting and slicing of the bills that will be required by \nthe Dole proposal. Although it may sound rational on paper, we do not \nknow how it will work in reality.\n  No Senator should vote on these proposals without hearing or reading \nSenator Nunn's Senate speech of last night. We all know Sam Nunn, his \nintegrity, his courtesy, his understanding of the issues. And we should \nat least listen to him.\n  In addition, the Dole proposal raises serious constitutional \nquestions. There are scholars who come out on each side of the issue, \nyet no one can deny that the question will not be fully resolved until \nthe proposal is reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I have long supported the idea of giving our President the line-item \nveto power. We should do so in a manner that will most likely stand the \ntest of constitutionality. I have been in the Senate for over 16 years, \nand this is the closest we have come yet to actually passing a line-\nitem veto. We should do the job right. Mr. President, we should do so \nin a way that effectively covers special tax breaks and tax loopholes. \nWe have to look at all of the pieces of our budget if we are going to \nsolve deficits of over $200 billion annually, feeding the national debt \nthat is rapidly rising, which is now at or near $5 trillion.\n  The Daschle amendment will address tax loopholes and will assure that \ntax giveaways receive the same scrutiny as pork in our appropriations \nbills. By covering more of the budget, the Daschle substitute will be a \nmore effective tool to help our President bring some fiscal sanity to \nthe Government. The Daschle substitute will allow the President to \nscale back on appropriations, while the Dole substitute does not.\n  Yesterday I talked about the dilemma that the President faces in \nsigning a bill that on the whole is good but includes some bad parts. \nThe same view would apply to individual amounts as well. I have found \nthe Dole substitute to be an honest proposal that merits serious \nconsideration. It took a step in the right direction by including some \nspecial tax provisions. I am pleased that the majority accepted my \nlockbox amendment. The Dole bill includes a sunset provision and will \nrequire Congress to review the bill in the year 2000.\n  In many ways the Dole substitute, as amended, comes a long ways \ntoward S. 14. Yet I remain disappointed by the process which has been \nfollowed to bring the Dole substitute to the floor. Bipartisan \ncooperation was cast aside in the name of party unity. Such action is \nan ill wind for future cooperation in the U.S. Senate. The Daschle \nsubstitute is a reasonable and responsible solution to pork-barrel \nspending. The Dole proposal, with all of its questions, remains at best \na shot in the dark. It might hit the mark. It might not.\n  The Daschle substitute will work. Once again, I urge its adoption.\n                 Amendment No. 348 to Amendment No. 347\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Under the previous order, the Senate \nwill now resume consideration of amendment No. 348 on which there shall \nbe 2 hours of debate equally divided.\n  Mr. EXON. I see the Senator from Georgia is on the floor.\n  I would simply say at this time that his remarks last night and the \nremarks that he is amplifying today are so important that I have asked \nthat the remarks printed in the Record last night be laid on every \nSenator's desk because I think every Senator should know about them.\n  I now yield whatever time is required to the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I made a lengthy presentation last evening \nrelating to the defects in this substitute that is now before us. I \nwould like to say at the outset I believe the current practice, where \nrescissions come over from the President and if we take no action \nnothing is changed, is unacceptable. That practice gives the President, \nreally, no authority to point out specific items in appropriations \nbills and to have any hope that they will be corrected if they are \nwasteful.\n  I have always contended and still contend that Presidents have \nenormous power if they would just veto the whole bill and then indicate \nto the American public what is wrong with the bill. That would put the \nonus on Congress to correct it. But apparently Presidents do not choose \nto do that.\n  I have listened with care in the last few days to the debate on this \nso-called line-item veto. There are several things I do not believe we \nhave properly focused on. The first point that I think people need to \nunderstand is the current appropriation process. There are two types of \ndocuments that are produced by the Congress in the appropriation \nprocess, and I really do not believe the distinction between the two is \ncommonly recognized in this Chamber.\n  The first document is an appropriation bill, which is passed by both \nHouses of Congress. It is signed into law by the President, or vetoed--\nusually signed. Last year's defense appropriation bill, for example, \nwas 61 pages long. The bill is legally binding on the executive branch. \nIt becomes law.\n  The second type of document is a different type of document \naltogether and that is the report issued by the Appropriations \nCommittees and the report issued by the House-Senate conferees. The \nthree reports issued, just for instance, in connection with last year's \nDefense bill are 853 pages, covering over 2,300 lines. The policy \ndirection in these reports, often known as pork-barrel spending to the \ncritics--some of it--is not binding on the executive branch.\n   [[Page S4412]] Much of what is complained about as wasteful spending \nby the President and by the media and by others, including people in \nthis body, is not even binding on the executive branch. But people do \nnot recognize that. Not all of it, but much of it.\n  There is no requirement in law or Senate rule that an appropriations \nbill or report must contain any specific level of detail. I want to \nrepeat that because that goes to the heart of what is wrong with this \nproposal. There is no requirement in law and no Senate rule, nor would \nthey be if we passed this--there is no change here--that an \nappropriations bill or report contain any specific level of detail.\n  Mr. President, I want to repeat that. There is no requirement in law \nnor any Senate rule that an appropriations bill or report contain any \nspecific level of detail. Most appropriations bills, particularly in \nthe defense arena but not limited to defense, set forth large lump sum \namounts that are not tied to specific programs, projects, or \nactivities.\n  Looking to an example from last year's Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act, the act provided a specific sum for Army aircraft \nprocurement, $1.164 billion. The text of the act does not require the \nArmy to spend that money on any particular type of aircraft. Then the \nreport comes along and indicates how the Congress expects the money to \nbe spent. But that is a matter of political comity. It is not binding. \nThat is the key to understanding what is wrong with this substitute \nproposal which we have before us.\n  I would say most of the defects I have pointed out do not apply to \neither of the bills based on rescissions. These defects do not apply to \nthe Domenici rescission bill, which is now before us and is known as \nthe Daschle-Exon amendment, nor to the McCain rescission bill. Most of \nthe defects I am pointing out here this morning do not apply to either \nof those. I do have some problem with the McCain proposal, as I said \nlast night, because of the two-thirds requirement and the huge, huge \nshift of power to the executive branch of government, but that is a \ndifferent matter.\n  What is wrong with this proposal? This proposal is aimed at cutting \nout pork-barrel spending. That is the aim of it. I understand that. I \nshare that goal. I quote directly from the Dole substitute:\n\n       The Committees on Appropriations of either the House or the \n     Senate shall not report an appropriations measure that fails \n     to contain such levels of detail on the allocation of an item \n     of appropriation proposed by that House as is set forth in \n     the committee report accompanying such bill.\n\n  So what is it we are calling for the President to have on his desk to \nbe able to veto out, to cut out, pork? In the words of the amendment, \nwe are calling for such level of detail as is set forth in the \ncommittee report. There is no requirement that there be any specific \nlevel of detail in the committee report.\n  So what are we saying is going to be on the President's desk? \nNothing, unless the Appropriations Committees choose to do it \nvoluntarily. We are basically creating a loophole big enough to drive \nall the pork through that has ever passed the Congress, if the \nAppropriations Committees decide to move in that direction.\n  So that is what is wrong with this proposal. There can simply be an \nappropriations bill that says so many dollars for Army procurement. \nThen instead of having the information in a report, the Appropriations \nCommittee can come out on the floor, and they can make a statement \nsaying here is what we expect. And that statement would not be subject \nto being put in the bill. The President will not have anything to veto.\n  The same thing could be done on a conference report. This proposal is \nshooting at a target and missing it completely, unless the \nAppropriations Committees decide to continue to put all of it in the \nappropriations report and then to incorporate that in the bill, which \nwould be an entirely voluntarily act.\n  So the authors of this bill are trying to reach a compromise and have \ntotally missed the target.\n  Mr. President, the other big feature that is wrong with this: Let us \nassume for a moment that the Appropriations Committee decides that, in \nspite of this legislation, they are going to continue to operate with \ndetailed reports which will invite the President of the United States \nto take certain actions on items which he does not like. If they do \nthat, what they are going to do then is they are going to put all of \nthese line items in a report. They are going to put it in a bill. It \nwill be enrolled. We will send down to the President thousands of \nbills. He will get Band-Aid hands doing it. We will get candidates for \nthe Presidency on TV, and let us see who can sign the things the \nquickest because that will be the criteria of who will be President. \nThey will have to sign 10,000 or 15,000 bills a year. We will have to \nget a great signature guy, or gal, in there for President of the United \nStates.\n  So let us assume, though, that they decide not to drive a pork truck \nthrough this huge loophole. Let us assume they do not. Let us assume \nthey send all of these bills down there. Now guess what happens? The \nDepartment of Defense then has no flexibility for reprogramming. What \nthat means in practical effect is, if the C-17 runs into a contractual \nproblem or some kind of technical problem and it can spend only $500 \nmillion of a $1 billion account, the $500 million that would otherwise \nbe available to put on readiness or pay or some other urgent need will \nnot be able to be reprogrammed because you will have a line item in \nthere. What does that mean? It means every time the Department of \nDefense, or any other Department for that matter, decides they are \ngoing to change anything on the budget--and that happens every year; \nthat happens to the tune of billions of dollars--they could not do so. \nCongress has the informal procedure we call reprogramming. They send \nover to us a letter to let us know over a threshold what they are \ndoing, lets all four committees sign off on it. It is not telephone; it \nis in writing. All four committees have to sign on it--Appropriations, \nand Armed Services in the case of defense. Then they are able to shift \nmoney around. That is good government. It encourages managing programs \nright.\n  What we are doing is we will now be saying they have to come over for \na statutory change on every single item that is signed into law. Do you \nknow how many bills they are going to have to\n come over here with every year? Hundreds of them. We struggle to get \none supplemental through.\n\n  This bill here is an absolute joke. It is a joke. I really have a \nhard time believing we are really even considering this.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NUNN. I yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is exactly right with respect to the \nreprogramming requests. Every year we get committee reprogramming \nrequests from the executive agencies. These reprogramming requests do \nnot come to the Senate floor or the House floor. They come to the \nAppropriations Committee or the Armed Services Committee, or both.\n  The chairman of the appropriate subcommittee on the Committee on \nAppropriations takes a look at this, along with the ranking member, and \nthey both sign a letter giving their approval of the reprogramming. \nThis allows the agencies to have flexibility in dealing with matters \nand changing circumstances. And it is utter nonsense--nonsense--to \nforce the Congress, and in the first place to force the agencies to \nhave to come on bended knees to the Congress to change the law so that \nthey can spend the taxpayers' money wisely.\n  It all goes to show how utterly insensible this approach is. This \nbill was brought in here on Monday of this week, this substitute. The \nBudget Committee and the Committee on Governmental Affairs, on which \nthe distinguished Senator from Georgia sits, studied carefully S. 4 and \nS. 14 and sent those bills to the floor. They were put on the calendar. \nAnd neither of those bills is before the Senate.\n  Mr. NUNN. That is right.\n  Mr. BYRD. Neither of those bills is very likely to be voted on by the \nSenate.\n  But this hybrid monstrosity has been brought in here on Monday, and \non the same day that this substitute was offered a cloture motion was \noffered, saying to the Senate we are going to have \n[[Page S4413]] a cloture vote on the following day but one.\n  Now, several flaws have already been pointed out. I pointed out the \nflaw, and several other Senators did, too, with respect to the \npresenting clause of the Constitution.\n  Here we were, about to pass legislation that would give to the \nenrolling clerk of the originating House the authority and the power to \nbreak down an appropriations measure after it has passed both Houses in \nthe same form, which means the conference report, and break that bill \ndown into hundreds--as I pointed out with respect to the energy and \nwater bill of 1995, it would be 2,000--around 2,000 small bills, \n``billettes,'' and send those to the White House. The Senate and the \nHouse would not have passed any one of those bills. Neither the Senate \nnor the House would have passed any one of those little ``billettes,'' \nand they would have been sent down to the White House, and the White \nHouse would presumably sign them or veto some of them and then they \nwould be sent back to the originating body.\n  I can just about guarantee the Senator that there will never be an \noverride of any of those little bills, never be an override, and some \nof them may be of utmost importance to a region of the country or a few \nof the States or a single State.\n  This is the forum of the States. The States are represented in this \nbody. It is the only forum in which the States are represented as \nStates. And I can just about guarantee the Senator that not one of \nthose would ever be overridden because there would not be the national \ninterest in one of those that there may be when an entire bill is \nvetoed by the President. And without the national interest, I pity the \npoor little northeastern region of this country that can only muster a \nfew votes in the House if the President were, for political reasons--if \nthe President for political reasons were to veto some of the little \n``billettes'' that were of vital interest to the northeast region. The \nnortheast region, with its few votes in the House, would never be able \nto muster a two-thirds majority of that body to override that bill \nwhich would be of significance only to a region, or only to a few \nStates.\n  When I called this measure a monstrosity, I aptly named it. I will \ntry to search Webster to see if I can find a more accurate definition \nof the measure. But several flaws such as that have been found.\n  Now, the other side is attempting frenetically to fix those flaws \nthat have been brought out. Just think, as the distinguished Senator \nfrom Georgia said last night, if this bill were to be before the Senate \nfor a few more days, how many more flaws would be found.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from West Virginia if \nthis bill were before the Senate, understood by people in this body and \nthe American people, we would be going back to some other bill. We \nwould be going to a rescission bill or we would be getting on welfare. \nThis would go back to the shop for repair.\n  This bill is in bad shape, and it is going to be looked on, it is \ngoing to be looked on with scorn if it passes the Senate. We are going \nto look silly. We are going to look like we make speeches and pass them \ninto law instead of legislating. I would say to my friend from West \nVirginia there is another defect.\n  The Somalia date for a time certain----\n  Mr. BYRD. Exactly. Exactly.\n  Mr. NUNN. On deploying troops last year. It was the only way \nCongress--because the War Powers Act does not work. We know that. The \nSenator from West Virginia and I have alluded to that, along with the \nSenator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], and others. The Somalia restriction \nabout how long troops can be deployed abroad, the President could veto \nthat the way the bill is right now.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mr. NUNN. That may be worked on. I hope that will be corrected. They \njust found out about it. I do not think that is what the authors \nintended. But the President could take the line item that had Somalia \ntroop deployment in it and restrictions on it, veto that, spend the \nmoney--no power of the purse at all in terms of our foreign troops \ndeployment.\n  Another would be the Hyde amendment. Many people in this body are \nvery much concerned about the abortion question. When we legislate \nfunding restrictions on abortion in this body, one way or the other, \nwhether it is rape, incest, to protect the life of the mother, the \nPresident can take the money and veto the paragraph. Now, unless that \nis corrected, that is another tremendous, tremendous diminishing of \ncongressional power and increasing the executive branch power.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NUNN. I hope that will be corrected.\n  Mr. BYRD. In other words, the President may strip out the language \nthat imposes a condition and make it a nonconditional appropriation.\n  Mr. NUNN. Right.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is that correct?\n  Mr. NUNN. That is correct. And the question now is--I know that my \nfriends on the other side from Indiana and Arizona are going to try to \ncorrect that. The Senator from Michigan pointed out last night they are \ngoing to try to correct it. But in correcting it, can you correct it \nand still be able to get at earmarks? I do not think so. I think when \nyou correct that, you are going to have to unwind the earmark language, \nwhich brings us back. This bill needs to be thought through. We are \ntalking about serious matters here. We are not talking about something \nthat is going to be in a 30-second ad or a bumper sticker. This is \nserious business.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NUNN. We are talking about the balance of power between the \nbranches of Government. We are talking about war powers. We are talking \nabout the power of the purse. We are talking about serious business.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NUNN. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I do not intend to--this will be my last question.\n  Would not the President then be given a tool whereby he could use the \nvetoed bill and formulate policy? He would not be using the veto pen \nnecessarily to reduce the deficit.\n  Mr. NUNN. Correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. He would be using the veto pen to formulate national \npolicy. We are giving him that kind of power in this bill.\n  Mr. NUNN. The Senator is exactly right. As this bill is now written, \nit gives the President the ability to legislate by deletion.\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. NUNN. There is no doubt about it. I will tell you what else it \ngives the President. We passed a supplemental appropriations bill last \nweek that had rescissions in it. Some of the President's favorite \nprograms were cut. The Technology Reinvestment Program was cut $200 \nmillion, as I recall. Environmental restoration funds were cut. Now \nthis proposal is intended to just let him cut spending. That is what \nthe authors\n intend. I know that. But it lets him veto rescissions. If we had had \nthis in effect last week, the President could have vetoed the deletions \nor the reductions in his own budget and left the increases in.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NUNN. I will be glad to yield. I just have brief time remaining, \nand I will yield right at the end of it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am sorry that the Senator will not yield to me as he \nyielded to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. NUNN. I say to the Senator, I will yield to him when I finish my \nremarks. I will be glad to yield, glad to have a discussion. I know \nthere is limited time and I have to complete my remarks.\n  As drafted, Mr. President, the substitute provides:\n\n       The Committee on Appropriations of either the House or the \n     Senate shall not report an appropriation measure that fails \n     to contain such level of detail on the allocation of an item \n     of appropriation as is set forth in the committee report \n     accompanying such bill.\n  The whole thing is tied to the committee report, but there is no \nrequirement for a committee report. This is an empty shell unless the \nAppropriations Committee decides they are just going to send a report \nto the President, incorporate it in a bill, have it engrossed, and give \nhim a target to either increase or decrease spending, change policy, \nwhatever he would like to do.\n   [[Page S4414]] I know certain provisions are being worked out to \nchange. We are on the floor of the Senate under a time agreement and we \nare now going to make fundamental changes by amendment in a bill that \nis flawed, badly flawed. We are going to, in the last hour, deal with \nquestions of war powers; we are going to deal with questions of whether \nrescissions will be deleted. In effect, if they can delete a \nrescission, the President has increased the spending.\n  The best indictment against this approach comes from the Republican \nmajority on the Governmental Affairs Committee, because they brought \nout bills that deal with rescission. The Domenici bill, now known as \nthe Exon-Daschle bill, that is based on rescissions, does not have \nthese flaws in it. It does not tie the President's powers to items in \nthe committee report. If it is a letter, if it is a statement of \nmanagers, the President can delete by rescission under the Domenici \nbill. That is the bill we ought to be voting for.\n  I know the majority is going to vote against it, but the majority is \ngoing to regret this.\n  Look at what the majority said in Governmental Affairs Committee in \ntheir report on this bill 10 days ago. And this goes right to the heart \nof the way we are now proceeding under this substitute. This is a quote \nfrom the majority report of the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\n       It is possible, although not desirable, to apply the state \n     budgeting system to the Federal Government and give \n     Presidents the kind of line-item veto available to Governors. \n     To maximize item-veto authority for the President, the \n     details in conference reports, agency justification \n     materials, and other nonstatutory sources could be \n     transferred to appropriations bills. . . .\n\n  That is precisely what the substitute does, precisely.\n\n       However, placing an item in appropriations bills would \n     produce an undesirable rigidity to agency operations and \n     legislative procedures.\n\n  That is a quote. Exactly what this bill does.\n\n       If Congress placed items in appropriations bills, agencies \n     would have to implement the bill precisely as defined in the \n     individual items.\n\n  That is exactly what this bill does.\n  You talk about tying up the Department of Defense. This bill is going \nto do more damage to the Department of Defense than anything I can \nimagine. They are not going to be able to shift money on lapsed \ncontracts or delayed contracts with the permission of Congress to pay \nor to have readiness to make up for critical shortfalls.\n  Last fall, the Republicans complained about readiness in the \ncampaign. I share some of those concerns. We had a committee this week \nthat reported at the request of the Senator from Arizona. Four retired \ngenerals talked about the problems with the defense budget--not enough \nfunding for force structure, not enough funding for modernization.\n  Now, what are we going to do? We are going to take all of this \nmaterial, if the Appropriations Committee acts in good faith, and we \nare going to put it into a law. They are going to have no flexibility \nwhatsoever unless they come back for statutory changes. We are going to \nhave the most bogged down legislative process that I can imagine in the \nhistory of this Republic. We are going to have statutory changes by the \nhundreds requested on every single defense bill.\n  Quoting again from the majority report:\n\n       In cases where the specific amounts detailed in the \n     appropriations statutes proved to be insufficient as the \n     fiscal year progresses, agencies could not spend above the \n     specified level. Doing so would violate the law.\n\n  Exactly what we are doing in this bill.\n  I will not quote it because I do not have the time this morning, but \nthe House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, the majority \nRepublicans, said the same thing when they brought out their rescission \nbill.\n  So we have the absolute, unbelievable paradox where the majority \nreports of the Republicans on the Governmental Affairs Committee, in \nthe House and the Senate, have decried the very approach that we are \nnow about to vote on and pass. And it has all been done in the last 2 \nweeks.\n  This is not a Democratic kind of critique. This is a Republican \ncritique of the legislation now being presented and supported by the \nmajority.\n  Continuing to quote the Governmental Affairs majority report:\n\n       Agencies and departments would have to come to Congress and \n     request supplemental funds for some items and rescissions for \n     others, or request a transfer of funds between accounts. \n     Neither the Congress nor the agencies want this inflexibility \n     and added workload for the regular legislative process.\n\n  Mr. President, I will conclude my remarks very briefly. There are at \nleast five serious problems with the proposed substitute.\n  First, it contains loopholes so large that proponents of pork will be \nable to insulate whole barrels of pork from a Presidential veto if they \nchoose to do so.\n  Second, the separate enrollment procedure would allow the President \nto veto funding limitations as well as funding amounts, which would \ninhibit the ability of Congress to address legitimate policy \ndifferences with the President. Some examples I have already given are \nabortion and troop restrictions on Somalia. He can veto those \nparagraphs. Maybe that will be changed, but it is my view that you are \ngoing to have a hard time changing that without deleting the ability of \nCongress to do away with earmarks, the very target the Senator from \nArizona has been shooting at.\n  Third, this proposal permits the President to increase as well as \ndecrease spending by allowing him to sign into law those portions of an \nappropriations bill that increase spending and to veto those portions \nof an appropriations bill that rescind or reduce pending.\n  In other words, if a President chose to, under this authority, he \ncould take an appropriations bill that had been passed by the Congress \nand he could basically increase the amount in that appropriations bill \nby doing away with or vetoing the rescissions in that bill to reduce \nfunding.\n  Mr. President, I hope that will be cured. But, again, on something \nthis important, to come out here and have to cure these absolutely \ncolossal defects in this bill in the last few hours is really a hard \nway for me to visualize responsible legislation occurring.\n  So just the opposite of what the sponsors have intended could occur.\n  This is just saying to the President: We think you are a whole lot \nbetter at this than we are, so we are giving you congressional \nauthority. We are giving you the power of the purse to make decisions \nto increase or decrease. You do whatever you want. We want you to do \nit, because we have proven that we cannot.\n  Mr. President, the other thing this bill does not do, it does not go \nafter the real problems with our own process--the real problems the \nSenator from Arizona has pointed out, earmarked funds. We could have a \npoint of order against that. We could have a point of order against an \nappropriation that comes back from the conference that was not even in \nthe House bill or the Senate bill. We could have a point of order on \nthat. But none of that is in here.\n  We are basically saying, ``We cannot take care of our problems, so we \nare going to give the President a huge additional authority.''\n  Well, the result of that is, believe me, within a year, everybody \nwill realize what we have done and then we will move away from \ncommittee reports and we will have statements by managers. And then \nthere will not be anything for the President to veto, and we will start \nthe process all over again, and we add to the disillusionment of the \nAmerican people. They will finally ask: ``Can't you guys do anything \nright? We thought we were getting rid of spending, but we are not.''\n  That is what is going to happen if this goes into law. If this goes \ninto law--and the President says he is going to sign whatever we send \ndown there. That ought to frighten a few people. That ought to make us \nthink.\n  It is a great pleasure to be able to vote for darn near anything, \nknowing the President will veto it and you can make your speeches and \nit is not going to go into law and you do not have to suffer the \nconsequences and the country does not. It is another thing entirely \nwhen the President says he is going to sign it. He is going to sign \nwhat we send down there on this. And I suppose any President would \nbecause, \n[[Page S4415]]  at least on paper, if it is abided by in good faith, we \nare going to give him the largest new hunk of Presidential power that \nwe have given any President in many, many, many years.\n  And then, what we will do, because there are loopholes here, we will \ntake it away by moving the pork out of the reports and moving it into \nspeeches on the floor or statements on the floor, and we will be right \nback where we are with disillusionment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Can I ask the Senator from Indiana a question? How many \nyears has he been on the Senate Armed Services Committee?\n  Mr. COATS. Six years.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Has he ever seen a reprogramming request?\n  Mr. COATS. I have not.\n  Mr. McCAIN. According to the distinguished ranking leader, who served \nfor many years as the chairman, that sometimes entails billions of \ndollars; is that correct?\n  Mr. COATS. It appears that it does. In fact there is----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Although we never have seen them. So if you were the \nchairman of a committee and ranking member and you were the only one \nwho made a decision on reprogramming, you would be very concerned if \nsomething like this--billions of dollars in transfers of funds--was \nunder just your almost direct supervision, would you not?\n  Mr. COATS. I think the whole purpose of this exercise----\n  Mr. McCAIN. By the way, I am sorry I did not have a chance to ask the \nSenator from Georgia, has there ever been a reprogramming request from \nthe Pentagon that says, ``We can't spend this money, so we would like \nto give it back to the taxpayers''?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I yield to the \nSenator from Arizona so he may ask questions of the Senator from \nGeorgia and he may respond without having to go through this convoluted \nprocedure. In fact, I yield the floor so the Senator from Arizona can \ntake the floor to ask questions.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I appreciate the indulgence of the Senator from Georgia, \nwho has obviously for many years been the person who decided whether \nbillions would be transferred from one account to the other without \nconsultation certainly with these two Senators.\n  Mr. NUNN. Will the----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me finish; I will ask the question. Has the former \nchairman ever, the distinguished ranking minority of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, ever seen a reprogramming request that said, ``We \ncan't spend this money. We'd like to give it back to the taxpayers''?\n  Mr. NUNN. Let me say to the Senator, all reprogrammings are approved \nby the majority and by the minority. That was the case when----\n  Mr. McCAIN. By the chairman and ranking member.\n  Mr. NUNN. And staff----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Neither the Senator from Indiana nor I were ever \nconsulted on any of these reprogramming requests, him 6 years and me 8 \nyears as members of the committee.\n  Mr. NUNN. Will the Senator yield for me to respond?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. NUNN. Staff has the responsibility to circulate the reprogramming \nrequest to the respective members on both sides of the aisle. On the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, we do that. If the staff on the \nRepublican side does not let the Republican Senators know, then if I \nwere a Republican Senator on that committee, I would be asking the \nstaff some very tough questions.\n  We let our members know about reprogramming. That is a question that \nis up to the Republicans because the chairman or the ranking member on \nthe Republican side understands reprogramming requests. Many times they \nare pending for 3 weeks to 3 months. Many times there is tremendous \ndiscussion. We even have reprogrammings that get folded into the bill \nitself because they are controversial.\n  As the chairman of the committee, I never passed a reprogramming \nrequest, if I had any member interested on my side raise an issue, \nwithout a full discussion. That is the job of the ranking member on the \nRepublican side and the staff.\n  So I think there are some tough questions that ought to be asked of \nthe staff on the Republican side if the Senator from Indiana and the \nSenator from Arizona have never seen a reprogramming request. Your \nstaff signed off on it in your name.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It certainly is alarming that that kind of responsibility \nwould be placed on staff who are not elected by anybody.\n  Mr. NUNN. This is----\n  Mr. McCAIN. And the kind of a system where it is up to one or two \nmembers, the chairman and the ranking member, whether they want to \nnotify them or not. I have never seen any formal procedure or rule in \nthe committee that says that. In fact, in other committees, it is \ncommonplace that a phone call be sufficient to approve a reprogramming.\n  Mr. NUNN. That is not the way we do it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will consider answering the question, if \nhe has ever seen a reprogramming request from the Pentagon that said, \n``We would like to not spend this money and send it back to the \ntaxpayers who sent us the money.''\n  Mr. NUNN. I will say to my friend from Arizona in response to that, \nthe committee has the duty as we see fit to turn down reprogrammings, \nin which case the money would not be spent, in which case the money \ncould be reallocated to any other Department in the regular process on \nthe budget bills and on the appropriations bills. I thought my friend \nfrom Arizona just had a hearing----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am sorry the Senator does not choose to answer my \nquestion. My question is, if I may restate the question because, \nobviously, he did not understand it or does not choose to answer it: \nDid the Pentagon ever request a reprogramming and say, ``We can't spend \nthis money in the Pentagon. We want it to go back to the taxpayers''? \nThat is my question.\n  If the Senator does not choose to answer that, that is fine. But I \nhope I made myself clear as to what my question is.\n  Mr. NUNN. I understand the question completely, and I hope the \nSenator will listen to the answer. I can state it but I cannot \ncomprehend it for him. Maybe I have been under a false impression. I \nthought the Senator from Arizona and my Republican colleagues wanted to \nincrease the defense budget. I thought my Republican colleagues had \nthat in their Contract With America. I thought the Senator from Arizona \nwanted more money for defense. And now he is saying when a C-17 program \nlapses, do we want to send it back to the Treasury, or do we want to \nput it on high defense needs? I have been under the mistaken impression \nthat the Senator from Arizona was concerned about readiness, was \nconcerned about modernization and felt there were deficient funds in \nthe Department of Defense.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I regret the Senator from Georgia will not answer the \nquestion. He is entitled not to answer the question. I will repeat it \none more time, but it is obvious--I will not waste the time of the \nSenate, because he is not going to answer the question. I also want to \nsay----\n  Mr. NUNN. The answer to the question is the Department of Defense \nalways on reprogrammings asks for the money to be shifted to other \ndefense needs, and our committee has supported that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Speaking of comprehension, I say again, has the Senator \nfrom Georgia ever heard of a reprogramming request where the Pentagon \nsaid, ``We can't spend this money. We'd like to give it back to the \ntaxpayers''?\n  Mr. NUNN. The answer is no, because the Department of Defense has \nbeen underfunded.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Thank you for answering that question. I also regret the \nfact that the Senator from Georgia alleges that neither the Senator \nfrom Indiana nor I understand what we are doing here. The Senator from \nIndiana and I, for 8 years, have been involved in this issue. We know \nit very well. It has been before the Senate many times, including 1985.\n  I did not accuse the Senator from Georgia of not understanding an \nissue when we had different positions. I did not accuse the Senator \nfrom Georgia of \n[[Page S4416]]  not understanding the situation in the Persian Gulf \nwhen he opposed our military involvement there.\n  The question is not whether we understand it, it is whether we have a \nlegitimate difference of opinion here, and that is what it is all \nabout.\n  I think that the Senator from South Dakota raised some legitimate \nconcerns. The Senator from West Virginia did. But to allege that the \nSenator from Indiana and I do not understand what we are doing, I think \ndoes not elevate the debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, some of the logic and reasoning of those \nwho are opposing the line-item veto measure offered by the Senator from \nArizona and the Senator from Indiana is curious. On the one hand, they \nsay that the bill is flawed and that if Republicans would simply reach \nout and attempt to correct what they perceive to be the flaws, we will \nhave a better bill.\n  They come to the floor and say, we need a line-item veto, we need to \nhave a process in place whereby the executive branch has the option or \nthe ability to check the excess spending habits of Congress that design \nspending or tax breaks that do not serve a broad purpose, and that they \nsupport that effort, but that some of the provisions of the bill, which \nthe Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Indiana have offered, \nneed to be modified.\n  When the points they make are legitimate points, because we never \nclaimed that our bill was perfect, as no one really claims their bill \nis perfect--that is why we have an amendment process, that is why we \nhave a debate process--and when a Senator from the other side who \nhappens to want to support it but simply wants to strengthen the bill \npoints out a particular provision that is not designed or drafted as \naccurately as they think it should be suggests that and we agree with \nthem that it addresses a problem in a more accurate way, then they turn \naround and say, ``See, that is proof that the bill is flawed.''\n  Well, what are we to do? On the one hand, they criticize us because \nthe bill, they say, is flawed and needs to be improved. On the other \nhand, when we say, ``OK, we'll accept that improvement, that's a \nlegitimate improvement,'' they say, ``See, there's proof that it is \nflawed; therefore, we can't vote for that.'' That is circular reasoning \nand circular logic that this Senator finds hard to understand.\n  One of the points that the Senator from Georgia has made is that as \nthe bill is currently constructed and is currently presented, policy \ndecisions would be subject to a Presidential veto and, therefore, it \nwould require a two-thirds override. But that issue has been debated \nand discussed at length. An amendment has been offered by the Senator \nfrom Michigan, Senator Levin, to clarify that that will not happen. It \nhas been cosponsored by a Republican Senator, the Senator from Alaska, \nSenator Murkowski. It has been accepted by the managers of the bill on \nboth sides.\n It has been accepted by Republicans, and it is designed to clarify a \nprovision in the original language that there is some ambiguity on, or \nat least some are concerned about some ambiguity. It was never the \nintent of the separate enrollment legislation to separate legislative \nlanguage, to have legislative language vetoed by the President. Those \nwere the dollars that are attached to it. That was debated at length. \nThe Levin-Murkowski amendment, which is going to be accepted on both \nsides, clarifies any question in that regard. Yet, we find ourselves \nbeing criticized for a legislation which we have agreed to improve and \naccept the amendment of the very Senators who have raised the question \nof criticism.\n\n  So I do not understand how our opponents on this issue want us to \nproceed. Do they want us to work with them or not? Do they want us to \nimprove the bill or not? Do they want us to clarify ambiguities or not? \nIf they do--and it appears that most do--then others should not come to \nthe floor and say, see, that points out that the bill is flawed. The \nMurkowski-Levin amendment protects all legislative language from being \nseparately enrolled and vetoed. The policy language is protected. That \nis the intent and that is the result of the amendment which has been \nagreed to and will be accepted as soon as, procedurally, we can get to \nthat point.\n  The Senator from Georgia also points out that if we go with the \nseparate enrollment process, it will require an inflexibility in terms \nof various agencies being able to reprogram funds and, therefore, it \nwill hideously confuse the legislative process. All it will do is \nchange the way in which funds are able to be reprogrammed. Instead of \nthe current practice of a phone call or a letter to a committee \nchairman and/or the ranking member, instead of a process which involves \ntwo, and at most four Senators out of 100, we will have a process which \nwill involve all 100 Senators.\n  We spend a great deal of time crafting an authorization for the use \nof funds, and we spend a great deal of time appropriating funds for \nthat authorization. We spend a great deal of time debating those \ndecisions on this Senate floor. Clearly, situations and circumstances \nchange. So that it is appropriate for agencies to come forward and say \nthat circumstances have changed, spending was greater in this area than \nwe anticipated 6 months ago when this was negotiated, or spending is \nless in that area, and we would like to shift some funds from one area \nto the other. But what will have to take place now is that that request \nwill have to be made available to all 100 Senators. I think that is \nappropriate.\n  If the reprogramming request was always made on an objective basis, \nalways made for legitimate purposes, I think there might be some \nvalidity to the arguments presented here this morning. But I think we \nall know that they are not always made that way, that little side deals \nare concocted and, yes, phone calls are made; but phone calls are made \nafter hours, and special requests are made from certain Members to \nother Members for--Heaven forbid--political purposes, and not \nnecessarily for legitimate new expenditures or shifted expenditures, \nbut made for political purposes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. I yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask my friend, is not the issue here programming and \nnot reprogramming? The fact is that this may be a straw man. We are \ntalking about whether we are going to eliminate the waste, and if we \nwant to use the word ``pork-barrel'' spending and put some fiscal \ndiscipline in the process. Is that not really what we are talking about \nhere? And the reprogramming issue is something that could be solved \nthrough simple changes in the rules or even in how we do business.\n  I agree with the Senator from Indiana that there are abuses in the \nreprogramming process. That is not really the fundamental issue, and I \ndo not think we should be spun off into that relatively unimportant \nside issue as compared with the larger argument here. And the reason \nwhy I think both you and I are somewhat agitated is, for somebody to \nsay that this is a joke, that this is not thought through, that we do \nnot know what we are doing--I have never accused any opponent on this \nfloor of not being serious about an issue, nor have I said that a \nproposal of theirs was a joke, nor did I accuse them of not thinking \nthrough a particular amendment when they had it on the floor.\n  I give them credit for having done their homework and doing what they \nthink is for the good of their State. I think it demeans the debate for \nanyone, either on this side of the issue or that side of the issue, to \nsay somebody has not thought through an issue, and to say somebody is \nnot serious about it, and to say that what we have been working on for \n6 or 8 years is a joke. I think it is wrong and it does not do anything \nfor the debate. I would be glad to and have continued to, since last \nThursday--and many years before--debate this issue on its merits, \nrather than demeaning the motivation or the knowledge or the experience \nor the talent of those who support it, as I have not those who are \nopposed to it are.\n  I ask the Senator from Indiana if he agrees that that might be a good \nidea for us to elevate this debate back to where it has been, frankly, \nup until just a short time ago.\n   [[Page S4417]] Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his \ncomments. For Members to suggest that this is some surprise that is \nbeing sprung on Members of Congress, I simply ask, where have they been \nfor the last decade? This issue has been debated, the merits of this \nissue have been debated at length on the floor. The Senator from \nArizona and the Senator from Indiana have offered time after time \nvarious proposals to deal with the fundamental underlying issue.\n  As the Senator from Arizona has said, the fundamental underlying \nissue is the ability of Congress, under current law and current \nprocedures, to spend the taxpayers' dollars either in appropriated \nexpenditures or in tax benefits, in a way that serves no national \npurpose, in a way that is not made available to Members to debate and \ndiscuss and to cast their yeas or nays on that particular item. It is \nan egregious practice that has cost the Treasury and the taxpayers tens \nof billions, if not hundreds of billions of dollars. It is, as former \nPresident Harry Truman said, ``legislative blackmail.''\n  We all know how the process works, so we can argue some of the fine \ndetails about the current practice and what a wonderful practice it is, \nand we can even talk about reprogramming. But this Congress would \neasily adapt to and accept the requests of various agencies, if they \nwere legitimate requests. There is nothing to prevent committees from \nroutinely reporting out reprogramming bills en bloc by voice vote at \nthe end of a markup and bringing it to the Senate. There is nothing to \nprevent routine reprogramming requests from being placed on the \ncalendar and passing by voice vote.\n  But if a reprogramming request is controversial, if a Member of the \nSenate or a Member of the House wants to say, ``Wait a minute, what do \nyou mean you are shifting that money from this account to that account? \nWhat do you mean there is a problem with spending on the C-17,'' maybe \nwe ought to look into that. Why is there a problem? Do we want to \nroutinely, on the advice of four Senators, simply say, well, that is \nOK; this program needs more money; let us shift it from this account to \nanother account? Should Members of the Senate have the right to say, \n``May I ask some questions about that? Can we debate that on the floor? \nCan we have some light shed on the reasons this reprogramming is \nrequested?'' That is all we are seeking to accomplish with this \nprocedure.\n  Again, this whole issue comes down to status quo versus change. Is \nthere a better way to do business? Or do we want to do business the old \nway? Well, if business done the old way had been satisfactory, if it \nhad not been done in a way which demeans the credibility of individual \nSenators and demeans the credibility of this institution, we ought to \nstay with it. Unfortunately, it has. It is an egregious practice that \nhas been abused by Members of the Senate and abused by Members of the \nHouse. And, as I said before, we are not here to point fingers. We have \nall taken advantage of this process.\n  It is not to our credit that we have done so. It is a time-honored--I \nnow call a ``time dishonored''--practice of trying to slip some goodies \nin for the folks back home, or for one individual, or a tax break for \none person, or one special interest.\n  Members have spoken eloquently about that practice. We read about it \nin the news, hear about it on the news. It happens all the time. It is \nwrong. It ought to stop. We are trying to provide a tool and basis to \nallow it to stop.\n  For goodness sake, the sky is not going to fall on Federal spending \nif we make it a little harder to reprogram something, if, instead of \njust a letter that comes over or a phone call between an agency and a \ncouple Members of Congress, if we say it will be a little bit tougher \nto make that decision, Congress is going to have to look at it a little \nbit longer, Members are going to have the right to raise a few \nquestions and say, ``Is this a legitimate transfer?\"\n  I think it is unfortunate that the C-17--or maybe it is fortunate--\nthe C-17 is a program that has been in serious trouble from the \nbeginning. I am not saying we should not have it. I support it. I think \nwe all have the right to raise questions about whether or not money \nshifted from one account to bail out a problem with the C-17 is a \nlegitimate shift of money.\n  There are ways in which Congress can deal with routine, legitimate \nreprogramming requests without tying this place in knots. For goodness \nsakes, we are legislators. There are legislators here who know more \nabout how to expedite and loophole things--they have forgotten more--\nthan this Senator can possibly learn.\n  My concern is not that this process is going to hamstring the \nprocess. My concern is that people in back rooms right now are trying \nto find end runs around what we are trying to do.\n  Let Members at least do something. Let Members at least make it \ntougher to spend the taxpayers' dollars. Let Members give the public a \nbetter opportunity to look at the way we spend. Let Members at least \nput our ``yes'' or ``no'' on record so that the taxpayers and our \nconstituents can hold us accountable. Let Members end this practice of \nsaying, ``I could not figure out what was in the bill because it was \n2,000 pages long and that stuff was buried or slipped in in \nconference.'' Let Members make it tougher to spend money, because we \nhave been irresponsible in the way we have spent money around here.\n  Mr. President, I see there are other speakers on the floor. Let me \ninquire of the time allocation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Indiana has \n36\\1/2\\ minutes remaining; the minority leader has 30\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time to make \ncomments on the Democratic substitute and reserve the balance of the \ntime allotted to the substitute to the distinguished ranking member, \nthe manager of our bill on our side, the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Georgia raised a number of very \nhelpful points. He makes a powerful case for the substitute that \nDemocrats have proposed. The Senator from Indiana has understandably \nresponded as best he could to many of these questions. The fact remains \nthat there are serious concerns about the proposal, as well-intended as \nit might be, that the Republicans have offered.\n  The Senator from Georgia did a real service, I think, in pointing out \nso well what the Governmental Affairs Committee and the Budget \nCommittee have said about these proposals. Republicans in the Senate \nhave expressed in writing fundamental concerns about what the proposal \nnow put forth by Senator McCain and Senator Coats.\n  Senator Nunn has clearly recognized what others have recognized--that \nthis proposal is flawed. As everyone probably now appreciates, it has a \nsunset of the year 2000. I predict this morning that this bill will not \nlast until the year 2000, if it were to pass into law. I make that \nprediction. I will predict we will be back here at some point before \nthe year 2000 to vote on a bill very similar, if not identical, to the \none that we are now proposing, the so-called Domenici-Exon bill.\n  I say so in large measure because I think many people recognize that \nin spite of the fact that the other side has come a long way on a \nnumber of concerns that we have expressed over the course of this \ndebate, very serious difficulty problems remain. First, there are \nloopholes in the amendment,--there is no requirement that a conference \nreport contain a line-item level of detail. We can get around the line \nitem almost entirely by putting the details in floor statements or \nletters to agency heads. We do not have to put it in detail. That is \none loophole.\n  The alternative to that problem is to create so many separate bills, \nrepresenting so many thousands of line items, that it will make the \noperation of every agency excessively rigid. If each item becomes \nseparate law, the rigidity of that process becomes so cumbersome people \nwill say it just is not going to work and the whole system will break \ndown.\n  A third problem is that the President can actually increase spending \nunder the Dole substitute by vetoing line items that actually represent \nrescissions or general reductions. I know that the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan, Senator Levin, is hoping to address that concern \nlater on. Perhaps we can work something out.\n   [[Page S4418]] Mr. President, these are very serious concerns. I \nhope that, as we have with many of the other concerns raised throughout \nthe course of the last several days, we can address those prior to the \ntime we vote on final passage, assuming the substitute is not passed. I \nam hopeful it will be passed. I will address my reasons for that hope \nin just a moment.\n  Let me also address some of the concerns that have, in our view, been \naddressed at least in part. Our conclusion was that the original tax \nlegislation in the McCain bill that was originally proposed did not go \nfar enough. The other side has come a long way in meeting some of our \nconcerns in adopting a broad provision allowing the President to veto \nspecial-interest tax breaks. I read a colloquy into the floor last \nnight between the Senator from Indiana and the Senator from New Jersey \n[Mr. Bradley] about the intention of the Senator from Indiana to \nbroaden the scope to include the issues that were raised on many \noccasions on this floor by the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Our amendment is clear and more forceful in that regard. We will talk \nabout that. The fact is that at least the Republicans have begun to \naccept the realization that we do not have a true, broad scope in our \nline-item authority unless we have tax breaks on the table as well.\n  In addition, an amendment by the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee has been adopted that directs all savings from the line-item \nveto to deficit reduction. A similar provision was in the Domenici-Exon \nbill but left out of the Dole substitute. Now, it is back in. We are \npleased with that. Without this amendment, savings from the line-item \nveto could be used to pay for other Government spending. One pork-\nbarrel project could be cut to pay for another. That will not happen \nnow as a result of the legislation offered by the Senator from \nNebraska. This was a truth-in-advertising amendment. If we promise \ndeficit reduction, we have to deliver it. It ensures that savings from \nvetoes of entitlements and tax breaks go to reducing the deficit as \nwell. So that, too, was an improvement.\n  Then, of course, I am pleased that the amendment by the Senator from \nWisconsin was adopted to create a budget point of order against any \nnonemergency spending included in an emergency supplemental \npropositions bill. This will ensure that supplementals are truly used \nfor emergencies and are not vehicles for extraneous projects, as we \nhave seen in our recent defense supplemental.\n  There are improvements in the legislation since Monday. We can be \ngrateful for that. The real improvement, the real opportunity to make \nsubstantive progress is to go back to where we started, to go back to \nwhat the real experts on this issue have proposed for many, many years. \nSenator Domenici, the chairman of the Budget Committee, and Senator \nExon, the ranking member, have worked on this issue, as has Senator \nCoats, for a long time. Senator Domenici and Senator Exon have looked \nat all the alternatives and concluded some time ago that the most \npractical approach, the most logical way with which to address this \nissue is to suggest a line-item rescission.\n  Forty-three States, including South Dakota, already have a line-item \nveto. It is time for the Federal Government to adopt one as well.\n  That bill not only had practicality, and it was most likely to be \nupheld constitutionally, but it also included the broadest base of a \nDemocratic and Republican consensus--broad bipartisan consensus that \nthis was the approach that could actually work.\n  I have supported a line-item veto. I supported this concept. I \ncosponsored it, as did the majority leader. Many others who have \ncosponsored this legislation this morning or this afternoon will now \nhave an opportunity to vote on a bill that they cosponsored. They \nclearly saw the wisdom in using this approach or they would not have \ncosponsored it.\n  The President has been very helpful in advocating a line-item veto, \nand has been helpful in moving this process forward.\n  When the chairman and the ranking member proposed S. 14, obviously \nthey felt, and they had good reason to feel, that based upon broad \nbipartisan consensus, based upon constitutionality, based upon \npracticality, that we really had a bill that we have the confidence \ncould be passed. In fact, every single Republican who voted supported \nthis legislation in a bill that was offered last year--by a vote of 342 \nto 69. That was the vote. Mr. President, 169 Republican Members of the \nHouse supported a bill nearly identical to the substitute that we are \noffering right now. So we have every expectation that this bill has \nenjoyed support on a broad, bipartisan basis in the past and there \nought to be no reason why we could not ensure that the same level of \nbipartisan support could be found again as we vote later on this \nafternoon.\n  That is really what we have all said we want. We want a line-item \nveto. We want one that is practical. We would like one to see broad \nbipartisan support when it passes. This substitute offers all of that \nand more. Basically, there is no secret, no mystery to how this works. \nI talked about this a little bit last night, but let me make sure \neverybody understands how simple the process is. That is really one of \nthe advantages to our approach, it is so simple. It gives the President \nthe authority to force Congress to vote on spending and tax provisions \nthat he considers wasteful. That is all it does. And it sets a \ntimeframe within which that must happen.\n  We all know the situation now. We all recognize that we can ignore \nline items as they are rescinded now. There is no requirement that \nCongress needs to respond. But our amendment takes care of that. Our \namendment says, within a designated period of time, 20 days, the \nPresident notify Congress after passage of a spending or a tax bill of \nthe things he wants to see cut. That is all he has--20 days. Then 2 \ndays later a bill with the President's proposal has to be introduced \nand within 10 days after that, the Congress has to vote. That is it.\n  In 1 month's time it is all over; 20 days the President has to notify \nCongress. Two days later a bill is introduced. And 10 days later it is \nover. During that 10-day period during which Congress takes it up, we \nhave 10 hours to deal with this issue and be done with it.\n  Mr. President, it is very clear. Our legislation is as simple as \nsimple can be. It is constitutional. It is a process that would work \nexceedingly well. We know it will work here.\n  I believe our amendment has at least four advantages over the pending \nRepublican substitute. Clearly it is more workable; clearly it is more \nconstitutional; clearly it protects majority rule; and, finally, it \nleaves no question that tax breaks are on the table. It ensures that \ntax breaks will be subject to review just like any other form of \nspending.\n  There is no question about the simplicity argument. The \nAppropriations Committee has estimated that 13 appropriations bills \nenacted in fiscal year 1995, sent down now for 13 signatures, will \nrequire 10,000 separate minibills under the Dole amendment. So we are \ngoing to go from 13 bills to 10,000 bills in just the appropriations \nprocess alone. That is what we are talking about. Coming on the heels \nof the Paperwork Reduction Act, this legislation goes in exactly the \nopposite direction. That is, the Republican substitute belies all of \nour public outcry about paperwork and the concerns we have raised time \nand again about how we want to reduce paperwork, reduce the level of \nredtape, whether it is in passing bills or the effect the bills have on \npeople afterward.\n  A good example, of course, is the one I have raised before. This is a \n17-page appropriations bill, the Energy and Water Appropriations Act of \nlast year. It is a bill that has 17 pages. That is all it has, 17 pages \nof line by line appropriations. This is a simple little document that \nfor 200 years we have sent down to the President for signature and that \nis it. He signs it, he vetoes it, it is over.\n  Mr. President, this is 1,746 pages. This is what we are going to \nchange it to if the Dole substitute passes. We are going to go from \nthat 17-page bill to this. And the whole story is that when the \nPresident gets it, page by page, one after another, he has to get his \npen out. He will probably have to get hundreds of pens out. But he is \ngoing to have to sign every one of these.\n  Of course the distinguished President pro tempore, our dear friend, \nSenator Strom Thurmond, will have to sign \n[[Page S4419]]  this. The Speaker of the House will have to sign it as \nwell. It takes three signatures, and this is what we are going to be \nsigning: one page after another--1,746 pages. Do we really want that? \nIs that really paperwork reduction? Is that simplicity? Is that the \nkind of practical kind of legislating we all espouse? I do not think \nso. I really do not think we want to go to 1,746 separate signatures \nevery time we pass a simple appropriations bill.\n  We have a choice of passing a small bill or a large stack of paper. \nThat is our choice. And that is just one bill.\n  We have also, of course, indicated our concern about the \nconstitutionality of the Dole substitute. The last time this issue came \nup in committee, the Rules Committee in 1985 voted out a similar \nproposal unfavorably by a unanimous vote. The separate enrollment \nproposal was considered then, and voted out unfavorably, with the \nrecommendation that it should not pass, by a unanimous vote, under a \nRepublican Rules Committee chaired by a Republican. The \nconstitutionality was raised again and again. The view then was what we \nwere proposing here was not only impractical but unconstitutional.\n  As I said, we are going to address that issue of constitutionality \nwith the expedited judicial review and I am hopeful that at some point \nin the not too distant future the courts will determine for us the \nconstitutional viability of this approach. As others, especially the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, have indicated, it is going \nto take more than legislative clarification for us to resolve the \nconstitutionality questions. I am hopeful the concerns raised by the \njunior Senator from Michigan in his proposed amendment will address \nsome of these concerns as well.\n  But the fact is that, in spite of as much legislative clarification \nas we can make, we are still rolling the dice when it comes to \nconstitutionality. No one can say unequivocally that what we are now \nproposing will pass constitutional muster; that we have overcome all of \nthe constitutional hurdles that have been raised over and over again in \nspite of the changes we have made. As I predicted, this bill will not \nsurvive until it sunsets. We will not have to wait until the year 2000 \nto review this again because whether it is the courts or whether it is \nthe Congress, somebody is going to come back and say: We made a \nmistake. It may take that. But ultimately we are going to come back \nhere and address it and I am sure at some point that will happen. And \ncertainly the constitutionality question is one of the biggest reasons \nwhy I think it could happen, sooner or later.\n  Mr. President, the third issue has to do with majority rule. Our \nsubstitute protects majority rule. Our substitute ensures a central \ntenent of democracy will be here even after this legislation passes. \nOur amendment requires a majority of Congress to approve cuts that are \nproposed by the President, and that majority rule has been something we \nhave supported for 200 years. Under the Dole alternative, the President \nwins, if he gets the support of just one more than a third of either \nHouse of Congress. Either House of Congress can uphold a Presidential \ndecision. If that does not create policymaking potential, if that does \nnot shift the balance of power towards the White House, I do not know \nwhat does. In my 16 years in Congress, I have never seen a greater \nopportunity for the President to become a legislator than this will \nprovide him in the future.\n  So I am very hopeful that, as we consider the question of \nPresidential power, the balance between the legislative and the \nexecutive branches, that we recognize the magnitude of the opportunity \nthe President will have to set policy for the first time as a result of \nhis ability to line item any one of thousands of specific provisions \nthat may ultimately not only affect spending but affect policy as well.\n  The fourth issue, as I said, affects tax break language. I indicated \nthat the constitutionality question is unclear. The tax language is \neven more unclear. The tax language, in spite of the best efforts \nthrough colloquies and through changes in the legislation itself to \nmake the tax language clear, is still ambiguous. We still are not sure \nwhat ``similarly situated'' is. I hope that we are not creating a \nprovision that would allow us to pass special tax breaks for very small \ngroups of people because they are ``similarly situated.''\n  I know no one here would support a tax break that only went to \nMembers of Congress or to members of our staff. But under the language, \nthat is a possibility. Under the language, ``similarly situated'' could \nactually mean that we are allowing tax breaks that would affect a group \nas small as the Members of this body or our staffs to not be subject to \nPresidential review.\n  Through the colloquy and assurances given to us by others, that is \nbecoming less of a threat, I hope. I think we can now be somewhat \nconfident that indeed it is the view of our colleagues on the \nRepublican side that they want broad language here, that they \nanticipate having the ability or giving the opportunity to the \nPresident to review items that are broad in their scope. But it is a \nroll of the dice. We are not sure what they mean. The language is \nvague. The language in my view is convoluted. We can do better than \nthat. The way we do it better than that is to pass the Democratic \nsubstitute.\n  Our language is very clear and very direct. It puts special interest \ntax breaks on the table, period. It is over. We can be very clear, if \nthe Democratic substitute passes, that every special interest tax \nprovision is going to be subject to a line-item veto. Every \nappropriations bill will be subject to line-item veto. There is no \nquestion there. So we will not have to roll the dice when it comes to \nthe interpretation of tax language or constitutionality on any of \nthose.\n  So, Mr. President, I do not think there is any question, I do not \nthink there is any doubt, that the Democratic substitute is the \nsuperior alternative. I do not think Senator Domenici and Senator Dole \nwould have sponsored this legislation had they not had confidence that \nthis is a very workable, simple, practical, constitutional solution. \nThey would not have put their names on a bill if they did not feel that \ngood about it. It is workable. It is constitutional. It projects \nmajority rule. It clearly puts tax breaks on the table. It has solved \nthe problem that we have raised now for days on this side of the aisle. \nIt clarifies our situation while protecting our rights.\n  So it is that simple. We have an opportunity to vote on something \nthat has history, to vote on something that has been carefully \nconsidered by two of our committees, the Governmental Affairs Committee \nand the Budget Committee. It has a history on both sides of the aisle, \nwith our most esteemed leadership on both sides of the aisle. So \nwithout any doubt, with real expertise, our leaders on this issue have \ncome forth and produced a document that I feel enthusiastic about, that \nI know will work, that I know will found to be constitutional.\n  So I hope that as we consider our vote, and our colleagues will come \nback to their original positions on this issue, come back to their \noriginal interpretation that indeed this does work well, and support \nthe Democratic substitute.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, may I ask the clerk how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has 36\\1/2\\ minutes, \nand the Senator from Nebraska has 19\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the Senator from \nIndiana yielding.\n  To review the bidding here on this substitute, naturally I support \nthe Dole-McCain-Coats line-item veto because I think it represents a \nbetter approach, the approach that the American people understand.\n  In the first place, in civics class in the eighth grade, we all \nlearned that a veto requires a two-thirds override. That is what veto \nis all about. That is what this provision has, unlike the version \noffered by the distinguished minority leader, which would only require \na 50-percent override. That is not what we think of when we think of a \nveto. So that is the first important distinction.\n  Second, with respect to tax breaks, it has never been the concept, in \nlining \n[[Page S4420]]  out pork-barrel spending through the line-item veto, \nthat we would add tax breaks to the line-item veto legislation. But in \norder to accommodate some of our friends on the other side, we did say \nthat if there is an omnibus tax bill, and somebody decides to slip in a \ntax break for their friend back home, the President could strike that \nout just as he would an item of spending, of pork-barrel spending, \nbecause a tax break for a very limited group or individual would be \nsimilar to pork-barrel spending.\n  So that is included in the Republican version of the line-item veto.\n  But what we do not think is appropriate is to put more than necessary \nroadblocks in the way of reducing taxes for all Americans, as the \nDemocratic approach would do. If we are going to give Americans a $500 \nchild tax credit, or if we are going to provide a capital gains tax \nrelief, or reduce the marginal rates, we think that is a matter that we \nought to be promoting and not putting roadblocks in the way. The truth \nis that in most of these major tax changes, it is a regular bill that \ncomes out of the House and Senate. It is subject to Presidential veto, \nanyway. So the President can veto it. It would require a two-thirds \noverride by the Members of the House and Senate.\n  So really, this argument, I think is a straw man. On most tax \nlegislation, there will be the two-thirds override, anyway. On that \nwhich does not require that, we should not be throwing up more \nroadblocks in the way of tax breaks for the American people except for \nthose that represent special interests which are taken care of.\n  In some respects, it seems to me that the Democrats are not willing \nto take yes for an answer. They wanted the issue of the tax breaks \nincluded. We did it. They wanted the so-called ``lock box'' so that any \nsavings will be applied to deficit reduction. We did that. They want to \nensure that the President could not veto rescissions. We are going to \nbe doing that.\n  In other words, most of the primary concerns that were raised about \nthe Republican version of the line-item veto have been agreed to. We \nare taking care of those. Let us take yes for an answer. We are willing \nto make this a bipartisan and better bill.\n  Of the issues remaining, some are I think matters of legitimate \ndispute. The issue of reprogramming that the Senator from Georgia \nmentioned I think represents a potential problem. It may be somewhat \ncumbersome. We will have to see whether Members of the House and the \nSenate are willing to deal with each other in a matter of comity and in \na matter of expedition in getting these rescissions through. But there \nis nothing wrong with having all Members of this body consider them as \nopposed to just a few on the committee. So I think that is something we \nwill have to see how it works. But it should not be a big problem.\n  There is the possibility that committees will not provide the \nspecificity that is called for in the legislation. What this argument \nassumes is that Members of the House and Senate, in effect, will cheat; \nthat we will decide to get around the line-item veto by not putting in \nthe specific line items, thus for the President to veto if he does not \nlike them.\n  It is possible that we could try to conjure up ways of getting around \nthis. That is what happened with the balanced budget proposals. That is \nwhat happened with Gramm-Rudman, and with other kinds of legislation.\n  I suspect, however, that good faith will prevail and that the \nmajority, which in fact favors the line-item veto and favors it \nworking, will ensure that as this legislation does work over the next 5 \nyears, it will be handled in such a way and will operate in such a way \nthat the President will be given the ability to line out specific items \nas is the intention under the legislation.\n  Of course, with respect to the argument that there is a difference \nbetween the majority position here of a two-thirds override and the \nminority view that there should only be a 50 percent override, that \nthere is a great deal of power being given to the President, that is a \nlegitimate argument. Reasonable people can differ about this. That is \nwhy the sunset provision is in the legislation. This legislation does \nnot automatically continue forever. After 5 years, it is over, and it \nwill not be reinstituted unless we decide it was a good idea and we \npass it again.\n  That is where this issue can be evaluated. And if Presidents have \nabused their authority, I am sure you will not see the Senate passing \nthis kind of legislation again. But if Presidents have done what they \nshould, if they have acted responsibly, then I suspect we will be \nreinstituting this legislation. That is what sunset is all about. We \nwill have an opportunity to look at it.\n  So the bottom line, Mr. President, is really whether we want to \ncontinue to conduct business as usual or not. The American people \nobviously do not want us to do that. They want us to change the way \nCongress conducts its business and the business that it conducts. The \nline-item veto is a significant improvement in the way the Congress \nconducts its business.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Nebraska to yield \nme 5 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator from Indiana if he \ncould answer some questions that I have.\n  Mr. COATS. The Senator from Indiana will be happy to try, depending \non the complexity of the questions.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, the thrust of my questions goes to the issue of \nwhether or not, with the Dole substitute, the President would be able \nto veto any existing entitlement spending.\n  Mr. COATS. The answer to that is no.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The answer to that is no?\n  Mr. COATS. No. It only applies to new spending.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, I am interested in that response because I really \nquestion whether it is right. I have here the Senate committee report \non last year's VA/HUD appropriations bill. Included in this bill was \nbudget authority and outlays for veterans' pensions and compensation. \nThis indicates that the Senate bill contains $17.6 billion for \nveterans' compensation and pensions. This is mandatory spending which \nnonetheless gets included in the VA/HUD spending totals every year. My \nspecific question would be, would the spending authority for veterans' \npensions and compensation be enrolled separately and subject to \nPresidential veto under the Dole substitute separate enrollment bill?\n  Mr. COATS. The answer to that--if the Senator will yield, Mr. \nPresident, the answer to that is no, unless it is new spending or a \nchange in the benefit, it would not be subject to the line-item veto.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, the difficulty I have with that answer is, I say to \nmy colleague, these are appropriated entitlements. These are \nentitlements that are in appropriations bills, and the Dole substitute \nprovides for the separate enrollment of all appropriated measures, does \nit not?\n  Mr. COATS. It does provide for the separate enrollment of all \nappropriated measures. But the application of the bill, application of \nthe veto, the power given to the President only goes to the new \nspending or expansion of benefits available under the entitlement \nprogram.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So the answer as I hear it is that, even though these \nappropriated entitlement accounts are in appropriations bills, \nspecifically included in appropriations, all existing entitlement \nspending would not be subject to Presidential veto?\n  Mr. COATS. The mandatory spending must go out under the law as it is \ncurrently written--mandatory spending. Only new spending is subject to \nthe line-item veto.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, let me go further if I can. For example, then, in \nlast year's agriculture appropriations bill there was $29 billion \nprovided for the Food Stamp Program. Would this amount be enrolled \nseparately and could the President veto it?\n  Mr. COATS. I am sorry; would the Senator restate that question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. There was in last year's agriculture appropriations bill \n$29 billion provided for the Food Stamp Program, an entitlement \nprogram, but it was an appropriated entitlement. \n[[Page S4421]]  Would this amount be enrolled separately and could the \nPresident veto it?\n  Mr. COATS. The amount appropriated must go out under the existing \nlaw. The only way in which the President could veto a provision is if \nthe underlying law were changed to increase the amount of spending as \nthe result of an expanded or new benefit. So additional spending to \nmeet the mandatory requirement under the law would not qualify for a \nline-item veto. But if there were additional spending as the result of \na change in the underlying law which increased spending as a result of \nthat change, that increase is subject to the line-item veto.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So the Senator is asserting that only the increase in \nthese appropriated entitlements could be subject to Presidential veto?\n  Mr. COATS. I am sorry; again I was speaking to staff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask the Senator from Nebraska if I might have 2 \nadditional minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. I grant 2 additional minutes, and then I would also like to \nfollow up on and try to give my perspective of the very legitimate \nquestions that are being asked.\n  Two more minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would then ask the Senator from Indiana, is the Senator \nfrom Indiana asserting that only the increase in appropriated \nentitlements would be subject to Presidential veto?\n  Mr. COATS. The entitlement could be separately enrolled and subject \nto a line-item veto, but the funds that were obligated to be spent \nunder the law would have to be spent.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, that sounds to me like a contradictory answer. How \ncould it be that the funds could be spent if the President can veto the \nitem?\n  Mr. COATS. Because it is direct spending which comes directly from \nthe Treasury, it is a protected expenditure under the law.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, I have great reservations about that answer. I \nwould ask the Senator from Indiana, are appropriated entitlements \nincluded in the definition of ``item'' under the terms of the Dole \nsubstitute?\n  Mr. COATS. Any allocation of money is an item, so the answer to that \nis yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So then that suggests to me they would be available for \nPresidential veto under the terms of the Dole amendment.\n  Mr. COATS. The Senator from Indiana would answer as he has answered \nbefore, that is, that the mandatory spending, the amount of dollars \nexpended to fulfill the requirements of the law under an entitlement--\nexisting requirement of the law under an entitlement--would be spent by \nthe Treasury in accordance with the law. The separate enrollment \nlanguage relative to entitlements applies, in terms of spending, in \nterms of dollars that are subject to line-item veto, applies only to \nnew spending under a change in the law which would change the benefit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COATS. And if that change in the benefit would require increased \nspending.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have run out of time. I have other questions I would \nlike to pursue. But I just say to my colleague and friend, I think we \nhave a real legal problem with the definitions.\n  Mr. EXON. How much time do we have remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes and fifty seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. Let me see if I can begin to clear up some of the very \nlegitimate questions that have been asked by the Senator from North \nDakota and others. I believe, with all good intentions, there has been \nsome confusion here. And that is the problem that occurs when we have \nsomething that comes up on Monday and, boom, a cloture motion is filed \nagainst it, then the we find the bill's language locked in concrete, \nchiseled in stone.\n  Certainly, we have made some improvements on some problems in the \nDole substitute. And some of the amendments that have been addressed \nhere are likely to be accepted and to improve things.\n  I want to go to the heart of the matter that has been brought up by \nthe Senator from North Dakota. I think the problem is that there has \nbeen a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding on the bill itself.\n  I refer to the Dole substitute bill, page 5, lines 1 through 6. ``The \nterm `Item' means--(A) with respect to an appropriations measure''. And \ndown below on line (B), ``with respect to an authorization measure.''\n  Now, many of the questions that the Senator from North Dakota phrased \nand were answered by our colleague from Indiana mixed back and forth \nthe difference between appropriations and authorizations.\n  I simply believe that--and I am not for a moment indicating that the \nSenator from Indiana is trying to mislead anyone at all--I just think \nthere is a very legitimate difference of opinion. I suspect, when this \nis looked at in retrospect, most of the legal scholars will agree with \nthe thrust being made by the Senator from North Dakota, which I think \nhas not been fully appreciated.\n  If I can, let me dwell on that a little further.\n  The Dole substitute would require all appropriations items to be \nenrolled separately. Now, remember, that is enrolled separately. Among \nthe items that it would require to be separately enrolled are \nappropriations for programs that many consider entitlements. Congress \nfunds these entitlements through appropriations acts.\n  With respect to these appropriated entitlements, the President will \nbe able to veto not only new entitlements, but also the funding for our \nexisting entitlement commitments. And I think we should make that \nabundantly clear and have an understanding of that. If we want to do \nthat, fine.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. EXON. Certainly.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would not included in these categories be such things as \nguaranteed student loans, higher education facilities loans?\n  Mr. EXON. Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. And I have seen your \nlist. It is right down the line.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Medicaid, health care trust funds, Federal payments to \nrailroad retirement accounts.\n  The President of the United States would be able to veto every one of \nthese programs, every agriculture program, including rural electric and \ntelephone loans, conservation, temporary emergency food assistance \nprograms, Federal crop insurance corporation, all payments to veterans.\n  Would not all these be included?\n  Mr. EXON. Absolutely.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And yet we cannot veto the capital gains tax cut? The \nPresident cannot veto the capital gains tax cut?\n  Mr. EXON. He cannot do it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I just say, in conclusion, it seems to me it does not \nmake much sense.\n  Mr. EXON. I say to my friend from North Dakota, again, I am not sure \nthat that is the intent of the Dole substitute, but that is what the \nDole substitute does.\n  Mr. COATS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. EXON. I am glad to yield on your time.\n  Mr. COATS. First of all, it would not make sense for the President to \ndo that. Theoretically, he could under the bill. But it would not have \nthe effect of changing expenditures under those entitlements because \nthose entitlements are contractual obligations entered into by the \nUnited States and they must be paid.\n  First of all, I do not know why a President would want to do that, \nbut particularly he would not want to do that because he knows it would \nhave no legal effect. Those are entitlements that have to be paid under \na contractual obligation. And while they would be separately enrolled \nand theoretically subject to a Presidential veto, such veto could not \nhave legal effect because it is a contractual obligation which the \nTreasury must pay.\n  It would only apply, as it is stated, to new expenditures under \nentitlements or where the benefits package has been changed to expand \nthe entitlement.\n  Those who suggested this argued, I believe rightfully so--and in fact \nmany Members on the Democratic side, or those opposing this effort--\nthat one of the original problems was that it was too narrowly drafted; \nit only applies to appropriated expenditures; it did not apply to \ntargeted tax benefits and it \n[[Page S4422]]  did not apply to entitlements, particularly the new \nentitlements.\n  So the habit that Congress has been in, even though an entitlement \nprogram is running amok with spending, we cannot begin to pay for it \nwithout incurring substantial additional debt. We keep expanding the \nreach of the entitlement programs and the benefits promised under the \nentitlement programs. We think those should be subject to a \nPresidential review and, if necessary, veto of that item, and Congress \nhaving a greater hurdle to cross in terms of passing that with a two-\nthirds veto.\n  Additionally, I trust that President Clinton and all the other \ncandidates seeking that position would never seek to veto these items.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Indiana. We are \ntalking about fine legal points here that, unfortunately, may have to \nbe decided by the courts at some time.\n  But let me give you some examples about annual appropriations bills \nand the enrollment process that has to do with that.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota has said, the President, under this \nbill, could veto the Commodity Credit Corporation fund, the Food Stamp \nProgram, the Child Nutrition Program, the Guaranteed Student Loan \nProgram, Federal unemployment benefits, Medicaid, Federal payments to \nrailroad retirement, and a number of other programs under which \nindividuals have legal rights to obtain benefits.\n  With regard to these programs, the separate enrollment procedure--now \nwe are going back to that dog in the manger again--the separate \nenrollment procedure would allow the President to veto the funding for \nour existing commitments.\n  So the President could veto the funding, let us say, for Medicaid. I \ndo not think he probably would, either, but it is a case in point, and \nonly one. But what would the beneficiaries then do? Well, they, of \ncourse, would go to court and get an order getting the Government to \npay their benefits. This money would then flow from the claims and \njudgments act. As a result, we would save no money whatsoever and \nindeed, probably spend much more on legal expenses.\n  All that I think it points out is how poorly drawn this proposition \nis. It should be given much more consideration. Rather than rushing the \nDole substitute through as a solution to all of our problems we should \ngo to a simplified, direct procedure such as the Daschle amendment, \nwhich is S. 14. Both S. 4, and the enhanced rescission bill that the \nHouse of Representatives has already passed, are better drawn and \npreferable to the Dole substitute we are debating here.\n  How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 6\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager of the \nbill, Mr. Exon.\n  I take the floor at this time merely to express my support for the \nsubstitute that has been offered by Mr. Daschle. The Daschle measure \nprovides that any rescissions that the President may recommend to the \nCongress will receive a vote by the Congress. The President's \nrescissions may be stricken but, in being stricken, the rescissions \nwill be given a vote.\n  Under the current law, when the President sends up rescissions, the \nCongress may, by not acting, force the President to proceed with the \nobligations of funds, or the Congress may act. The Congress may accept \nsome of the President's recommendations, the Congress may substitute \nits own rescissions, or it may do nothing, in which case, as I say, the \nPresident's recommendations will amount to nothing. And over the years, \nCongress has rescinded, as the record will show, more in terms of \ndollars than the total rescissions that have been submitted by the \nseveral Presidents in that period of time.\n  So the Congress has actually rescinded more moneys than have been \nrequested to be rescinded by the Presidents. But under the Daschle \nsubstitute, a President may be assured that he will get a vote, and \nthere is a very well-honed, expedited procedure set forth in the \nsubstitute. If at the end of the day, the conference committee is \nunable to meet an agreement--that is the final step--then any Member of \neither body may call up the President's original rescissions and offer \nthem, and the President will be given a vote up or down.\n  It seems to me that is fair. The Daschle substitute does not result \nin any shift of power from the legislative branch to the executive. It \nis clear cut. It gives the President the opportunity to get a vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute out of the 2 hours that have \nbeen yielded to me by special order.\n  The President is assured a vote, and it seems to me that is fair. \nThat is fair to the President. It gives the President an opportunity, \nin the face of changing circumstances, to suggest certain rescissions, \nwhich perhaps the Congress will agree to.\n  So I am 100 percent behind the substitute by Mr. Daschle, and I ask \nunanimous consent that my name may be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, while I have the floor, where in the pecking \norder is my amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised it will come up after \nwe adopt the Daschle amendment.\n  Please restate the question.\n  Mr. BYRD. Where in the regular order is the amendment which I have \nhad made in order for calling up today?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised that will be the next \namendment following the disposition of the Daschle amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat that amendment that I am qualified under the agreement to offer \nmay be called up at such time as I wish to call it up. I do not wish it \nto appear in the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. COATS. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I wonder if \nI can inquire of the Senator, I want to just make sure I understand \nwhat the Senator from West Virginia has requested.\n  I thought I heard the Chair to say that under the regular procedure, \nthe next order of business following disposition of the Daschle \namendment would be the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COATS. And is the request of the Senator from West Virginia that \nthat amendment be subject to being called up in a different order at \nthe Senator's request?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes; I am not prepared to call it up next, and I merely ask \nthat I be allowed to call it up when I am ready to call it up.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would have no objection to that within \nthe constraints of the overall agreement.\n  Mr. BYRD. It certainly would be within the constraints of the overall \nagreement.\n  Mr. COATS. Can I inquire of the Senator from West Virginia, will he \nbe prepared to call up that amendment today?\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, I may or may not be, but I can assure the Senator \nthat within the constraints of the overall agreement, that amendment \nwill have to be called up before the substitute by Mr. Dole is voted \non.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I certainly understand that. I guess my \nconcern is that the majority leader has indicated that it is his \nintent, and I think it was the agreed-upon intent of the managers of \nthe bill as well as the minority leader, that we conclude all action on \nthe line-item veto and bring it to final passage today.\n  Mr. BYRD. I do not think that was the agreement. It was my \nunderstanding it would be concluded this week. I do not think there was \nany assurance that action would be finalized on the line-item veto \ntoday.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the statement of the Senator from West \nVirginia is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will just try to----\n  Mr. COATS. The original decision did carry through until Friday. \nGiven the progress that we have made and the short list of amendments \nthat was left, \n[[Page S4423]]  I guess it was the thinking that it could be concluded \ntoday, and, obviously, many Members hope that will be the case, but it \nis not determined and there is no particular agreement says that it has \nto be.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is right. I have no intention of trying to lay the \nmatter over until next week. If I had that intention, I would not have \nagreed to the agreement. I have no intention of that.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this Senator has no doubt that had the \nSenator from West Virginia wanted to carry this over into next week or \neven beyond, he certainly has the ability to do that. I take him at his \nword and withdraw my reservation.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Did the Chair put the question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous-consent request has been agreed \nto.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair, and I thank all Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I inquire as to the time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has 27\\1/2\\ minutes \nleft; the Senator from Nebraska has 3\\1/2\\ minutes left.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, earlier the minority leader, Senator \nDaschle, whose amendment is currently pending, once again made the \npoint that the complexity of the separate enrollment process is a \nreason to vote against the Dole amendment, because it would take a \nfairly simple, several-page piece of legislation that would be sent to \nthe President and translate it into a stack of individually enrolled \nitems, any one of which or several of which the President could veto.\n  The strength, I will suggest, of the separately enrolled procedure is \nthe very fact that each particular item is separately enrolled into a \nseparate bill. And the purpose of that is so that the Congress, the \nPresident, and the American public knows just exactly what is contained \nin this thin little booklet as to how their money is going to be spent.\n  It is not a matter of convenience for Congress. It will be somewhat \nless convenient to go to separate enrollment, although we have \ndemonstrated that the enrolling clerk now possesses the technology \nthrough computerization to process separate enrollment in a very \nexpeditious way. So it is not the nightmare that it might once have \nbeen. It is not the nightmare monstrosity that has been described.\n  I wonder what the American people would say if they were polled on \nthe question of whether, to determine how their tax dollars are spent, \nthey wanted a booklet of about 8 or 10 or 12 pages which talked in very \nbroad categories,\n or whether they would like the ability to see how each particular item \nis spent, and they could pull that out and say, ``Aha.'' See, the \nquestion is not whether or not the rescission process suggested by the \nminority leader is more convenient; the question is not even whether or \nnot it spends less or more money; the question is, How is that money \nspent? The question that the American taxpayer is raising is: How is my \nmoney being spent? They care a lot more about the details of the \nspecific expenditure than they do the overall total, although I do not \nmean to suggest the overall total is not important.\n\n  So, if a rescission is brought to the floor and the claim is made \nthat this rescission saves as much money as what the President \nrequested, it does not answer the question of how is that money spent. \nAnd is it spent for a legitimate purpose? And so we annually run into \nthe question of the expenditures for the Lawrence Welk Home--the \nstudies that most Americans feel are inappropriate uses of their tax \ndollars, the special little projects and spending that goes to benefit \nmaybe a particular Member of Congress and enhance his or her reelection \nbut really does nothing for the individuals that the majority in \nCongress represent.\n  We annually have to deal with how the money is spent. So it is not \njust a question of how much; it is how much is being spent and is that \nin the taxpayers' interest? And is there accountability to the Member \nwho has proposed such an expenditure?\n  Mr. President, last November, anger against this institution burned \nwhite hot. With their votes, the American people decisively \ndemonstrated their deep frustration with the status quo. Just weeks \nago, I suggest that the Senate fueled that anger and betrayed their \ntrust by failing to pass a balanced budget amendment, demonstrating \nthat we are an institution more concerned with preserving our power \nthan with protecting our Nation's posterity.\n  That is really the issue that is before us today. Are we going to \npreserve the status quo? Are we going to preserve the power of \nspending, so that we can continue to spend the way that we have spent \nthe taxpayers' dollars in the past? Or are we going to change the \nprocedure so that we can be held more accountable to the American \ntaxpayer for how we spend their dollars? That is the question that is \nbefore us under the minority leader substitute. Will this institution \ndecide to protect our powers and preserve the status quo? Or are we \nwilling to take bold steps to end business as usual?\n  The Wall Street Journal editorialized, in 1993, expedited rescission, \nwhich is the minority leader's alternative proposal before us that we \nwill vote on shortly, an alternative to the tough measure that the \nPresident has requested, that Senator McCain and I have brought \nforward. ``Expedited rescission,'' the Wall Street Journal said, ``is \nto the line-item veto what chicory-flavored water is to Colombian \ncoffee. It may look the same, but one taste tells the difference. A \ntrue line-item veto,'' the editorial said, ``would mean that the \nPresident will receive a spending bill from the Congress and would have \nthe right to strike out items he considered unnecessary spending. \nCongress could restore the spending but only by a two-thirds vote of \nboth the House and the Senate. The push to replace the line-item veto \nwith a sham substitute is typical of how Congress is dealing with \nreform in this session. It is faking it.''\n  The substitute that is offered by the minority leader simply does \nnothing to change the way in which we spend people's money. It does not \nalter the balance in favor of savings. The same simple majority that \nvoted to spend the money in the first place is all that is required to \ncontinue the spending. Procedure in the minority leader's bill says \nthat Members on this floor can take the President's rescission which, \nyes, does now have to be brought to a vote under expedited rescission, \nbut with just a simple majority can strike any rescission that the \nPresident sends up. So the same majority that passed the bill in the \nfirst place can take the President's rescission and strike it.\n  Although the title of the minority leader's bill is the Legislative \nLine-Item Veto Act, this is false advertising. There is no veto \ncontemplated anywhere in the bill, none whatsoever. The President is \ngiven the chance to veto spending, and Congress is not forced to muster \nthe two-thirds to override the veto.\n  In 1992, former President Reagan said, ``There is talk that the \ncongressional leadership may offer the new President expedited \nrescission authority. This will not do the job,'' he said. ``Although \nit would permit the President to strike budget-busting expenditures, \nthey could easily be reinstated by a simple majority vote of the \nCongress. A true line-item veto,'' President Reagan said, ``must \nrequire a two-thirds vote to override. Not only does the substitute \nfail to give the President veto power over spending accounts, it does \nlittle to address the failures of the Impoundment and Control Act.''\n  Since 1974, Congress' record on acting on Presidential impoundments \nhas been embarrassing. The minority leader said as much. By simple \ninaction, we have ignored tens of billions of dollars in Presidential \nrequests for rescission or impoundment authority. It has been the will \nof Congress not to act. It has been the will of Congress to fail to \nact. And Members of the minority leader's party have as much as said \nso. They have come down here and said, ``We have to stop the current \npractice.'' The problem is, their bill will not stop the current \npractice. All the substitute does is expedite a vote. It does nothing \nto change the presumption in favor of savings. It takes no step toward \nrestoring the impoundment powers which the President exercised prior to \n1974. And \n[[Page S4424]]  since 1974, we have seen rescission after rescission \nafter rescission of the President rejected by this Congress.\n  The separate enrollment legislation before us, on the other hand, \nwould restore authority to the President. It would allow him to veto \nspending and require two-thirds of both Houses to override it. The \nsubstitute offered by the minority retains the current procedures, with \nthe one exception that Congress could no longer bury the impoundments, \nbut they must vote.\n  Quite frankly, Mr. President, their idea is too little too late. \nNothing but the threat of a true line-item veto has even prodded their \nopposing our efforts into a vote on expedited rescission. Where were \nthey when Senator McCain and I were on the floor year after year after \nyear offering enhanced rescission, offering some way to deal with the \nproblem that they all admit exists? A handful of Democrats--you can \ncount them on one hand--were supporting our efforts. Now it is only the \nlegitimate, real threat of a true line-item veto that brings them to \nthe floor saying, ``We are for line-item veto, we are just not for your \nline-item veto. Let us do it our way.'' Well, their way basically \ncontinues the practice that brought us to this place in the first \nplace.\n  They have never brought up, since my time in Congress and in the \nSenate--or Senator McCain's time in Congress and the Senate--a \nfreestanding bill. The majority leader, Senator Mitchell, never brought \nup a freestanding bill to deal with this problem. Expedited rescission \ndoes nothing to restore power to the Executive which Congress grabbed \nin 1974. Congress, which chose to spend the money in the first place, \nretains complete control under expedited rescission.\n  The only argument for expedited rescission is that it might shame the \nCongress with a public vote. But the time for shame is over. With a \n$4.8 trillion debt, with our children facing a lifetime tax rate that \nis unconscionable, shame is simply not enough. We are already shamed. \nWe need more than a sense of shame; we need to give the Executive power \nto challenge our spending habits. We need a true line-item veto. I urge \nmy colleagues to reject the amendment offered by the minority leader \nand vote for a true line-item veto.\n  Mr. President, may I inquire how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has 13\\1/2\\ minutes \nand the Senator from Nebraska has 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to thank the junior Senator \nfrom Arizona for a very detailed exposition of our position on this \npending amendment.\n  Have no doubt, this is probably the crucial amendment of this debate \nbecause we are back, frankly, where we were at the beginning of this \nyear, when a line-item veto was going to become a reality, very \nfrankly, because of the results of the November 8 election.\n  As the Senator from Indiana pointed out, he and I, for the last 8 \nyears, have attempted time after time to bring the line-item veto up \nfor debate and amendment. If there was a better idea on that side as to \nhow to do what the distinguished Democratic leader has said, and that \nis, that we all want a line-item veto, it is rather amazing to me that \nwe were never able to get a line-item veto to the floor of this Senate \nfor consideration. Each time, it was blocked on a parliamentary tactic \ncalled a budget point of order, which prohibited Members from bringing \nup the amendment.\n  With all due respect to my friend from South Dakota, I wish that he \nhad taken this attitude some years ago. I believe that we would have \nsaved the American people billions and tens of billions of dollars in \nwaste and pork-barrel spending.\n  We really are, Mr. President, getting down to the crucial aspect of \nthis entire issue, as the Senator from Indiana said, whether a \nlegislative line-item veto will mean the definition that is written in \nthe Constitution of what a veto is, a two-thirds vote by both Houses to \noverride the President's veto, or whether it will simply be a majority \nvote in either House.\n  Mr. President, the argument that the majority vote in either House \nwill do the job flies in the face of the experience that I have had for \nmany years now, as I have come down here and tried to eliminate \nclearly, clearly, wasteful and unnecessary spending that is devoted to \nthe interests of a few, rather than the interests of the American \npeople.\n  I will provide for the Record at some point the many times I have \ncome here and lost amendments to try to remove these incredibly \nunacceptable appropriations, many times in the most egregious manner, \nstuffed in in conference between the two bodies, never being brought up \nin either House.\n  Last year, in the VA/HUD conference report, there was a couple \nhundred million dollars stuffed in at the very end, none of which we \nhad ever had any opportunity to scrutinize or look at.\n  Mr. President, that practice will stop. That practice will stop. Just \nby bringing it to the attention of the Senate and by seeking a majority \nvote to overturn it, it is clear that my efforts and others, the \nSenator from Indiana and others, have been unsuccessful. It took a \nmajority vote of both in order to put it in; it seems to me that a \nmajority vote of one House would clearly keep it in.\n  We really are talking about what a line-item veto really is, whether \nwe are going to make it--as the President of the United States has \nstated--a strong line-item veto which he supports. I am a little \ndisappointed that my friends on the other side of the aisle do not \nsupport the President of the United States on their own party's \nposition.\n  I would also like to say, Mr. President, that the debate we have been \ninvolved in on this issue--especially the thoughtful comments by the \nSenator from South Dakota and the very thoughtful and indepth \nquestioning on the part of the Senator from West Virginia--I believe, \nhas made a record here that will help the people in the future if we \npass this legislation--I believe we will--as to the exact meaning of \nthis legislation, what it entails, and what is circumscribed by it.\n  I think it has been a very healthy debate. I look forward to \nobviously concluding action on this bill in a reasonable time, but at \nthe same time I think that perhaps the entire body and maybe the Nation \nhave been illuminated and informed by this very significant debate.\n  I want to say, again, I respect the views of the Senator from West \nVirginia. I know that they are deeply held beliefs. I respect the views \nof the Senator from South Dakota. I know they are deeply held. We have \na fundamental difference of opinion here as to whether the executive \nbranch should have power restored to it. This, in my view, was taken \naway in 1974.\n  This is really, fundamentally, what this is all about. I believe that \nthe November 8 election clearly showed that the American people are \nsick and tired of business as usual in the Congress. If we pass this \nlegislation, especially after having failed to pass the balanced budget \namendment, I think that we will at least restore some confidence in the \nAmerican people, recognizing that it is no panacea. The only real \npanacea, as even the Senator from Georgia said, is we have to \ndiscipline ourselves. I do not see how in the past we have been able to \ndiscipline ourselves without the necessary tools to do so.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to talk about the fact that there \nare ways to get around this. Mr. President, there are ways to get \naround every law we pass. There is no better example of that than the \nWar Powers Act. This body passed the War Powers Act and then repassed \nit over the veto of the President. We routinely ignore it.\n  I have no doubt, if the Congress of the United States wants to ignore \nthe line-item veto, they can somehow find ways to get around it. What \nkind of message is that we would send to the American people?\n  The intention of the legislation is clear. The provisions of the \nlegislation are clear. No, I cannot guarantee the American people that \nwe will comply. But I suggest that if we do not comply with laws that \nwe pass, as we have not with the War Powers Act, we do it at \n[[Page S4425]]  great risk not only to the institution, but to the \nentire system and fundamentals of democracy, which is the expectation \nof the people that sent their representatives to Washington that we \nwould comply with the laws that we pass.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank my friend from Indiana. I want to \nthank the other participants in this debate, and I look forward to \ncontinuing it after we finish this vote. I do not think there should be \nany doubt in the minds of my colleagues that this is really the crucial \nvote of this debate.\n  Mr. President, I might suggest to the Senator from Nebraska we might \nmove to a vote. I think we planned around noontime, anyway.\n  Mr. EXON. May I inquire how much time is left on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority side has 3\\1/2\\ minutes; the \nmajority side has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. I will use at least 3 minutes, and then maybe we can move \non.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, Let me sum up, if I might, in the remaining \ntime. I will simply say, Mr. President, that although I did not support \nS. 4 in its original form--which was very much akin to what came over \nfrom the House of Representatives--I would be far more satisfied with \nS. 4 in its original form than with what has been put together in a \nhasty fashion, as demonstrated by the lengthy debate and many \namendments that have been accepted with regard to the Dole substitute.\n  I will simply say that I suspect that there are few times in the \nhistory of the Congress of the United States when the Congress of the \nUnited States is about to give, in rather shabby fashion, give away the \nprerogative to the President of the United States.\n  Maybe if this passes, if the Dole amendment finally passes, we could \nclean it up in some legitimate way in the conference between the House \nand Senate.\n  I simply say I cannot understand how any true conservative could want \nto give away, to the extent that the Dole substitute as originally \nproposed would give away the authority of the powers of the purse, to \nthe President of the United States, whoever that President is.\n  Let me sum up some of the advantages of the substitute offered by \nSenator Daschle, which is the original Domenici-Exon bill. Our \nsubstitute allows the President to veto part of an appropriation, \ngiving the President added flexibility. Theirs does not. Our substitute \nallows the President to veto pork that is caused by colloquies on the \nfloor and other mechanisms, including measures put in the conference \nreport but not forwarded into the language in the statutes. Theirs does \nnot. Our substitute has a clear, broad definition of tax loopholes that \nplainly covers all tax loopholes. The Dole substitute would allow the \nPresident to veto the existing obligation of appropriated entitlements, \nleading to legal challenges. The Dole substitute raises constitutional \nconcerns that do not exist with regard to our substitute. And our \nsubstitute provides an orderly procedure. No 10,000 bills, no new \nburdens on the President or the Congress or the Members of the Congress \nwho have to sign those bills, in contrast to the Dole substitute which \nwould make a hash of the legislative process.\n  In closing--and I ask for an additional 1 minute if necessary----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. In closing, let me say that there are so many things that \nhave not been considered. In a short period of time, we have come up \nwith so many shortcomings. One of the most important, I think, was \ndemonstrated by Senator Nunn when he talked about the action of the \nSenate not long ago with regard to the issue in Somalia. Here was a \nsituation where we felt that Somalia should be put behind us. We put in \nan appropriation and we said that appropriation could be used, but the \ntroops had to be removed by a specific date--let us say April 1, I do \nnot remember what the date was. Under the Dole substitute, the \nPresident could have simply kept the money, vetoed out the April 1 \ndate, and all of the outreach and control that legitimately is found in \nthe legislative body would go out the window. I do not think that is \nwhat they intended, but that is what happens when you put together \nlegislation in the fashion that this was put together.\n  I hope we approve the Daschle substitute.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would just point out to my colleague \nfrom Nebraska, the pending Levin-Murkowski amendment will make \nadjustments to take care of the problems which have been highlighted \ntime after time here. That is why we have bills for consideration. That \nis why we go through an amending process, to improve legislation. If we \ndid not do that, then clearly a bill would be deemed perfect and we \nwould not even have to pass it through the floor of the Senate.\n  The fact is, though, this legislation was not hastily put together. \nIt has been considered in its various aspects for many, many years \ndating back to 1867, I believe it was, when a Member of Congress from \nWest Virginia proposed a similar separate enrolling legislation.\n  We would be glad to consider other amendments which would further \nimprove this legislation, but we are going to get down to, in this \nvote, whether it is a two-thirds majority to override a veto of the \nPresident by both Houses or not. That is really the fundamental \nquestion that is being asked when we consider the Daschle amendment.\n  I might remind my colleagues, that amendment was overwhelmingly \nrejected by the other body in the form of the Stenholm amendment.\n  Mr. President, I find no further need for time, I say to my friend \nfrom Nebraska.\n  I yield to the distinguished majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank both my colleague from Arizona and \nmy colleague from Indiana. I have been watching at home on C-SPAN, \nwhile they have been here in the evening, the remarkable work they have \nbeen doing. I appreciate it very much. No one on this side has worked \nharder and longer than the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from \nIndiana on what I think now is within reach. That is the good news.\n  The good news is, while we may disagree on how to achieve it, I think \nit appears we are about ready to give the authority that should be \nprovided. I guess the disagreement is really what constitutes a line-\nitem veto. Our proposal would require certain items in appropriation, \nauthorization, or tax bills to be enrolled as a separate act, clearly \nallowing the President to veto these items. And these vetoed measures \nare then available for consideration by Congress as any other vetoed \nmeasure is today. We can choose to override or not.\n  In the case of the Daschle proposal, the distinguished Democrat \nleader, there are fast-track procedures for consideration of the \nPresident's proposals to rescind, but unlike our proposal, a simple \nmajority can defeat the President's efforts. Is the Daschle proposal \nbetter than current law? Probably yes, on the margin, as it does \nrequire us to at least consider the rescission. But it also only takes \na majority to defeat. In the case of our proposal, the President's \naction stands unless two-thirds of us overturn that exact decision up \nor down, yes or no. No confusion. I believe this is a much stronger \ntest.\n  Separate enrollment is not simple. I acknowledge that. But I believe \nwe should give the President, be it this President or any other \nPresident, the opportunity to use this authority. If it is abused, if \nthe executive branch takes the opportunity to subvert our intentions, \nwe can remove this new authority as we have granted it. Of course, \nthere is a sunset of the year 2000, so we have the time between now and \nthen to see how the process works.\n  Is our substitute perfect? Probably not. But I believe it is much \nstronger and moves us much further in the right direction. I hope we \nmay defeat the Daschle proposal. Then I am assuming, according to my \nconversations with the Democratic leader, we will conclude action on \nthis bill today. That is my understanding and the understanding of the \nDemocratic leader, and I \n[[Page S4426]]  would like to conclude action on it by mid-afternoon so \nwe can move to the self-employed tax measure and complete action on \nthat tomorrow. Then, on Monday, move to the modified moratorium on \nregulations.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the Democratic leader for his \nsubstitute line-item veto amendment. It strikes the worst features of \nSenator McCain's version of a line-item veto and the majority leader's \nseparate enrollment version. Instead, it adds the best features of \nSenator Domenici's and Senator Exon's original version of a line-item \nveto.\n  The Daschle amendment restores majority rule to the line-item veto \nprocess. Under this amendment, the President would have 20 days after \nsigning an appropriations bill or a revenue bill to send Congress a \ndraft bill cancelling any line item. Congress then would have 10 days \nto vote on the rescissions bill.\n  If Congress passes the bill by a simple majority and it is signed by \nthe President, all savings must go to reducing the deficit.\n  This procedure honors the intent of our Founders by embracing the \nfundamental principle of majority rule.\n  By contrast, the McCain bill and the Dole substitute would undermine \nthis fundamental principle by imposing a three-fifths supermajority \nvote in both houses to overturn a line-item veto.\n  Our Founders rejected such supermajority voting requirements on \nmatters within Congress' purview.\n  James Madison condemned supermajority requirements in Federalist \nPaper No. 58. Madison warned that:\n\n       In all cases where justice or the general good might \n     require new laws to be passed, or active measures to be \n     pursued, the fundamental principle of free government would \n     be reversed. It would be no longer the majority that would \n     rule: the power would be transferred to the minority.\n\n  Unfortunately, the McCain bill and the Dole substitute would do \nexactly what Madison warned against--it would transfer power to a \nminority in either the House or Senate.\n  Moreover, supermajority requirements hurt small States, like Vermont, \nby upping the ante to take on the President.\n  No matter how worthy a project, it will be difficult for States with \nonly a few Members to overcome a line-item veto.\n  Under Senator McCain's proposal and Senator Dole's substitute, it \nwould require Members from small States to convince two-thirds of \nMembers in each House to override the President's veto for the sake of \na project in another Member's district.\n  With Vermont having only one Representative in the House, why would \nother Members risk the President's wrath to help us with a project \nvetoed by the President?\n  The Daschle amendment keeps the power of the purse with Congress--\nwhere it belongs.\n  As the ranking member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the \nAppropriations Committee, I am frequently called upon to travel abroad. \nWhen I visit emerging democracies, one of the universal praises I hear \nabout our system of checks and balances is the power to spend residing \nin the legislative branch, not the executive.\n  Many officials from new democracies believe that a legislature's \npower over the purse is the best weapon to fight the tyranny of a \ndictatorship.\n  The McCain line-item veto and the Dole substitute hand over the \nspending purse strings to the President.\n  The President would have no burden of persuasion while a Member would \nhave the Herculean task of convincing two-thirds of his or her \ncolleagues in both Houses to care about the vetoed project. It is truly \na task for Hercules to override a veto. Just look at the record--of the \n2,513 Presidential vetoes in our history, Congress has been able to \noverride only 104 times.\n  The McCain and Dole supermajority veto procedures would fundamentally \nchange the balance of powers between the two branches and result in a \nmassive shift of power to the executive branch from the legislative \nbranch.\n  The Daschle amendment, on the other hand, maintains the \nconstitutional balance between the executive and legislative branches.\n  For a Presidential rescission to become effective, both Houses of \nCongress must approve it within 10 days. The burden is on the President \nto convince a simple majority in both the House and Senate to agree to \nhis line-item veto. The President is guaranteed a vote, and Congress is \nforced to consider the rescission.\n  If the President cannot convince a majority of us that a targeted \nproject is unnecessary and frivolous, then his veto should fail.\n  Like Senator Domenici's original version, this substitute line-item \nveto will sunset at the end of the 1998 fiscal year. I strongly support \na sunset provision since any line-item veto legislation is like walking \non Mars--it has never been done before.\n  Let us try it out for a few years and see what happens.\n  Senator Daschle has improved the original Domenici-Exon bill. The \nDaschle substitute protects Social Security--America's true contract \nwith its senior citizens. The Daschle amendment exempts the \nadministrative expenses of Social Security from a line-item veto.\n  But the most significant feature of the Daschle amendment is that it \ncloses a multi-billion-dollar loophole in the McCain bill and Dole \nsubstitute.\n  The McCain bill ignores tax break loopholes. And the Dole substitute \nhas such a convoluted definition of tax breaks that no one knows which \ntax loopholes the President may strike.\n  The Daschle substitute fixes these flaws by giving the President \nclear authority to target for repeal all wasteful tax benefits in \nrevenue bills.\n  I find it ironic that the proponents of the McCain bill and now the \nDole substitute--who claim that their line-item veto is the only \nversion that will effectively cut pork-barrel programs--are afraid to \ngive the President the ability to cut pork-barrel tax breaks too. Why \nshould the President be given the power to veto spending for school \nlunches and not for tax deductions claimed by businessmen for three-\nmartini lunches?\n  Whether pork-barrel spending is in a program or in a tax break, it is \nstill wasteful. To paraphrase Gertrude Stein: A pork barrel is a pork \nbarrel is a pork barrel.\n  Over the years, big business and other special interests have lobbied \nhard for tax subsidies for specific industries. And, unfortunately, \nthey have been successful on occassion.\n  These wasteful special interest tax subsidies do not increase \neconomic growth. To the contrary, wasteful special interest tax \nsubsidies only add to our deficit, which puts a drag on our whole \neconomy.\n  Like an old-fashioned pork sausage, it is amazing what is in our \nInternal Revenue Code. Let me give you an example of the corporate pork \nin our tax laws today.\n  Our tax laws allow U.S. firms to delay paying taxes on income earned \nby their foreign subsidiaries until the profit is transferred to the \nUnited States. Many U.S. multi-national corporations naturally drag \ntheir feet when transferring profits back to their corporate \nheadquarters to take advantage of this special tax break.\n  But the millions of small business owners--who make up over 95 \npercent of businesses in my home State of Vermont--do not have the \nluxury of paying their taxes later by parking profits in a foreign \nsubsidiary. The bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that \nthe U.S. Treasury will lose close to $6 billion from this tax loophole \nover the next 5 years.\n  The Progressive Policy Institute, a middle-of-the-road think tank, \nalong with the liberal Center On Budget And Policy Priorities and the \nconservative Cato Institute, recently identified 31 tax subsidies that \nwill cost U.S. taxpayers almost $102 billion over the next 5 years. A \nfew of these subsidies have merit, but many more are just plain \nwasteful.\n  Robert Shapiro, the author of the report, concluded that ``tax \nsubsidies, like their counterparts on the spending side, reduce \neconomic efficiency.* * *'' Budget experts on the right, center and \nleft all agree that pork-barrel tax loopholes are just as wasteful as \npork-barrel programs.\n  Not only does the Daschle amendment vastly improve the McCain bill \n[[Page S4427]]  and Dole substitute, but it also would clear up a murky \narea in the line-item veto bill that recently passed the House. In the \nHouse passed version, H.R. 2, the President has authority to veto \ntargeted tax benefits, which are defined as providing a Federal tax \ndeduction, credit or concession to 100 or fewer beneficiaries.\n  Is this definition of targeted tax benefits a practical joke by our \nHouse colleagues? I can think of only a handful of tax breaks that fit \ninto this very narrow definition.\n  In fact,the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office agreed that \ndefining targeted tax breaks in such a limiting manner would produce \nlaughable savings.\n  The CBO, in typical understatement, said that repealing a tax break \nthat benfits fewer than 100 people is unlikely to generate large \nsavings.\n  This extremely limited definition would protect almost all wasteful \ntax loopholes and invite tax evasion.\n  Any accountant or lawyer worth his or her high-priced fee will be \nable to find more than 100 clients who can benefit from a tax loophole. \nIf more than 100 taxpayers can figure out a way to shelter their income \nin a tax loophole, the President would not be able to touch it.\n  The bigger the loophole in terms of the number of people who can take \nadvantage of it, the safer it is from being cut.\n  The Daschle amendment gives the President real authority to go after \nwasteful tax breaks. Under the Daschle substitute, every wasteful tax \nbreak would get the same Presidential scrutiny as every wasteful \nprogram.\n  I believe the Daschle amendment embraces the best parts of various \nversions of a line-item veto. It honors majority rule.\n  It keeps the power of the purse with Congress while still giving the \nPresident new authority to target wasteful spending. It protects Social \nSecurity. And it gives the President authority to target all future tax \nloopholes for repeal.\n  The Daschle line-item veto substitute is a reasonable and \ncomprehensive measure. I urge my colleagues to adopt it.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak for a moment on \nbehalf of the line-item veto proposal that the minority leader has \noffered. I support this reasonable alternative to the so-called \nseparate enrollment line-item veto legislation. Just one of a number of \nproblems with the separate enrollment measure is that it makes funds \nfor operating the Social Security Administration vulnerable to the \nPresident's line-item veto authority.\n  It is clear that the public expects us to protect the integrity of \nthe Social Security System for current beneficiaries and for the \nmillions of current workers and employers worried about the future of \nSocial Security. The majority leader's separate enrollment proposal \nwould not protect Social Security. A provision, however, in the \nDemocratic substitute would exempt moneys used to administer the Social \nSecurity program from the President's line-item veto power.\n  This provision is almost identical to an amendment that I \nsuccessfully offered to one of the line-item veto bills during our \nrecent Governmental Affairs Committee markup. This amendment was \nunanimously accepted. The Democratic proposal simply states that,\n\n       The term ``budget item'' means an amount, in whole or in \n     part, of budget authority provided in an appropriation Act \n     except to fund direct spending programs and the \n     administrative expenses of Social Security.\n\n  Under the separate enrollment proposal new direct spending for Social \nSecurity would be subject to the line-item veto. But my primary concern \nis about the annual appropriation that is used to administer the Social \nSecurity program. These funds, for the most part, come from the Social \nSecurity trust funds, are reviewed annually, and are appropriated by \nthe Appropriations Committees of the Congress. The President, armed \nwith line-item veto authority, could eliminate, or by leveraging a \nveto, limit these administrative funds.\n  As it currently stands, the Social Security Administration's \noperating budget is over $5 billion. The greatest portion of these \nfunds come from the Social Security trust funds and are used to \nadminister the Social Security retirement and disability programs. \nOperating expenses for these two programs represent only 0.9 percent of \ntotal program costs, but are the key to effective distribution of \nSocial Security payments and efficient operation of the Social Security \nsystem. If we don't have sufficient operating funds to properly fulfill \nthe mission of the Social Security Administration, we fail to honor our \ncommitment to protect Social Security.\n  One of the many functions carried out by the Social Security \nAdministration is to make sure that beneficiary checks are correctly \ncalculated and promptly mailed out. This is vital to the 42.6 million \nrecipients of Social Security who deserve to get their benefits on time \nand also to receive the right benefit amount. In my State alone, \naccording to the Social Security Administration, 489,330 Arkansans \nreceive Social Security benefits. This is 20 percent of the Arkansas \npopulation. I can only imagine the outcry and confusion if these \ncitizens were to not receive their benefits on time due to a \nPresident's line-item veto of Social Security.\n  Administative funds also ensure that citizens who apply for benefits \nunder the disability program are reviewed for eligibility and that \nbenefit denials can be appealed. But perhaps even more importantly, \nthese operating funds are also used to conduct continuing disability \nreviews. These reviews are conducted to determine if individuals \ncontinue to be eligible for disability benefits, and, if not, to \nterminate them from the rolls.\n  Just yesterday the Subcommittee on Social Security of the Senate \nFinance Committee held a hearing on the growth in the Social Security \ndisability program. This growth stems, in part, from the lack of \nresources the Social Security Administration currently has to conduct \nthese important reviews. The resources provided for the Social Security \nAdministration are important to\n ensure that benefits only go to those individuals who are truly \neligible.\n\n  In fact, the General Accounting Office has estimated that \nadministrative budget cuts at Social Security have resulted in \nsignificant reductions in disability reviews and that the failure to \nconduct these reviews will cost the trust funds $1.4 billion over 5 \nyears.\n  Proper administrative funding also means that we can combat \nfraudulent Social Security claims. Social Security is not immune to \nfraud and abuse. Without proper funding, it is possible that there \ncould be an increase in fraudulent claims filed by citizens that will \ntry to cheat the system.\n  Mr. President, before the committee mark-up of the line-item veto \nlegislation my amendment was endorsed by the American Association of \nRetired Persons. I have a letter from the AARP which makes several \nimportant points that I would like to emphasize today. They point out, \nand I quote, that ``Social Security is a self-financed program and does \nnot contribute one penny to the deficit.'' They also state ``since \nSocial Security takes in more revenue than is needed to pay benefits, \nCongress deliberately took it off budget in order to shield it from \nunwarranted reductions.'' I ask that the full text of this letter be \nprinted in the Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, by exempting Social Security administrative \nfunds as incorporated in the Democratic amendment, we can honestly tell \nthe American people that their Social Security checks are secure and \nthat administrative functions and services will not be interrupted, \nreduced, or eliminated.\n\n                                Exhibit\n\n                                           American Association of\n\n\n                                        Retired Persons, AARP,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 2, 1995.\n     Hon. David H. Pryor,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pryor: The American Association of Retired \n     Persons (AARP) supports your amendment to S. 4, the \n     ``Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 1995,'' that would ensure \n     that Social Security is exempt from the line item veto. \n     Although AARP believes a limited line item veto or other \n     mechanism that allows for appropriate Congressional review \n     may be warranted to help control unjustified tax breaks or \n     spending programs, \n     [[Page S4428]]  we strongly believe that the administrative \n     expenses of the Social Security Administration (SSA) should \n     be excluded for the following reasons:\n       Social Security is a self-financed program that does not \n     contribute one penny to the deficit. In fact, since Social \n     Security takes in more revenue than is needed to pay \n     benefits, Congress deliberately took it off budget in order \n     to shield it from unwarranted reductions.\n       SSA's administrative expenses are financed from the Social \n     Security trust funds.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to table the Daschle amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, before we call for that, could we maybe make \nan agreement here on what we have left, I ask my friend?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. EXON. According to my list, we have the amendment left by Senator \nByrd, which we talked about a few moments ago. He reserves the right to \ncall that up sometime today or tomorrow.\n  We have the amendment offered by----\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I interrupt my friend for a minute?\n  Mr. EXON. Is that right?\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is the understanding on this side of the aisle, \narticulated by the majority leader, the agreement between the majority \nleader and Democratic leader was that we could conclude this bill \ntoday. So we may have to discuss that.\n  Mr. EXON. I would certainly say, at least one of the principles in \nthis--I understood there was a goal to conclude this today. But I \nbelieve Senator Byrd is absolutely correct that when he did not object \nearlier, the gentlemen's agreement was we would finish it this week. So \nI would say, despite any agreement that might have been entered into by \nthe majority leader and minority leader, that did not receive unanimous \nconsent and therefore would not be binding. Is that right?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will yield to the majority leader on that one.\n  Mr. DOLE. It may not be binding, but this is an understanding the two \nleaders had. We will just leave it at that.\n   Mr. EXON. I think Senator Byrd could adequately defend himself on \nthat.\n  Mr. DOLE. I am certain he could.\n  Mr. EXON. I will not do so. Suffice it to say the Byrd amendment \nthen, whenever it is called up, is one remaining.\n  The Levin and Murkowski, two amendments, have now been combined into \none, so we have that one left in addition to Byrd.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is my understanding also--I think it is my \nunderstanding that is acceptable to both sides. Is that your \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. EXON. That is correct. So that should be easily taken care of.\n  Then we have the Hatch judiciary amendment that has not yet been \ndisposed of and will likely require a vote. Is that the Senator's \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. DOLE. If it is pursued.\n  Mr. EXON. And as far as I know, that is all I have on my list. Does \nthe Senator have anything else?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, I would say to my colleague from Nebraska, the \nAbraham amendment, which I also believe would be accepted by both \nsides.\n  Mr. EXON. I missed that. I think that is agreed to also. We are \npretty close.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I then say to my friend from Nebraska, without \ntaking much more time of the body, obviously we could finish this today \nwith great ease, perhaps by mid-afternoon. So I hope the Senator from \nWest Virginia might appreciate that and help us move forward. But, as \nmy colleague said, that is an issue that the Senator from West Virginia \nwould want to discuss.\n  Does that complete our colloquy?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n      Amendment No. 401, As Further Modified to Amendment No. 347\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 401, and I \nhave a further modification of my amendment, which I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification of \namendment No. 401 by Senator Abraham? Without objection, the amendment \nis so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 401), as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 17, strike everything after word \n     ``measure'' through the word ``generally'' on page 4, line 14 \n     and insert the following in its place: ``first passes both \n     Houses of Congress in the same form, the Secretary of the \n     Senate (in the case of a measure originating in the Senate) \n     or the Clerk of the House of Representatives (in the case of \n     a measure originating in the House of Representatives) shall \n     disaggregate the items as referenced in Sec. 5(4) and assign \n     each item a new bill number. Henceforth each item shall be \n     treated as a separate bill to be considered under the \n     following subsections. The remainder of the bill not so \n     disaggregated shall constitute a separate bill and shall be \n     considered with the other disaggregated bills pursuant to \n     subsection (b).\n       (2) A bill that is required to be disaggregated into \n     separate bills pursuant to subsection (a)--\n       (A) shall be disaggregated without substantive revision, \n     and\n       (B) shall bear the designation of the measure of which it \n     was an item prior to such disaggregation, together with such \n     other designation as may be necessary to distinguish such \n     measure from other measures disaggregated pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) with respect to the same measure.\n       (b) The new bills resulting from the disaggregation \n     described in paragraph 1 of subsection (a) shall be \n     immediately placed on the appropriate calendar in the House \n     of origination, and upon passage, placed on the appropriate \n     calendar in the other House. They shall be the next order of \n     business in \n     [[Page S4429]]  each House and they shall be considered and \n     voted on en bloc and shall not be subject to amendment. A \n     motion to proceed to the bills shall be nondebatable. Debate \n     in the House of Representatives or the Senate on the bills \n     shall be limited to not more than 1 hour, which shall be \n     divided equally between the majority leader and the minority \n     leader. A motion further to limit debate is not debatable. A \n     motion to recommit the bills is not in order, and it is not \n     in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the bills \n     are agreed to or disagreed to.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the purpose of the modification is to \naddress technical concerns which were raised by the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia and others.\n  These concerns pertain to whether parts of a bill that do not \nconstitute an item under the definition set out in the substitute would \nhave to be disaggregated. The effect of this modification is to make \nclear that only new direct spending or new targeted tax benefits must \nbe disaggregated.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nfor raising questions that led to this clarification. And I wish to \nthank my colleagues from Indiana and Arizona for their willingness to \nwork with me on this matter.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I call for regular order with regard to the \nLevin amendment No. 406.\n  Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that this amendment addresses \nthe enrollment restrictions and limitations.\n  I notice the presence of the Senator from New Mexico, Senator \nBingaman, on the floor. I know that he wishes to address this \namendment. I also note that the sponsor of the amendment, Senator \nLevin, is here, and I believe Senator Murkowski, who is a cosponsor, \nwas here a moment ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Abraham amendment, \nwhich is amendment No. 401.\n  Mr. EXON. I request that be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Does the Senator from Nebraska intend to take up the Abraham \namendment?\n  Mr. EXON. The Abraham amendment is being temporarily laid aside at \nthe request of myself on behalf of Senator Byrd, who wishes to address \nit before it is voted on. I suspect that we will have a chance to voice \nvote that, but there has been a request on this side to address it \nbefore we proceed.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 406 to Amendment No. 347\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is now on amendment No. \n406, offered by the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I just had a few questions to ask to try \nto understand amendment No. 406. I was hoping to address those \nquestions to one or any of the sponsors. I note the Senator from \nMichigan is here. He has previously indicated he would be glad to try \nto respond to these questions.\n  So let me just state those questions and then, if the Senator from \nMichigan or anyone else would want to respond, I would appreciate it.\n  Let me first just put this in some context, because I am trying to \nunderstand the bill that is pending and also understand it in light of \nthis amendment.\n  As I understand the bill that is pending, it essentially tries to \nfocus in on items of appropriation and provides that an item of \nappropriation has to be separately enrolled and sent to the President \nin separate form so that the President has the discretion to either \nsign or veto that item of appropriation.\n  I recognize that it is both items of appropriation, and then it is \ndirect spending and one other matter which is covered.\n  But I guess my concern is this: When we get back to the finding of \nwhat an item of appropriation is, what does the term ``item'' mean? We \nsay that it means any numbered section, any unnumbered paragraph, any \nallocation or suballocation of an appropriation.\n  And then the amendment that we are now discussing tries to write in \nan exception to that and say, as to items of appropriation, that an \nitem:\n\n       Shall not include a provision which does not appropriate \n     funds, direct the President to expend funds for any specific \n     project, or to create an express or implied obligation to \n     expend funds and--\n       (i) rescinds or cancels existing budget authority;\n       (ii) only limits conditions, or otherwise restricts the \n     President's authority to spend otherwise appropriated funds; \n     or;\n       (iii) conditions on an item of appropriation not involving \n     a positive allocation of funds by explicitly prohibiting the \n     use of any funds.\n\n  That is complicated to me, Mr. President. I may be the only Member of \nthe Senate who has difficulty understanding that, but, I have to tell \nyou, I have some difficulty.\n  Let me just ask a couple of questions.\n  First of all, what happens to all of these that we are talking about \nhere, all the items which are not included in the definition of items? \nFor example, what happens to the limits, conditions, or other \nrestrictions on the President's authority to spend otherwise obligated \nfunds?\n  If those are not to be enrolled as separate items and sent to the \nPresident for his signature, what does happen to them? Is there \nanybody--the Senator from Michigan or anyone else--who would like to \nrespond to that question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me first back up and then attempt to answer the \nSenator's question.\n  The problem that this amendment addresses is that there are many \nitems under the definition in the bill which are not spending items, \nwhich are not items where Congress is adding on funds, where we are not \nappropriating money, but where we are restricting or rescinding or \nlimiting, where we are saying, ``None of the funds appropriated in this \nbill may be spent to keep troops'' in a certain country after a certain \ndate, or where we are saying, ``No more than,'' a certain amount of \ndollars, ``can be spent on travel,'' or we are saying, ``None of the \nmoney that has been appropriated here can be spent on first-class \ntravel,'' or where we are saying, ``Not to exceed,'' a certain amount, \n``could be spent on consultants.''\n  Where Congress in an appropriations bill, which we do all the time, \nis restricting the use of funds by the executive branch or limiting the \nuse of funds by the executive branch, if those restrictions and limits \nare items, then to give the President that special veto power, if he \nuses it, will not save the Treasury any money but will give the \nPresident more flexibility exactly the opposite way than we intend.\n  So we will have failed in restricting the use of funds and we will \nnot have benefited the Treasury one dollar. That is the problem that is \nsought to be addressed by this amendment.\n  So in order to avoid at least some of that, as much as we can, as \nmuch as we were able to get cleared and support on, what we are saying \nis, in the cases enumerated here, those are not to be treated as \nseparate items. That is the background of it.\n  The Senator then says, ``Well, how will they be treated?'' I have a \ntwofold answer. One is that they will be attached to the item to which \nthey relate.\n  For instance, if you say, ``Here is $10 million, HUD, but no more \nthan $1 million may be spent for'' a particular purpose, the ``but not \nmore than $1 million for'' a particular purpose, would then, my \nintention is, be attached to the larger item. It would not be an \nallocation or a suballocation in the words of the bill. It would be \nconnected to the larger item that otherwise it would be separated from.\n  Now, if for some reason you cannot do that--and there may be \ncircumstances that you cannot do that--then, as I understand the bill, \nthere will be a place where all the items that are not separated out \nand separately enrolled will be packaged together. I do not know what \nthat paragraph would be called, but there will necessarily be such a \nparagraph, and these items would then be part of that paragraph.\n   [[Page S4430]] Let me say to my friend from New Mexico, I have a lot \nof problems with this bill and with the separate enrollment. I think we \nare going to find very soon that this is not going to work very well \nfor lots of reasons. And I think one of them is going to be the \nenrollment process itself and the fact that then, after they are \nseparately enrolled under the Abraham amendment, they would come back \nto us, they are unamendable, up or down, so forth, and we are going to \nbe sending the President a thousand bills to sign instead of one. I do \nnot know how the President can even veto an appropriations bill under \nthis approach. If he wants to veto the whole appropriations bill, there \nis no bill to veto. He would have to veto 1,000 bills.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Back on the question that the Senator from New Mexico \nasked, can I ask him for a practical example and how this amendment \nwould address it, if that would be agreeable?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to accept that, but I want to be sure \nfirst that I have done the best job I can in addressing the Senator's \nquestion.\n  I happen to agree with, I think, the thrust of the questions, that we \nare going to have a huge amount of practical problems, in any event, I \nbelieve, with the separate enrollment process. What my amendment may do \nis create an additional--could be--an additional practical problem so \nthat there will be 51 practical problems instead of 50. But what it is \naimed at is a very critical substantive point, and that is the power of \nthe purse of the U.S. Congress.\n  We have used the power of the purse throughout history to be sure \nthat the President did not exceed certain limits that the Congress has \nset. We do it all the time. We say, ``No later than'' a certain date. \n``None of the funds in this bill may be used to keep troops in Somalia \nafter'' a certain date. That is an absolutely essential congressional \npower, and we should not give that up.\n  We are giving up some power in this bill in order to gain some money \nfor the Treasury, in order to limit spending which Congress asks. So \nthere is a tradeoff. Are we willing to give the Executive additional \npower in order to reduce the additional spending which Congress \nsometimes puts in appropriations bills? But in these cases in this \namendment, there is no additional spending. This is limits on spending. \nThis is where we rescind spending. This is where we restrict spending, \nand in those cases, it hopefully is not our intention to be giving \npower to the President to override our policy where there is no gain to \nthe Treasury.\n  So my answer is twofold: One, that the intent of this amendment is \nthat the restriction be connected to the appropriation item it refers \nto, and where that is impossible, that it would then be packaged with \nany other parts of that bill before it became subbills and pieces of \nbills, and so forth.\n  I tried to answer the question, and I now yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I do not want to take the time of the Senator from New \nMexico. A couple of practical examples have been raised. For example, I \nask the Senator from Michigan, suppose that the appropriations bill \nsaid $10 million for aid to El Salvador but no funds for any military \ntraining.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if the Senator from Arizona will allow me to \nanswer that question as a cosponsor of this amendment. I have a \nspecific example that will hopefully enlighten and address that \nquestion.\n  On a defense appropriations bill, say we have a provision that \nprovides funding for the Department of Defense for military personnel, \n$75 billion, provided that none of the funds appropriated will be \navailable to deploy United States Armed Forces to participate in the \nimplementation of a peace settlement in Bosnia unless previously \nauthorized by Congress.\n  Under the Dole substitute, the President basically gets two bills. \nThe first would be a bill to appropriate $75 billion for military \npersonnel. The second would bar United States troops in Bosnia \npeacekeeping. The President can sign bill 1 and veto bill 2. He, thus, \nwill be able to receive the $75 billion without restriction and can \nsend troops to Bosnia without congressional approval.\n  Under the amendment of the Senator from Michigan and myself, the \nPresident gets one bill. Since the restriction in the appropriations \nbill completely bars the use of any funds in Bosnia peacekeeping, the \nPresident gets only one bill which contains the appropriation of $75 \nbillion and the Bosnia restriction.\n  So that is the intent and an example specifically. The President must \neither sign the bill and accept the Bosnia restriction, or he must veto \nthe bill and not have the $75 billion available.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, can I just ask a follow-up question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, where in the amendment or the bill does \nit say what the Senator from Alaska just described? As I see it, the \ncondition that none of the funds in this bill can be spent to support \nactivities in Bosnia, or whatever the condition would be, might just as \neasily be separately enrolled, along with a lot of other conditions.\n  I do not see why you could not have, as a result of this process, in \nthe defense area, for example, 2,000 bills go to the President. Each \none of those would be bills that qualified under the definition in here \nfor ``item.''\n  Then you could have another bill go to the President which \nincorporated all of the various conditions that Congress has put on the \nPresident in the expenditure, and one of them would say you cannot do \nanything more to enforce the Endangered Species Act. We adopted that \nlast Thursday. Another would say you cannot spend more on the B-2. \nAnother would say you cannot go into Bosnia. We can add those together \nand put them into a bill--I think that is permitted under this--and \nsend it to the President and the President could veto it. He gets his \nmoney and he does not get any restrictions. What is wrong with that? \nDoes it say that cannot be done?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is in the amendment as offered by the Senator from \nMichigan and myself, specifically stating that ``conditions on an item \nof appropriation not involving a positive allocation of funds by \nexplicitly prohibiting the use of any funds.'' That is the amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. But, Mr. President, the condition that we are talking \nabout has to be enrolled someplace, if it is going to become law. It \nhas to be sent to the President if it is going to become law, and he \nhas to sign it if it is going to become law. I am just asking, is there \nanything in this amendment or this bill which keeps us, the Congress--\nor the appropriators, more specifically, because they are the ones who \ndetermine this--from just saying, OK, we are going to take all of these \nrestrictions and we are going to package them together and send them up \nthere and call them a bill, just like we call each item a bill? That \nwould be a natural thing to do if we want to get it to the President \nfor signature.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, is he saying that right now we \ncould do that, and this amendment does not prevent that same thing from \nhappening?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes, we could do that now. This amendment, as I read \nit, and this bill, as I read it, calls for the separate enrollment of \nthe specific dollar allocations or appropriations, so that the \nPresident can cross out the allocations or appropriations. There are a \nlot of conditions we stick into appropriations bills which are not tied \nto a specific allocation or appropriation. When we adopted, last \nThursday, the prohibition against doing anything more to enforce the \nEndangered Species Act--or whatever the precise language of the \nHutchison amendment was--why would that not be a separate item?\n  Mr. LEVIN. This amendment does not cure that problem.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. So you are saying that there are conditions which would \nbe enrolled separately from the appropriation itself and which would go \nto the President, and he could either defer to the Congress and say \nthey do not want me to do anything more on the Endangered Species Act, \ntherefore, I will sign their bill; or he could say, I am going to veto \nthat part and use the money that they have appropriated as I see fit?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Well, the amendment addresses those situations where there \nis \n[[Page S4431]]  a limitation, a condition, or a restriction on the \nPresident's authority to spend otherwise appropriated funds. If there \nis no appropriated fund in that bill, then it could not be attached to \nthat. You would not be addressing the problem the Senator raises. But \nthat exists right now. That is a problem that exists right now. This \namendment does not solve, at all, all of the problems with this bill, \nor all of the circumstances under which we now legislate. What this \ndoes is what I have described.\n  If we say to the President, here is $100 billion for the United \nStates Army, and none of these funds may be used to have any of these \nsoldiers in Somalia after a certain date, this would require, under \nthis amendment, that the restriction on the funds in that bill be \nconnected to it, or else we are giving the President power without any \nbenefit to the Treasury. If you allow him to veto the restriction, he \nthen has the $100 billion unrestricted, the Treasury has not gained a \npenny, and we have lost our policy.\n  The Congress will have ceded to the President that power of the \npurse, with no financial benefit whatsoever. And I happen to have great \nproblems with the Dole substitute. There are all kinds of problems, I \nbelieve, with the separate enrollment which this amendment does not \nsolve, including, I believe, the one the Senator from New Mexico has \ncome up with. If we are going to have separate enrollments, which I \noppose--I think they are unconstitutional, unwise, and everything \nelse--at least we should not be giving up the power of the purse, where \nthere is no benefit to the Treasury, where it is a restriction on \nspending.\n  I have used the example--and I will use it again--where we give an \nagency money and say: This is for your general operations, but you may \nnot spend more than $10 million on consultants. I do not think there is \nany intent--there should not be in this amendment, and I will make sure \nthere is no intent--to let the President separately veto the \nrestriction on the use of consultants and then have all the money \nwithout such restriction.\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, let me once again go at this and see \nif I am clear. I am concerned about this. Under the existing \nprocedure--and it has lots of flaws, and I am as critical of it as many \nin this body are--we send the President a bill and it has money \nappropriated and it has conditions attached, and those are all \ntogether; the President either takes it or leaves it and, clearly, \nthere are major deficiencies with that system.\n  What I am concerned about with this amendment and this new bill that \nwe are talking about here is that we are requiring that the dollar \nfigures be separately presented as bills. And it would seem logical to \nme that if those are all items that are separately presented, any \nconditions we want to attach to the expenditure might be a separate \nbill, as well, might be presented as a separate bill, and we might put \nthem all together. I do not know what we would call it, but that might \nbe the result. The President would have the choice of vetoing each and \nevery appropriation, and then he would be presented with sort of a \ncatch-all remainder kind of a bill which has all these conditions in \nit. And there would be a great incentive on the part of the President \nto say, ``I will sign everything but the conditions. I do not like \nCongress telling me what to do. They do not know anything about Bosnia \nup in Congress.''\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield, I do not believe Congress \nwould be so foolish as to enroll it that way because it would leave it \nas a target. The Congress would enroll the restricting language along \nwith the money, so that the President had no choice. I cannot imagine \nthat the Congress, if they wanted restrictions enforced, would have one \nline item with the money and some in a different paragraph--although \nthe language of the Senator from Michigan also provides for that, as \nwell.\n  So this bill provides for the fencing language, and the amendment \nprovides for the fencing language that affects that appropriation to go \ntogether and be inseparable.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, if I may ask the Senator from New Mexico \na question. In my colloquy, which is going to be made a part of the \nRecord, with the Senator from Alaska, we make it clear that where you \ncannot connect a restriction to an appropriation, it would be put in \nthe kind of package that the Senator from New Mexico describes. There \nis no other way to do it. But why should we, because there is no \nalternative but to do it that way. Where there is no appropriation to \nconnect the restriction, why should we give up the congressional power \nto restrict, limit, and rescind the use of funds, where there is no \nbenefit to the Treasury, just because it is impossible to add all \nrestrictions to an appropriation? To connect all of the limits to an \nappropriation does not mean we should not try where there is an \nappropriation in the bill to do so?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Well, Madam President, let me try to put this in into \nspecifics here, and see if I understand it. As I understand it, what \nthe Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Arizona are saying is \nthat if we put a general restriction on a bill which cannot be tied to \na specific appropriation, then that could be, or should be, separately \nenrolled as another bill, along, perhaps, with other restrictions.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the restrictions which are not tied to \nspecific appropriations would necessarily have to go in somewhere.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. So they would go into another bill, which the President \ncould either sign or veto, so that any condition that is not tied to a \nspecific appropriation would be there for the President to sign or veto \nas he saw fit.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. And there would be some incentive.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me ask the Senator from Michigan another question: \nTaking the example that the Senator from Arizona was referring to, \nsuppose in the defense appropriation bill we were to say, ``Of the \nfunds appropriated in this bill, not more than $100 million can be \nspent by the Department of Defense to go into Bosnia unless and until \nthe President certifies to the Congress''--whatever. That would be the \nprovision.\n  Now, the Senator is saying that would be separately enrolled if we \nhad that kind of a reference to a specific amount of money, which was \nthe top amount that could be spent out of a much larger appropriation?\n  Is that a separate item which would then be enrolled?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, if I might say, the conditions that \nwould be tied to any specific amount of money are inseparable.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Inseparable.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, my question, though, the money \nreference in the example I just gave is not a reference that \nappropriates money.\n  We have a bill that says we will give the Department of Defense $250 \nbillion; that is the appropriations language. Then we put in a \nprovision that says not more than $100 million of the funds \nappropriated in this bill can be spent for activities in Bosnia.\n  Is that a separate item?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is correct, but if it has restricted language \nassociated with it, then that language is associated with it, also.\n  Wherever there is a line where money is mentioned, that is a separate \nitem.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That, to my mind, would be a restriction. That would be \na limit or condition or otherwise restrict the President's authority to \nspend, because it would say, ``You cannot spend more than $100 \nmillion.''\n  Mr. LEVIN. Of money appropriated herein.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. To do anything--of money appropriated herein--to do \nanything in Bosnia, and we are saying that is something that would not \nbe submitted to the President as a separate bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct.\n  Would the Senator want it to be?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I do not know. I am trying to understand what the \nPresident is ultimately going to be presented with.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have a lot of problems with this bill, as the Senator \nknows, for exactly that same reason. It is our effort here to tie the \nrestriction to the appropriation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, if that is the case that we are trying \nto tie the restriction to the appropriation so as to keep the President \nfrom \n[[Page S4432]] vetoing the legislation separately, what is meant by the \nphrase ``otherwise appropriated funds''?\n  It says here, ``only limits, conditions, or otherwise restricts the \nPresident's authority to spend otherwise appropriated funds.'' Does \nthat mean I can put a restriction in the defense bill which relates to \nfunds appropriated in the energy and water appropriations bill? Is that \nwhat that means?\n  Why do we intend to exempt from this separate enrollment process \nlimits, conditions, and restrictions on the President's authority to \nspend otherwise appropriated funds? Why is that? I do not understand.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The provision that the Senator is referring to is not a \nprovision which appropriates funds. If it were, it would have to be \nseparately enrolled.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. So the point is not to require that the limits and \nconditions and restrictions on the President's authority apply to funds \nappropriated in other bills; it is rather to require that the limits, \nconditions, and restrictions on the President's authority instead apply \nto funds that are in a separately enrolled portion of the bill. Is that \nwhat it is?\n  Mr. LEVIN. If they are already together, then there is no need for \nthis paragraph. This paragraph only says that we will not separately \nenroll the restriction where we can link it to an appropriation. If we \ncannot link it to an appropriation, if it is in another bill, it will \nthen have to either be separately enrolled or packaged as a separate \nenrollment.\n  There is no cure for that problem under the current law. That is a \nproblem which exists in our current law, that we restrict in one \nappropriation bill the President's authority to spend money in another \nappropriation bill. This does not solve that problem. It does not \nworsen the problem.\n  In other words, this does not do a lot of the things that I think the \nSenator would like to see done. It does not do a lot of the things I \nwould like to see done. What it does do is make sure that where there \nis a restriction on an appropriation in a bill, that we do not separate \nthe restriction from the appropriation, because then again we would be \ngiving up a power over the purse for no advantage to the Treasury.\n  Where we can do that, we should do that.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, let me go at this slightly \ndifferently. And I am not trying to delay my colleagues here. I do have \nlegitimate questions that I wanted to ask.\n  If I could get one other example for the Senator from Michigan to \nrespond to. Considering this option, ``Of the $1 billion appropriated \nfor research and development, not more than $100 million shall be spent \non'' a specific project. Is that an earmark? I guess that is the \nquestion. Even though it does not mandate that $100 million be spent, \nit is a strong signal by the Congress that we intend that $100 million \nbe available and spent. Is that an earmark which we are trying to \neliminate by this legislation?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The language of the amendment is that if it does not \ncreate an expressed or implied obligation to spend the $100 million, \nthen the answer would be ``no.''\n  Now, in my judgment, the way that was read, the answer would be \n``no.''\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. So the view of the Senator from Michigan is that that \nkind of a proviso does not constitute an implied obligation to expend \nthose funds?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is right.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me ask, on the third subsection of this where it \ntalks about--again, we are trying to define items and saying that items \ndo not include conditions--language which ``conditions on an item of \nappropriation not involving a positive allocation of funds.''\n  Madam President, my concern is that I thought all items of \nappropriation were, by definition, positive allocations of funds. That \nis what I thought an appropriation was. It was an allocation of funds \nfor a purpose.\n  Here we are saying that we are not going to include in the definition \nof item language which ``conditions on an item of appropriation not \ninvolving a positive allocation of funds. * * *'' I do not understand \nthat language. It sounds to me entirely contradictory. I am obviously \nmissing something.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may respond, it is the implied purpose that no \nmoney can be spent. It says ``not involving a positive allocation of \nfunds and explicitly prohibiting the use of any funds.''\n Does that answer the question?\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I guess I still have a concern in \ntalking about language that ``conditions * * * an item of appropriation \nnot involving a positive allocation of funds.'' I did not know there \nwere any items of appropriation that did not involve positive \nallocations of funds. I thought----\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may respond, my example given on the Department \nof Defense of $75 billion provided that none of the funds appropriated \nbe available to deploy Armed Forces to participate in implementation. \nNone of the funds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I add to that? It refers to any ``conditions on an \nitem.'' Not to the item, I say to the Senator from New Mexico; any \n``conditions on an item of appropriation not involving a positive \nallocation of funds.''\n  There are many conditions that are placed that do not have anything \nto do with allocation of funds. We are talking about the condition, not \nthe item, in the amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. All right. Let me ask one other question here, Madam \nPresident, just to try to get a clear notion. The language of the \namendment talks about language which ``rescinds or cancels existing \nbudget authority.'' I guess I have two questions on that.\n  What do we mean by ``existing'' and what do we mean by ``budget \nauthority''? Are we talking about just this current fiscal year's \nrescissions? And, if so, is it appropriate to just limit or just \nexclude from the definition of ``item'' rescissions of budget \nauthority? Or should we also be excluding from the definition of \n``items'' rescissions of appropriations, as well?\n  Mr. LEVIN. First of all, to answer question No. 1, it is not limited \nto the current year. Second, appropriations, as I understand it, are a \nbudget authority. The words ``budget authority'' include \nappropriations, I am informed by the technical experts here on our \nstaff. It surely is intended to include appropriations.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. So it would not be limited just to the current fiscal \nyear; is that correct, Madam President?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. And therefore a 5-year budget resolution is what would \nbe the determining factor, is that right, in whether or not a \nrescission would be exempt from the definition of ``item'' for purposes \nof this section?\n  Mr. LEVIN. It would cover the rescission of existing budget authority \nfor whatever year that it has been adopted.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. OK.\n  Madam President, I have delayed the Senate long enough. Let me just \nconclude by making a general statement.\n  I think what we are faced with, with this amendment--and I think it \nis a conscientious effort by the Senator from Michigan and the Senator \nfrom Alaska to come up with some way of sorting out a separation of the \nappropriating process from the policymaking process. That is what they \nare trying to do here, as I understand it. They are trying to preserve \nto the Congress the ability to make policy while granting to the \nPresident dramatic new powers with regard to the actual appropriating \nof funds or the prevention of funds from being appropriated. That is \nwhat I understand is going on.\n  I think it is very, very difficult to sort those things out. I think \nit is very difficult to grant to the President one power and reserve to \nthe Congress the accompanying power--which is what this amendment is \ntrying to do. I think it may go a short distance in getting us to that, \nbut I think the grant of authority, if the bill which is pending before \nus is adopted, as I gather it is going to be--the grant of authority is \nbroad and the President, I think, would find that he has very broad \nauthority to countermand policy decisions by the Congress through the \nuse of this new veto power that we would be granting in this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, first let me say I agree with my friend \nfrom New Mexico. This is an effort here to \n[[Page S4433]]  not give to the President, to avoid giving to the \nPresident, power which does not lead to a reduction in spending. The \npurpose of the line-item veto is to try to give the President \nadditional authority over spending where the Congress adds spending. \nBut where the Congress is restricting spending, limiting spending, \nrescinding spending, conditioning spending for policy purposes that we \nbelieve are good and valid, we surely do not want to give the President \nthe veto authority over those restrictions, limitations, conditions, \nand rescissions.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is exactly right. That is the purpose of \nthis amendment.\n  I do not support the underlying substitute to which this amendment \nwill hopefully be attached. I think we are going to create an absolute \nnightmare for the legislative process, for the executive branch, in \nsplintering up an appropriations bill into all kinds of shards and \nlittle pieces. But it appears clear that is what the Senate is about to \ndo. I do not support that approach.\n  But if we are going to do that, for heaven's sake, let us not go \nbeyond the purpose of a line-item veto, which is to give the President, \npresumably, the authority to veto additional spending. Let us not give \nthe President the authority to wipe out our restrictions on spending. \nLet us not give the President that additional authority to wipe out our \nconditions on spending, our rescissions of spending. There is no reason \nto do that.\n  While this only cures one of the problems, in my book, with the \nunderlying substitute--and there are plenty of others that give me \ncause to oppose the underlying substitute--I think we surely ought to \ndo this much, and do what we can to avoid unintended consequences.\n  I believe the sponsors of the underlying substitute support this \nbecause it is not their intention to give the President authority to \nwipe out our restrictions on spending and our rescissions of spending. \nSince that is not, I hope, their intent, we can do the best we can to \ncorrect the bill in this regard. But without this amendment, the bill \nwould give the President a separate piece of a bill, of an \nappropriations bill, and that piece would have just the limitation or \njust the restriction or just the condition, allowing the President to \nseparately veto that and then to be able to spend all of the money \nwithout restriction.\n  So I think the Senator from New Mexico pointed out what the purpose \nof the amendment is and is accurate in saying it does not solve a \nnumber of additional problems. I would agree with him. But it does \nsolve some of the problems. I hope it will be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I would like to thank Senator Bingaman \nfor bringing these issues to the attention of this body as we are \nconsidering it. I think there will be significant questions. As the \nSenator from New Mexico pointed out, this is a very significant and \nfundamental change in the way that business is done. So these examples, \nand the questions that are in the Record, I think, will be helpful when \nwe proceed--I put that perhaps a little too optimistically--when we \nproceed to implement the line-item veto. I thank the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  I would like to point out that, as I said earlier, we have proved to \nanyone's satisfaction here that the Congress can ignore or violate any \nlaw that it passes. The most outstanding example, of course, is the War \nPowers Act. The Congress of the United States, over the veto of the \nPresident of the United States, passed the War Powers Act. We routinely \nignore that legislation--routinely; perhaps one of the most fundamental \nprinciples of the separation of powers as embodied in our Constitution.\n  So I am fully aware that if the Congress wants to violate this law \nwhen we pass it, they can. They can find loopholes. They can find ways \naround it. But this language in the Levin-Murkowski amendment I think \nmakes it very clear that the President of the United States cannot and \nshould not be able to veto an item of condition or money--moneys that \nthe Congress appropriated under those conditions, and be able to \nseparate the two. I think this amendment is very clear in that \ndirection.\n  Senator Levin very thoughtfully points out other problems he has with \nthe bill. I think many of those problems are legitimate. I had a long \nexchange yesterday with Senator Byrd, who raised some legitimate \nconcerns.\n  But I believe there are two ways to look at this legislation. One is \nto go at what the intent is, what the language is, what I think is very \nclear and has been interpreted on this floor as to what it is. Or we \ncan go at it and say we will find some loopholes here and we will \nappropriate $50 billion--$234 billion for defense, period; or maybe \neven break it up into the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force.\n  We can also better shape legislation so the intent of legislation is \nclear, so it is very easy to enroll and, frankly, Madam President, with \nsome of the extraneous matter taken out of it which I believe will make \nthese bills much smaller than they are today,\n because I do not think we get away with some of the items that are now \nput in which some of us only discover weeks or months after the passage \nof the legislation. Items that are put in in conference between the two \nbodies, no Members except those members of the conference, a small \nnumber of people, ever see until we are presented with that \nlegislation, and we only have two choices: yes or no, up or down on \nthat bill. That is not what the participation of Members of the body in \nshaping legislation is all about, in my view.\n\n  So I again want to thank the Senator from Michigan. I think it is \nparticularly interesting that the Senator from Michigan opposes this \nbill, yet he is willing to spend an enormous amount of time and energy \nin trying to make this bill better.\n  My sincere appreciation goes to the Senator from Michigan for his \nattempts and for what I think he and the Senator from Alaska have done. \nFrankly, that is what the amending process on the floor of the Senate \nis all about: to make legislation better. The Senator from Michigan saw \na potential serious problem. I believe that his amendment addresses the \nvast majority of it.\n  Madam President, I yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, let me thank my friend from Arizona, \nfirst of all, for his comments and for his support. I want to thank \nSenator Murkowski because he also noted a very significant problem with \nthis approach. We worked out this common solution to it.\n  I thank Senator Exon for his cosponsorship and support.\n  Madam President, I also thank the Senator from New Mexico. He raises \nsome very important questions which will help create a record which, \nhopefully, will in turn help to implement this legislation, if it is \never passed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I have worked with the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Michigan, Senator Levin, in developing some \nexamples of the implications of amendment No. 406. I think these \nexamples provide our colleagues with a clearer picture of the \nlimitations that will be imposed on enrolling line items.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I appreciate the help of my colleague from Alaska in \ndeveloping these examples and I believe they reflect our intent in \ndrafting this amendment.\n  Example I: Absolute funding prohibition as part of an appropriation; \na Defense appropriations bill contains a provision that provides:\n  Funding for the Department of Defense: For military personnel $75 \nbillion: Provided that none of the funds appropriated be available to \ndeploy United States Armed Forces to participate in the implementation \nof a peace settlement in Bosnia unless previously authorized by \nCongress. Under the pending substitute, the President would be \npresented with two bills:\n  Bill 1 appropriates $75 billion for military personnel.\n  Bill 2 bars United States troops in Bosnia peacekeeping.\n  The President can sign bill 1 and veto bill 2. He thus will be able \nto receive the $75 billion without restriction and could send troops to \nBosnia without congressional approval.\n  Under our amendment, the President receives one bill:\n  Since the restriction in the appropriations bill completely bars the \nuse of any funds in Bosnia peacekeeping, \n[[Page S4434]]  the President would receive only one bill which \ncontains the appropriation of $75 billion along with the Bosnia \nrestriction. The President must either sign the bill and accept the \nBosnia restriction or he must veto the bill and not have the $75 \nbillion available.\n  Example II: Funding Prohibition as a Free Standing Provision; other \nlimits and conditions on appropriations are frequently placed at the \nend of an appropriations bill. For example, in last year's Commerce, \nJustice appropriations bill, provisions were included prohibiting the \nexpenditure of funds for specific purposes including: publicity and \npropaganda purposes not authorized by the Congress; expenditures for \nconsulting services that are not a matter of public record; the \npurchase of certain equipment outside the United States; and the \nimplementation of certain EEOC harassment guidelines based on religion.\n  Similarly, last year's Defense appropriations bill contained \nprovisions prohibiting the expenditure of any funds for specific \npurposes, including: To build a specific radar system; to establish or \nsupport a specific type of maintenance support activity for the B-2 \nbomber; or to carry out specified research projects involving the use \nof animals.\n  Other examples of limits and conditions on appropriation that are \nfree standing sections within an appropriations bill include last \nweek's Defense supplemental bill passed by the Senate. Section 108 \ncontains a requirement that none of the funds appropriated by the act \nmay be made available for operations in Haiti more than 60 days after \nthe date of enactment, unless the President complies with specified \nreporting requirements.\n  Under the substitute, as originally drafted, each of these \nlimitations would be placed in a separate bill, and could be vetoed by \nthe President. For example, the President could sign the supplemental \nappropriation bill providing the money for operations in Haiti and veto \nthe limitation.\n  Under our amendment, the general limitations in a bill would not be \nitems, and would be enrolled together in a single bill. Thus the \nlimitation on funds for Haiti would not be a separate item. Because it \npertains to multiple appropriations, it would be enrolled with the \ngeneral limitations described above.\n  Example III: Limitation and conditions; a VA-HUD bill appropriates \n$350 million for research and development activities including \nprocurement of laboratory equipment and supplies and repair and \nrenovation of facilities. A proviso in that bill states that no more \nthan $55 million of these funds shall be available for procurement of \nlaboratory equipment. The proviso does not mandate that money be spent \non laboratory equipment. Nor should it be considered as creating an \nexpress or implied obligation to expand funds. It only provides that if \nthe administration chooses to spend money on such equipment, it can \nexpend no more than $55 million.\n  The President would receive only one bill containing the $350 million \nappropriation along with the restriction limiting the amount of money \nthat can be expended for procurement of laboratory equipment.\n  Similarly, a provision stating that ``not to exceed $8,000'' of an \noverall appropriation may be expended for official reception and \nrepresentation expenses would be enrolled with the appropriation that \nis so limited, and not as a separate bill.\n  Example IV: Implicit obligation to spend; the same legislation as in \nexample II appropriates $350 million for procurement of laboratory \nequipment, supplies, repair and renovation of facilities contains a \nproviso that three research facilities be constructed in a particular \nState at a cost of no more than $30 million. Such a condition would not \nbe covered under our amendment. That's because the proviso requires the \nconstruction of such facilities and therefore implicitly obligates the \nexpenditure of funds.\n  The President would receive two bills. One would contain the $350 \nmillion appropriation for laboratory equipment, supplies, repair and \nrenovation of facilities. The second bill would contain the provision \nspecifying that three research facilities be constructed in a \nparticular State at a cost of no more than $30 million. The President \ncould sign or veto the first bill and could sign or veto the second \nbill.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nMichigan. I think this is a very, very good amendment. It certainly \ndoes not cover all of the concerns I have in this area, but a \nconsiderable number of those concerns.\n  I am very pleased to be a cosponsor of the amendment, and once again \nI appreciate my colleague's attention to the details. I think the \namendment makes the proposition, although I still have some concerns, \nmuch more palatable. I thank him for offering the amendment. I believe \nwe are ready to act on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I was admonished yesterday by the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia that it is not appropriate to \nsay I move the amendment. I do not say that. But I note that there is \nno further debate at this time as far as I can tell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 406) to No. 347 was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I say to my colleague and friend from \nNebraska that it is my understanding, now that this amendment has been \ntaken care of, that Senator Hatch is now ready to propose an amendment. \nI believe that he may decide to withdraw that amendment.\n  Then remaining, as far as I can ascertain, will be the Abraham \namendment which I believe Senator Byrd wanted discussed, and then \nfinally the Byrd amendment itself.\n  So perhaps we could notify the Senator from West Virginia that his \ninvolvement on the two remaining amendments will be what remains after \nSenator Hatch finishes.\n  Mr. EXON. We will certainly tell the Senator from West Virginia what \nis taking place so that he will be fully advised. My conversations with \nhim indicated that he may want to make some comments with regard to the \namendment that is going to be discussed by our colleague from Utah.\n  Also, the Senator from Arizona is correct. I believe very likely we \ncould agree to the Abraham amendment that Senator Byrd wanted to talk \non. I do not know what his position is. But he wants to talk on it. \nAfter we dispose in some fashion of the Hatch amendment, the only \nthing, as the Senator from Arizona said, that I know of is the Abraham \namendment that Senator Byrd wishes to address, and the Byrd amendment \nitself. I think that indicates that we have moved in great fashion by \nworking together in moving this. We are much further along than most of \nus thought we would be on Tuesday last.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Nebraska for his totally \ncooperative spirit in this effort. Perhaps Senator Byrd would want \nSenator Abraham on the floor when he discusses his amendment. So \nperhaps we can coordinate that.\n  Mr. EXON. Senator Abraham told me about one-half hour ago that he, by \nnecessity, had to leave the Hill and would be back in about an hour, \nwhich I thought would be around 2 o'clock or something like that. He \nasked me to tell Senator Byrd that he was sorry that he had to leave. \nSo we will pass along the information to Senator Byrd on the fact that \nSenator Abraham will be back around 2, and whether or not he wants to \ncome up and talk about the next business, the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Utah, and we will see that all parties are properly advised.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I note the presence of the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 407 to Amendment No. 347\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 407.\n   [[Page S4435]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is the pending \nquestion at this time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, my amendment to the Dole substitute version of S. 4 \nexcludes items of appropriation for the judicial branch from enrollment \nas separate measures prior to presentment to the President. It provides \ninstead that items of appropriation for the judicial branch shall be \nenrolled together in a single measure. This amendment would help ensure \nthe independence of the judiciary from the executive branch, and would \nnot detract from what this bill seeks to accomplish.\n  The amendment is designed to protect the judicial branch from \nattempts by the President to influence or punish the judiciary--or \notherwise undermine its independence as a co-equal branch of \nGovernment--through exercising the line-item veto power with respect to \nparticular judicial appropriations. While I would hope that no \nPresident would think to exercise the line-item veto in such a manner, \nit remains a very real threat that we can easily safeguard against at \nthis stage through adopting this amendment.\n  The amendment I propose would do that by excluding items of \nappropriation for the judicial branch from enrollment as separate \nmeasures for presentment to the President. The exception would cover \nall salaries and expenses related to the operation and administration \nof the Federal courts. The exception would not extend to courthouse \nconstruction, which does not appear in the judiciary's budget and which \nwould remain subject to the line-item veto. Under my amendment, if any \nof the covered items appeared in an appropriations measure, those items \nwould be enrolled together into a single measure.\n  The amendment is carefully crafted to avoid creating a loophole \nthrough which other expenses could be shielded from the line-item veto. \nA budgetary item would only qualify for the exception from separate \nenrollment if it is for one of the functions of the judiciary as those \nare listed or described in the current appropriations act. Thus, \nCongress could not seek to hide an item from the line-item veto by \nslipping it into the judiciary's budget.\n  I believe that the judiciary needs this protection. In the absence of \nthis exception, the judicial branch would be particularly vulnerable to \nthe President's whim. In one form or another, the executive branch is \nthe largest litigator in the Federal courts. Federal courts frequently \nweigh in on the legality of executive branch action. It is not \ndifficult to appreciate how the judicial branch would be vulnerable to \nthe line-item veto because of that. Perhaps more important, the \njudiciary would be relatively powerless to defend itself compared with \nthe legislature. Although a President could conceivably use the line-\nitem veto to target particular functions of the legislative branch, \nCongress would have a keen interest in defending itself against such a \nveto if it believed the veto unwise, and would have at its disposal the \ndirect means through which to override a Presidential veto. The \njudicial branch, however, cannot defend itself.\n  John Adams stated that ``The judicial power ought to be distinct from \nboth the legislative and executive, and independent upon both, so that \nit may be a check upon both.'' Just as the judiciary is separate from \nthe executive and legislative powers in our constitutional system, so \nits independence should be safeguarded through the budgetary process on \nwhich it depends.\n  Current law already protects the judiciary's budget from Presidential \naction, in large part to insulate the judiciary from political \nmanipulation through the budget process. By statute [31 U.S.C. \nSec. 1105(b)], the Judicial branch's budget is accorded protection from \nPresidential alteration. When the President transmits a proposed \nFederal budget to Congress, the President must forward the judicial \nbranch's proposed budget to Congress unchanged. That process has been \nin operation since 1939. It was adopted in part because of unilateral \naction taken by the executive branch in the 1930's to cut the \njudiciary's funding. The Chairman of the Judicial Conference, Chief \nJudge Gilbert Merritt of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit, testified before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, \nthat in the 1930's executive branch action forced the firing of court \nstaff and cut in half the salaries of judges' secretaries. That kind of \naction to influence our Federal judges cannot be tolerated, and it \nshould not be allowed to creep back into the system.\n  Under the present system, that does not mean that the judiciary is \nimmune from budget cuts. The judiciary must independently justify its \nbudget to Congress, and must operate within the budget appropriated for \nit. It would continue to do so under the amendment I propose. In \naddition, Congress would\n continue to be as free to legislate the judiciary's budget under my \namendment as it is today. The President would also remain free to veto \nthe Judiciary's entire budget. To subject the judiciary's budget to \nseparate enrollment, however, risks undermining the current approach--\nand the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches--\nand risks exposing the judiciary to targeted, politically motivated \nretaliation. The President should not be permitted to veto specific \nappropriations for the judiciary where those appropriations have been \ncarefully shielded from Presidential alteration in the first place.\n\n  Moreover, an exception for the judiciary would have virtually no \nimpact on the Federal budget. The entire budget for the judiciary is \ntwo-tenths of 1 percent of the entire Federal budget. While the \njudiciary could be devastated by the line-item veto if portions of its \nbudget were subject to separate enrollment, subjecting it to the line-\nitem veto could not possibly have any significant impact in terms of \nbudget reduction.\n  Normally, I would say subject every line item covered by the bill to \nPresidential veto. But I believe that an exception for the judicial \nbranch is uniquely warranted on principle. The judiciary is a separate \nand co-equal branch of Government that does not have the institutional \npower to look after itself under separate enrollment. The Congress can \nsafeguard itself through the use of the veto override process. The \njudiciary, however, possesses no similar safeguard.\n  To be sure, Congress would have the authority to override a veto of \nany item in the judiciary's budget. I feel very strongly, however, that \nthe judiciary should not be placed in the position of depending on that \naction. That is too slender a reed on which to rest the independence of \nthe judiciary. This amendment will better ensure the judiciary's \nindependence and protect it as a co-equal branch of Government.\n  Mr. President, my amendment does not alter the basic operation of the \nunderlying legislation. Nor would its adoption be a precedent \njustifying other exceptions: no other entity or part of our system of \nGovernment funded by Congress stands on the same footing as the Federal \nJudiciary, a co-equal branch of the central Government.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in acknowledging the status of the \njudiciary as a branch of Government co-equal in status to the Congress \nand the President, and will support this amendment.\n  Let me give my colleagues a hypothetical which illustrates my \nconcern. It involves private property rights.\n  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is a separate line \nitem, currently at $13 million. Among other matters, this court \ncurrently handles all appeals in property rights cases under the \ntakings clause of the fifth amendment. Suppose this court hands down a \nstring of cases favoring property owners, and against the Federal \nGovernment. Suppose further that this angers the President. Without my \namendment, he could veto the $13 million line item--with the exception \nof the salaries of the judges, which the constitution protects, return \nit to Congress, and object that the item should be reduced to $10 \nmillion, citing, not the private property rights cases, but some \nostensible good Government, cost-saving reason. Now, Congress can \neither override the veto or pass a new bill giving this court only $10 \nmillion, hampering its ability to function. Or worse yet, the President \ncould veto it all and just take the whole $13 million.\n  What is likely to happen? Most Americans, and probably most Members \nof Congress, have never heard of this court. No one is going to get \nworked up about this unknown court and $3 million. The judges of the \ncourt \n[[Page S4436]]  are hamstrung from speaking frankly and accusing the \nPresident of undermining them because he dislikes their opinions--that \ngets them too involved in the political process.\n  We do not want judges moving back and forth in accordance with every \nblink or whimsy of the President of the United States or the Congress \nalso. We want judges judging things on the merits, the way they should \nbe judging matters.\n  Moreover, if enough congressional members of the President's party \nshare his disapproval of how this court has ruled on these matters, a \ntwo thirds override will not happen. Congress will be forced to cut the \ncourt's budget and the independence of the judiciary has been \nundermined.\n  If all of the judicial branch's appropriations are in one bill, \nhowever, including the Supreme Court, the other courts of appeal, the \ndistrict courts, and so on, the President couldn't get away with this. \nWe all know what the Supreme Court and the other courts do. If the \nPresident wanted to tamper with the Court of Appeals for the Federal \nCircuit, he would have to veto the Supreme Court's funding and the \nfunding of all of the other Federal courts. This would alarm people. I \ndoubt very much that a President would veto a $2.7 billion bill for the \nsake of knocking out $3 million for this obscure court. If he does so, \nI think Congress would override it so the Supreme Court, for example, \nis able to function.\n  I make this argument only in defense of a coequal branch of \nGovernment which has no direct means of protecting itself. I am not \nbeing critical of the line-item veto in other contexts, and I will \nsupport it.\n  I understand that Senator Byrd would like to speak on this amendment, \nso I will yield the floor at this time before making any further \nmotions on it.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. It is my understanding that the distinguished Senator from \nWyoming [Mr. Simpson] wanted to speak as if in morning business for 10 \nminutes. Would it be agreeable----\n  Mr. HATCH. That is certainly agreeable with me.\n  Mr. BYRD. With the Senator from Utah? If Mr. Simpson would like to \ncome down now, I would like to ask some questions of the distinguished \nSenator from Utah but I do not want to be in a position of keeping Mr. \nSimpson waiting. If it does not inconvenience the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah, I would be happy to wait until the Senator from Wyoming \nmakes his statement.\n  Mr. HATCH. That will be fine. I need to go to another meeting for a \nfew minutes anyway. And I will come right back as soon as I am through.\n  Mr. BYRD. All right.\n  Could we get the yeas and nays on the Senator's amendment now?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would prefer to wait, holding out on the yeas and nays \nfor just a short period.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator desires them, we will get them.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well.\n  Madam President, the distinguished Senator from Utah has to be off \nthe floor for a few minutes to attend a press conference. I would \nprefer that he be here. I do have a few things to say about this \namendment and I have some questions to ask. So I would prefer to \nsuggest the absence of a quorum and give the Senator an opportunity to \nattend the press conference.\n  In the meantime, if the distinguished Senator from Wyoming [Mr. \nSimpson] could be contacted, he perhaps could make his statement before \nfurther discussion on this amendment.\n  So, unless the distinguished Senator from Arizona or any other \nSenator wishes to speak, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Hatch-Roth \namendment. This amendment would exempt portions of the budget used to \nsupport the Federal judiciary from the line-item veto by directing that \nthe entire appropriation for the judicial branch be enrolled in a \nsingle bill.\n  From the outset, I want to make it clear that I support the idea of \nthe line-item veto. I believe that it is important to give the \nPresident the authority to selectively eliminate expenditures of \ntaxpayer funds which are not in the public interest. I believe the \nlegislation we are considering will do that, and that this legislation \nis a big step toward fiscal responsibility.\n  But when it comes to the funding of the Federal judiciary, we are \ndealing with very sensitive constitutional issues. An independent \nFederal judiciary was so important to the Founders that the \nConstitution itself not only gives Federal judges lifetime tenure, it \nspecifically prohibits any reduction of salary during a Federal judge's \nterm of office.\n  Our amendment would exempt the Federal judiciary from the line-item \nveto. Unless this amendment is adopted, the vast majority of the \njudiciary's appropriations would be subject to a line-item veto by the \nPresident. Only the salaries of article II and bankruptcy judges and \nretirement-related programs would be excluded.\n  If the Founders were concerned enough about the independence of the \nFederal judiciary to prohibit reductions in salary during a judge's \ntenure, we ought now to be extremely cautious about giving the \nexecutive branch the power to exert pressure on the judicial branch by \nthe withholding funds for necessary judicial staff salaries, equipment \nor communications, for example. Of course, I am not asserting that this \nPresident, or any President, would use the line-item veto authority \ngranted by this bill to exert such improper pressure, but the fact is \nthat the power to do so would exist under this bill. We should keep in \nmind that the Executive branch always has more lawsuits pending in the \nFederal courts than any other litigant.\n  Since 1939 the Budget and Accounting Act has provided that requests \nfor appropriations for the judicial branch shall be submitted to the \nPresident and transmitted by him to Congress ``without change'' [31 USC \n1105 (b)]. This legislation was adopted because of the inevitable \nconflicts that arose in having the Department of Justice cut funds \nrequested by the judiciary before the judicial budget was submitted to \nCongress. That legislation is still in effect. It seems anomalous to \nprohibit the executive branch from changing the judiciary's budget \nprior to submission to Congress, but then to give the President \nunilateral authority to revise an enacted budget.\n  Does this mean that if our amendment is adopted the Judiciary gets a \nfree ride to spend as much as it likes? Of course not. The judicial \nbudget would still be subject to congressional approval and \nPresidential veto, just as it is now. Moreover, it should be noted that \nthe judiciary's budget does not include funding for courthouse \nconstruction. Budget requests and appropriations for building \nconstruction are within the province of the executive branch and the \nCongress, and are not affected by our amendment since the judiciary has \nno role in the funding of such construction.\n  For all these reasons, this amendment makes a great deal of sense. It \nis the prudent and responsible thing to do, and I urge its adoption.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the amendment by Mr. Hatch reads as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 21, after ``separately'' insert ``except \n     for items of appropriation provided for the judicial branch, \n     which shall be enrolled together in a single measure. For \n     purposes of this paragraph, the terms `items of appropriation \n     provided for the judicial branch' means only those functions \n     and expenditures that are currently included in the \n     appropriations accounts of the judiciary, as those accounts \n     are listed and described in the Department of Commerce, \n     Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Appropriations \n     Act.''\n\n  [[Page S4437]] May I ask the very distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, the author of this amendment, why are we seeking \nto exempt the judiciary from the four corners of the measure that has \nbeen introduced by Mr. Dole as a substitute for S. 4?\n  Why do we seek to exempt the judiciary from the reaches, from the \nrequirements of the substitute? Why should the judiciary be exempted? I \nknow these are questions that not many Senators are very likely to come \nto the floor and ask, but I think they should be asked. I would like to \nhave the distinguished Senator's response to that question.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think it is a good question. Of course, keep in mind \nthat the judiciary is one of the three separated powers in our \nConstitution. The executive branch of Government has plenty of power \nunder this amendment to veto the line items. The legislative branch has \nthe power to send the appropriations bills and other bills to the \nexecutive branch in and of its own; if items are vetoed, the \nlegislative branch can defend itself by, of course, overriding that \nveto. The judicial branch, however, has no power under the line-item \nveto in comparison with the other two.\n  Without a judicial branch exception to separate enrollment, the \njudiciary is more vulnerable than the other two co-equal branches of \nGovernment.\n  Under the line-item veto, the judiciary could be highly vulnerable to \ntargeted budget cuts if its budget were subject to separate enrollment. \nCongress, as I have said, can protect itself from such use of the line-\nitem veto through the legislative process in overriding a Presidential \nveto. The judiciary, however, does not have the means to protect \nitself.\n  In order to preserve the judiciary's place as a coequal branch of \nGovernment, the appropriations items in the judiciary's budget should \nbe excluded from separate enrollment and should instead be enrolled as \na separate measure.\n  Let me just say this. The exception that we are asking for--and I am \na supporter of the line-item veto measure before this body--the \nexception I am asking for would cover all salaries and expenses related \nto the operation and administration of the Federal courts. It would not \nextend to courthouse construction, which does not appear in the \njudiciary's budget, and which would remain subject to the line-item \nveto.\n  Under my amendment, if any of the covered items appeared in an \nappropriations measure, those items would be enrolled together into a \nsingle measure.\n  We feel we have carefully crafted the amendment to avoid creating \nloopholes through which other expenses could be shielded from the line-\nitem veto. A budgetary item would only qualify for exemption from \nseparate enrollment if it is for one of the functions of the judiciary \nas those are listed and described in the current appropriations act.\n  Thus, Congress could not seek to hide an item from a line-item veto \nby slipping it into the judiciary's budget. We feel this is an \nappropriate thing to do since the judicial branch of Government is a \nco-equal, separate branch of Government and is supposed to be kept out \nof politics.\n  If, for instance, we allow line-item vetoes on salaries and the \nadministration of the courts, then it seems to me almost impossible to \nkeep the judges out of politics. That is not the direction we want to \ngo.\n And, frankly, I think this an appropriate amendment under those \ncircumstances.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, Mr. President, I certainly respect the views of the \ndistinguished Senator in this area, as well as in all other areas. I \nhave had a long and cordial association with the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah that extends over a period of many years. I sat on the \nJudiciary Committee at one time with the Senator, and he is a very \ndistinguished chairman of that committee.\n  But here we are, we are purporting to send to the President \nlegislation that will allow the President to veto any one, or more, of \nthe hundreds, perhaps even thousands of minibills--or ``billettes,'' as \nI prefer to call them--which will flood the President's desk as a \nresult of the requirements of this substitute by Mr. Dole.\n  It seems to me that all of the branches of Government should be \ngoverned equally in the enrollment of ``billettes,'' thus giving the \nPresident an opportunity, if he thinks there should be reduced \nexpenditures in any of the accounts, with respect to any of the items, \nallocations, suballocation sections or paragraphs. It seems to me that \nthe taxpayers would expect to be fully protected with reference to all \nthree branches of Government and not just two, not just the executive \nbranch and the legislative branch.\n  For all practical purposes, I would imagine that the President, in \nline-iteming the ``billettes,'' will probably not be very severe with \nrespect to items that are in the executive branch. If the judicial \nbranch is to be exempted, then it further seems to me that the \nlegislative branch is the one branch of the three that is going to feel \nthe fall of the scimitar, the fall of the ax. It is going to be the \nobject of the wet veto pen of a President.\n  So while I realize that most Senators, maybe all except one, will \nvote for this amendment--I start out by presuming that I will be the \nonly Senator that will vote against it. I presume all of the other \nSenators will vote for it. But that does not trouble me in the least. I \nhave been in that situation before. I cannot believe that justice is \nbeing done in relation to this hurriedly written substitute, which was \napparently cut and pasted together over the spread of a few hours, \nbrought in here, laid down on Monday of this week, and upon which \nimmediately was trained the cloture-motion gun. I cannot believe that \njustice is really being done with this piece of legislation on such \nshort notice and under such limitations of the time.\n  I agree with the Senator and recognize what he says with respect to \nthe independence of the judiciary. I fully agree with the need for the \njudiciary to be independent. I do not quarrel with that at all. The \nconstitutional Framers thought likewise, and rightly and wisely. There \nis nothing we can do with regard to the salaries of judges. Under the \nConstitution, they cannot be reduced. And I call attention to history \nin this regard, which is anathema, apparently, to a good many Members \nof the legislative branch. I am not just restricting my statement to \nthis House. But history is something that, if we read it all, it must \nbe a revisionist history. It cannot be the history that I studied. It \ncannot be Muzzey's history, because that history is not politically \ncorrect. Muzzey. The very first sentence of Muzzey says: ``America is \nthe child of Europe,'' or something to that effect. Of course, that is \npolitically incorrect today to say that. But inasmuch as you cannot \nteach an old dog new tricks, I still believe in Muzzey.\n  I studied Muzzey by the old kerosene lamp back in the hills of West \nVirginia, Mercer County. I memorized my history lessons at night by the \nlight of that old kerosene lamp. So I remember that the Founding \nFathers decided that the judiciary should be independent, and they were \npreeminently correct in that they had studied history also, and they, I \nam sure, noted that in the English Bill of Rights--which started, may I \nsay to the distinguished Senator from Alabama [Mr. Heflin], the English \nDeclaration of Rights became the English Bill of Rights in 1689. In \nthat English Declaration of Rights, there were certain provisions to \nwhich William III of Orange and Mary II had to agree before Parliament \nwould make them joint sovereigns. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine \nParliament saying to these two eminent personages, ``You will have to \nagree to this Declaration of Rights before we, the Members of \nParliament, will enthrone you. Before we will put that crown on your \nheads, you will have to agree with these provisions, one of which is \nthat judges shall enjoy life tenure. They cannot be derobed or \ndefrocked or lose their capacity as judges just by the whim and fancy \nof the king. They are there on their good behavior.'' So William and \nMary agreed to the provisions that were laid out in that Declaration of \nRights.\n  Another provision in the Declaration of Rights was that the Members \nof Parliament had the right of speech, right to free speech. They could \nnot be questioned in any other place. We have the same provisions in \nour own Constitution to protect us, the Members of the U.S. Senate. We \ncan say whatever we want on this floor. I can criticize the \n[[Page S4438]]  President of the United States, and there is not a \nthing he can do about what I say. There is not a thing anybody else can \ndo about it. I have the right of freedom of speech right here on this \nfloor, and I have no compunction with criticizing, in a constructive \nway, a king, a shah, a prince, or a President.\n Those are rights that were won for Englishmen, by Englishmen over a \nperiod of centuries.\n\n  That is one of the things I am concerned about in the so-called line-\nitem veto. This is not a line-item veto. One of the things that \nconcerned me about the line-item veto is the fact that a President \nmight be able to cower a Member of the Congress, and cause that Member \nto be inhibited from voicing criticism of the President for fear that a \nproject or program affecting the Member's State or the Member's \ndistrict--talking about a Member of the other body--would be \njeopardized if that Member were to speak critically of the President.\n  So to that extent, it is not a measurable extent, but to that extent, \na Member may be to some extent inhibited from exercising his freedom of \nspeech. So these are just a few of the things that I call attention to \nthat have been derived from the English Bill of Rights, the English \nconstitution.\n  The English constitution is an unwritten constitution except that it \nis composed of various documents, the Magna Carta, the Petition of \nRight, Declaration of Rights, other important documents, statutes, \ncourt cases, customs, traditions, and so on. All these things go up to \nmake the English constitution, the British constitution.\n  I am sure such a law would not be constitutional, but I would like to \nsee a law that would place a requirement on every Member of the Senate \nand the House of Representatives to study American history and to study \nthe history of England. Why? Because not only was England the mother \ncountry of our early forebears for the most part--Benjamin Franklin's \nfather was an immigrant from England; Robert Morris, the financier of \nthe Revolution was from England; and James Wilson, one of the delegates \nof the Convention on the Constitution from Pennsylvania, was born in \nScotland.\n  What I am saying is that every Member of this body ought to have a \ngreater appreciation of the American Constitution. He should note the \nphrases and the clauses that are in the American Constitution that have \ntheir roots deeply embedded in the soil of the English constitution. \nMany of those rights were gained by Englishmen after centuries of \nstruggle. Many of them were won at the top of the sword.\n  So I will save any filibuster on this matter until later, if I am \nforced to. If I should be forced to have to filibuster, I think most \nMembers recognize by now that I would not have to carry a bundle of \nnotes to the floor. As long as my poor old feet that have been carrying \nme around now for more than 77 years are able to stand on this soft \nlanding, but I recognize and fully support the independence of the \njudiciary.\n  I hope that the author of the amendment has not grown tired already \nof what is just the beginning of what I want to say, and asks about \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. President, I was going to ask the distinguished Senator what is \nmeant by the words ``currently included.'' I will read the sentence \nagain: ``For purposes of this paragraph, the term items of \nappropriations provided for the judicial branch, means only those \nfunctions and expenditures that are currently included in the \nappropriations accounts and the Judiciary. . .''\n  ``Currently included,'' only those that are currently included in the \nappropriations accounts of the judiciary as those accounts are listed \nand described in the Department of Commerce, Justice, and State, the \njudiciary and related agencies of the appropriations act.\n  I promise the distinguished Senator I will repress my appetite for \nlaunching into the vast realms of history during the remainder of my \ndiscussion of this amendment. What is meant by those words ``For \npurposes of this paragraph, the term items of appropriations provide \nfor the judicial branch means only those functions and expenditures \nthat are currently included in the appropriations accounts of the \njudiciary.''\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, my distinguished colleague is as \nknowledgeable as anybody on the history of this body with respect to \nappropriations.\n  Of course, he is currently the ranking member of that committee and \nhe has chaired that committee. He knows what we are trying to do with \nthat language. We are trying to define the exemption so that this will \nnot become a loophole through which Congress could avoid a Presidential \nveto.\n  As I have explained, we believe that the judiciary, which is a truly \nseparated power and a co-equal branch of Government, has no real power \nunless it starts to politicize itself. I think that is what would \nhappen if this amendment is not adopted and the line-item veto passes. \nIf we do not give some protection here, we will politicize the \njudiciary.\n  I think we need to have this protection. What this amendment does is \ntake the vulnerable judicial branch, which is a small percentage of the \nbudget, and exclude it from separate enrollment. We exclude it in \naccordance with the language in this amendment, with reference to \nappropriations for the judiciary as listed and described in the \nDepartment of Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary and related \nagencies Appropriations Act of 1995.\n  We define it in that way so that we limit it so that there are no \nloopholes. We think it is a crucial matter. It is critical to do this \nbecause it is such a small part of the budget yet so easily politically \nmanipulable. I do not want the courts manipulated, not by the \nPresidents, not by the Congress, not by anybody.\n  Mr. BYRD. But the Senator has not answered my question. What do the \nwords ``currently included in the appropriations accounts'' mean? What \nabout new functions?\n  Mr. HATCH. They would not be covered.\n  Mr. BYRD. New functions would not be covered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Just the ones currently covered. We want to have a \ndefinition in time, so if we are going to add features, they would not \nbe covered. They could be enrolled as a separate item.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let us take a look at what those current items are, what we \nare talking about.\n  Mr. HATCH. Maybe I could--will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I would like to point out an error that appears to me \nimmediately.\n  Mr. HATCH. OK.\n  Mr. BYRD. Which again--which again is indicative of the hurry in \nwhich this substitute was put together.\n  The Senator's amendment refers to Public Law 104-317. It refers to \nthe Department of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act.\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree with the Senator. It ought to be 103.\n  Mr. BYRD. It has the wrong citation here.\n  Mr. HATCH. It ought to be 103-317.\n  Mr. BYRD. Error. Instead of Public Law 104-317, it is 103-317.\n  That is a minor error. But just think of the thousands of errors that \nwill be committed in the name of the enrolling clerk of the originating \nbody once this monstrosity becomes law. That is just a small error. \nThat can be cured easily by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is a technical error. I think that can be easily \nremedied.\n  But let me just say this----\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the Senator like right now by unanimous consent to \ncure that error?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes. I ask unanimous consent it be cured at this time and \nit be modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 407), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 21, after ``separately'' insert ``, except \n     for items of appropriation provided for the judicial branch, \n     which shall be enrolled together in a single measure. For \n     purposes of this paragraph, the term `items of appropriation \n     provided for the judicial branch' means only those functions \n     and expenditures that are currently included in the \n     appropriations accounts of the judiciary, as those accounts \n     are listed and described in the Department of Commerce, \n     Justice and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 1995 (Public Law 103-317)''.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, if I could, with the forbearance of my \ncolleague \n[[Page S4439]]  from West Virginia--he asked the question what really \nis covered here. Let me just cover it briefly.\n  The judiciary's budget is broken up into a number of sections and \nsubsections. In the Judiciary Appropriations Act for 1995, the current \nact that is being referenced in the amendment--those accounts are, 1995 \namounts, as follows:\n  First, Supreme Court of the United States. The 1995 appropriation is \n$27 million, which is almost a minuscule amount when you look at the \ntotal Federal budget of the United States.\n  Second, Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Their appropriation \nis $13 million.\n  Third, the U.S. Court of International Trade's appropriation is $12 \nmillion.\n  Fourth, the courts of appeals, the district courts, and the other \njudicial services. This account covers the salaries and expenses of all \nFederal district courts, courts of appeals, and bankruptcy judges. This \naccount also includes subaccounts for defender services, fees of jurors \nand commissioners, and court security. Salaries and expenses equals \n$2.340 billion; fees of jurors and commissioners equals $59 million; \ncourt security equals $97 million; defender services equals $250 \nmillion.\n  Fifth, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts' appropriation is \n$48 million.\n  Sixth, the Federal Judicial Center's appropriation is $19 million.\n  Seventh, the judicial retirement funds are $28 million.\n  Eighth, the U.S. Sentencing Commission's appropriation is $9 million.\n  This amendment only involves the judiciary's total 1995 budget, which \nis $2.9 billion. That is two-tenths of 1 percent of the Federal budget.\n  I would like my colleagues to note the salaries and retirement \nexpenses for article III Federal judges are constitutionally mandated \nexpenses.\n  The question might be, why should the exception be linked to today's \njudicial expenditures? What if there are technological changes or \nsubstantial changes in the organization of the courts? Could that not \nmean in the future some central judicial functions would be left out?\n  If I interpret the question of the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, it is along those lines. I would respond this way: The \njudicial expenses included today are broad enough that they should \ncover most technological advances that might have an impact on the \ncourts and court support services. As for any fundamental \norganizational changes in the courts, I agree that certain changes \nmight in fact be so fundamental that they would be left out. If that is \nthe case, however, the definition of the excepted judicial expenses for \npurposes of separate enrollment could be amended by statute to \naccommodate any fundamental changes.\n  I do not foresee that as being likely, however, since most changes in \ncourt organization and operation would involve the types of services \nthat are currently embodied in the appropriations process.\n  Again, I commend the distinguished Senator from West Virginia and the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon and other members of the \nAppropriations Committee for handling these matters as well as they \nhave.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  What about these items that are in the Department of Commerce, \nJustice and State, Judiciary and Related Agencies, 1995 Appropriations, \nand 1994 Supplemental Appropriations? What about such items as these:\n\n       $2,340,127,000 (including the purchase of firearms and \n     ammunition); of which not to exceed $14,454,000 shall remain \n     available until expended for space alteration projects; of \n     which not to exceed $11 million shall remain available until \n     expended for furniture and furnishings related to new space \n     alterations and construction projects; and of which $500,000 \n     is to remain available until expended for acquisition of \n     books, periodicals, and newspapers, and all other legal \n     reference materials, including subscriptions.\n\n  Mr. President, we are talking about chicken feed here, I realize \nthat. But we are also talking about taxpayers' money. We are going to \nsend to the President thousands of little billettes every year, any one \nof which he may line-item out. He can veto it. Any one of the \nlegislative branch's items he can strike.\n  Under the amendment of the distinguished Senator, as far as the \njudicial branch is concerned, everything is to be in one package. That \npackage is not to be broken down. The enrolling clerk can go out and \ntake a walk. He gets a rest. When he comes to that item he will not \nhave to worry about breaking those out and enrolling those several \nlittle billettes.\n  But to the taxpayer, $11 million is $11 million. The President might \nfeel he ought to save some money and the judicial branch should not be \nexempt. Money is tight. We have a $5 trillion debt. The interest on the \ndebt is running over $200 billion a year. The President may feel--and \nperhaps with good reason--that some of those items ought to be \nquestioned. He may feel they ought to be reduced. There is $11 million \nthat\n\n       . . . shall remain available until expended for furniture \n     and furnishings related to new space alterations and \n     construction projects;\n      and of which $500,000 is to remain available until . . . all \n     other legal reference materials, including subscriptions.\n\n  I realize that the judges have to continue to read books, \nperiodicals, and newspapers, and there may need to be some space \nalterations, and so on. But the President may feel that this is too \nmuch money.\n  Why should he not have the same authority and rights to scrutinize \nthe budget for the judicial branch and question those items, and even \nstrike them out? He could strike them out. If Congress does not want to \noverride the veto, or if it cannot, it could pass a new bill. Instead \nof providing $11 million, it might provide half of that.\n  So the Senator's amendment, it seems to me, would let the judiciary \ngo scot-free with no questions asked. The judicial branch is to be a \npreferential branch. The fact is that it is to be an independent \nbranch. There is no reason why it should be a preferential branch when \nit comes to the line-item veto. It is a preferential branch under the \nConstitution by virtue of the fact that the salaries, title III judges' \nsalaries, cannot be cut.\n  How many Senators are aware of that? How many Senators are aware that \nwhen judges retire, they retire at full salary? How many Senators are \naware that judges do not pay one thin dime into their retirement--not \n10 cents, not one copper penny, not one Indian head penny do the judges \npay into their retirement. When they retire, they get full pay.\n  President Nixon talked once upon a time about nominating me to the \nSupreme Court of the United States. I was flattered by his \nconsideration. That may be one reason why President Nixon is my \nfavorite Republican President during my lifetime. But I decided that \nwas not the place for me. But, gee whiz. I would not have to pay \nanything into the retirement. I could retire at full pay. I would not \nhave to run in any election. I would not have to worry about those 30-\nsecond ads, would not have to raise any money for elections, would not \nhave to purchase the services of consultants, and would not have to \nundergo the negative ads. I sometimes wonder if I did not make a \nmistake. No, I did not make a mistake. I like the legislative arena. I \ndo not like to be quite that independent. I do not want to be quite \nthat independent.\n  That is not said in derogation of the judges. We have to have them. \nThey have to be independent. But we are talking about a matter here \nthat goes to the heart of the legislative power of the purse. We are \ngoing to some extent to shift the power over the purse from the \nlegislative branch, where it has been reposed for 206 years, since the \nbeginning of this Republic, we are going to expand the powers of the \nPresident and, of course, we do not operate in a vacuum when we expand \nthe power of the President. In this sense, we are going to lessen the \npowers of the legislative branch.\n  Looking further, under ``defender services.''\n\n       . . . provided that not to exceed $19.8 million shall be \n     available for Death Penalty Resource Centers.\n\n  I do not know. Who am I to say that every President, Republican or \nDemocrat, is going to be in favor of Death Penalty Resource Centers? \nDoes that have anything to do with the independence of judges? Does \nthat have anything to do with the independence of judges? Death Penalty \nResource Centers? Suppose the President wants to whack that $19.8 \nmillion. That is not \n[[Page S4440]]  going to interfere with the independence of the judges, \nis it?\n  Let the Record show that there is no answer, no response.\n  Let us go down to the Administrative Office of the United States \nCourts. There we find advertising and rent in the District of Columbia \nand elsewhere, $47.5 million, of which not to exceed $7,500 is \nauthorized for ``official reception and representation expenses.''\n  What is that? What is meant by ``official reception and \nrepresentation expenses''? Does that mean we can spend money on \nthrowing a party, treating people to a few cocktails?\n  I cannot believe that if the President wanted to cut that item, that \nhe would be impairing the independence of judges. What about those \npeople up there in the hills of West Virginia, who help to pay the \ntaxes? I believe they would say, ``Well, we are going to have this so-\ncalled line-item veto; why should we exempt moneys for official \nreceptions and representation expenses in the judiciary, or in the \nlegislative account, or in the executive branch? Why should that be \nexempted?''\n  Then there is the Federal Judicial Center. I see under ``General \nProvisions, the Judiciary,'' section 304:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the salaries \n     and expenses and appropriations for district courts, courts \n     of appeals, and other judicial services shall be available \n     for official reception and representation expenses.\n\n  Here is another of the same item, ``Official reception and \nrepresentation expenses'' of the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates, provided that such available funds shall not exceed $10,000.\n  Well, $10,000 is $10,000, whether it is in the judicial branch or \nwhether it is in the legislative branch; $10,000. You cannot brush that \naside with a wink and a nod. That is $10,000. That is more than some \npeople earn in a year in this country. Yet, under the amendment offered \nby the distinguished Senator from Utah, the President cannot touch \nthat. The President cannot touch that item because it is in the \njudicial branch.\n  Why should we give this kind of preferential treatment to the \njudicial branch in a line-item veto bill? For one thing, it is not a \nline-item veto. But we will be truly approving exempting one of the \nthree branches of Government. That has nothing to do with the \nindependence of judges.\n  I have as much respect for the members of the judicial branch of the \nGovernment as anybody else does here. I have some very, very good \nfriends. As a matter of fact, Mr. Nixon appointed one of my very best \nfriends to be a Federal district judge. That is another reason I liked \nMr. Nixon. He was a Republican President who nominated a Democratic \njudge, and he has been a good judge, an excellent judge. He is now on \nthe circuit court of appeals. I have other friends.\n  I am not out to whack the judges. But I want to see justice done. \nJustice--that is what the judicial system is all about; rendering of \njustice. So why not do justice to the taxpayers in making subject to \nthe wet veto pen, the wet and ready veto pen of the President of the \nUnited States, when we send all of this multitude of little orphan \nbillettes down to President of the United States?\n  I suppose my questions are being viewed as rhetorical questions, \nbecause I hear no answers.\n  Let me ask the distinguished Senator from Utah a question that cannot \nbe viewed as a rhetorical question.\n  In section 303 of Public Law 103-317 there is a provision that reads \nas follows:\n\n       Not to exceed 5 percent of any appropriation made available \n     for the current fiscal year for the Judiciary in this Act may \n     be transferred between such appropriations, but no such \n     appropriation, except as otherwise specifically provided, \n     shall be increased by more than 10 percent by any such \n     transfers.\n\n  What will happen to that provision in section 303? Does this mean \nthat the judiciary would be the only branch that would still have the \nbenefit of reprogramming authority? As Senator Nunn stated this morning \nand on yesterday and as I stated a few days ago our concerns with \nrespect to reprogramming and how there can no longer be reprogramming \ndone, if the substitute amendment becomes law, there cannot be any more \nreprogramming. If agencies get stuck with the need to reprogram moneys, \nthey will just have to come back to the Congress and there will have to \nbe a new law passed.\n  But now what about this provision here that gives the judiciary the \nauthority to transfer--not to exceed 5 percent of any appropriation \nmade available for the current fiscal year for the judiciary in this \nact may be transferred between such appropriations?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the distinguished Senator from West Virginia yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I was just going to say, as I see it, as I understand the \namendment by Mr. Hatch--then I will yield-- as I understand the \namendment by Mr. Hatch, the judiciary is going to be exempt from the \nclaws and clutches and jaws and teeth of this substitute. And if it is \nthus exempt, are we to understand that the judiciary would be able to \ncontinue to reprogram, it would be able to continue to make transfers \nbetween appropriations? Am I correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. If the future appropriations bills have section similar to \nsection 303 in them, it would work the same way as it will in fiscal \nyear 1995.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the distinguished Senator yield for just one \nquestion?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I promised to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have had several requests from my colleagues who are \ninterested in what the legislative schedule is going to be. Does the \nSenator by chance have an estimate as to how much longer he is going to \nbe with the Senator from Utah on this issue? I am not trying to in any \nway curtail the Senator's in-depth discussion, but I would just \nwondered if he had any estimate on it?\n  Mr. BYRD. I do not have any estimate on the time. I certainly do not \nintend to take all afternoon on this one item. I am just curious as to \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. I assure the Senator I will not be long.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. As a matter of fact, I have already asked enough questions \nto indicate that we cannot expect full justice, we cannot expect equal \ntreatment under the law among the various branches of the Government if \nthe amendment by Mr. Hatch is agreed to here.\n  Let's see now. Where was I? Back on section 303.\n  So what we are saying then, if I may ask the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah, with respect to the Department of Defense, with respect to \nthe Department of Justice, with respect to the FBI, with respect to any \nof these other departments, while they will not be allowed to transfer \nmoneys from one account to another, while they will not be allowed to \nreprogram, they will no longer be allowed to come to the Congress, to \nthe chairmen of the Appropriations and Armed Services Committees and \nthe ranking members and ask permission to reprogram certain moneys, the \nJustice Department can go on its merry way and continue--the judiciary, \nnot the Department of Justice. I am sorry about the Department of \nJustice. It will not be able to do that. The crime fighting \ndepartments, the FBI, and so on, will not be able to transfer between \nappropriations that are made available. Yet, the judiciary can go on \nits merry way--the judiciary, not the Justice Department, the judiciary \nwill be able to continue to transfer between appropriations.\n  Mr. HATCH. As long as future bills have this provision in them, that \nis true. We have the right as a Congress to not give them that power. \nIn other words, the full judiciary, a little over $2 billion--two-\ntenths of 1 percent of the total Federal budget --will be subject to \ncongressional review every year. If Congress decides, as it did in this \nparticular instance, in Public Law 103-317, to have a section 303, then \nit can. But if Congress decides not to have a section 303, Congress has \nthe power to stop the judiciary from having that right that is defined \nin section 303.\n  Mr. BYRD. Do I hear the distinguished Senator saying that \nnotwithstanding the passage of the Dole substitute, notwithstanding it \nis agreed to in conference, if it is, notwithstanding that the \nconference reports go down to the President untrammeled, unchanged, \nunblemished, and unstained, that Congress can come along next year \nwithout the Senator's amendment--could Congress then next year write \ninto the appropriations act, the \n[[Page S4441]]  act making appropriations for the judiciary, could \nCongress write into that act next year section 303 that not to exceed 5 \npercent of any appropriations made available may be transferred--\nnotwithstanding that the Dole substitute becomes the law of the land, \ncan Congress thwart that act next year by writing into the \nappropriations for the judiciary this language that allows the \njudiciary to transfer moneys?\n  Mr. HATCH. It is my understanding Congress can do whatever it wants \nto. All the rest of the provisions would be subject to the line-item \nveto except for the judiciary's budget as we have defined it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Then if Congress can do that in the case of the judiciary, \nnext year under the influence of Senator Nunn and Senator Stevens, \nSenator Inouye, Senators who are most knowledgeable with respect to \ndefense appropriations and needs of the country, Congress can come \nalong next year and write into the appropriations for the Department of \nDefense language that will allow the Department of Defense to continue \nto reprogram as in the past?\n  Mr. HATCH. Not as in the past. If the President has the veto, the \nPresident has a right to veto or not to veto. Congress can do pretty \nwell what it wants to.\n  Mr. BYRD. So the President could veto?\n  Mr. HATCH. The President could veto.\n  Mr. BYRD. Could the President veto a congressional approval of \ntransfer of authority?\n  Mr. HATCH. As in section 303?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. The President could veto that by vetoing the complete \njudicial appropriations bill. He would have to veto the whole bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. He would have to veto the whole bill?\n  Mr. HATCH. He could not line item that one.\n  Mr. BYRD. He could not?\n  Mr. HATCH. Not under my amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. He could not line item that one item out?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right. If the Congress chooses to put it in there, \nthen, under my amendment as I have crafted it, if Congress chooses to \ndo that, then the President could not line item it out. The only way he \ncould get it out would be to veto the whole bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Could he do the same with respect to the defense \nappropriations bill?\n  Mr. HATCH. He could line item out any provision.\n  Mr. BYRD. He could line item any provision out of that one?\n  Mr. HATCH. Right.\n  Mr. BYRD. But he could not line item any provision out of \nappropriations for the judiciary?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct.\n  But if he line items the defense appropriations bill, Congress is \nhere to protect defense appropriations.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  (Mr. GREGG assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HATCH. If he line items a provision, a small, obscure provision \nin the judiciary, a coequal branch of Government that has no real \nability to defend itself, Congress may not feel the need to do so. And \nif that is so, the judiciary could suffer some crippling line-item \nvetoes if we get a President who acts officiously, or who is mad at the \njudiciary for one reason or another, or who wants to give them a rough \ntime. There would not be the same lack of vulnerability that, say, the \nDefense Department would have.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am not sure the Senator and I are talking on the same \nwave length. I think he is talking with respect to his amendment, if \nhis amendment is agreed to. But I am asking a question notwithstanding \nhis amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. If my amendment is not agreed to, then the President would \nhave the right to line item any aspect of the judiciary as well.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Which I think would be very detrimental to the judicial \nsystem of this country.\n  Mr. BYRD. Congress is responsible for the appropriations for the \njudiciary, as well.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator would yield, as much as I respect the \nDepartment of Defense, it is not a co-equal branch of Government. The \njudiciary is. We are trying to keep the judiciary less political than \nthe other two branches. That is the reason I would like to have this \nprotection. It is a very small part of the appropriations process.\n  And if a President feels strongly about some aspect of the judiciary, \nthe President can veto the whole judiciary bill. But at that point I \nthink Congress will come back and defend the judicial system.\n  Mr. BYRD. Why does the Senator not include in his amendment the \nJustice Department? Why does he not include the law enforcement arm? \nWhy does he not include the FBI? Why does he just single out the \njudicial branch?\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will let me answer, I believe the reason we \nhave not done that is because we believe that the executive branch of \nGovernment is very capable of defending itself.\n  Those branches are not the judicial branch, which is supposed to be \nthe least political branch of Government. I believe we ought to keep \nthe judiciary as separate, as distinct, and as apolitical as we \npossibly can.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, I respect the Senator's viewpoint. I share with him \nthe belief in the need for complete independence on the part of judges. \nBut I cannot understand how, in protecting that independence, we need \nto protect items such as furniture, recreation, moneys for travel, \nlimousine service. Such items are subject to the veto pen of the \nPresident when it comes to the legislative branch and when it comes to \nthe executive branch, so he is going to look twice or three times \nbefore he vetoes something that pertains to the White House or certain \nother areas of the legislative branch.\n  The legislative branch appropriations is less than the appropriation \nfor the judiciary, is it not?\n  Mr. HATCH. I think that is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I believe the Senator said the appropriation for the \njudiciary is $2.9 billion?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, $2.9 billion.\n  Mr. BYRD. And he spoke of that as a rather small amount, not exactly \ntrivial, but a small amount. Yet, for the legislative branch, I am \nadvised, the total is $2.3 billion.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, I do not think anybody in his or her right mind \nbelieves that the legislative branch would not fight with all of its \npower to sustain its own branch of Government. But who fights for the \njudiciary if the judiciary branch has been treated unfairly by the \nPresident for some political reason? I am hopeful that no President \nwould be that way, but we have all seen some pretty petty things in \nthis town.\n  I just want to make sure that this very small, coequal branch of \nGovernment--which is small but is important as the least political \nbranch of Government--is kept that way.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I cannot think of any Senator who has \nmerited the Purple Heart for standing up for the legislative branch in \nrecent years. As a matter of fact, it has been pretty much open season \non the legislative branch around here. We enjoy self-flagellation, \nnicking our skins, cutting our throats.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for his patience and his responses. \nHe is sincere, he is conscientious, and he believes in what he is \nsaying and what he is doing.\n  I happen to be one who believes that we should not give the judicial \nbranch this kind of preferential recognition in a bill of this kind. We \nare talking about a so-called line-item veto in which the items in the \nlegislative appropriations bill would be subjected to the scrutiny of \nthe Chief Executive.\n  There is no reason that is contained within the four corners of the \nlegislation, no reason, there is nothing in there that will keep the \nPresident from lining out items in the legislative appropriation. He \nwill have that right. He can line them out. True, Congress may, if it \never returns to its senses, develop the courage to override one of \nthose vetoes by the President. But it has been pretty much bereft of \nreason in late years and I doubt that it would have the collective guts \nto muster two-thirds vote.\n  [[Page S4442]] I think that the judicial branch should undergo the \nsame scrutiny as any other branch.\n  Mr. BROWN. Will the distinguished Senator from West Virginia yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes; I am about ready to yield the floor, but I am glad to \nyield.\n  Mr. BROWN. I do not mean to interrupt the distinguished Senator. My \nhope was to take 2 or 3 minutes to explain the new NATO Participation \nAct. I was wondering if there would be a point that the Senator might \nyield for me to do that. I do not wish to interrupt his flow of \nthoughts on this subject matter.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will not detain the Senator.\n  I did want to make one other point,\n   and that is that the amendment by Mr. Hatch not only puts the \njudiciary in a preferential position, it also provides the loophole \nagainst the requirement that every appropriation account be divided \ninto separate bills, including items in the accompanying report.\n\n  Let us take courthouses, for example. Ordinarily, I believe, they are \nincluded in the Treasury-Postal bill. They are included in the \nTreasury-Postal appropriations bill, and under the so-called line-item \nveto legislation that the Senate will be voting on, that bill will be \nsubjected to the scrutiny and possible vetoing by the President of \ncertain line items which could include courthouses. There is nothing to \nprotect them.\n  But it seems to me that if the amendment by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah is agreed to, which will protect the judicial branch against \nvetoes of items, it would not take long around here for ingenious minds \nto decide that if so-and-so wants a courthouse to put it into the \njudiciary appropriation, put it in there, because it will be scot-free, \nthere could be no tampering with that, there could be no vetoing of \nitems there.\n  So then that will open up a loophole whereby Senators may get \ncourthouses in their States under the loophole. I would be surprised if \nthat is beyond the reach of the ingenious brains of Members of this \nbody.\n  But this legislation opens up a loophole there. I bet we will start \nseeing Federal courthouses with earmarks showing up under the judiciary \nif this exemption is allowed to create such a loophole.\n  So the judiciary then would be the only part of Government allowed to \nretain reprogramming authority.\n  The Senator has been very patient, if he wishes to respond; if not, I \nwill yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. May I suggest the absence of a quorum for a minute?\n  Mr. BYRD. I will yield for that purpose, yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed as in morning business for 5 minutes concerning the NATO \nParticipation Act Amendments of 1995.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Brown and Mr. Simon pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 602 are located in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am very serious about this amendment. I \nthink it is a correct amendment and a good amendment. I would like to \ngo forward with a vote on it.\n  I have to say that a number of my colleagues have requested that I \nwithdraw the amendment. I ask my dear friend from West Virginia if he \nwould have any objection to my withdrawing the amendment at this time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I think this would be the first time in my \ngoing on 37 years in the U.S. Senate that I would object to withdrawing \nan amendment. I do not like to object to a Senator otherwise having the \nright to withdraw an amendment.\n  In this case, I will object to withdrawing the amendment, and I will \ninsist on a yea and nay vote on the amendment. It is not that I think I \nhave any chance of carrying the amendment. It is not that at all. I do \nnot know whether I will get another vote besides my own. But I think \nthe U.S. Senate ought to be ready and willing to have a showdown as to \nwhether or not we believe there is a special branch of Government that \nis above and beyond the other two and as to whether or not the \nappropriations for that branch ought to be exempt from the scrutiny and \nthe possible veto by a President of certain items in an appropriation \nbill which the President may, with every justification, feel ought to \nbe vetoed.\n  And so I do object to withdrawing the amendment. I apologize to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think the Senator has every right to do so.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I believe the Senator has every right to do so. I am \ndisappointed that he has.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I have joined my colleague Senator Hatch \nof Utah in proposing an amendment to exempt items of appropriations \nprovided for the judicial branch from enrollment in separate bills for \npresentment to the President.\n  The doctrine of separation of powers recognizes the importance of \nprotecting the judicial branch of government against improper \ninterference from the legislative or executive branch. This doctrine is \nrecognized in article III of the Constitution which protects salaries \nof article III judges.\n  Similarly the Budget and Accounting Act provides that requests for \nappropriations for the judicial branch shall be submitted to the \npresident and transmitted by him to Congress without change. Thus it \nwould be inconsistent to prohibit the President from changing the \nbudget of the judicial branch prior to submission to the Congress, but \nthen by the line-item veto legislation to give the President the \nauthority to change the judiciary's appropriation line-by-line.\n  A little history may help explain the basis for our bipartisan \namendment. Congress created the Administrative Office of the U.S. \nCourts in 1939 which now has the responsibility for budget submissions \nthrough the President and on to the Congress. Prior to that time budget \nsubmissions were provided by the Department of Justice, which is an \nexecutive branch agency. During the 1930's, according to testimony \ngiven to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee by Chief Judge \nGilbert Merritt, chairman of the executive committee of the Judicial \nConference of the United States, the Justice Department often rejected \nthe judicial branch's requests for funds, denied requests for new \njudges, cut travel funds, and denied other requests for appropriate \nstaff support.\n  Congress reacted to this situation by creating the Administrative \nOffice of the U.S. Courts and by directing it to submit the budget of \nthe judiciary without change by the executive branch. Congress acted to \nprotect the independence of the judicial branch, and I believe this \nprotection should continue.\n  The protection should continue because often the executive branch of \ngovernment is a litigant, both as plaintiff and defendant, in lawsuits \nin the Federal courts. Subtle or otherwise, the judiciary should be \ninsulated from undue presssure from the executive branch.\n  Further, and most importantly, we are not giving the judicial branch \na blank check for any appropriation it wants. The judiciary's budget \nwill continue to be subjected to full congressional review and \nscrutiny. The judicial branch will still have to appear before the \nAppropriations Committee and defend its budget request, and we in \nCongress can amend or change that request as we deem necessary.\n  I believe that failure to exempt the judicial branch from the \nprovisions of the pending line-item veto legislation will do violence \nto the separation of powers that was established by our Founding \nFathers who wrote the Constitution.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas, the majority leader, \nis recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I happen to believe that we are going to \nhave a \n[[Page S4443]]  line-item veto that will apply to everyone. I listened \nto the arguments of the Senator from West Virginia. I agreed with him \nbefore he made his statement. I have already had a call from a friend \nof mine who is a Federal judge who said, ``Leave us out.'' Why not \nleave somebody else out? This is serious business, in my view, and if \nwe are serious, everything has to be on the table from A to Z, with the \nexception of Social Security. Therefore, I am constrained to move to \ntable the amendment of my colleague from Utah, my good friend--or \nformer good friend--and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Before we vote on the motion, would the majority leader \nallow me to say I had no idea the majority leader was going to support \nmy position on this. If I had known that, I would not have said that in \nall likelihood mine would be the only vote against the amendment. I do \nappreciate it.\n  Mr. DOLE. I hope we have a majority----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not want the Senator to be broken off \nin the middle of a sentence.\n  Mr. DOLE. If my colleague will yield, I think it is pretty hard to \nmake an argument that we ought to exempt the judiciary. I know we have \nseparation of powers, but we are all spending the taxpayers' money.\n  Mr. BYRD. Exactly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, for the second time in less than 1 \nmonth, the Senate is confronted with a proposal to alter our \nconstitutional system in the name of fiscal responsibility. On March 2, \nthe Senate declined to adopt a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. Today, we are considering a proposal which, although not \ndrafted as an amendment to the Constitution, nonetheless has important \nand far-reaching constitutional implications.\n  The separate enrollment bill would have Congress surrender \nfundamental constitutional prerogatives to the Executive. I hope the \nSenate will recognize the constitutional and practical defects of this \nproposal, and I hope we will again have the wisdom to say no.\n  Just as importantly, I would hope the Senate would consider the \npractical consequences of this radical proposal. I would have the \ntemerity to suggest that the White House pay heed as well.\n  In 1986, on the occasion of the bicentennial of the U.S. \nConstitution, I had the honor to deliver a lecture at the Smithsonian \nInstitution entitled, ```The New Science of Politics' and the Old Art \nof Governing.'' I take the liberty of repeating the opening passages.\n\n       Anyone who has studied American government or taken some \n     part in its affairs will often have asked: ``How goes the \n     science of the thing?''\n       As we approach the bicentennial of the Constitution, which \n     is not to say our Independence, but our form of government, \n     leafing through ``The Federalist Papers,'' pondering the \n     unexampled endurance of the Constitutional arrangements put \n     in place in those years, we are reminded of the role the \n     ``new science of politics,'' as the founders liked to call \n     it, played in devising those arrangements.\n       It appears to me that the significance of this bicentennial \n     is predicated on the extent to which the perception is \n     widened that the government of the United States was not \n     fashioned out of ``self-evident truths,'' but rather was the \n     work of scholar-statesmen who had studied hard, learned much, \n     and believed they had come upon some principles--\n     uniformities--in human behavior which made possible the \n     reintroduction of republican government nearly two millennia \n     after Caesar had ended the experiment.\n       We may doubt that the bicentennial discussion will attain \n     to anything like the level of discourse two centuries ago. We \n     are short on Madisons and Hamiltons and Jays. But it is \n     possible to hope that we may acquire a more general \n     understanding of what it was those men were discoursing \n     about. Else all will be lost to fireworks and faith healing.\n       The argument was whether government could be founded on \n     scientific principles; those who said it could be, won.\n       At the risk of reproach from persons more learned than I, \n     let me state in summary the intellectual dilemma of that \n     time. The victors in the Revolution could agree that no one \n     wanted another monarchy in line with the long melancholy \n     succession since Caesar. Yet given what Madison termed ``the \n     fugitive and turbulent existence of * * * ancient \n     republics,'' who could dare to suggest that a modern republic \n     could hope for anything better?\n       Madison could. And why? Because study had produced new \n     knowledge, which could now be put to use. To cite Martin \n     Diamond:\n       ``This great new claim rested upon a new and aggressively \n     more `realistic' idea of human nature. Ancient and medieval \n     thought and practice were said to have failed disastrously by \n     clinging to illusions regarding how men ought to be. Instead, \n     the new science would take man as he actually is, would \n     accept as primary in his nature the self-interestedness and \n     passion displayed by all men everywhere and, precisely on \n     that basis, would work out decent political solutions.''\n       This was a declaration of intellectual independence equal \n     in audacity to anything done in 1776. Until then, with but a \n     few exceptions, the whole of political thought turned on ways \n     to inculcate virtue in a small class that would govern. But, \n     wrote Madison, ``if men were angels, no government would be \n     necessary.'' Alas, we would have to work with the material at \n     hand. Not pretty, but something far more important: \n     predictable. Thus, men could be relied upon to be selfish; \n     nay, rapacious. Very well: ``Ambition must be made to \n     counteract ambition.'' Whereupon we derive the central \n     principle of the Constitution, the various devices which in \n     Madison's formulation, offset ``by opposite and rival \n     interests, the defect of better motives.''\n\n  The lecture thereupon considered the development of what seemed to me \nto be the ``defining failure of the Reagan era * * * that of political \neconomy.'' Specifically, the accumulation in a brief span of a huge \nnational debt, much at variance with any peacetime period in our then \ntwo-century experience. That debt has continued to grow, largely the \nresult of compound interest, and is the presumed motivating factor \nbehind the legislation before us now. Even as it was the concern that \nled to the proposed balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, \nwhich we dealt with recently.\n  In point of fact, that era is behind us. In 1993, the Congress \nenacted the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act which provided for \ndeficit reduction over a 5-year period of some $500 billion--the \nlargest deficit reduction measure in the half-century since the deficit \nwas reduced following the end of World War II. Such was the size of the \nprogram cuts and--yes--tax increases provided in the 1993 legislation \nthat interest \n[[Page S4444]]  rates fell sharply--the so-called deficit premium \ndropping off dramatically. The result was lower debt service and a \ncumulative deficit reduction of near to $600 billion.\n  Citizens who might wonder at this will recall how many individuals, \ntheir neighbors, themselves perhaps, refinanced their mortgages \nfollowing the 1993 legislation and the sharp drop in interest rates. \nThat affected our costs as well--our costs, their costs, the costs of \nGovernment.\n  In consequence of this, Mr. President, we have in fact returned to a \nprimary surplus in this year's budget. A primary surplus or primary \ndeficit is defined as the difference between revenues and outlays for \npurposes other than debt service.\n  I pointed this out on February 8 in the course of the debate on the \nbalanced budget, to wit: Spending on Government programs is less than \ntaxes for the first time since the 1960's.\n  May I repeat that. Spending on Government programs is less than taxes \nfor the first time since the 1960's.\n  Not a bad performance. But how did it come about?\n  Given the critical issue that confronts us, I will be candid with the \nSenate. More, perhaps, than is usual; more, perhaps, than is prudent.\n  In 1993, I was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. The task of \nraising taxes by a quarter of a trillion dollars, and the lion's share \nof an equal amount in spending cuts, thus fell to our committees and to \nits chairman.\n  How did we do it? We did it the way the Framers of the American \nConstitution envisioned. We made accommodations that made up for the \ndefect of better motives.\n  Item. Gasoline and diesel fuel taxes were raised 4.3 cents per \ngallon. Offset. Airlines were given a 2-year exemption from the \nincreased tax. We also took away the tax benefits previously accorded \nexporters of raw timber.\n  Item. The business meal tax deduction was reduced from 80 percent to \n50 percent. Offset. Restaurant owners were given a tax credit for the \nFICA tax they are required to pay on their employees' tips.\n  I could go on at some length. But there must be a point where \nprudence intervenes. I simply make a point known to every experienced \nlegislator in the Congress. Compromise and trade-offs are the key.\n  And now I make the further point. If these exchanges cannot be sealed \nin legislation--all or nothing--the accommodations will be vastly more \ndifficult, if not indeed impossible to reach.\n  The chairman will say to a Senator: ``If you will go along with this \nprovision not much to your liking, we will be able to get you another \nprovision that will in some measure make up for what you legitimately \nconsider a loss.''\n  But what if the other Senator knows that his or her provision will \nend up as a separate item of legislation which could very well be \nvetoed?\n  Answer. There would be no deal.\n  Which is to say, no deficit reduction. Even as we have shown that we \nare capable of deficit reduction, and only have to keep at it for \nanother 5 years or so to erase the legacy of the 1980's.\n  Those are the practical considerations. But now to the constitutional \nones, which are scarcely impractical.\n  The Framers were well aware of the importance of the power of the \npurse, and accordingly made the conscious decision to vest this power \nin the branch of government closest to the people: Congress. In \nFederalist No. 58, James Madison wrote:\n\n       This power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the \n     most complete and effectual weapon with which any \n     constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the \n     people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for \n     carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.\n  According to Madison's notes of the Constitutional Convention of \n1787, Roger Sherman of Connecticut said that:\n\n       In making laws regard should be had to the sense of the \n     people who are bound by them and it is more probable that a \n     single man should mistake or betray this sense than the \n     legislature.\n\n  Thus, article I, section 9 of our Constitution plainly states:\n\n       No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in \n     consequence of appropriations made by law.\n\n  In a brilliant article on the power of the purse in the Georgia Law \nReview in 1986, Judge Abner J. Mikva, then of the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia Circuit, now counsel to President Clinton, \nwrote\n\n       . . . if we wish to live in a pluralistic and free society, \n     we will strive to ensure that Congress retains exclusive \n     control of the nation's purse. Only in that event will the \n     delicate balance of our constitutional structure be \n     preserved.\n\n  I do hope Judge Mikva has not forgotten his paper.\n  The line-item veto legislation before us would disturb--profoundly \ndisturb--that delicate balance. It would have us deviate from the \nexplicit procedures for passage and enactment, or veto, of legislation, \nset forth in detail in article I, section 7, which states:\n\n       Every Bill which shall have passed the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a \n     Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If \n     he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, \n     with his Objections to that House in which it shall have \n     originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their \n     Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such \n     Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass \n     the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to \n     the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, \n     and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become \n     a Law.\n\n  The Supreme Court has referred to this part of article I, section 7 \nas ``a single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure.'' \nThere is nothing ambiguous about it, nor is there any uncertainty about \nwhy the Framers vested the power of the purse in Congress.\n  Why, then, are we now giving serious consideration to measures that \nwould radically alter our constitutional procedures?\n  The line-item veto is not a new idea. President Ulysses S. Grant \nfirst proposed it in 1873. In 1876, Representative Charles James \nFaulkner of West Virginia introduced an amendment to the Constitution \nto provide for a line-item veto. Some 150 line-item veto bills have \nbeen introduced in the interim, but Congress has never seen fit to \nadopt any of them.\n  Today we are told that circumstances, including the failure of the \nbalanced budget amendment, have given the line-item veto a new urgency. \nIt is argued that we need this because congressional spending and the \nnational debt are out of control--precisely the same rationale offered \nby proponents of the balanced budget amendment. And mistaken for the \nsame reasons.\n  We ought to be asking ourselves how and when these deficits were \ncreated, and whether they are permanent features of our governmental \noperations, or merely temporary. After a month of debate on the \nbalanced budget amendment, I would hope the Senate knows the answers to \nthese questions.\n  The point has been made over and over again on this floor by the \nSenator from New York, and by the distinguished Senators from West \nVirginia and Maryland, our revered Senator Robert C. Byrd and Senator \nPaul Sarbanes. Insofar as the national debt is a problem in our fiscal \naffairs, it is a problem that was created--in some measure \nintentionally--during the 1980's, the single decade of the 1980's. I do \nnot wish to belabor this point. The facts have been well documented by \nDavid Stockman, President Reagan's Budget Director, by the journalist \nand historian Haynes Johnson, and others. It ought to be considered \nwell-settled by now. The debt accumulated during the\n Reagan era was an historical anomaly. Again, were it not for the \ninterest on the deficits created during those years, the Federal budget \nwould be in balance today. If we recognize this, we will realize there \nis no need for the legislation before us.\n\n  Even if there were a need for a line-item veto, the separate \nenrollment legislation is surely unconstitutional. It would require the \nenrolling clerks to dismantle bills passed by the House and Senate \nbefore the bills are presented to the President, as provided by the \nConstitution. You do not need to be a constitutional scholar, or even a \nlawyer, to recognize that this procedure would violate the \nConstitution.\n  The presentment clause in article I, section 7 requires ``every Bill \nwhich shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate'' \nto ``be presented to the President'' before it becomes a law. Under \nthis provision of \n[[Page S4445]]  the Constitution, the bill presented to the President \nmust be the same bill passed by Congress--not a series of smaller bills \ncreated by the enrolling clerks, or ``billettes,'' as they have been \ncalled by our learned colleague from West Virginia. The separate \nenrollment proposal would delegate to the House and Senate enrolling \nclerks a legislative function explicitly assigned to Congress by \narticle I: deciding what bills say.\n  The Association of the Bar of the City of New York recently produced \nan exhaustive analysis of the constitutionality of the line-item veto. \nThe association's report was written by David P. Felsher and edited by \nDaniel J. Capra, who is chairman of the association's committee on \nFederal legislation. The report finds that under either ``enhanced \nrescission'' or ``separate enrollment,'' the President would in effect \nbe authorized to restructure legislation after its passage by Congress. \nThis is unconstitutional because it is the province of Congress and \nCongress alone, to determine the contents of bills; the sole power of \nthe President under the article I, section 7 is to sign or veto \nlegislation. According to the association's analysis, ``it is \nirrelevant whether the itemization needed to implement the line-item \nveto is effectuated by the President or the enrollment clerk in \nCongress.''\n  I might add that this opinion is shared by other prominent \nconstitutional scholars, including Prof. Michael J. Gerhardt of Cornell \nLaw School, who has written me to say that the ``separate enrollment'' \nlegislation is unconstitutional because it\n\n       . . . effectively enables the President to make affirmative \n     budgetary choices that the Framers definitely did not want \n     him to make.\n\n  These scholars have concluded that ``separate enrollment'' is \nunconstitutional because the Supreme Court has been scrupulous in \nrequiring strict adherence to the legislative procedures set forth in \nArticle I. In INS versus Chadha in 1983, the Court struck down a \nstatutory provision that permitted one House of Congress to exercise a \n``legislative veto.'' Chief Justice Burger wrote that the requirements \nof article I, and I quote:\n\n       . . . were intended to erect enduring checks on each Branch \n     and to protect the people from the improvident exercise of \n     power by mandating certain prescribed steps. To preserve \n     those checks, and maintain the separation of powers, the \n     carefully defined limits on the power of each Branch must not \n     be eroded.\n\n  And there I end the passage from Chief Justice Burger. Three years \nlater, in Bowsher versus Synar, the Court invalidated the provision in \nthe Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit control law giving the Comptroller \nGeneral of the United States authority to execute spending reductions \nunder the act. The Court held that this violated the separation of \npowers because it vested an executive branch function in a legislative \nbranch official. ``Underlying both\n decisions,'' according to a Congressional Research Service analysis, \n``was the premise * * * that `the powers delegated to the three \nbranches are functionally identifiable,' distinct, and definable.'' I \nshould add that a second en bloc vote on the itemized mini-bills would \nnot cure the constitutional defects of this proposal. I refer of course \nto an amendment offered to this legislation yesterday. A second en bloc \nvote on the itemized mini-bills would not cure the constitutional \ndefect of this proposal. We vote on one bill at a time in the U.S. \nSenate. Professor Gerhardt of Cornell has said that a separate vote \nwould have to be taken on each of those bills in order to satisfy \nArticle I.\n\n  If we wish to enact legislation in which we passed a bill for each \nitem of the kind now put together in an appropriations bill, that would \nbe perfectly constitutional. It would require us to pass perhaps 10,000 \nbills a year, which we could do, but it would be constitutional. What \nyou cannot do is pass 10,000 bills with one vote.\n  Clearly, the great weight of authority indicates that ``separate \nenrollment'' is unconstitutional. Yet even if it is not, it is still a \nbad idea. Its proponents argue that 43 Governors have used this power \nto great effect in the States. This argument demands closer scrutiny.\n  Recall that a similar claim was made during our debate on the \nbalanced budget amendment: that balanced budget requirements have \nenforced fiscal discipline in the States. But word eventually got out \nthat this was not quite true: States also have capital budgets which \nare not required to be balanced which are, by definition, financed by \ndebt, even as they return benefits over time. Claims about the \neffectiveness of the line-item veto in the States may be equally \nmisleading.\n  The late, beloved Prof. Aaron Wildavsky of the University of \nCalifornia at Berkeley wrote in 1985, with characteristic insight, that \nmuch of the ``savings'' attributed to use of the line-item veto in the \nStates may be illusory. He cited the experience of Pennsylvania, where \none study found that spending bills were deliberately inflated in order \nto compensate for expected item vetoes, or simply to serve political \nends. Thus it does not necessarily follow that X million dollars are \n``saved'' merely because a Governor line-item vetoes that amount. They \nwere not meant to be enacted in the first place.\n  Dr. Louis Fisher of the Congressional Research Service and Prof. Neal \nDevins of the Marshall-Wythe School of Law at William and Mary concur \nin Wildavsky's assessment, writing that ``[g]ubernatorial reductions \nmay merely cancel spending that the legislature added because the \ngovernor possessed item veto authority.'' Fisher and Devins conclude \nthat `` * * * the availability of an item veto allows legislators to \nshift more of the responsibility for the fiscal process to the \nExecutive,'' instead of keeping it in the Congress where it belongs and \nwhere, in 1993, we showed we could exercise such responsibility. If I \nmay say, Mr. President, without meaning in any way to be partisan, \nevery vote for the 1993 $600 billion deficit reduction measure came \nfrom this side of the aisle.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator \nHatfield, testified along the same lines before the Judiciary Committee \nin 1984 of his experience with the line-item veto when he was Governor \nof Oregon:\n\n       We also know that the legislators in States which have the \n     line-item veto routinely ``pad'' their budgets, and that was \n     my experience, with projects which they\n      expect, or even want their Governors to veto. It is a \n     wonderful way for a Democrat-controlled legislature, that \n     I had, to put a Republican Governor on the spot: Let him \n     be the one to line-item these issues that were either \n     politically popular, or very emotional.\n\n  There is no reason to think these problems would be avoided at the \nFederal level if we adopt the line-item veto. If the state experience \nis any indication, the line-item veto might even create more difficulty \nin the Federal budget process. This has been our science of politics, \nthis has been our experience of politics.\n  The substitute amendment before us will not impose discipline on \nCongress. Nor will it erase the national debt. It is very likely \nunconstitutional. It will undoubtedly be litigated, and the courts will \nhave to decide.\n  I have great confidence that they will decide the measure before us \nis unconstitutional and the entire exercise will have been for nothing.\n  I hope the Senate will say no to separate enrollment. I hope the \nSenate will decline this invitation to relinquish important \nconstitutional prerogatives to the executive branch. It was why the \nAmerican Government came into being, Mr. President, in response to what \nwe saw as the abuses in fiscal matters of the executive branch in Great \nBritain.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Prof. \nMichael J. Gerhardt of Cornell Law School and the report of the \nAssociation of the Bar of the City of New York, of which Daniel J. \nCapra is chair, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                           Cornell Law School,\n\n                                                   March 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: I greatly appreciate the chance to \n     express my opinion on the constitutionality of a proposed \n     scheme directing the clerk of the House in which an \n     appropriation bill or joint resolution originates to \n     disassemble the measure and enroll each item as a separate \n     bill or joint resolution, which is then presented to the \n     President for approval or disapproval. As I explain \n     [[Page S4446]]  below, I consider this proposal to be \n     unconstitutional because it (1) violates Article I by \n     allowing the President to sign or veto a measure in a form \n     never actually by both houses of the Congress; (2) involves \n     an illegitimate attempt by the Congress to redefine \n     statutorily the constitutional term ``Bill''; (3) contravenes \n     both Supreme Court authority severely restricting \n     congressional discretion to delegate a core legislative or \n     lawmaking function and longstanding congressional \n     understanding of the prerequisites for a legitimate bill; and \n     (4) radically alters the fundamental balance of power between \n     the Congress and the President on budgetary matters.\n       At the outset, I find that merely describing the proposal's \n     intended operation demonstrates its basic constitutional \n     shortcomings. Suppose that an appropriation bill containing \n     200 separate appropriation items, which was considered and \n     passed by both Houses as a single, whole bill, would be \n     translated at the enrollment stage into 200 separate bills \n     for presentment and veto purposes. Yet, none of those 200 \n     bills would have ever been separately considered, voted on, \n     or passed by the two Houses of Congress. The problem is that \n     Congress cannot pass or enact 200 separate appropriation \n     bills without subjecting each of those 200 bills to the full \n     deliberative processes of the two Houses. The enrollment \n     procedure is simply not a part of the carefully designed \n     procedures for lawmaking set forth in Article I.\n       More specifically, the proposal violates the plain language \n     of the presentment clauses of Article I. According to the \n     latter, a bill or resolution that is to be presented to the \n     President can become a law only if it has ``passed the House \n     of Representatives and the Senate.''\\1\\ The purposes of this \n     requirement were to circumscribe Congress's lawmaking powers \n     and to define the scope of the President's veto authority. It \n     tortures the English language, however, to maintain that, in \n     the hypothetical above, both the House of Representatives and \n     the Senate actually passed 200 separate bills. A fragmented \n     bill that is never subjected for consideration and approval \n     by both Houses of Congress is not a bill or resolution within \n     the plain and original meaning of the presentment clauses.\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Moreover, the framers deliberately restricted the \n     President's role in the lawmaking process to a qualified \n     negative rather than to have him exercise an affirmative \n     power to redraft or reconfigure a bill. Because the President \n     is able under the proposal to pick and choose which budgetary \n     items he would like to see enacted, the proposal allows him \n     to sign various items into law in forms or configurations \n     never actually approved as such by both houses of Congress. \n     This kind of lawmaking by the President clearly violates \n     Article I, section 1, which grants ``[a]ll legislative \n     powers'' to Congress, and Article I, section 7, which gives \n     Congress the discretion to package bills as it sees fit.\n       The proposal effectively enables the President to make \n     affirmative budgetary choices that the framers definitely did \n     not want him to make. The framers deliberately chose to place \n     the power of the purse outside of the executive because they \n     feared the consequences of centralizing the powers of the \n     purse and the sword. As James Madison wrote in the Federalist \n     No. 58, ``This power of the purse may, in fact, be regarded \n     as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any \n     constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the \n     people.''\\2\\ Every Congress (until perhaps this most recent \n     one)--as well as all of the early presidents, for that \n     matter--have shared the understanding that only Congress has \n     the authority to decide how to package legislation, that this \n     authority is a crucial component of checks and balances, and \n     that the President's veto authority is strictly a qualified \n     negative power that enables him to strike down but not to \n     reconfigure whatever the majorities of both Houses have sent \n     to him as a bill.\n       Another major constitutional deficiency with the proposal \n     is that the enrollment process--the phase in which the \n     proposal allows for the fragmentation of a bill to occur--is \n     not mentioned in the Constitution as a step in the bicameral \n     development of a bill or resolution to be presented to the \n     President. Nor it is considered an aspect of the ``step-by-\n     step, deliberate and deliberative process'' by which the two \n     Houses consider and pass a legitimate bill or resolution.\\3\\ \n     Enrollment is supposed to be merely the meticulous \n     preparation of ``the final form of the bill, as it was agreed \n     to by both Houses, for presentation to the\n      President.''\\4\\ Yet, when an enrolling clerk disassembles a \n     unitary appropriations bill passed by both Houses and \n     rewrites it into many separate bills, the clerk is not \n     enrolling what was in fact ``agreed to by both Houses.'' \n     Rather, the clerk is dividing the bill into 200 separate \n     bills--a task that can only be performed by both Houses, \n     acting in the customary bicameral manner.\n       In addition, Congress's delegation of its authority to \n     enact each item of a bill into separate bills is \n     illegitimate. The basic decision whether to adopt and then \n     present one or many bills to the President is a legislative \n     choice that is, according to the Supreme Court, the ``kind of \n     decision that can be implemented only in accordance with the \n     procedures set out in Article I.''\\5\\ Congress cannot \n     delegate to an enrolling clerk the core legislative function \n     of deciding how many appropriation bills will be presented to \n     the President or the form each of those bills should take.\n       The seminal case on this point is INS v. Chadha,\\6\\ whose \n     reasoning is directly applicable to the proposal under \n     consideration. Chadha held that Congress cannot delegate to a \n     single house any kind of legislative function that must be \n     performed by both Houses, such as the enactment of a bill or \n     resolution that changes the status quo or affects the \n     interests of those outside the legislature. Because an \n     appropriation obviously affects existing relationships, it is \n     the kind of legislative judgment both as to form and \n     substance that Congress cannot delegate to an enrollment \n     clerk. The proposal deals with an integral part of the \n     deliberative bicameral process. As the Court explained, \n     ``[t]he President's participation in the legislative process \n     was to protect the Executive branch from Congress and to \n     protect the whole people from improvident laws. The division \n     of the Congress into two distinctive bodies assures that the \n     legislative power would be exercised only after opportunity \n     for full study and debate in separate settings. The \n     President's unilateral veto power, in turn, was limited by \n     the power of two-thirds of both Houses of Congress to \n     overrule a veto thereby precluding final arbitrary action of \n     one person. It emerges clearly that the prescription for \n     legislation in article I represents the framers' decision \n     that the legislative power of the federal government be \n     exercised in accord with a single, finely wrought and \n     exhaustively considered, procedure.''\\7\\\n       Undoubtedly, the proposal would also significantly alter \n     the balance of power between the President and Congress. The \n     proposal would expand presidential involvement in the \n     legislative process beyond what the framers intended. Such \n     aggrandizement would be at the expense of Congress, which \n     would lose its basic authority to present appropriation bills \n     to the President in the precise configuration or compromises \n     produced by the deliberative processes of the two Houses. The \n     proposal would demote Congress, which the Constitution makes \n     the master of the purse, to the role of giving fiscal advice \n     that the President would be effectively free to disregard. \n     The framers granted the President no such special veto power \n     over appropriation bills, despite their awareness that the \n     insistence of colonial assemblies that their spending bills \n     could not be amended once they had passed the lower house had \n     greatly enhanced the growth of legislative power.\\8\\\n       The proponents of separate enrollment argue, however, that \n     the parsing and reformulating of bills by an enrolling clerk \n     involves ministerial rather than legislative tasks. The \n     problem with this contention is that Congress simply does not \n     have the constitutional authority to redefine the necessary \n     ingredients for legislative action for its own convenience. \n     No case makes this point more clearly than Chadha, in which \n     the Supreme Court declared that any action deemed legislative \n     must be undertaken ``only in accordance with the procedures \n     set forth in article I.''\\9\\ Unless both houses of Congress \n     have enacted each item in an appropriations bill as separate \n     bills, it would be unconstitutional for a clerk of either \n     House to do so and to submit his handiwork as a ``Bill'' to \n     the President for approval or disapproval.\n       In summary, the explicit prescription for lawmaking set \n     forth in detail in Article I, whereby Congress is allowed to \n     present to the President only those bills that have been \n     subjected to the full deliberative process of both Houses, \n     cannot be amended by legislation, as this proposal tries to \n     do. Nor can Congress, by statute, redefine the constitutional \n     term ``Bill'' to include each and every item in a duly \n     enacted unitary bill. This conclusion is supported by the \n     plain and original meaning of Article I, longstanding \n     congressional understanding, and clearly applicable Supreme \n     Court authority.\n       It has been a privilege for me to share my opinions about \n     this proposed law with you.

The \n     104th Congress and President Clinton are no exception. One \n     perennial proposal has been to provide the President with a \n     line item veto. This Committee last reported on a legislative \n     line item veto eight years ago.\\1\\ Without coming to any \n     conclusion at that time, this committee did believe that \n     there existed substantial practical, and possibly \n     constitutional, impediments to the implementation of a line \n     item veto. This Committee has revisited the issue because the \n     proposed legislation, H.R. 2, differs in some respects from \n     the line item veto previously analyzed by this Committee and \n     because the changed political environment may allow the line \n     item veto to finally pass; indeed, as of this writing, the \n     line-item veto has been passed by the House of \n     Representatives and is pending in the Senate.\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n       We conclude that a line-item veto may not be implemented by \n     statute. Rather, the Constitution must be amended, because a \n     Presidential line item veto would fundamentally alter the \n     legislative and veto process currently written into the \n     Constitution and would unduly limit the power of Congress to \n     enact legislation.\n\n\n                         item vetoes generally\n\n       The line item veto, or more precisely designated, the item \n     veto, is a device that would, if enacted, enable the \n     President to veto particular items in a bill without having \n     to veto the entire bill. In theory, an item veto would enable \n     the President to accept bills without having to accept \n     expensive riders. Such riders are typically attached though \n     the process of ``log-rolling.'' Proponents believe that an \n     item veto would significantly reduce Congressional spending \n     while simultaneously allowing the President to sign otherwise \n     desirable bills.\\2\\\n       For over one hundred years, Congress has considered and \n     consistently rejected attempts to provide the President with \n     a line item veto. These repeated rejections have been based \n     on the belief that the item veto would gravely undermine the \n     fiscal authority of Congress and would greatly augment the \n     ability of the President to impose his political agenda on \n     the nation.\\3\\\n       There is legitimate concern that if an item veto were \n     implemented, the results might be the opposite of what was \n     intended. Professors Crain and Miller indicate that a line-\n     item veto would lead to an increase in undisciplined federal \n     spending:\n       ``With the item veto at its disposal, the executive branch \n     assumes more responsibility for eliminating wasteful spending \n     programs. This invites legislative irresponsibility because \n     legislators will tend to rely on the executive branch to cut \n     out wasteful provisions with the item veto. By discouraging \n     legislative discipline, critics argue that the item veto \n     actually could discourage fiscal efficiency.\\4\\\n       Even if the line-item veto would improve fiscal efficiency, \n     any improvement could come at the expense of disturbing a \n     healthy tension between the Legislative and Executive \n     branches. There is a real danger that the item veto might be \n     used to promote Executive branch interests unrelated to the \n     budgetary process. A President could use the item veto to \n     punish those who oppose him (by singling out an opponent's \n     project for a veto), or he might use the veto as a ``club'' \n     to promote partisan causes generally.\n       Each member of Congress represents and is answerable to a \n     local constituency, while the President has a national \n     constituency. This difference in representative basis results \n     in a different cost-benefit analysis for legislation and \n     ultimately different policy choices. The President therefore \n     considers the interests of a larger and more diverse group \n     than an individual member of Congress when taking positions \n     on budgetary matters. Congress, like any legislature, is an \n     institution that is conducive to vote trading and log-rolling \n     activities. To be enacted into law, any proposed legislation \n     requires that a majority coalition be formed. Consequently, \n     members of Congress often engage in cooperative legislative \n     activities in order to further their individual agendas. As a \n     result of this ``horse trading,'' aggregate spending levels \n     tend to be greater than they would be otherwise.\\5\\ The line-\n     item veto would undoubtedly alter this process.\n       Advocates of the item veto often justify their positions by \n     claiming: (1) the favorable experience of 43 states that \n     provide their governors with an item veto; (2) the inability \n     of Congress to curb its own spending excesses; and (3) modern \n     congressional techniques (e.g. riders and eleventh hour \n     omnibus\n      appropriations bills) that create ``veto-proof'' \n     legislation--i.e., a bill which, if vetoed in its \n     entirety, could effectively shut down the federal \n     government.\\6\\\n       In contrast, opponents of the item veto argue: that the \n     state analogy is inapplicable (or at the very least, of \n     limited applicability) to the federal situation; that the \n     federal packaging of appropriations bills is not amenable to \n     the effective use of an item veto; that the vast majority of \n     federal expenditures are mandatory and would be immune from \n     the item veto; and that an item veto would substantially \n     alter the Separation of Powers Doctrine written into the \n     Constitution.\\7\\\n       At least 43 states have enacted line item vetoes in an \n     effort to give their governors some control over spending. \n     This has enabled some states, at least on the face of it, to \n     save significant sums of money.\\8\\ To date, none of those 43 \n     states has acted to repeal those provisions. Despite these \n     positive indicators, the state experience is not dispositive \n     of whether a line-item veto is workable on the federal level. \n     First, state constitutions differ significantly from each \n     other and from the Federal Constitution. As two commentators \n     have stated, ``[t]here is a much greater state bias against \n     legislatures than exists at the national level.''\\9\\ Second, \n     state budgetary institutions and procedures vary in key \n     respects from each other and from those in the Federal \n     government.\\10\\ Third, appropriations bills in the states are \n     structured to facilitate item vetoes by governors. In \n     contrast, Congressional appropriations bills contain \n     relatively few items, rendering the utility of the line item \n     veto (for anything other than political coercion of \n     individual legislators) more suspect.\\11\\ Fourth, legislators \n     in states which have an item veto have been known to \n     ``routinely `pad' their budgets,'' resulting in savings that \n     are illusory.\\12\\ Fifth, the item veto functions more as a \n     partisan political tool, increasing tensions between \n     governors and state legislatures, than as an effective means \n     for reducing expenditures. In fact, the experience in at \n     least one state suggests that ``the President may use the \n     item veto to control a Congress dominated by [the] opposing \n     political party.''\\13\\ Sixth, because judicial \n     interpretation, at the state level, has yet to delineate the \n     scope of the item veto powers possessed by the various \n     governors, caution is necessary before an item veto is \n     adopted at the Federal level.\\14\\ Seventh, the item veto \n     could accelerate the use of budgetary legerdemain, i.e., \n     accounting tricks such as moving items off budget or \n     privatizing various programs.\n       The argument that an item veto would help Congress curb its \n     spending excesses is, we believe, overstated.\\15\\ Currently, \n     only 39 percent of the Federal budget may be classified as \n     ``discretionary spending'' and subject to the Congressional \n     appropriations process. This figure is expected to decline \n     even further. By the year 2003 interest and mandatory \n     spending will account for more than 72 percent of the Federal \n     budget, thus leaving only 28 percent for discretionary \n     spending.\\16\\ On the other hand, in order to be reelected, \n     members of Congress will often log-roll legislation they \n     desire into the budget in order to get their pet projects \n     approved. Their decisions to increase spending will often be \n     camouflaged by the creation of automatic spending increases \n     in various entitlement programs.\\17\\\n       Despite the suggestion that the advent of omnibus \n     legislation makes the President's use of his (or her) veto \n     too costly, it appears that when a President has been willing \n     to use the veto power, that President has gained tremendous \n     negotiating leverage over Congress. For example, when \n     President Reagan vetoed two omnibus measures in 1982, parts \n     of the Federal government were shut down. Consequently, \n     Congress was forced to revise those bills to comply with his \n     wishes.\\18\\\n       As a result, in later years, President Reagan merely had to \n     threaten to use his veto in order to win important \n     concessions from Congress. Because President Reagan was \n     willing to and did use his veto power, the ``all or nothing'' \n     stakes of omnibus legislation actually increased rather than \n     decreased his power relative to Congress with respect to the \n     content of legislation.\n\n\n                constitutionality of the line-item veto\n\n       We expressed concerns above that the line-item veto was an \n     unnecessary measure that might in fact be counterproductive \n     in obtaining fiscal efficiency, and that it might be unfairly \n     used by the President to punish particular members of \n     Congress. Yet even if the line-item veto made sense as a \n     policy matter, it should not be adopted, because it violates \n     several provisions of the Constitution. What follows is a \n     discussion of the Constitutional provisions which are in \n     conflict with the line-item veto.\n\n\n                            veto procedures\n\n       Article 1, Section 7, clause 2 of the Constitution sets \n     forth, in considerable detail, the procedure for exercising \n     and overriding the President's veto of legislation. The \n     procedures set forth in H.R. 2 do not conform with these \n     constitutional requirements.\n       Section 7 of Article I of the Constitution provides, in \n     pertinent part, that:\n       ``Every Bill which shall have passed the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a \n     law, be presented to the President of the United States: If \n     he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, \n     with his Objections to that House in which it shall have \n     originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their \n     Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such \n     Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass \n     the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to \n     the \n     [[Page S4448]]  other House, by which it shall likewise be \n     reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it \n     shall become law. . . .''\n       Under the proposed line-item veto, a different ``bill'' \n     would be enacted than was presented to the President. \n     Furthermore, subsection 5(a) of H.R. 2 provides that \n     ``[w]henever the President rescinds any budget authority . . \n     . or vetoes any provision as provided in this Act, the \n     President shall transmit to both Houses of Congress a special \n     message . . .'' Subsection 5(b) requires that each special \n     message be transmitted to both Houses on the same day.\n       Thus H.R. 2 appears to directly contradict section 7 in \n     several ways. First, and most importantly, Section 7 \n     contemplates that the Bill be either approved or disapproved \n     in its entirety by the President. Under the Constitution, \n     when the President approves a bill, he signs ``it.'' When he \n     disapproves of a bill he is not permitted to rewrite it--that \n     may only be done by Congress through the legislative process. \n     The Constitution does not permit the President to rewrite the \n     bill except to the extent that Congress incorporates his \n     Objections into a new or amended bill. Rather, in connection \n     with a non-approved bill, the Constitution directs the \n     President to return the bill in its entirety, together with \n     his objections to the House that originated the bill. At that \n     point that House, and not both Houses, shall enter the \n     President's objections into its Journal. The Constitution \n     then instructs that House, and not both Houses, to reconsider \n     the bill. Under the Constitution, it is only after that House \n     has reconsidered it, and only if two thirds of its members \n     agree to pass the bill, that it shall be sent, along with the \n     President's objections, to the other House, where it shall be \n     reconsidered. It is only after reconsideration of the Bill by\n      the second House, and only if approved by two thirds of the \n     members of that second House, that a non-approved bill can \n     become law.\n       In sum, Article I, Section 7 prohibits partial vetoes. The \n     literal language of the second clause of this section \n     strongly suggests that bills are to be approved, disapproved \n     and reconsidered in toto and not in part. This is apparent \n     from the repeated use of the terms ``it or its''--12 times, \n     ``the bill''--2 times, and ``reconsider or \n     reconsideration''--3 times, and from the context in which \n     those terms are used. Both ``it'' and ``the Bill'' refer to \n     ``Every Bill which shall have passed the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate.'' They do not refer to any \n     modified or amended version of the bill and do not refer to \n     portions of any bills passed by both Houses. Consequently, \n     pursuant to Section 7, a non-approved bill is returned to \n     Congress for reconsideration. The President does not return a \n     modified version. He is instructed to return the bill passed \n     by the House and the Senate along with his Objections \n     thereto. It is the bicamerally passed bill that is \n     reconsidered. Various forms of the word ``reconsider'' are \n     used not once but three times to refer to ``it'' or ``the \n     bill'' in connection with the return to Congress of a non-\n     approved bill. Furthermore, the framers and ratifiers did not \n     choose various forms of the words amend, change, alter, \n     modify, or some similar word. Instead they chose to provide \n     that Congress could ``reconsider'' a non-approved bill, in \n     order to give Congress a chance to approve the bill as it was \n     originally passed, to modify it or to pass a completely new \n     bill.\n       The veto provision is one of the most detailed and \n     precisely worded provisions in the entire Constitution. This \n     suggests that the procedures outlined therein should be \n     carefully followed and not artfully evaded.\\19\\\n       Considering America's history, it is remarkable that the \n     Constitutional Convention of 1787 included any kind of veto \n     power for the President. Before the American Revolution, \n     legislative acts of the colonies were subject to two vetoes. \n     Both the Governor of the colony and the King of England could \n     veto legislation. Both vetoes were absolute and not subject \n     to override by the legislatures. It is not surprising that \n     the colonists resented these veto powers.\\20\\ In fact, the \n     first two grievances listed in the Declaration of \n     Independence deal with this issue. They are: that ``He \n     [George III] has refused his assent to laws . . . He has \n     forbidden his Governors to pass. . . .'' It is thus clear \n     that, during and immediately after the American Revolution, \n     there was a strong disposition against any Executive veto \n     power.\\21\\ We believe that a strict construction of the \n     detailed veto provisions in the Constitution is consistent \n     with the intent of the Framers to provide a relatively \n     limited, rather than generous, veto power.\n\n\n                 bicameral and presentment requirements\n\n       One of the most troubling aspects of any item veto bill is \n     that an item veto would augment the President's veto power by \n     permitting him to veto appropriation bills that were never \n     considered by the House or the Senate in such fragmented \n     form. Executive veto power over part of a Bill is, in this \n     respect, inconsistent with the bicameral and presentment \n     requirements of the Constitution. As the Supreme Court \n     pointed out in I.N.S. v. Chadha,\\22\\ legislative actions \n     require approval of both Houses, in a bicameral fashion, and \n     presentment to the President. There is no language in the \n     presentment clause, or anywhere else in the Constitution, \n     that permits the President to approve or veto a bill other \n     than in the form in which it passed both Houses and\n      was presented to him. As Professor Gressman puts it: ``The \n     Presentment Clauses state that the bill which is to be \n     presented to the President, the bill he may veto or \n     approve, is the bill `which shall have passed the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate.'''\\23\\\n       Under Chadha, when a legislative power is exercised--such \n     as in the case of a one House veto--the legislative act is \n     subject to the explicit provisions of the presentment \n     clauses, Article 1, section 7, clause 2 and 3, and the \n     bicameral requirement of Article 1, section 1 and Article I, \n     section 7, clause 2. With a line-item veto, the President \n     clearly would be exercising legislative power insofar as he \n     performs the legislative act of determining the final content \n     of an appropriations bill and does not merely accept or \n     reject the bill as a unit. It is irrelevant whether the \n     itemization needed to implement the line item veto is \n     effectuated by the President or the enrollment clerk in \n     Congress. The effect is the same. A line item veto will \n     permit the President to restructure legislation after its \n     passage. If the President were to exercise an item veto, the \n     bill that would be enacted into law would not have been voted \n     upon and passed by the two Houses of Congress. One bill would \n     be passed by the two Houses of Congress and presented to the \n     President and a second bill would end up being enacted into \n     law without passage by both Houses of Congress and \n     presentment to the President. As the Supreme Court explained \n     in Chadha, a law enacted pursuant to this process would be \n     unconstitutional because it failed to pass both House of \n     Congress and was not presented to the President after such \n     passage.\n       It is true that H.R. 2 subsection 3(a) permits an item veto \n     to be overridden by way of a rescission/receipts disapproval \n     bill. However, while a rescission/receipts disapproval bill \n     can restore the legislation to what it was before the \n     exercise of the line item veto, a problem is created because \n     it is the President who actually changed the law and not both \n     Houses of Congress with the approval of the President.\n       Moreover, as a practical matter, the legislative option of \n     promulgating a rescission/receipts disapproval bill is made \n     difficult by the provisions of H.R. 2. Such a bill must \n     reinstate all of the items vetoed. Thus, if the President \n     vetoes several items from a single bill, the practical \n     reality is that a rescission/receipts disapproval bill is \n     unlikely to be forthcoming from Congress. And even if such a \n     bill is passed, the President can veto that bill, and a two-\n     thirds vote in each House of Congress is required to overcome \n     that veto. Furthermore, under H.R. 2, unless Congress \n     overrides the President's veto of a rescission/receipts \n     disapproval bill within the time specified in the statute, \n     the rescission of discretionary budget authority or the veto \n     of a targeted tax benefit becomes effective. Thus, the veto \n     of the rescission/receipts disapproval does not trigger a \n     reconsideration of a law passed by Congress and vetoed by the \n     President, but rather triggers the automatic implementation \n     of a law presented by the President to Congress unless \n     Congress enacts another law. This stands the \n     Constitutionally-mandated legislative process on its head.\n\n\n                            the rules clause\n\n       The Rules Clause of Article I of the Constitution provides \n     that ``Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings. \n     . . .''\\24\\ We believe that a line-item veto is inconsistent \n     with the Rules Clause. Under a line-item veto, the form, \n     content and subject matter of bills will be determined by \n     someone other than the members of the House and Senate.\n       Moreover, Subsection 5 of H.R. 2, which deals with \n     ``Consideration in the Senate'' and ``Points of Order,'' \n     appears to explicitly violate the Rules Clause by controlling \n     Congress' internal rules and procedures. For example, \n     Subsection 5(d) of this bill attempts to limit debate on \n     rescission/receipts disapproval bills, debatable motions and \n     appeals in connection therewith. it also provides that a \n     motion to further limit\n      debate is not debatable and a motion to recommit is not in \n     order.\\25\\ Such a provision imposes an obvious limitation \n     on the rulemaking authority of each House of Congress.\n       It is true that, to the extent item-veto legislation \n     imposes limitations on Congressional rule-making, it is a \n     self-inflicted wound. Congress, if it passes the line-item \n     veto, will have constricted its own rulemaking authority. Yet \n     the Rules Clause does not permit such a self-inflicted \n     limitation on Congressional authority. It has been settled \n     law for more than a century that:\n       ``The power to make rules is not one which once exercised \n     is exhausted. It is a continuous power, always subject to be \n     exercised by the house, and within the limitations suggested, \n     absolute and beyond the challenge of any other body or \n     tribunal.\\26\\''\n       Thus each House has the power and authority to set its own \n     rules regarding a variety of internal matters. The problem \n     with passing legislation that restricts the rulemaking power \n     of either House is that the legislation is passed by both \n     Houses and can only be abrogated through subsequent \n     legislation by both Houses. This is inconsistent with the \n     Rules Clause, which provides that each House has the \n     authority to determine ``its'' own proceedings. Legislation \n     affecting the internal rulemaking power of either House \n     results in one House of Congress ceding control over its \n     internal rules to the other House. The power granted in the \n     Rules Clause was granted to each House of Congress in order \n     to make the legislative powers of each House more effective. \n     That power may not be channelled or regulated by a statute \n     passed by both Houses and signed by \n     [[Page S4449]]  the President. As one commentator has stated, \n     the Rulemaking power ``granted in the Constitution is above \n     all law, and cannot be taken away or impaired by any \n     law.''\\27\\\n\n\n                       The Appropriations Clause\n\n       In addition to all the constitutional concerns addressed \n     above, an appropriations bill that is modified by an item \n     veto is probably unconstitutional on another ground as well: \n     the ``approved'' appropriations would not be approved ``by \n     law'' as required section 9 of Article I of the Constitution. \n     That section provides that: ``No Money shall be drawn from \n     the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by \n     Law.'' The problem created by a line-item veto is that the \n     resulting appropriations would not be made by law, but rather \n     would be made by the President with the tacit approval of \n     Congress.\n\n\n               The Power of the Purse Belongs to Congress\n\n       Providing an item veto to the President could fundamentally \n     alter the balance of power between Congress and the \n     President. Commentators have stated:\n       ``the adoption of what might appear to be a relatively \n     modest reform proposal could result in a radical \n     redistribution of constitutional power * * * At stake are the \n     power relationships between the executive and legislative \n     branches, the exercise of Congress' historic power over the \n     purse, and the relative abilities of each branch to establish \n     budgetary priorities.''\\28\\\n       The Constitution places the ``power of the purse'' in the \n     hands of Congress and outside the grasp of the President \n     because of the fear of combining the power of the purse with \n     the power of the sword.\\29\\ Section 9 of Article I of the \n     Constitution provides that ``No money shall be drawn from the \n     Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law.'' \n     James Madison wrote\n      that `` [t]his power of the purse may, in fact, be regarded \n     as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any \n     constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the \n     people.''\\30\\\n       Roger Sherman said at the Constitutional convention that \n     ``[i]n making laws regard should be had to the sense of the \n     people who are bound by them and it is more probable that a \n     single man should mistake or betray this sense than the \n     legislature.'' These words apply in the area of fiscal \n     decisions where the decisions regarding taxation and spending \n     depend on the government having taken into account the \n     diverse interests of its citizens. No institution is better \n     suited, able or willing to accommodate these diverse \n     interests than Congress. Based upon this view, the Framers \n     chose to give supremacy in budgetary power to Congress. In \n     fact, only the House--the chamber closest to the elctroate--\n     was given the right to initiate revenue bills. Clearly, the \n     Framers believed that decisions affecting the pocketbooks of \n     the citizens should be made by the governmental institution \n     that is closest to them.\\31\\\n       All this does not mean that the President is prohibited \n     from taking an active role in Congress' appropriations \n     decisions. For example Article II provides that the President \n     may recommend to Congress measures that he deems ``necessary \n     and expedient.'' And of course the President possesses a \n     qualified veto over all legislation, including appropriations \n     measures.\n       Nevertheless, with respect to the budget, under the \n     Constitution, the President's role is subordinate to that of \n     Congress. Despite the President's recommendation and veto \n     powers, it is Congress that must make the final decisions \n     regarding funding levels and the expenditure of appropriated \n     funds. It is Congress that must decide the extent to which \n     the President's views and proposals are accepted. Budgetary \n     ``reform'' that increases the President's power at the \n     expense of Congress would alter this scheme and therefore \n     should be disfavored.\n       In considering whether Congress may cede any of the Power \n     of the Purse to the Executive, Chief Justice Taft states \n     that:\n       ``it is a breach of the National fundamental law if \n     Congress gives up its legislative power and transfers it to \n     the President. . . This is not to say that the three branches \n     are not coordinate parts of one government and that each in \n     the field of its duties may not invoke the action of the two \n     other branches in so far as the action invoked shall not be \n     an assumption of the constitutional field of action of \n     another branch.''\\32\\\n       It could be argued that a line-item veto does not in fact \n     cede legislative power over the purse to the President, given \n     the fact that the President already has the power to veto \n     appropriations legislation in its entirety. The fact is, \n     however, that the ability to veto specific items in a larger \n     bill will definitely increase Executive control of the budget \n     process, at the expense of legislative prerogative; indeed, \n     that is the very reason that supporters are pushing for a \n     line-item veto.\n       The legislative process is a complex, politically-driven \n     process; one item often gets passed in ``trade'' for another \n     as part of a general piece of legislation. This kind of \n     ``horse-trading'' or ``log-rolling'' was clearly not unknown \n     to the Founders of the Constitution. To the contrary, \n     legislative bargaining is essential to the Constitutionally-\n     mandated process and to Congressional control over the \n     purse.\\33\\\n       The line-item veto would upset this carefully-calibrated \n     legislative process by allowing the Executive to pluck out a \n     piece of the Congressionally-passed puzzle and reject it. The \n     line-item veto is therefore qualitatively different from the \n     veto power enacted in the Constitution. It represents an \n     aggressive extension of the veto power, and therefore \n     contradicts the qualified use of the veto power that was \n     envisioned by the Framers.\n                               conclusion\n\n       Because the line-item veto conflicts with the veto \n     provisions of the Constitution, with the Rules Clause, with \n     the bicameral and presentment clauses, and with the supremacy \n     of Congress over fiscal matters, we conclude that the line-\n     item veto may only be enacted through Constitutional \n     amendment.\n\n\n                  the committee on federal legislation\n\n       Daniel J.

Mr. President, it is always enlightening listening to the \nSenator from New York. He always presents a thoroughly researched and \nthoroughly examined and well-articulated argument for his positions. \nAnd I enjoy his presentations immensely.\n  As the Senator from New York knows, there is a difference of opinion \non the constitutionality of separate enrollment. Distinguished \nconstitutional scholars have come to opposite conclusions, one of which \nis Laurence Tribe, a constitutional scholar frequently quoted by \nmembers of both parties, but particularly by members of the party of \nthe Senator from New York. \n[[Page S4450]]  The American Law Institute and Congressional Research \nService have given indication that they believe the separate enrollment \nprocedure is constitutional, and Senator Biden, currently a Member of \nthis body and ranking member of Judiciary, has argued articulately for \nthe constitutionality of such procedure.\n  So, clearly, there are opinions on both sides of this issue. \nUltimately, of course, the court will make that determination. We have \nadopted expedited procedures, traditional procedures of which that \ndetermination can be made. This Senator hopes and trusts that the \nopinions of Mr. Tribe and Senator Biden, the American Law Institute, \nand others, will prevail and be persuasive with the courts. But we will \nfind out in due course what that is.\n  I thank the Senator from New York for his contributions, which are \nalways valuable contributions and thought-provoking contributions.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. If the Senator will yield for a question, I am sure the \nSenator would agree that when the Court decides, we will abide by the \ndecision. That is the great fact of the American Government.\n  Mr. COATS. There is no dispute on that point.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. I would like to yield the floor if the Senator from West \nVirginia seeks the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nYork for his very scholarly statement today. I am only sorry that more \nSenators are not on the floor to have heard what the Senator had to \nsay. We know what the Constitution says, and the Constitution says \n``every bill which shall have passed.'' Constitutional scholars may \ndiffer, but I think that we have to retreat to the Constitution itself, \nfirst of all, to attempt to construe and interpret that document and \nread the plain language of the Constitution itself.\n  We have, as Senators, a responsibility to make some judgment \nourselves as to the constitutionality of a measure before we pass on \nit. In the final analysis, it will be the courts that will decide. But \nwe cannot pass that cup to others. We have to make that judgment here.\n  I read the letter by Professor Tribe. It was written 2 years ago, I \nbelieve, to Senator Bill Bradley, if I am not mistaken. I have great \nrespect for Professor Tribe. But I must say, I was disappointed in \nreading that letter. I was disappointed that such an eminent scholar of \nthe Constitution would take that view of this measure. I say that with \napologies to Professor Tribe. He is a constitutional scholar and I am \nnot. But I was astonished that he took that view and indicated that in \nhis judgment that would pass the constitutional test.\n  I thank the Senator from New York for his statement here today, in \nwhich he pointed to the acknowledged Father of the Constitution, James \nMadison, who in Federalist Papers No. 58 said, ``This power over the \npurse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual \nweapon with which any Constitution can arm the immediate \nrepresentatives of the people * * *'' Is that not what he said?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. This power over the purse. What escapes my comprehension is \nhow we, as Senators, can so lightly pass that cup; how we can so \nlightly vote to transfer some of that power over the purse to the \nExecutive. Whether he be a Democrat or a Republican, I have never \nwavered in my opposition to the line-item veto.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the distinguished and revered Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am delighted to.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Would he happen to know that in the 1988 text of \n``American Constitutional Law,'' which Professor Tribe wrote, he stated \nthat separate enrollment was probably unconstitutional?\n  Mr. BYRD. Was probably?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Probably unconstitutional. I think he was right then.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, that statement is in stark contrast to the letter \nwhich I believe he wrote to Senator Biden.\n  The Senator from New York, who has\n\n       A heart as stout as the Irish oak\n       And as pure as the Lakes of Killarney\n\nhas taken the right stand in my judgment. He took the right stand on \nthe ``unbalanced budget amendment,'' commonly referred to as the \nbalanced budget amendment. And he has unwaveringly defended the \nposition that that document which has come to bear the aura of \nimmortality should not be demeaned and debased and, as a matter of \nfact, defaced by such an amendment.\n  He takes the right stand today. He is a man of obstinate veracity. I \nappreciate the fact that he has taken the time here today to make this \nstatement. I wish all Senators heard it. I hope they will read it. I \nheard part of it. It will be my intention to read Senator Moynihan's \nstatement, and I will keep it. I thank the distinguished Senator for \nhis service.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I believe the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan wanted to modify his amendment. Has he modified it?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I have modified it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, let me compliment the Senator on having \nimproved the language of the amendment. I certainly have no objection \nto adopting the amendment on voice vote.\n  It is an improvement. He has contributed a very worthwhile service. I \njust wanted to compliment him and say that even though his action \nconstitutes an improvement, this piece of legislation is beyond the \nstage of improving in such a way that it will not impair the power of \nthe purse which, under the Constitution, has been lodged in the \nlegislative branch.\n  If the Senator wishes to have a voice vote on his amendment, I yield \nfor that purpose.\n\n\n      Amendment No. 401, as Further Modified to Amendment No. 347\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would call up amendment No. 401.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the pending amendment.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor the comments he made yesterday and the questions which he raised \nwith respect to this amendment. I appreciate his help on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  So the amendment (No. 401) was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 350 to Amendment No. 347\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of savings achieved through lowering the \ndiscretionary spending caps to offset revenue decreases subject to pay-\n                        as-you-go requirements)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk which has \nbeen qualified for a call up. I shall call it up at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Amendment numbered 350:\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . USE OF THE REDUCTIONS IN DISCRETIONARY SPENDING CAPS.\n\n       (A) Congressional Budget Act.--\n       (1) Budget resolutions and legislation.--Section 301 of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(j) Use of Reductions in Discretionary Spending Caps.--It \n     shall not be in order in the Senate or House of \n     Representatives to consider any concurrent resolution on the \n     budget, bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or \n     conference report that decreases the discretionary spending \n     limits unless the concurrent resolution on the budget, bill, \n     joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report \n     provides that such decrease may only be used for deficit \n     reduction and may not be used to offset all or part of an \n     increase in direct spending or decrease in receipts under \n     section 252 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1974.''.\n       (2) Sixty vote point of order.--Subsections (c) and (d) of \n     section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 are \n     amended by inserting ``301(j),'' after ``301(i).''.\n       (b) Gramm-Rudman.--Section 252 of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n       ``(f) Use of Reductions in Discretionary Spending Caps.--A \n     decrease in the discretionary spending limits may only be \n     used for deficit reduction and may not be used to offset all \n     or part of an increase in direct spending or decrease in \n     receipts under this section.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  [[Page S4451]] Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank \nthe able clerk for reading the amendment in its entirety.\n  Mr. President, I am one Senator who believes that it would be \nfoolhardy to enact tax cut legislation this year. Instead, I believe \nthat we should concentrate all of our efforts and our resources toward \nreducing the deficit. I am aware that President Clinton has called for \na middle-class tax cut and I am sorry that he did so. I am aware that \nthe so-called Contract With America pledges a much larger tax cut than \nthat which has been called for by President Clinton.\n  The so-called Contract With America pledges a much larger tax cut, \nwould be mostly for America's wealthiest taxpayers. I am opposed to \nboth of those proposals because I believe that deficit reduction ought \nto be our first priority at this time.\n  I think the President was on the right track when he worked with the \nDemocratic leadership in the 103d Congress to enact a budget deficit \nreduction package that amounted to somewhere between $400 and $500 \nbillion over a period of 5 years. He was on the right track. He should \nhave stayed on that track.\n  According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the tax bill \npassed by the House Ways and Means Committee would reduce revenues by \nnearly $180 billion over the next 5 years. That, I believe, is bad \nfiscal policy.\n  Here we are, we are debating today, and we have been debating since \nMonday, a piece of legislation that purports to do something about the \nbudget deficit. It purports to do something about the budget deficits. \n``Oh, we have to do something to get these deficits under control. We \nhave to do something about our horrendous budget deficits. We have to \nput the tools in the hands of the President of the United States. We \nhave to give him the line-item veto.''\n  President Reagan often said, ``Give me the line-item veto. When I was \nGovernor of California I had the line-item veto. Give me the line-item \nveto. I will take on the challenge. I will make the cuts.''\n  And I hear--it is only hearsay, or ``read-say,'' I hear and I read \nthat the so-called Contract With America--if I ever refer to that as a \n``Contract With America'' I hope the Official Reporters will make a \ncorrection in my transcript, to put the words ``so-called'' as \nantecedents to the words ``Contract With America.''\n  The so-called Contract With America, I understand--I hear and I \nread--that one of the planks in that so-called contract is a line-item \nveto. So the so-called Contract With America purports that a line-item \nveto should be placed in the hands of the Chief Executive. We have all \nthese fine new Senators who have come in here, 11 of them, 11 new \nSenators, all Republican Senators. I get the impression that these, not \nonly new Senators but several of the Senators who have been around here \nlong enough to know better, consider that as a conservative position. I \nknow there are some real conservatives on that side of the aisle, but I \nam at a loss to understand how a true conservative can advocate giving \nto the President a line-item veto and can advocate a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution.\n  I have been around here now 36 years in this body, going on my 37th \nyear. I have known a lot of conservatives, conservative Senators, \nconservative Republicans. I cannot imagine the conservative Republican \nSenators who were in this body when I came here 36 years ago advocating \na line-item veto, advocating a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. I cannot believe that Norris Cotton, George Aiken, or \nEverett Dirksen, or Bob Taft, I cannot believe that Senators of that \nday would not roll over in their tombs today if they heard what I have \nbeen hearing. Conservative Senators--this is the great conservative \ncause. ``Stand up for the conservative cause. Put in the President's \nhand a line-item veto. Power of the purse vested in the legislative \nbranch? Why, article I, section 9 of the Constitution--I don't believe \na word of it. I don't believe that the Framers of the Constitution knew \nwhat they were doing when they wrote into the Constitution section 9 of \narticle I, which says, `No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but \nin Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.' And, of course, the \nfirst article, the first sentence in the Constitution tells us who \nmakes the laws. `All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested \nin the Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate \nand House of Representatives.'''\n  And here we are, we are being told that the conservatives--this is \nsupposed to be this great new revolution here being carried on by the \nconservatives, being brought to the floor of both Houses, this new \nrevolution--the conservatives are out to advocate that the \nconstitutional framers were not as wise as we had been heretofore \ntaught they were, and that the President of the United States should \nhave part of the power over the purse; we should place in his hands the \nline-item veto.\n  I wish that Henry Clay were still in the Senate. I wish that Henry \nClay were still in the Senate.\n  It is kind of old fashioned around here, I know, to go back and read \nthe old dusty records of the Congresses of yesteryears. But I hold in \nmy hand here some pages from the Congressional Globe containing \nsketches of the debates and proceedings of the Second Session of the \n27th Congress, volume 11, Blair and Rives, editors, City of Washington, \nprinted at the Globe office for the editors in 1842, exactly 153 years \nago. And the date, to be very exact, was January 24, 1842.\n  Let us see what old Henry Clay said. I do not use that word as a word \nof disrespect. I am getting along in years myself and I expect I am \nolder today than Henry Clay was--I know by a long shot--than he was \nwhen he spoke in the Senate. Let us see what Henry Clay had to say.\n  He was not talking about the line-item veto. He was talking about the \nveto, the veto, which we all know is in the Constitution. Here is what \nMr. Clay said. I will not read his whole speech. I had thought, if I \nwere forced to stand on my feet and take a good bit of the Senate's \ntime I just might read the whole speech of Henry Clay, but I will not \ndo that. Just a little of it will give you the flavor. Here is what he \nsaid in part.\n\n       After speaking of the veto power generally, and more \n     particularly of its exercise by a late President of the \n     United States, the speech proceeded to say. . . .\n\n  You see, this is the reporter of the Congressional Globe who is \nwriting in the third person, so he is saying this is what Mr. Clay had \nto say. The Official Reporter today will not refer to the Senators as \nin the third person.\n  ``After speaking of the veto power generally and more particularly of \nits exercise by a late President of the United States, the speech \nproceeded to say''--now this is Henry Clay. This is not Robert C. Byrd. \nThis is Henry Clay.\n\n       The first and in my opinion the most important object which \n     should engage the serious attention of a new administration \n     is that of circumscribing the executive power and throwing \n     around it such limitations and safeguards as will render it \n     no longer dangerous to the public liberties.\n\n  Hear me: Henry Clay. We do not hear talk in the Senate about public \nliberties anymore. We do not talk about the liberties, the people's \nliberties anymore. We only talk about what is good for the next \nelection. What party is going to prevail in the next election. Who is \ngoing to get the upper hand in the next election. There is no time and \nno place here to talk about the people's liberties.\n\n       With the view, therefore, to the fundamental character of \n     the government itself, and especially of the executive \n     branch, it seems to me . . .\n\n  This is Henry Clay of Kentucky.\n\n       . . . to me that either by amendments of the Constitution, \n     when they are necessary, or by remedial legislation when the \n     object falls within the scope of the powers of Congress, \n     there should be, first, a provision to render a person \n     ineligible to the office of the President of the United \n     States after a service of one term.\n\n  Not ``three strikes and you are out.'' One term, then you are out.\n\n       Second, that the veto power . . .\n\n  Listen to this.\n\n       Second, that the veto power should be more precisely \n     defined and be subjected to further limitations and \n     qualifications.\n\n  He is not talking about broadening the veto power. He is not saying \nthat we should give the Chief Executive a line-item veto. Clay thinks \nthat the framers went too far in giving the \n[[Page S4452]]  President the veto and requiring that, if a veto is \noverridden, it be overridden by two-thirds vote.\n\n       It was his purpose . . .\n\n  This is the reporter again talking in the third person.\n\n       It was his purpose--\n\n  Meaning Clay's purpose.\n\n     to go but very briefly into the history and origin of the \n     veto power. It was known to all to have originated in the \n     institution of the tribunitian power in ancient Rome;\n\n  Well, sweet speak of rhetoric. Here is a man 153 years ago who is \ntalking about the tribunitian power in ancient Rome. I have been \ntalking about that also.\n  Senators could learn a little more about the tribunitian power in \nancient Rome.\n  Henry Clay said.\n\n       . . . that it was seized upon and perverted to purposes of \n     ambition when the empire was established under Augustus; and \n     that it had not been finally abolished until the reign of \n     Constantine. There could be no doubt that it had been \n     introduced from the practice under the empire into the \n     monarchies of Europe, in most of which, in some form or other \n     some modification or other, it was now to be found. But, \n     although it existed in the national codes, the power had not, \n     in the case of Great Britain, been exercised for a century \n     and a half past; and, if he was correctly informed on the \n     subject, it had, in the French monarchy, never been exercised \n     at all. During the memorable period of the French Revolution, \n     when a new Constitution was under consideration, this subject \n     of the veto power has been largely discussed, and had \n     agitated the whole country. Everyone must recollect how it \n     had been turned against the unfortunate Louis XIV.\n\n  Well, that is an error. The official reporters made an error in the \nCongressional Globe when they referred to Louis XIV. Clay was talking \nabout Louis XVI. He was not talking about Louis XIV. He was talking \nabout Louis XVI. It is easy to see how a mistake can be made. Instead \nof XVI the official reporter wrote XIV. But be that as it may.\n\n       . . . Louis XVI, who had been held up to the ridicule by \n     the populace, under the title of ``Monsieur Veto'', as his \n     wife, the Queen, had been called ``Madame Veto'' . . .\n\n  So it had to be Louis XVI.\n\n       . . . although, after much difficulty, the power had \n     finally found a place in the constitution, not a solitary \n     instance had occurred of its actual exercise. Under the \n     colonial state of this country, the power was transplanted \n     from the experience which had been had of it in Europe, to \n     the laws relating to the colonies, and that in a double form, \n     for there was a veto of the Colonial Governor and also a veto \n     of the Crown.\n\n  Clay went on to say that:\n\n       No doubt the idea of engrafting this power upon our own \n     Constitution was adopted by the Convention from having always \n     found it as a power recognized in European Governments, just \n     as it had been derived by them from the practice and history \n     of Rome. At all events, the power was inserted as one \n     feature, not only in the general Constitution of the Federal \n     Government, but also in the Constitutions of a portion of the \n     States.\n\n  I will not tire Senators with reading from the Congressional Globe \nand reading from the words of one of the all-time great Senators. His \npicture is out here in the anteroom where we meet with constituents; \nHenry Clay.\n\n       Anyone at all acquainted with the contemporaneous history \n     of the Constitution must know that one great and radical \n     error which possessed the minds of the wise men who drew up \n     that instrument was an apprehension that the executive \n     department of the then proposed government would be too \n     feeble to contend successfully in a struggle with the power \n     of the legislature. Hence, it was found that various \n     expedients had been proposed in the convention with the \n     avowed purpose of strengthening the executive arm.\n\n  And the Federalist Papers so state that one reason why the President, \nwhy the Executive was given the veto, was to protect himself and his \noffice from the incursions by the legislative branch.\n\n       All these propositions had their origin in the one \n     prevailing idea: that of the weakness of the Executive and \n     its incompetence to defend itself against the encroachments \n     of legislative domination and dictation.\n       It was an axiom in all three governments that the three \n     great departments--legislative, executive and judicial--\n     should ever be kept separate and distinct, and a government \n     was the most perfect when most in conformity with this \n     fundamental principle. But it was said that the framers of \n     our Constitution had nevertheless been induced to place the \n     veto upon the list of executive powers by two considerations. \n     The first was a desire to protect the executive against the \n     powers of the legislative branch, and the other was a prudent \n     wish to guard the country against the injurious effects of \n     crude and hasty legislation. But where was the necessity? \n     Clay asked. Where was the necessity to protect the executive \n     against the legislative department? Were not both bound by \n     the solemn oath to support the Constitution? The judiciary \n     had no veto. If the argument was a sound one, why was not the \n     same protection extended to the judiciary also?\n\n  Ah, Clay speaks of the solemn oath to which we swear with our hands \non God's gospel and our other hand raised to Almighty God. We do not \npay much attention to our oaths anymore. But Clay evidently felt \ndifferently about it.\n  Some of the pages are gone from my faxed copy of the Congressional \nGlobe. But I will continue reading excerpts from the same speech by \nClay\n on the abolition of the veto power in the Senate January 24, 1842.\n\n       Clay had hitherto viewed the veto power simply in its \n     numerical weight, in the aggregate votes of the two Houses; \n     but there was another and far more important point of view in \n     which it ought to be considered. He contended, that \n     practically, and in effect, the veto, armed with such a \n     qualification as now accompanied it in the Constitution, was \n     neither more nor less than an absolute power. It was \n     virtually an unqualified negative on the legislation of \n     Congress.\n\n  That was Henry Clay.\n\n       In such circumstances, when all the personal influence, the \n     official patronage, and the reasoning which accompanied the \n     veto, were added to the substantial weight of the veto \n     itself, every man acquainted with human nature would be ready \n     to admit, that if nothing could set it aside but a vote of \n     two-thirds in both Houses, it might as well have been made \n     absolute at once.\n\n  And there have been only 104 vetoes in the history of this Republic \nthat have been overridden--104 in 206 years. So it is virtually an \nabsolute veto. Think of what it will mean. I daresay, once this \nlegislation becomes law, if it ever does become law, which God avert--I \nwish it would not be done with my help--I daresay there will not be any \nvetoes of items, any vetoes of these little orphan ``billettes.'' I \ndaresay that there will not be any vetoes overridden because not one of \nthose little orphan ``billettes'' will have the pressure and the power \nthat may be brought to bear on a matter of national significance.\n  Little West Virginia in the House of Representatives has three votes. \nThere are many other States likewise that are represented by few in \nnumbers in the other body. And as I have already said, let something be \nof interest--take the Northeast region here because there are a cluster \nof States up there, very important States. Most of them were States \nbefore the Constitution existed. They had a part to play in writing \nthat Constitution and a part to play in the revolution, the \nRevolutionary War. But if there is something in an appropriation bill \nthat is of major significance to those few little States but not of \nimportance to the rest of the Union, it would be very, very difficult \nfor those few States to muster the votes necessary to override a \nPresidential veto of some of the little orphan ``billettes'' that will \nparade across the President's desk once this piece of legislation is \nenacted.\n\n       Mr. Clay contended, that really and in practice this veto \n     power drew after it the power of initiating laws, and in its \n     effect must ultimately amount to conferring on the executive \n     the entire legislative power of the Government.\n\n  You wait until he gets this. Clay in his dreams probably would never \nhave conceived of such a massive transfer of power of the purse that we \nare about to enact here. He was talking about the veto that is in the \nConstitution, which has been in there for 206 years, which was \nthoroughly discussed at the Convention, thoroughly discussed in the \nratifying conventions of the States. He could not have dreamed of this \nkind of veto that we are about to hand to the President.\n\n       With the power to initiate and the power to consummate \n     legislation, to give vitality and vigor to every law, or to \n     strike it dead--\n\n  Or to strike it dead.\n\n     at his pleasure, the President must ultimately become the \n     ruler of the nation.\n\n  And he will also become the ruler of the Members of the House and \nSenate. Bow down to this new Caesar, bow down to this power. I wish \nthere were a Henry Clay in this body today.\n\n       Mr. Clay warned the nation, that if this veto power was not \n     arrested, if it were not either abolished or at least limited \n     and circumscribed, in process of time, and that before \n     another such period had elapsed as had intervened since the \n     Revolution, the whole legislation of this country could \n     become to \n     [[Page S4453]]  be prepared at the White House, or in one or \n     other of the Executive departments, and would come down to \n     Congress in the shape of bills for them to register, and pass \n     through the forms of legislation, just as had once been done \n     in the ancient courts of France.\n\n  There was the voice of prophecy.\n\n       There, there, was the security, [Clay said] and not in this \n     miserable despotic veto power of the President of the United \n     States.\n\n  That is what he thought of the veto power, ``the miserable despotic \nveto power of the President of the United States.''\n\n       You might take a mechanic from the avenue and make him \n     President, and he would instantly be surrounded with the \n     power and influence of his office. . .\n       The unpretending name, President of the United States, was \n     no security against the extent or the abuse of power. . . \n     Whether he were called emperor, dictator, king, liberator, \n     protector, sultan, or President, of the United States was of \n     no consequence at all. Look at his power; that was what we \n     had to guard against. The most tremendous power known to \n     antiquity was the shortest in duration.\n\n  That was the power of the dictator. Under the Republic, a dictator \nwas chosen for a maximum of 6 months or until such time as the crisis \nfor which the dictator was chosen had run its course, whichever was the \nlessor. Cincinnatus was chosen dictator because there was a Roman \ngeneral whose army was surrounded by the tribes of the east. \nCincinnatus heeded the call, took off his toga, took on the cloak of \nthe dictator, defeated the enemy in 16 days, gave up the dictatorship, \nand went back to plowing with his oxen on his little 3-acre farm beside \nthe Tiber.\n  But what power he had. He had all the power, omnipotent power, over \nevery man, woman, boy, and girl in Rome while he was dictator. He could \nexecute without trial; all power. So the dictatorship of Rome continued \nbut for a brief period. Yet, while it lasted, the whole state was in \nhis hands. He did whatever he pleased, whether it was life, liberty, or \nproperty.\n  I will close with this last extract of the speech of Clay on January \n24, 1842.\n  ``Before the power should be utterly abolished, he''--meaning Clay--\n``deemed it prudent, that an experiment should be made in a modified \nform; and instead of requiring a majority of two-thirds of both Houses \nto supersede the veto of the President, he thought it sufficient to \nrequire the concurrence of a majority of the whole number of members \nelected to each House of Congress.''\n  So that was Henry Clay, one of the great trio of all time, one of the \nMembers of the Senate when it was in its golden age.\n  What would he say today? What would he say today of this hydra-headed \ndragon? We are about to sow the dragon's teeth and the country will \nreap the whirlwind.\n  Where are the true conservatives of today? You are looking at one. I \nam a conservative when it comes to preserving the constitutional \nsystem, the Constitution of the United States. I am not above many. I \nhave voted for five amendments, as I have said. But never would I \nvote--I would be shot before a firing squad before I would vote--to \ndestroy the structure of this Constitution.\n  Talk about our children and grandchildren. We shed crocodile tears \nabout children and grandchildren when it comes to reducing the budget \ndeficit. Well, then, let us start helping our children by taking a \nforthright stand against the tax cut.\n  If we want to really help our children and grandchildren, let us take \na stand against a tax cut.\n  It would put us in the hole by another $180 billion in this year's 5-\nyear budget resolution before we even start to work on a plan to reduce \nthe deficit. To make matters worse, these revenue losses would \nskyrocket over the subsequent 5 years to $450 billion, making total \nrevenue losses over the next 10 years equal $630 billion. Ultimately, \nwhen all of the provisions of the House Ways and Means Committee bill \nare phased in--now. this is the so-called contract with America--the \nrevenue losses every year would be more than $110 billion.\n  Who would get the lion's share of the benefits of these tax cuts? \nAgain, according to the latest analysis by the Center on Budget and \nPolicy priorities, these large revenue losses, which would total $630 \nbillion over the next 10 years, are largely attributable to provisions \nthat heavily benefit upper-income households and large corporations.\n  In fact, according to a Treasury Department analysis, less than 16 \npercent of the benefits of the fully phased-in tax provisions as passed \nby the House Ways and Means Committee would go to the 60 percent of all \nfamilies with incomes below $50,000. The top 1 percent of families with \nincomes of $350,000 or more a year would receive 20 percent of the tax \nbenefits, while more than half of the tax goodies would go to the top \n12 percent of families--those with incomes over $100,000 per year.\n  Of the major provisions in the House Ways and Means Committee bill, \nthe changes in IRA's capital gains taxation, and the taxation of Social \nSecurity income are heavily tilted in favor of high-income people.\n  Past analyses indicate that about 95 percent of the benefits from the \ncurrent IRA proposal would go to the top fifth of the population.\n  According to an analysis by the Treasury Department, over half the \nbenefits from the House Ways and Means Committee's capital gains \nprovisions would go to the wealthiest 3 percent of families who have \nincomes over $200,000, while three-fourths of the benefits would go to \nthe top 12 percent of families who have incomes over $100,000 a year; \nand the House Ways and Means Committee's reduction in the proportion of \nSocial Security benefits that are subject to taxation would give a tax \nbreak to the top 13 percent of Social Security beneficiaries.\n  Similarly, the changes proposed by the House Ways and Means Committee \nin rates of depreciation and the repeal of the corporate Alternative \nMinimum Tax would substantially reduce taxes paid by the Nation's \nlargest corporations.\n  All of these new tax breaks, Mr. President, will have to be paid for. \nOver the next 5 years alone, we would have to find $180 billion in \nspending cuts; $630 billion over the next 10 years; and, every year \nthereafter, $110 billion per year in cuts in order to bankroll these \nsubsidies for the well off people in this country. That level of cuts \nwould have to be made if we were to enact the House Ways\n and Means Committee tax bill. Having made these cuts, we will just be \nbreaking even. We will not have reduced the deficit at all. We have \nheard all this crying out here on the Senate Floor over the cruel \neffects of budget deficits on our children and grandchildren. Yet, when \nit comes right down to it, the grandchildren do not vote so we will \njust wait a little longer to get serious about the deficit. Meanwhile \nwe can dole out a little more tax pork for the privileged few.\n\n  It is silly; utter folly. They talk, on the one hand, about reducing \nthese deficits so that we can finally get down to paying something on \nthe principal of the debt, stop having to pay interest on that debt, \nreduce the deficits, take defense off the table--do not touch defense--\neven increase defense, and, at the same time, balance the budget and, \nlo and behold, enact a tax cut. Enact a tax cut--what a joke.\n  I like to vote for tax cuts. That is easy. That does not take any \ncourage.\n  Where are these cuts to come from? The Ways and Means Committee will \nnot tell us the specifics; but, according to a Washington Post article \nof March 17, 1995, the House Budget Committee has approved the ``broad \noutlines of $190 billion in spending cuts over the next 5 years ``--for \nwhat?--'' to finance a massive GOP tax cut. Nearly half the reductions \nwould come from Welfare and Medicare and the rest from hundreds of \nother government programs and foreign aid.'' So, we cut programs for \nthe poor,\n we cut programs for the sick, we cut programs for the elderly. For \nwhat? So that another Rolls Royce can appear in the driveway of some \nfat cat. Well, that ought to get your blood pressure up. I have no \nproblem with the idea of slicing foreign aid, but the savings ought to \ngo toward reducing the deficit.\n\n  That same Washington Post article also lists what are called \n``suggestions in the House Budget Committee's proposal to cut \ndiscretionary spending by $100 billion over 5 years.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this article in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n        [[Page S4454]] [From the Washington Post, Mar. 17, 1995]\n\n  House Panel Plans Big Spending Cuts--$190 Billion Would Offset Tax \n                                 Breaks\n\n                    (By Eric Pianin and Dan Morgan)\n\n       The House Budget Committee yesterday approved by the broad \n     outlines of $190 billion in spending cuts over the next five \n     years to finance a massive GOP tax cut. Nearly half the \n     reductions would come from welfare and Medicare and the rest \n     from hundreds of other government programs and foreign aid.\n       Budget Committee Chairman John R. Kasich (R-Ohio) boasted \n     that his plan would assure that Republicans fully pay for a \n     tax package providing three times as much relief as one \n     proposed by President Clinton and begin to put the government \n     on ``the glide path'' to a balanced budget.\n       Republicans issued the proposals hours before the House \n     passed a separate bill that would pare $17.1 billion from the \n     current budget. Republicans had pledged that all the long-\n     term savings from that package would go for deficit reduction \n     and not to help pay for their tax cut. But early yesterday, \n     Kasich acknowledged that the promise had been nothing more \n     than a ``game'' to attract conservative Democratic support \n     for the bill, provoking a storm on the floor of the House.\n       The House approved the spending-cut package, 227 to 200, \n     despite widspread defections by fiscally conservative \n     Democrats who claimed they had been duped. The uproar further \n     soured Republican-Democratic relations and distracted from \n     the COP leadership's message that they were paying for tax \n     relief with ``real'' spendng cuts.\n       ``They lied in order to pass a bill they couldn't pass \n     otherwise,'' Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) \n     said.\n       Yesterday's contentious, sometimes confusing budget drama \n     underscored the House Republicans' challenge in juggling a \n     number of converging fiscal initiatives--proposing a huge tax \n     cut just as they are promising a balanced budget--with time \n     running out on their 100-day ``Contract With America'' \n     timetable.\n       The $17.1 billion spending-cut package initially was \n     devised by Republicans to offset the cost of disaster relief \n     for California and to make a down payment on the cost of the \n     tax package, although later they promised to use most of it \n     for deficit reduction. Separately, Kasich and his staff \n     prepared the plan for $190 billion of spending cuts to \n     finance the bulk of the tax cuts, along with a 10-page list \n     of ``illustrative Republican spending cuts'' to show where \n     most of those savings could be found. The five-year plan \n     would take effect in 1996.\n       In the coming weeks, Kasich must also complete work on yet \n     another initiative, a seven-year plan for balancing the \n     budget. All told, GOP leaders must come up with as much as \n     $1.2 trillion of cuts and savings to eliminate the deficit \n     and pay for the tax cuts by 2002, as they have pledged to do.\n       Meanwhile, about 100 moderate and fiscally conservative \n     Republicans have joined in a mini-revolt aimed at forcing the \n     leadership to peel back the cost of the proposed $500-per-\n     child tax credit--the most expensive piece of the GOP tax \n     plan--and target the benefits more narrowly to middle-class \n     families.\n       The Republicans have signed a letter circulated by freshman \n     Rep. Greg Ganske (Iowa) and House Agriculture Committee \n     Chairman Pat Roberts (Kan.) asking Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-\n     Ga.) to assure a floor vote on cutting the maximum income of \n     eligible families from $200,000 a year to $95,000 according \n     to several signers.\n       ``We took a little bit silly passing tax cuts when we don't \n     have any money,'' said Rep. Ray LaHood (R-Ill.), who declined \n     to sign the Contract With America because he opposes its tax \n     cuts.\n       Yesterday, Sens. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) and Rod Grams (R-Minn.) \n     introduced a $500-per-child tax credit proposal that is \n     similar to the version approved by the House Ways and Means \n     Committee earlier this week and provides benefits to families \n     making up to $200,000 a year.\n       While the drive for a major tax cut continues to enjoy \n     widespread support among House Republicans, Democrats and \n     Senate Republicans are wary of devoting precious resources to \n     a tax cut when polls indicate that voters are more concerned \n     about deficit reduction and many economists say a tax cut is \n     a bad idea.\n       But House GOP leaders refuse to back down on their campaign \n     pledge to slash taxes for families and businesses, and \n     yesterday Kasich unveiled his blueprint for financing the \n     package.\n       About $100 billion of the proposed savings would be \n     achieved by extending and lowering legally mandated limits on \n     discretionary spending over the next five years and leaving \n     it up to the appropriate House committees to determine where \n     the specific cuts would be made.\n  Suggestions in the House Budget Committee's proposal to cut \ndiscretionary spending by $100 billion over five years:\n                   Budget committee's five-year plan\n\n                        [In billions of dollars]\n\n  Reduce funding for ineffective training and employment programs...9.3\n  Eliminate Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program...............7.2\n  Reduce federal agency overhead....................................5.0\n  Reduce violent crime trust fund...................................5.0\n  Terminate support for the International Development Association...2.8\n  Cut funding to Agency for International Development...............2.7\n  Repeal the Davis-Bacon Act (sets wages for federal contracts in \n    construction industry)..........................................2.6\n  Cut National Institutes of Health funding by 5 percent............2.5\n  Reduce energy supply research and development.....................2.3\n  Reduce mass transit operating subsidies, capital grants...........2.3\n  Eliminate programs in National Telecommunications and Information \n    Administration..................................................2.2\n  Phase out Amtrak operating subsidies..............................1.6\n  Phase out funding of Legal Services Corp..........................1.6\n  Reform management of NASA's human space flight programs...........1.5\n  Terminate funding for the National Endowments for the Arts and \n    Humanities......................................................1.4\n  Place five-year moratorium on construction, acquisition of federal \n    buildings.......................................................1.3\n  Restructure National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.......1.2\n  Eliminate the Economic Development Administration.................1.2\n  Eliminate the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration and trade \n    promotion.......................................................1.1\n  Privatize the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.................1.0\n  Reduce programs in vocational and adult education.................0.9\n  Reduce assistance to Eastern Europe, former Soviet Union..........0.8\n  Eliminate wasteful rehabilitation of severely distressed public \n    housing.........................................................0.8\n  Cut contributions to international peacekeeping...................0.8\n  Reduce funding for Goals 2000 and School in Work programs.........0.7\n  Reduce funding for construction of Agriculture, Interior facilities \n    and trails......................................................0.7\n  Reduce domestic volunteer programs................................0.7\n  Reduce Energy Department's fossil energy research and development.0.7\n  Apply cost-benefit test to Superfund projects.....................0.5\n  Reduce General Accounting Office funding by 15 percent............0.3\n  Cut number of political appointees................................0.2\n  Reduce Peace Corps funding........................................0.2\n  Replace dollar bills with dollar coins............................0.1\n  Eliminate Small Business Administration's tree planting program (in \n    millions of dollars).............................................75\n  Terminate State justice Institute (in millions of dollars).........54\n  Other programs (in billions of dollars)..........................37.0\n                                                               ________\n\n      Total.......................................................100.4\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in other words, the House Budget Committee \nhas proposed a list of suggested discretionary spending cuts, totaling \n$100 billion over the next 5 years, which would be used, not for \ndeficit reduction, but to pay for more than half of the 5-year cost of \nthe tax breaks proposed by the House Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. President, the use of cuts in discretionary spending to pay for \ntax cuts is not permitted under the provisions of the Budget \nEnforcement Act. Rather, that act sets annual discretionary spending \nlimits which, if they are exceeded, will cause across-the-board \nsequesters sufficient to ensure that total discretionary spending stays \nwithin the caps. Similarly, pay-as-you-go procedures in section 252 of \nthe Budget Enforcement Act control mandatory spending and taxes. This \nis good policy because domestic discretionary spending, in large \nmeasure, goes to benefit the Nation in general. It should not be \nallowed to be ravaged in order to pay for tax favors--tax favors--for \nthe well-to-do.\n  What the House Republicans are actually proposing will require a \nchange in the Budget Enforcement Act to follow reductions in \ndiscretionary spending limitations to be used to pay for tax cuts for \nthe wealthy. That is bad policy. That is not just some obscure Budget \nAct process change. That is bad policy, and it ought not be sanctioned.\n  I note among the suggestions here, one, reduce violent crime trust \nfund, $5 billion. It was my proposal that we have a crime trust fund, \nand I think I found $21 billion or $22 billion or $23 billion to put in \nthat trust fund when we passed the crime bill--$30 billion. So here \nthey are going to whittle out $5 billion from the trust fund.\n  Reduce funding for ineffective training and employment programs. \nWell, it says ``ineffective.'' Whether or not they are ineffective we \nwill know.\n  Eliminate Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program; cut National \nInstitutes of Health funding by 5 percent; \n[[Page S4455]]  reduce energy supply research and development; reduce \nmass transit operating subsidies; phase out Amtrak operating subsidies; \nphase out funding of Legal Services Corporation, and so on and so on\n and so on.\n\n  Reduce programs in vocational and adult education; cut contributions \nto international peacekeeping; reduce funds for Goals 2000 and school-\nin-work programs; reduce funding for construction of agriculture/\ninterior facilities and trails.\n  Mr. President, we saw what happened in 1981 under President Reagan's \npolicies. He blew into town preaching deficit reduction and promising \nto balance the Federal budget while, at the same time, proposing to \nincrease defense spending and to cut taxes. Congress gave him what he \nasked for, and I gave him what he asked for.\n  The people of West Virginia said, ``He is a new boy on the block, \nhelp him, give him a chance.'' So I did. I voted to give him what he \nasked for. We passed his massive tax cuts in 1981, and I have been \nkicking myself ever since.\n  We passed his massive tax cuts in 1981, which cut revenues by $2.1 \ntrillion over the following 10 years. We provided huge increases in \ndefense spending as well, and I went along with that. I voted for \neverything he asked for. I wanted to give him a chance. That is what my \nconstituents told me to do. Supply-side economics, we were told, would \nkick in as a result of the tax cuts, and we would actually see more \nrevenues coming into the Treasury than would have come in without the \ntax cuts. We were going to ``grow our way'' out of our deficit problem. \nBut, it did not happen. Instead, we saw a string of budget deficits \nwhich were by far the largest in the history or the Nation. Those \ndeficits of President Reagan's 8 years were only exceeded by President \nBush's deficits, which stand as the largest in history. It should be \nclear that supply-side economics is a failed theory, and David Stockman \nknew it and said it in writing. It was bogus baloney. It was a flop and \nit was highly detrimental to this Nation.\n  It is why we are in this debate right today. It is why we are in the \npickle that we are in right today, because out of that colossal mistake \nthat we made came the largest budget deficits, a quadrupling of the \nnational debt and the pressure for a line-item veto and for \nconstitutional amendments to balance the budget. That is why we are in \nthis pickle. They brought us to this. We would not be debating a line-\nitem veto here today if we had not gotten caught up in that trap, that \nquadrupling the debt.\n  We are now being asked by the Republican leadership in the House to \ngo down that same road again.\n  It is really quite unbelievable, but that is what the proponents of \nthe huge tax cut believe. Talk about disregarding history. Talk about a \nflat learning curve. We have not learned anything from recent history. \nSome have not picked up a thing from the nightmare of the 1980's. This \nso-called Contract With America calls for massive tax cuts, increases \nin defense spending, and a balanced Federal budget by the year 2002. \nEven if defense spending is not increased, the House Ways and Means \nCommittee's tax cuts will cost $630 billion over the 10 years. That \ncost will have to be paid for, along with over $1 trillion in \nadditional spending cuts, in order to balance the Federal Budget by the \nyear 2002.\n  Well, I made that mistake in 1981. But this is one Senator who is not \nprepared to make the same mistake again. I do not intend to vote for \nany tax cuts this year--not President Clinton's and not the House Ways \nand Means Committee's proposal.\n  We say we are for deficit reduction, and I am for deficit reduction. \nI am for cutting spending where we can do so in a fair and equitable \nmanner and at the same time deal with our investment deficit in this \ncountry. We have not only a trade deficit, not only a fiscal deficit, \nbut we also have an investment deficit, an infrastructure deficit.\n  I am opposed to enacting spending cuts to pay for tax giveaways. Any \nsavings we can make should go toward reducing our deficit not lining \nsomebody's pockets.\n  My amendment provides that it shall not be in order in the Senate or \nHouse of Representatives to consider\n\n       Any concurrent resolution on the budget, bill, joint \n     resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that \n     decreases the discretionary spending limits unless the \n     concurrent resolution on the budget, bill, joint resolution, \n     amendment, motion, or conference report provides that such \n     decrease may only be used for deficit reduction and may not \n     be used to offset all or part of an increase in direct \n     spending or decrease in tax receipts under section 252 of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1974.\n\n  My amendment also creates a requirement that a waiver would require \nan affirmative vote of three-fifths of Senators duly chosen and sworn, \nas would an appeal of the ruling of the chair.\n  I urge Senators to support the amendment. If the rhetoric about \nbalancing the budget which has been flowing fast and thick in this \nCongress since we convened is to be believed, we need to take this \nimportant step.\n  Any private citizen paying attention will know that these huge \ndeficits will never be reduced if we are subsidizing wealthy tax payers \nwith back-loaded tax cuts at the same time we are trying to reduce the \ndeficit.\n  How ironic that we are voting before this day is over, voting to \nshift the control of the purse, vested in the hands of the people's \nrepresentatives in Congress, voting to shift that power to an \nexecutive, in the name of reducing deficits, in the name of balancing \nthe budget on the one hand and, on the other, let flow from our lips \nthe utter folly of advocating a tax cut. For what reason? To get votes.\n  Let us not stretch our already fragile credibility to the breaking \npoint by continuing to pretend that these obviously incompatible \ngoals--massive tax breaks and reduced deficits--can ever by reconciled \nin the real world.\n\n\n          amendment No. 350, as modified to amendment No. 347\n\n  Mr. President, on page 2, line 10, I modify my amendment and I ask \nunanimous consent to modify it by striking ``1974'' and inserting \n``1985.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 350), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . USE OF THE REDUCTIONS IN DISCRETIONARY SPENDING CAPS.\n\n       (a) Congressional Budget Act.--\n       (1) Budget resolutions and legislation.--Section 301 of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(j) Use of Reductions in Discretionary Spending Caps.--It \n     shall not be in order in the Senate or House of \n     Representatives to consider any concurrent resolution on the \n     budget, bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or \n     conference report that decreases the discretionary spending \n     limits unless the concurrent resolution on the budget, bill, \n     joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report \n     provides that such decrease may only be used for deficit \n     reduction and may not be used to offset all or part of an \n     increase in direct spending or decrease in receipts under \n     section 252 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985.''.\n       (2) Sixty vote point of order.--Subsections (c) and (d) of \n     section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 are \n     amended by inserting ``301(j),'' after ``301(i)''.\n       (b) Gramm-Rudman.--Section 252 of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n       ``(f) Use of Reductions in Discretionary Spending Caps.--A \n     decrease in the discretionary spending limits may only be \n     used for deficit reduction and may not be used to offset all \n     or part of an increase in direct spending or decrease in \n     receipts under this section.''.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have been listening with keen interest to \nthe excellent remarks made by my great friend and colleague from West \nVirginia. I want to compliment him, once again, for being able to seize \nthe key elements that tell the truth as it is. I am rising now \nprincipally to support the amendment that has been offered by the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia and to address what he had to say \nabout the history of the lack of fiscal management. I think it points \nout just how important the amendment he is offering tonight and why it \nbelongs on the important piece of legislation before us.\n  This amendment would strengthen and reinforce the pay-as-you-go \nrequirements in the current budget law. \n[[Page S4456]]  And certainly, Mr. President, I think it deserves our \nsupport. If only we had something like this during those other times \nwhen we went down that rosy scenario road that the Senator from West \nVirginia outlined.\n  I would like to take a few moments to discuss the logic of supporting \nthe current law, which fits right in with the amendment offered by the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, the current law requires the Government to account for \nannual appropriations spending separately from permanent changes in \ntaxes and entitlements. It is unwise for the Government to use savings \npromised by budget process changes to pay for tax cuts or entitlement \nexpansions, which, by their very nature, are permanent and require no \nadditional congressional action. They, theoretically, are there \nforever.\n  Under section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \nControl Act, annual caps on budget authority and outlays limit \ndiscretionary spending. Pay-as-you-go procedures in section 252 of the \nact control mandatory spending and taxes. The law setting forth these \npay-as-you-go procedures does not, in any way, mention changes in the \ndiscretionary spending limits.\n  The appropriations caps constrain the total amount of money that the \nCongress may appropriate. They do not, by themselves, spend money, nor \ncan anyone know that they will save money until Congress has enacted \nevery appropriations bill for the year in question. The Congressional \nBudget Office scores only actual appropriations, because they provide \nthe actual authority to spend. Changes in the caps, on the other hand, \ndo not yield immediate budgetary savings. If Congress reduces the caps, \nsubsequent appropriations bills, later appropriations, after-the-fact \nappropriations are the ones that determine whether or not we live up to \nthe goals that we have outlined.\n  The amount saved would not be available. I emphasize that again, Mr. \nPresident. The amount saved would not be available to offset \nlegislative changes in entitlements or taxes.\n  The Congressional Budget Office thus believes that it cannot include \ncap reductions on the pay-as-you-go scorecard without a change in the \nlaw. Sound reasons for support of the structure of the law--that is \nimportant. That is sound reasoning. Congress appropriates spending, \nyear by year, one year at a time.\n  Entitlement spending and tax cuts, on the other hand, often go on and \non and on forever unless Congress takes an affirmative action to trim \nthem back. To rely on budget processes, changes that promise to \nconstrain appropriations in future years to pay for tax cuts or \nentitlement expenses, is like buying an unaffordable new house based on \nthe expectation that a person is going to get a substantial raise each \nand every year that follows. It might work. But then again, Mr. \nPresident, it might not. Most times, it has not worked. We should not \nbase our Nation's fiscal policy on such promises and guesswork.\n  Under the current law, rewards follow responsibility. The law holds \nappropriated spending responsible for breaches of the appropriation \ncaps, and holds legislation under the jurisdiction of authorizing \ncommittees responsible for entitlement and tax law changes that do not \npay for themselves. Allowing committees of the Congress other than the \nAppropriations Committee to get credit for reducing appropriation caps \nwill encourage those committees to look to the appropriated spending \nrather than to themselves for deficit reduction.\n  The law links deficit reduction burdens and benefits, and we should \nkeep it that way.\n  A few days ago, the House Budget Committee reported out a piece of \nlegislation that would have allowed future reductions in appropriation \ncaps to be counted to offset the tax cuts, those tax cuts that Senator \nByrd outlined just a few moments ago.\n  My concern is, what is to stop the House Budget Committee from \nincluding such a provision in the budget resolution that they may \nreport next year? The amendment by the Senator from West Virginia would \nensure--I repeat, Mr. President--the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom West Virginia would ensure that they could not profit from such a \nprovision that on its face is so phony.\n  The amendment of the Senator from West Virginia would help to ensure \nthat any savings achieved from lowering the appropriation caps would go \nto deficit reductions. We all know now and we all understand that that \nwas the reason for the caps in the first instance, to try to bring \nsanity to the fiscal irresponsibility we have experienced for far too \nlong. The appropriation caps under this bill would go to deficit \nreduction. I suggest that that is the way it should be.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia simply would \nmake it more difficult to alter the existing law. He would preserve the \npay-as-you-go procedure that has served Congress so well over the past \nfew years, and make sure they are effective in the future.\n  Mr. President, I urge Senators to support the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from West Virginia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have just read the amendment from the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia. I regret, Senator Exon, that \nI did not get to hear your entire argument.\n  Mr. President, I do not think the Senate should adopt the Byrd \namendment because I think it is redundant, and I do not think we need \nit. I would like to explain why.\n  On the 28th day of February of this year, in response to an inquiry \nthat I as chairman of the Budget Committee made to the Congressional \nBudget Office, in the last correspondence signed by Robert Reischauer \nas Director, in response to two questions, the second of which was: Can \nlegislation that reduces the discretionary limits--that is, the caps--\nbe counted on the pay-as-you-go scoreboard?\n  Now, essentially, this question is answered in a rather lengthy \nparagraph which I will read shortly. Essentially, it says ``No.''\n  Now, what has happened is in the 1990 summit, followed by a \nreconciliation bill later on, the U.S. Congress distinguished \nappropriated accounts from taxes and entitlements and mandatory \nspending in two very fundamental ways.\n  First, as to appropriated accounts, they were to be governed and \ncontrolled by a mechanism called caps. That means that literally, until \n1998, there is an actual dollar number already existing for all of the \nappropriated accounts including defense. So we add them all up, Senator \nExon, and there is a literal dollar number. Later on, from time to \ntime, we might change those caps. But they are, nonetheless, caps.\n  What happens is that if we break those caps the budget is held \nharmless and returned to that level by a sequester, an automatic \nacross-the-board cut of appropriated accounts.\n  If we come in under those caps then that money does not go on any \nscorekeeping card nor is it counted as a reduction in the caps unless \nyou do that, and until the year's end nothing happens to that money \nbecause it is still subject to appropriation under the caps.\n  Now, that is one way of treating the combination of defense spending \nand appropriated domestic money. That is how it is treated.\n  Now, the rest of Government--that is, entitlement and taxes--are \ntreated differently. They are treated under language called pay-as-you-\ngo. Let me read what the Director of the OMB has to say about pay-go \naccounts.\n  Here is where I think our good friend, Senator Byrd, got the idea \nthat we needed to put a new law in place. Unless it is to tweak the \nHouse, because they went through an exercise of saying they were going \nto pay for taxes with appropriated accounts. CBO says they cannot do \nthat.\n  This is the CBO Director's response to that question. One, the Office \nof Management and Budget contends that current law allows a reduction \nin spending limits to offset increases in spending or losses of \nreceipts on the pay-as-you-go scoreboard.\n  The Congressional Budget Office disagrees. The current budget \nenforcement process reflects a clear decision by the lawmakers that \ndiscretionary \n[[Page S4457]] spending--a subject matter of Senator Byrd's amendment--\nthat discretionary spending would be subject to different budgetary \ncontrol mechanisms than would be applied to mandatory spending and \nreceipts or taxes.\n\n       Under current law [law that is in effect tonight] \n     discretionary spending is limited by annual caps on budget \n     authority and outlays. If enacted, discretionary \n     appropriations for any year exceed either cap, an across-the-\n     board sequestration of nonexempt appropriations would lower \n     discretionary spending to the level of the caps.\n\n  I stated that a little while ago. Now it is being stated in the \nlanguage of the CBO director, Dr. Robert Reischauer:\n\n       Mandatory spending and revenues are controlled by pay-as-\n     you-go procedures. Under PAYGO, OMB and CBO track all \n     mandatory spending and revenue legislation enacted since the \n     BEA. If at the end of a session of Congress such legislation \n     has, in total, increased the deficit for the current and \n     budget years, spending for nonexempt mandatory programs is \n     cut by the amount of the increase. Section 252 of the \n     Balanced Budget Act, which governs enforcement of the PAYGO \n     procedures, does not refer in any way to changes in the \n     discretionary spending limits.\n\n  Which is what is worrying the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia:\n\n       The limits on discretionary spending included in the BEA \n     and OBRA-93 constrain the overall amount of money that the \n     Congress may appropriate in a given year. They do not by \n     themselves create new budget authority or outlays, and CBO \n     and OMB have not reflected the limits in their scorekeeping \n     systems. CBO scores only actual appropriations, because they \n     provide the authority to spend. Changes to the discretionary \n     spending limits thus do not yield immediate budgetary \n     savings. If the discretionary spending limits were reduced, \n     the savings would be achieved through subsequent \n     appropriations bills, but the amounts saved would not \n     automatically be available to offset legislative changes in \n     mandatory spending or receipts.\n\n  That is the answer to the question and why we do not need the \namendment. Let me repeat:\n\n       If the discretionary spending limits were reduced, the \n     savings would be achieved through subsequent appropriations \n     bills, but the amounts saved would not automatically be \n     available to offset legislative changes in mandatory spending \n     or receipts. Therefore, CBO believes that reductions in the \n     discretionary spending limits cannot be included on the PAYGO \n     scorecard without a change in law.\n\n  I hope this information has been satisfactory, he says to me, writing \nthis letter.\n  Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for the Senator from West \nVirginia. And I have great, great empathy and concurrence with the \nnotion he is trying to achieve. The budget resolution produced by the \nSenator from New Mexico, coming out of our Senate committee, will \nfollow this law. If we reduce the discretionary caps the money \nallegedly saved will not be available for the pay-as-you-go scoreboard, \nwhich is the only place it could have gone to make room for tax cuts. \nAnd it does not go there. It does not go there by law.\n  So there is not any need to now say you cannot use savings by \nreducing the caps to offset taxes because that is the law. That is what \nthe director of CBO says. That is what our Parliamentarian is going to \nsay. I do not think there is any doubt about it. A point of order will \nlie, and we do not need to create it in a new piece of legislation \nbecause it already would lie if you attempted to offset in some way the \nsavings that will come from reducing appropriations to pay for tax \ncuts.\n  Incidentally, if there really was reason to do this it would be \nbecause the President of the United States--and that is stated in this \nletter, implicitly, at least--made a mistake. He found room in his \nbudget to pay for his so-called middle-class tax cuts by cutting \nappropriated accounts--lowering the caps. As a matter of fact he made \ntwo mistakes.\n  First is, he cannot do that. You need to get a waiver here. It should \nnot be in a budget without a clear statement that I need a 60-vote \nwaiver in the Senate because the law prohibits me from doing that. That \nis one mistake.\n  The second mistake, he used phony numbers. First he increased the \ncaps impropitiously, in a manner not prescribed by law. And then he \nreduced the caps to count some savings. And then he counted the savings \nto pay for the tax cuts. Every single step of that is either illegal or \nphony or a combination thereof.\n  That is not going to happen in a budget resolution in the Senate \nbecause it will get caught right here on the floor. If I try to do it \nwhen I put that budget resolution up there for debate, Senator Byrd \nwill get it. He will stand right up and say, ``You cannot do that.'' So \nlet me suggest, he is not going to get a chance to do that because I am \nnot going to do that. I will not bring a budget resolution to the floor \nof the U.S. Senate as chairman of a committee that flies smack in the \nface of this letter from the Congressional Budget Office that says that \nis not the law.\n  So, if anybody needed any assurance that is not the way we are going \nto do it here, you got it right now, because we are not going to do it \nthat way.\n  Well, I should not say it. If 61 Senators want to vote that we do it \nthat way, we will do it that way, the 61 votes are prescribed in this \namendment also as a way to waive it. You do not need that either.\n  So I regret coming down here. I think I made a case, however, and I \ndo not think I harmed Senator Byrd's position at all because I think he \nmakes the right point. But I do not think we need the amendment. \nFrankly, if there is anything else we have to do by way of amending the \nBudget Act we are going to have some more hearings. I have committed it \nto the Budget Committee. We will get onto some other changes in the \nBudget Impoundment Act. There are a lot people want to do. Besides, I \nam not at all sure--I say to my friends on the other side--how soon \nthis line-item veto will get out of conference. There are some very big \ndifferences between this bill as it leaves the U.S. Senate and the bill \nthat the U.S. House of Representatives passed. There are very, very big \ndifferences.\n  As a matter of fact, I think we will have a budget resolution on the \nfloor, I say to my friend, Senator Byrd, before that conference report \nwill ever get back. So this amendment, if it is on there, is not going \nto help that situation. But I am here to say I am going to try to help \nbecause I do not have to give a speech as to why, why we should not use \nappropriated accounts, the Paygo accounts. We went through that. We \nspent weeks on end figuring this out. There is no intention whatsoever \nto use discretionary programs of this country to pay for tax cuts or \nentitlement increases, and I do not think that is the way it is going \nto be.\n  And I do not think that is the way it is going to be.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have no doubt that the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico means exactly what he says. He has no intention of doing that. \nThat is not what the House is saying. The House wants to change the \nlaw. I do not want to see the law changed. I think we ought to have \nthis amendment. This would also apply to any reductions in the \ndiscretionary spending limits which might occur pursuant to any budget \nresolution in the future.\n  The Senator from New Mexico agrees that the summit agreement--we were \nboth there--and resulting Budget Enforcement Act do not allow domestic \nspending cuts to be used for pay-go. This amendment will make it \nperfectly clear that any reductions in discretionary spending limits \nwill be used for one purpose only, deficit reduction.\n  Does the Senator from New Mexico agree that that should be the case?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Did I yield for a question? I thought I still had the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator does.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The reason I say that is that I am supposed to be \nsomewhere in a minute. I want to get the floor back, and then I will \nyield very quickly.\n  Let me just make this point. There have been some discussions on the \nfloor of the Senate about the amendment that is going to pass, the \nline-item veto that is going to pass. There has been some discussion \nabout how different it was in the original Domenici-Exon line-item \nveto. Let me just say there is one aspect to this line-item veto that \nthe American people ought to understand, and that Senators ought to \nunderstand.\n  First, I will premise it on the following. None of us really knows \nwhether this will be a significant shift of power, whether Presidents \nnow or in the future will use line-item veto to gain \n[[Page S4458]] some significant leverage that they should not have or a \nmyriad of other concerns that are on the side of those who are \nreluctant to vote for this.\n  But I might suggest there has been one exchange made in the Budget \nCommittee and carried over here, and even made a little better. That is \na sunset provision. This bill, as it leaves here in a compromise \nbetween the distinguished Senator from Arizona and the Senator from New \nMexico, carries a 5-year sunset. That means that if we look at this \nmaybe in 3 years and it is not working too well, or in 4 years, clearly \nwhen that 5th year comes, it is gone. If Presidents in the meantime \nchoose to make it this big power shift, you see that this sunset means \nthat we do not have to send them anything.\n  But if we send them a new bill, there will not be any law on the \nbooks. So they will not have the veto pen out to make us do it their \nway. That is if we are going to pass another law to change it or modify \nit. I think everybody should know that. That is a bit of protection for \nthe uncertainties that come with legislation of this type.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank you for that. That is the only good provision in \nthis package that we are about to vote on tonight; the only good \nprovision. I fully support that provision.\n  But I call attention to the distinguished Senator's statement in the \n``Report on the Legislative Line-Item Veto Act of 1995.'' Senator \nDomenici, according to this statement, ``The Additional Views of \nSenator Pete V. Domenici''--I do not know what the ``V.'' stands for; I \nwant Pete to tell me what that is:\n\n       I do not support S. 4 because I believe it will delegate \n     too much authority to the President over the control of the \n     budget . . .\n\n  I do not believe he supported S. 4. I think that S. 14, which \nrepresented his views, is the bill that we ought to be passing. And \nthat is the bill with some important additions that the distinguished \nminority leader introduced as a substitute. He included the additions \non taxes as well, which was an improvement. I am sorry that the Senator \nobjected to that. But I supported that measure when the distinguished \nSenator's committee reported it out.\n  I thank the Senator. I am glad that there is that sunset provision:\n\n       Boast not thyself of tomorrow, for thou knowest not what a \n     day may bring forth.\n\n  I do not know whether I will be here 5 years from now. None of us \nknow. Not any man or woman in this Chamber can foresee whether he in \ntruth will be here when that 5 years rolls around. But that is within \nmy present term, and although I intend to be running that period, \nplanning that year for the next election, the next year, I cannot boast \nmyself of tomorrow because I do not know what a day may bring forth.\n  But I hope I am here when that sunset provision runs out because I \nwant to do everything I can to see that this monstrosity does not have \na future life, as much as I do believe in a future life.\n  While I am on any feet, I want to compliment the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona. He has fought for this legislation over the \nyears. I do not think this is the legislation he really wants. It is \nnot the legislation that he agrees that he has expressed support for \nover the years, but he is about to achieve a victory of sorts.\n  I compliment him on a job well done.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, the ``V.'' in my \nname is my mother's maiden name. Her father was named Pete--like me--\nVichi, V-i-c-h-i. She wanted so much to have as much of her father as \nshe could. She gave me his first name, and she gave me his initial, and \nthen my father insisted that I, nonetheless, have his name. So that is \nwhere it came from.\n  Mr. President, I want to make one other comment. The legislation is \ndifferent in another way. The sunset is brief. It is 1 year shorter \nthan previously reported out of the committee. But there is another \nthing. I know this would never be enough to convince the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia. But this does make it such that individual \nvetoes can be voted on separately in the U.S. Senate. They do not have \nto be packaged, as in the original McCain proposal or the original \nDomenici proposal.\n  And, in a sense, for those who do not like the line-item veto, or are \nworried about it or frightened of it, that is thought to be a little \nbetter protection than if you have to vote, like the military BRAC \nCommission, take it or leave it. At least you can take one at a time. \nThat is one other aspect of this that I thought we ought to put on \nrecord as being different and changing things a bit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, before my good friend and colleague leaves \nthe floor--I know he has another matter--I just wanted to make a few \nbrief comments. First, that I have had a very close relationship with \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee for a long, long time. Although we \ndo not always agree, we have a good working relationship that is going \nto carry through in the future. I hope to try to solve the mammoth \nproblems that are going to be pushed off on the Budget Committee, and \nto help where the decisions have to be made.\n  I have listened to the statements he made in opposition to the \namendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia. I listened very \ncarefully to the quotes he made by the former CBO Director, Dr. \nReischauer, who is no longer there. We have a new CBO Director now. I \nagree, I think, almost word for word, paragraph by paragraph, point by \npoint, with everything the chairman of the Budget Committee said. Then \nwhy are we arguing? We are arguing because the chairman seems to feel \nthat just because we have a policy that has existed in the past, that \nthat is going to continue to be the policy in the future.\n  Senator Byrd, I think, has no quarrel with what the Senator from New \nMexico is saying. We have no quarrel with what Senator Domenici says he \nintends to do. Senator Byrd has a quarrel, and I have a quarrel, and I \nthink you, Senator Domenici, have a quarrel with what is going on on \nthe other side of the Hill.\n  What we are trying to do--since this measure that is going to pass is \ngoing to be the law of the land--is to put into place, in law, once \nagain now, provisions to tell the House of Representatives that we are \nnot going to allow them to continue what they are doing, which is in \nviolation of what Dr. Reischauer previously said.\n  I think we all agree. I think what we are simply saying to my friend, \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee, is if you agree with Dr. \nReischauer, then you agree with Senator Byrd. The only disagreement you \nseem to have is that it is redundant and it is not necessary.\n  I would simply say that I really think this amendment is obviously \nnecessary, given what is going on in the House of Representatives today \nin that Budget Committee. And we have a new director over there of the \nCongressional Budget Office. What is to stop the Budget Committee from \ntelling the Congressional Budget Office to do differently in the budget \nresolution than what Dr. Reischauer had indicated earlier, as was \nextensively and accurately quoted by the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee.\n  I would simply say that I believe we are talking by each other as we \ndo often times here in this body. As near as I can tell, Senator \nDomenici, the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Byrd, myself, \nand many others all agree. And if the only reason not to adopt the Byrd \namendment is because it is redundant, then this is the time when \nredundancy is vitally important because of what is going on in the \nHouse of Representatives. The House's recent actions are anything but \nredundant with regard to what we have done in the past.\n  All Senator Byrd is trying to do with this amendment--and I am \nsurprised that there is opposition on the other side--is to say, let us \nkeep doing business the same way we have done it in the past. Some \npeople say you do not have to say that because it is redundant.\n  Well, just look at what is going on in the House of Representatives \ntoday. They are making cuts in vital programs for infants and children \nand mothers and senior citizens, and all the underprivileged of the \nNation, for the purpose of putting in a tax cut that benefits primarily \nthe wealthiest citizens of this Nation. They are only going to be able \nto do that over there \n[[Page S4459]] if they make some changes in the rules and regulations \nthat we have followed in the past.\n  What Senator Byrd is simply saying, I say to my colleagues on both \nsides of this aisle, is let us not fool ourselves again. Let us not go \ndown that path that we did in the 1980's by charting new courses and \ngoing through rosy scenarios and inventing systems such as what--I have \nalways called the laughable curve. I think it was really the Laffer \ncurve, but I called it the laughable curve. The laughable curve in the \n1980's is back with us once again under a different name. It is rosy \nscenario. It is changing the rules.\n  All that Senator Byrd's amendment tries to do, and I think the \nchairman of the Budget Committee agrees with it, if I heard him \ncorrectly--and he is a very honest and honorable man--is let us leave \nthings the way they are. In this very important new piece of \nlegislation that in some form is going to become the law of the land \nlet us say once again that we are not going to be carried off course, \nand that we are going to be using the cuts that we make to reduce the \ndeficit and not to irresponsibly, irrationaly, and unreasonably make \ntax cuts that even the Senate committees run by Republicans on this \nside of the Capitol, indicate do not make sense.\n  The Byrd amendment makes sense. It is in keeping with what I think is \nthe feeling of my chairman, Senator Domenici of the Budget Committee. I \ncannot see why we are arguing about something that we seem to all agree \nwith. If the only argument not to accept the Byrd amendment is that it \nis redundant, then it is the type of redundancy, Mr. President, that we \nneed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I understand that the Democratic leader would like to \nspeak on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Thank you, Mr. President. Let me commend the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska for his comments. I feel very \nstrongly about this issue as well. And I commend the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia for offering the amendment.\n  It is appropriate that this is the last amendment. It is appropriate \nin part because the distinguished Senator from West Virginia has made \nit clear all along that there are some very fundamental concerns here, \nand one of the biggest concerns we have is the vagary of the \nlegislation to begin with. There is a vagary on what the scope of tax \nlegislation is. There is a vagary on its constitutionality. There is a \nvagary, frankly, on the balance of power, as the Senator from New \nMexico just indicated. We are not sure what this is going to do. We are \nnot sure just how much of a shift down to the White House this may \nrepresent. There is certainly a vagary with regard to the degree of \npracticality or of the prudence in taking a simple bill and making it \n1,500 or 2,000 pages. There is a lot of vagary here. But how ironic it \nwould be if in the interest of deficit reduction, with all the other \nvagaries, we did not even know this was going to reduce the deficit, we \nhad no idea whether or not ultimately we were going to accomplish what \nI thought brought us here in the first place, which is to reduce the \ndeficit. That would be the ultimate irony.\n  All the distinguished Senator from West Virginia is saying is let us \nbe true to our goal. If we are going to do this, let us be absolutely \ncertain there is no mistake about why we are doing it. Before we vote \non final passage, regardless of what assurances we may be given by CBO, \nregardless of what budgetary guidelines normally we must follow--as the \nSenator from Nebraska has so appropriately said, we do not know what is \ncoming over from the other side. We do not know how many times things \nmay come over from the other side that will dictate a situation that \ncould otherwise undermine the intent of this legislation.\n  So let us be clear. This is our last opportunity to say with an \nexclamation point, ``Here is why we are doing it. This is why it is \nimportant.'' If we are going to line-item veto specific provisions in \nthe bill, then it better be designated for one purpose and one purpose \nonly. Regardless of the agenda in the Contract With America, regardless \nof what intentions the House may have, we now know that it is going to \ngo to deficit reduction because of the Byrd amendment.\n  So I think it is very appropriate that this is the last amendment \nbecause it ought to clarify with no equivocation why we have spent the \nlast week debating line-item veto.\n  We are not supporting a line-item veto because we want to offer an \nagenda for tax reform or tax cuts, for tax cuts that we may not want. \nThat is not why we are doing this. We do not want to provide more \nopportunities to cut taxes and create even greater imbalance between \nthe wealthy and the middle class in this country. That ought to be a \nfight for another day. What we are here for is to reduce the deficit. \nWhat we are here for is to be absolutely certain that if we have \ndesignated the President with new powers, we understand what those \npowers are for. It is to reduce the deficit and nothing else.\n  So I hope that colleagues on both side of the aisle, regardless of \nwhether they think we have said it loudly enough or clearly enough, can \nappreciate the concern for vagary once more in this legislation.\n  The courts are going to determine whether or not this is \nconstitutional. Ultimately, we will probably be able to determine what \nkind of a shift in the balance of power results. The courts will also \ndetermine, I suppose, what will happen with regard to the scope of tax \nlegislation, but we ought to be the ones to determine for what the \nline-item veto is going to be used. And if we determine it, we have our \nopportunity with this amendment to say it is going to be used for \ndeficit reduction and that is it.\n  So, Mr. President, there is nothing more to say than that. The \npurpose of this amendment is very clear. Again, as so many amendments \nthat we have offered have attempted to do, we are trying to improve \nthis legislation in a way that allows us the confidence that, indeed, \nwe are doing what we say we want to do.\n  So I commend the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for the \namendment. I am very hopeful that in an overwhelming bipartisan \nconsensus we can adopt it before this bill is enacted into law. And \nwith that I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I will be very brief in my remarks.\n  I first want to rise in support of the Byrd amendment. As everyone \nhere knows, the House Budget Committee last week proposed a change in \nthe Budget Act that would permit reductions in discretionary spending \nto be used to offset lost revenues resulting from tax cuts, rather than \nto reduce the deficit. This is one of the most irresponsible proposals \nI have seen since coming to the U.S. Senate. Everyone in Congress \nspeaks loudly and clearly about the need for spending cuts in order to \nreduce the deficit. However, one of the first things the new Republican \nmajority in Congress has proposed is to, rather than reducing the \ndeficit, cut spending on programs that help some of the neediest people \nin the country so that we can pay for tax cuts for some of the \nwealthiest people in America.\n  I heard the distinguished Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici, argue that the Byrd amendment would replicate current law. \nWhile that might be technically true, given the House Budget \nCommittee's actions last week, the Senate needs to go on record in \nopposition to using spending cuts to pay for tax cuts. These cuts must, \nand should, be used to reduce the deficit. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Byrd amendment.\n  I also would like to spend a few minutes discussing the Dole line-\nitem veto proposal that will be voted on tonight. I want to pay tribute \nto my esteemed colleague from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, who, in my \nopinion, is always on the side of the angels when it comes to assaults \non the Constitution, always on the side of the angels in understanding \nwhat James Madison and John Jay and Alexander Hamilton meant when they \ntalked about the separation of powers.\n  The first time I ever heard that expression I was in the ninth grade. \nThe concept of separation of powers was refined for me somewhat when I \nread the Federalist Papers for the first time when I was an \nundergraduate student at the University of Arkansas. Then I \n[[Page S4460]] went off to law school and studied a full course in \nconstitutional law and almost a full course on the Federalist Papers. \nIt is a tragedy that every high school student in this country does not \nhave at least one semester on that sacred document called the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  John Jay, Alexander Hamilton, and James Madison created the concept \nof the separation of powers as a method of protecting the public. They \nput it in the Constitution because it was an important idea that should \nnot get swept away with a momentary trendy, popular idea. So here we \nare with a very momentary, popular, trendy idea that could very well be \nan unmitigated disaster for the country--the Dole line item veto \nproposal.\n  I remember when I was Governor of Arkansas 250 magnificent prints of \na mockingbird showed up to be signed by the Governors of the five \nStates that had the mockingbird as their State bird. When these prints \narrived I spent all night long signing my name 250 times on those \nprints. And of the 250, I got 50, Preston Smith in Texas got 50, the \nother three Governors got 50. They all spent all night long signing \ntheir names, too.\n  We are going to see similar signing ceremonies if the Dole proposal \never becomes law. Poor President Clinton. He does not sleep very much \nas it is. I have known him for years. He gets by on less sleep than \nanybody I have ever known, but he cannot get by with the 2 hours a \nnight that will be left if he is forced to sign all those billettes \nsent up by Congress.\n  Mr. President, I would not be surprised if within 2 years from this \nmoment, the Dole proposal will have been found to be such a disaster, \nso unworkable, there would be a clamor to repeal it.\n  Mr. President, I went to Wake Forest 3 or 4 weeks ago to speak at a \nconvocation of their law school. The subject of my speech was on the \n``Trivialization of the United States Constitution.'' While we are not \ndealing with a constitutional amendment today, we are dealing with an \nassault on the Constitution.\n  I voted for Senator Hatch's amendment to try to retain some semblance \nof the constitutional balance or power. Can you imagine what FDR would \nhave done when he called the Supreme Court those nine old men who kept \nstriking down the laws that he was trying to get passed to get this \ncountry moving again--nine old men. He detested them. He wanted to pack \nthe Court by putting six more members on the bench. At first, everybody \nthought that was pretty good idea. Just like at first everybody thinks \nthe Dole proposal is a good idea. All of the sudden, the people of this \ncountry decided that was one thing they did not want FDR to have the \nauthority to do.\n  But can you imagine the President of the United States having a line-\nitem veto on the Supreme Court? The Constitution would prohibit him \nfrom cutting their salaries, but he could sure turn the lights out. He \ncan cut the heat off. James Madison would just be whirling in his grave \nif he knew this debate was going on.\n  We, as Members of Congress are not perfect. There is plenty of pork \nto go around. Anybody who beats his chest on the floor of this body and \nsays, ``I'm above that'' is not being entirely truthful. All you would \nhave to do is ask that Senator how he or she voted on the space \nstation. That is the biggest piece of pork in the history of the world. \nHow did they vote on the super collider, the second biggest piece of \npork in the history of world? How did they vote on that $400 million \nwind tunnel the other day, the third biggest piece of pork? No, it is \nthat little $1 million lab down in some poor rural state that is pork.\n  So, Mr. President, as I say, we are not perfect.\n  But we have been doing some things right. Over the last several years \nwe have taken a number of concrete steps in an effort to deal with the \ndeficit. If we are serious about the deficit, we need to agree to work \nin a bipartisan manner and say to the American people, ``Yes, we are \ngoing to get the deficit under control and we are not going to squander \nthe opportunity to get the deficit under control by putting out a \npolitically inspired tax cut to people who do not want it.''\n  So we have a golden opportunity. And instead we are squandering it \nwith another assault on the Constitution by shifting the power of the \npurse to the executive branch. We want the President to be king.\n  The one thing the Founding Fathers in 1787 said in Philadelphia, ``We \nhave had enough kings. We don't want any more kings. We are going to \nhave a President.''\n  And until this moment, they have succeeded magnificently. We have had \n42 Presidents and no kings. I wonder how much longer that is going to \nlast.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, I make a motion to table the Byrd amendment, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Arizona to table the amendment of the Senator from \nWest Virginia. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the separate \nenrollment bill offered by Majority Leader Dole because I do not \nbelieve that it represents a true compromise. I cannot support \nlegislation that requires a two-thirds vote of both Houses of Congress \nto disapprove a presidential item veto because I see it as an \nunwarranted tilting of the balance of power away from Congress--the \nbranch of government that is closest to the people.\n  I believe that separate enrollment legislation would be both \nunconstitutional and unduly burdensome. This bill requires the \nenrolling clerk to enroll each individual item in appropriations bills \nor legislation that includes new entitlement spending or a new targeted \ntax benefit. The definition of a targeted tax benefit is ambiguous, \nand \n[[Page S4461]] the application of new entitlement spending is unclear.\n  What is clear is that this slice and dice approach could break up one \nbill into more than 2,000 separate pieces of legislation. As Senator \nByrd noted, if separate enrollment requirements had been in place last \nyear, it would have required the President to review 9,625 separate \nappropriations measures, instead of just 13 appropriations bills. \nSeparate enrollment would surely be a boon to the Presidential pen \nmanufacturers industry, but a logistical nightmare for everyone else.\n  I have always been very concerned about line-item veto legislation. \nBut, I could support a reasonable version this year because of the \nenvironment in which we now find ourselves.\n  We recently completed a lengthy debate on the balanced budget \namendment. That proposal failed--fortunately, in my view. But at least \nfive other Constitutional amendments--on tax limitation, term limits, \nunfunded mandates, school prayer and flag burning--are waiting in the \nwings.\n  The new Congressional leadership has expressed an unprecedented \ndesire to enact the Republican agenda not only in statute, but into the \npermanent Constitution of the Nation.\n  This is the context in which I am willing to support statutory \nchanges that I might not otherwise have endorsed. In contrast to \nConstitutional amendments, we can easily change statutory language if \nwe find that it has not met our expectations or has had unintended \nconsequences.\n  I support the substitute offered by Senator Daschle. I believe it is \na reasonable line-item veto alternative. It requires both Houses of \nCongress to vote on a President's rescission list and sets up a fast-\ntrack procedure to ensure that a vote occurs in a prompt and timely \nmanner.\n  My change of heart is not based on a belief that strengthened line-\nitem authority will be effective in curbing spending. It is based on a \nwillingness to give a reasonable measure a try.\n  Line-item veto legislation has always been trumpeted as a critical \ntool to reduce the deficit. Its supporters argue that any \nConstitutional concerns are eclipsed by the need to rein in a free-\nspending Congress. They argue by anecdote that strengthened rescission \nauthority is essential to impose fiscal discipline and eliminate \negregious pork-barrel spending. There is, however, little evidence that \nline-item authority reduces spending in any significant way.\n  Here is what the experts have to say. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office: ``* * * the potential for the item veto to decrease the \ndeficit is uncertain.'' The General Accounting Office states: ``* * * \nrescissions cannot be expected to serve as a significant deficit \nreduction or spending limitation tool.''\n  If one doubts the effect of rescissions on the Federal budget, we can \nlook to the example of the States. Forty-three States grant their \ngovernors line-item veto authority. Studies have shown that less than 1 \npercent of budgetary savings is typically achieved by these States \nthrough the item veto. The State of Wisconsin--which has one of the \nmost generous item vetoes in the Nation--is a good case study. An \nanalysis of 542 line-item vetoes in Wisconsin found that budget savings \nattributable to the Governor's use of item veto authority ranged from \nonly .006 percent to 2.5 percent.\n  Former President Ronald Reagan was one of the most vocal champions of \na line-item veto. In fact, in honor of his persistent support, the \nHouse passed its line-item bill on his birthday. The fact is, however, \nthat when the former President was Governor of California, he used his \nline-item authority to rescind an average of less than 2 percent of the \nState's budget.\n  While its impact on spending levels is likely to be small, the Dole \nlegislation raises important Constitutional separation of powers \nquestions. Granting new rescission authority would shift the delicate \nbalance of powers our founders established, and would inordinately \nincrease Presidential power over spending priorities.\n  The framers did not flip a coin to divvy up powers among our three \nbranches of government. They were familiar with tyranny and were \nconcerned about vesting too much power in the hands of any one person. \nThey believed that the Nation's priorities should be determined by a \nlarge and highly accountable body of representatives. They wanted \nCongress to make public policy by deciding whether and how much money \nshould be allocated. So they specifically granted the power of the \npurse to Congress--not to the President.\n  In Federalist 58, James Madison wrote:\n\n       This power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the \n     most complete and effectual weapon with which any \n     constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the \n     people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for \n     carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.\n\n  Strengthening the President's power over the purse could yield \ndangerous and unintended consequences. Expanded line-item authority \ncould be used to arm-twist individual legislators into adhering to the \npresident's political priorities. Legislators could be coerced into \nsupporting policy positions out of fear for vital projects in their \nState or district.\n  It is clear that granting greater line-item authority increases an \nexecutive's say over not just how much money will be spent but also \nover what will be spent. In the hands of a creative and aggressive \nchief executive, this power could be wielded to subvert the most basic \ndecisions and policies of the legislature.\n  The line-item veto can be taken to ridiculous extremes by strong \nchief executives. In Wisconsin, Governor Tommy Thompson has exercised \nhis generous line-item authority on some 1500 occasions. Governor \nThompson has been unafraid to wield his veto pen, and he has been \nimaginative in doing so. He has gone so far as to delete individual \nletters, words and lines from the budget to stand the legislature's \nintent on its head.\n  The Governor's prolific and inventive use of the line-item veto \nattracted a great deal of attention in his State--so much so that \nWisconsin citizens voted to amend the State constitution to bar the \nGovernor's use of the so-called ``Vanna White Veto.'' It was so named \nbecause Governor Thompson used his veto to imitate the ``Wheel of \nFortune'' star who came to fame by flipping letters.\n  Here are just a few examples. In one instance, Governor Thompson was \nsent a bill establishing a 48-hour maximum detention for certain \njuvenile offenders. He creatively used his line-item veto authority to \nincrease that limit to 10 days.\n  In another instance, the Governor gutted a $650,000 clean energy \nrebate program by eliminating all the words except ``$50,000'' and \n``program'', thereby providing $50,000 for an unspecified program--\nmystery pork, you might say. On two occasions, he used his line-item \nauthority to raise taxes.\n  On yet another occasion, Governor Thompson redirected $83 million of \na $183 million property tax relief measure to the State's general fund \nfor other purposes. As one member of the State assembly pointed out, \nsuch actions have resulted in the Governor literally vetoing budget \nitems into existence.\n  While Governor Thompson has been somewhat more inventive than his \npredecessors in exercising item veto authority, his intent has been the \nsame as his fellow governors. A 12-year study of the State's item veto \nrevealed that Wisconsin's Governors were likely to use the authority to \npursue their own policies or political goals--but not to reduce \nspending.\n  Wisconsin is not alone. The Congressional Budget Office recently \nconcluded that ``although the item veto may affect State budgets, it is \nmore likely to substitute the Governor's priorities for those of the \nlegislature than it is to reduce spending.''\n  While much has been made about the need to increase the President's \nrescission authority, all evidence suggests that current authority \nworks quite well.\n  In the 20-year history of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment \nControl Act of 1974, Congress has enacted more than $92 billion in \nrescissions, compared to $72 billion requested by six Presidents. This \npoint bears repeating: Congress has rescinded $20 billion more in \nspending than requested by Presidents over the last two decades.\n  Earlier this month, one likely Presidential candidate announced that \nhe \n[[Page S4462]] would not seek his party's nomination. Explaining his \ndecision, he declared that he wanted to focus on real economic issues, \nbut that his party was more interested in gimmicks and procedural \nissues. That candidate was none other than Jack Kemp.\n  I believe that the line-item veto is just one more procedural duck \ndesigned to serve as a substitute for the difficult and painful budget \nchoices needed to balance the budget.\n  In less than 2 weeks, the Senate Budget Committee is required by law \nto report a budget resolution. All evidence suggests that our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have no intention of meeting \nthis statutory deadline. Apparently, when the Congressional Compliance \nAct was signed into law earlier this year requiring Congress to abide \nby all laws it imposes on everyone else, the new majority put in a \nhidden rider exempting Congress from obeying its own internal laws.\n  The 104th Congress has now been in session for 12 weeks. At least \ntwo-thirds of the Senate's time has been occupied considering process \nchanges that would make none of the difficult and painful decisions \nneeded to put our fiscal house in order.\n  Members of Congress have had ample opportunity to bemoan the economic \nillnesses our country faces and offer seemingly painless magic potions \nto cure them. Most of these proposed cures have been worse than the \ndisease. And all have been lacking in the basic political leadership \nand courage that is necessary to solve our problems.\n  At the end of the day--balanced budget amendment, or no balanced \nbudget amendment, line-item veto or no line-item veto--we have to roll \nup our sleeves and get to work.\n  I am willing to support a reasonable line-item veto proposal. I can \nsupport one that guarantees the President a majority vote. But I cannot \nsupport any line-item proposal that hands the President plus a small \nminority in either House of Congress the power to govern.\n  I am not willing to undermine the delicate balance of powers created \nby our Founding Fathers in our zeal to respond to a contemporary \neconomic problem.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, there has been uncertainty expressed \nregarding some of the language contained in the Dole line-item veto \nsubstitute. It is important to clarify the language in order to give \nguidance to those who will be responsible for implementing it.\n  The major area of uncertainty has surrounded the definition of \ntargeted tax benefit under the Dole substitute and, in particular, the \nmeaning of ``similarly situated taxpayers.'' I would like to enter into \nthe Record a few comments to further clarify this issue.\n  It has been suggested that ``similarly situated taxpayers'' may refer \nto taxpayers who are engaged in a particular activity. Democrats would \nnot disagree with this as one interpretation of the language.\n  As I did last night, I would like to take an example because I \nbelieve this helps focus the discussion. Speaking in generalities can \nonly get us so far, and, as I said, it is important that we provide \nsome specific guidance for those who will be implementing this \nlanguage.\n  Suppose that a proposal is raised to provide a tax credit for \nresearch expenses incurred by companies promoting conservative causes. \nI don't believe anyone would argue that this proposal should not be a \nsubject to scrutiny under the line-item veto legislation. Everyone \nwould agree that a tax benefit solely for companies that do research in \nan effort to promote a specific cause is a special interest tax break. \nAnd, as a special interest tax break, it ought to be subject to \npossible line-item veto.\n  But, what if someone were to say, ``Compared to those taxpayers who \npromote conservative causes, there is no special treatment here.'' In \nother words, what if we define ``engaged in a particular activity'' as \nthe identical activity for which the special tax break is given. \nClearly, this leads to a ludicrous result, and clearly that is not what \nis intended.\n  Again, common sense dictates that the particular activity to which \nthe measure should be compared is business research or some broader \nactivity. When this is the comparison group, then we obtain the right \nresult--that is, that the provision is subject to potential line-item \nveto.\n  Let me turn another point of clarification, relating to the \napplication of the Dole substitute to direct spending measures. Again, \nit is important that we make these clarifications for those who will be \ncharged with implementing this legislation.\n  Nowhere in the language of the Dole substitute does it say that \napplication of the line-item veto will be restricted to increases in \ndirect spending. Both decreases in spending and increases in spending, \ntherefore, potentially will be subject to the veto pen.\n  The result is that the Dole language would treat direct spending \ndifferently from targeted tax benefits. A reduction in entitlement \nspending would be subject to potential line-item veto, whereas a tax \nincrease clearly would not be subject to line-item veto.\n  There are the points of clarification I wished to make at this time \nfor the Record. It is my hope and intention that these will provide \nadequate guidance to those in both Chambers who will face the important \ntask of interpreting and implementing the line-item veto legislation we \nenact.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my strong \nsupport for line-item veto legislation, and specifically the Dole \nsubstitute amendment before us today. I would like to thank the \nMajority Leader and my colleagues Senator McCain, and Senator Coats for \ntheir leadership and hard work in drafting a compromise bill that has \ngained wide support in the Senate. I believe the Dole amendment is good \nlegislation. I hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwill join me in supporting this important piece of legislation granting \nline-item veto authority for the President.\n   In light of our Nation's $4.8 trillion public debt, which is $18,500 \nfor every American, I believe enacting line-item veto legislation would \nbe an important step to reduce Federal deficit spending. Obviously, \nline-item veto legislation by itself would not eliminate our yearly \nbudget deficits, but it would create a critical link in our efforts to \ncontrol and effectively reduce the enormous public debt. I am committed \nto getting our Nation's fiscal problems under control and I believe \nline-item veto legislation would help accomplish this difficult, yet \nattainable, goal.\n  Whether the Senate approves enhanced rescission, expedited \nrescission, or separate enrollment, any of these approaches would \nstrengthen the ability the President has to rescind Federal spending or \ntargeted tax benefits.\n  The central message I hear every day from Idahoans is to reduce \nFederal spending, balance the budget and lower the national debt. But \nabove all they want Congress to eliminate pork-barrel spending. \nAmerican taxpayers are tired of watching the Federal Government waste \ntheir hard earned tax dollars on unnecessary projects which are not of \na national concern.\n  Mr. President, I would like to share with you a sample of some of the \ncomments I received from Idahoans during the 104th Congress in support \nof enacting line-item veto legislation:\n\n       Recently the house passed a measure to allow the line-item \n     veto for the President. This is something I feel we \n     desperately need in order to eliminate much of the ``pork'' \n     that is added to large bills as they proceed through the \n     process. I realize that I may not understand all the \n     implications this power might lend to the executive branch \n     but I feel at least it is better than the uncontrolled \n     behavior that is now practiced by members of the \n     Congressional branch. If individual States need such pork, \n     let that State pay for it. I respectfully request that you \n     pass this measure--Joy C. Roberts, Eagle, Idaho\n\n       I believe this measure would discourage the funding of \n     unnecessary programs and reduce government waste--Marc \n     Banner, Boise, Idaho\n\n       Line item veto is mandatory to bring back responsible \n     government--Richard Lewis, Pocatello, Idaho\n\n       This would help eliminate many partisan and/or \n     irresponsible clauses passing through on the shirt tails of \n     otherwise responsible legislat[ion]--Bill Trammel, Boise, \n     Idaho\n\n  Under the Dole amendment, once an appropriation bill, authorizing \nbill, or any resolution providing direct spending or targeted tax \nbenefits passes the Senate then each item in the bill or resolution \nwill be enrolled as a separate bill or joint resolution. The respective \ncommittees will report the bills with great detail so that each item \nmay be separately enrolled. With \n[[Page S4463]] the President's existing Constitution authority to veto \nbills, he will be able to review each item in detail and veto any \nprovision separately enrolled.\n  Opponents of line-item veto legislation believe Congress would \nunnecessarily grant the President too much power, therefore upsetting \nthe legislative and executive branches' balance of power. Moreover, \nopponents fear the President will use this line-item veto power to \ncoerce Members of Congress. There is concern the President would be \ninclined to target funding of particular interest to Members' States as \npork-barrel spending and threaten to line-item veto it to gain support \nfor an administration objective. I believe line-item veto legislation \nwill hold the President more accountable to Federal spending programs. \nThe President and Congress will be forced to work together on spending \nprograms.\n  Enacting line-item veto authority for the President is a top priority \nof the Republican leadership in the 104th Congress. Forty three States \nprovide their Governors with some type of line-item veto legislation \nbecause it works. Idaho is one of these States.\n  Last January, during President Clinton's State of the Union Address \nhe urged Congress to send him line-item veto legislation for his \napproval. Various line-item veto bills have been introduced and voted \non in previous Congresses, at times when we had a President who wanted \nline-item veto authority, but a Congress not willing to give him the \npower. Today, however, we have a President who wants a line-item veto \nauthority, constituents who demand it, and a Congress willing to give \nhim the power. It is time for the Senate to do the responsible thing \nand pass the line-item veto.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Dole substitute \nto the McCain-Coats Legislative Line-Item Veto Act of 1995.\n  I do not feel it necessary to revisit, here, the stores of dubious \nspending programs, whether on cranberries, bees, helium, or whatever, \nthat unfortunately find their way into legislation and our bloated \nFederal budget.\n  I will, however, repeat what we all know, or at least should know: \nthat we desperately need to regain control over our spending so that we \ncan stop adding to our country's huge and exploding deficit. We must \nuse every means at our disposal to eliminate unnecessary spending, \nincluding Presidential vetoes of particular spending programs that have \nbeen inserted into larger bills.\n  Those who argue that this bill improperly hands excessive power to \nthe President ignore the history of Congress' budgeting process or fail \nto come to grips with its effects on our spending habits.\n  During the early years of our Republic Congress' appropriations \ncomprised all of four or five pages. Back in the 1940's and 1950's, \nhowever, Congress developed the habit of putting riders, in reality \nspending programs irrelevant to the underlying legislation, on our \nbills. It was the funding for these riders that Presidents impounded, \nand it was in 1974, after Congress took away the President's \nimpoundment power, that the legislature began earmarking all funding.\n  At that point Congress began to pass appropriations bills, laws, and \nenabling legislation of hundreds of pages in length.\n  The word ``omnibus'' no longer finds its way into legislation, but \nmany of the so-called laws Congress passes actually are bundles of laws \nand appropriations put together for reasons of political convenience.\n  During most of the 19th and part of the 20th century, Congress passed \nshorter, more precise, and concise laws that only aimed to accomplish \nparticular goals--setting or better yet eliminating a particular \ntariff, paying an individual for a particular service, and so on. We \nalso put fewer burdens on our people in the form of taxes and \nregulations.\n  It is simply unrealistic to pretend that the legislation that \ngenerally comes out of Congress today represents unitary legislation.\n  In some ways, perhaps, our society requires more complex \nlegislation--to, for example, set forth a complete program that has a \nnumber of distinct but mutually dependent elements. But too many of us \nhave come to use complex legislation as a form of cover under which we \ncan hide pork for our constituents. This is wrong, and it should be \nstopped.\n  The line-item veto essentially returns to the President a power he \nalready has--that of reviewing legislation and vetoing it if he finds \nit improper. Discrete programs and appropriations still would be sent \nto the President as before, only now the President would be able to \napprove or disapprove of each of them, even when bundled together into \na large, more disparate bill.\n  The line-item veto would provide us with an important tool in \ncombating hidden pork and yet maintain an appropriate balance of \npower--with a legislative process under which the President may review \nand even veto any piece of discrete congressional action, and under \nwhich we in Congress may, if two-thirds of us agree that we should, \noverride that veto.\n  Far from taking away our proper legislative function, this line-item \nveto ensures that we will scrutinize every piece of legislation, every \nprogram and spending proposal, to see to it that it is in the interest \nof the American people. We must restore discipline to our budgeting \nprocess and this regulation requires that we examine every proposal \nthat affects the budget to make sure that it is both worth the cost and \nnecessary.\n  With a line-item veto in effect Congress no longer will reach \ncompromises by giving everyone the spending programs they want because \na third party, the President, will hold an effective veto power over \neach element of that compromise. Instead of being forced to choose \nbetween accepting a good program that has been stuffed with pork or \nvetoing the entire bill, the President now will be able to slice away \nthe pork, leaving the program itself intact.\n  In this way the President, once again, can serve as a check on \noverspending by Congress, without taking away our constitutional right \nand duty to consider and enact legislation in the interest of the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, in September, the Congress will vote to \nincrease the U.S. Government's borrowing authority to over $5 \ntrillion--a regrettable but necessary step to keep our Government \nafloat. The tragic truth is, uncontrolled Federal spending has \neffectively saddled every man, woman and child in this country with \n$18,000 worth of debt. And, deficits continue to pile up at a rate of \nmore than $200 billion per year with no end in sight.\n  In short, Congress' appetite for spending more than the Treasury \ntakes in, has created a deficit situation that is snowballing out of \ncontrol. Today, the interest charge alone on our national debt consumes \n15 percent of our annual Federal budget. In my view, the deficit crisis \nis our most significant, and distressing national problem. Absent swift \naction, our children will inherit a legacy of debt that will reduce \ntheir standard of living, and eclipse the American dream.\n  While the line item veto on its own will not substantially reduce \nthese deficits, it is an important check on special interest spending \nthat today finds its way into dozens of bills signed into law each \nyear. The substitute amendment we are debating today, which has been \nsponsored by the distinguished Majority Leader, Senator Dole, would \ngive the President badly needed authority to veto special interest \nspending provisions and tax expenditures buried in important \nlegislation, without having to veto the overall measure.\n  In effect, rather than receiving a single bill, the President would \nreceive a series of mini-bills contained within an overall bill. He \ncould then surgically remove or veto narrow special interest \nprovisions, and sign the remainder into law. The Dole substitute would \nrequire that all new direct spending provisions, appropriations \nmeasures and targeted tax expenditures contained within each bill be \nenrolled as separate items to give the President this surgical, or \nline-item veto authority. The Congress could override vetoes with which \nit disagreed by a two-thirds vote of both houses.\n  The Dole amendment would give the President the authority to excise \npork barrel projects and tax breaks intended to benefit narrow \nconstituencies. Importantly, it would also enable the \n[[Page S4464]] President to veto new direct spending programs which \nprograms operate without the need for annual appropriations.\n  During my tenure as Governor of Rhode Island from 1962 to 1968, there \nwere many occasions when I wished I'd had a line-item veto. The \nsituation I faced then was identical to the problem the President \nconfronts today at the national level. Narrow special interest \nprovisions, which could not survive on their own merits, are inserted \ninto critical legislation, leaving the President with a Hobson's \nchoice: Veto urgently needed legislation, or swallow the offending \nprovisions to advance the greater good. The line-item veto is the right \nprescription for this problem.\n  Many have expressed concern that giving the President this new \nauthority would undermine the ``power of the purse'' delegated to the \nlegislative branch under the Constitution. While this concern maybe \noverstated, there is no question----this is a bitter pill for the \nCongress to\n swallow. But it's a recognition that the legislative branch cannot put \nits fiscal house in order, and that additional checks are needed. \nWisely, the Dole amendment includes a 4-year sunset provision, so that \nwe are not committing ourselves to an irreversible course of action.\n\n  In closing, I want to commend the majority leader, Senator Dole, as \nwell as Senators McCain and Domenici for working together to develop \nthe Dole substitute to S. 4. I strongly support this amendment and hope \nthat the Senate will adopt this measure with a substantial bipartisan \nvote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have long believed that giving the \nPresident the capability to exercise a line-item veto will be helpful \nin preventing some of the unsupportable spending projects that are put \nin appropriations bills without notice, public debate, or hearings.\n  I voted for the Daschle proposal for a line-item veto today, and I am \nalso voting for the Dole proposal to give the President the line-item \nveto authority.\n  The Daschle proposal contains two provisions that were, in my \nopinion, preferable to the Dole proposal. The Daschle proposal had a \nbroader provision on the line-item veto for tax items. Also, the \nDaschle proposal called for a majority override on the vetoed \nprovision. The Dole proposal requires a two-thirds vote to override the \nline-item veto. Both of the provisions in the Daschle bill are \npreferable to me.\n  However, the Daschle bill did not receive sufficient votes for \npassage.\n  Therefore, I am voting for the Dole proposal. I want the Senate to \npass a line-item veto bill this session of Congress, and this is a way \nto get that done.\n  The Dole proposal does contain a provision for the veto of certain \ntax provisions. I believe that is an improvement over previous \nversions.\n  Although the separate enrollment requirements of the Dole bill may be \ncumbersome, I have supported that approach in my cosponsorship of the \nBradley bill in the last session of Congress. It is, if not the \npreferred approach, still a reasonable one.\n  I want to be clear that I don't think the line-item veto will have \nmuch affect on the size of the Federal deficit. But, in real ways, it \nwill bring more discipline to congressional spending. And for that \nreason I believe it is good public policy.\n  The line-item veto is one part of a series of reforms that I believe \nare necessary to change the spending habits in Congress. That is the \nreason I voted yes on both the Daschle and the Dole proposals for a \nline-item veto.\n                     Amendment No. 347, As Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under previous order, amendment No. 347, as \namended, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 347), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread the third time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as I understand the parliamentary \nsituation, under the previous unanimous-consent agreement, Mr. Byrd is \ngoing to speak for up to 2 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be up \nto 2 hours of debate under the control of the senior Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have discussed the unanimous-consent \nagreement with Senator Byrd and he has agreed to allow a new unanimous-\nconsent agreement that would allow for 5 minutes for the Senator from \nArizona, myself; followed by 5 minutes by the Senator from Indiana, \nSenator Coats; and, of course, whatever leader time he wishes to \nconsume.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that, in addition to the 2 hours \ncontrolled by Senator Byrd, following the 2 hours controlled by Senator \nByrd, there be 5 minutes for the Senator from Nebraska, 5 minutes for \nthe Senator from Arizona, and 5 minutes for the Senator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. Pending the presence of \nSenator Byrd, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, under the unanimous-consent agreement, I \nunderstand the Senator from Nebraska has been allotted 5 minutes. I \nwould like to take that 5 minutes at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I will vote for final passage of the Dole \nline-item veto substitute. As my colleagues well know, I would have \npreferred another version of the legislation, namely S. 14, which I \ncosponsored with the distinguished Republican and Democratic leaders \nand the chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  However, S. 14 was not meant to be. We had a vote earlier today to \nsubstitute S. 14 for the so-called Dole compromise. Unfortunately, S. \n14's supporters, of which I am one, did not carry the day.\n  All vote tallies aside, I still believe with all of my heart that S. \n14 is a better bill. As one of its architects, I can say that it is a \ncleaner bill. It is constructed on sound footing. It is a simple bill \nwithout the unwieldy contraptions that complicate and weigh down the \nDole substitute. It is a bill that can weather a constitutional \nchallenge.\n  Yet, I tell my colleagues today that I will vote for the Dole \nsubstitute. I will vote for it as our only chance to win a line-item \nveto. I will vote for it as a last resort to cut pork-barrel spending.\n  Mr. President, I can support this bill because it is much improved \nover its\n original version. In spite of the haste and pressure to ram this \nlegislation through this body, the Senate worked its will in a number \nof areas. Through the amendment process, we made this a better bill. We \nmade it a bill that Senators from both sides of the aisle can support--\nalbeit reluctantly.\n\n  I am pleased to see that many of the concepts that I proposed in S.14 \nhave found their way into the Dole substitute. The bill now contains a \nsunset provision. It now addresses the critical areas of targeted tax \nbenefits and entitlements.\n  However, we are not yet in the winner's circle. We will have enormous \nhurdles to clear in conference. I hope they are not insurmountable. I \nhope that reason and bipartisanship can conspire to produce a \nconference report that the Senate can support, and as a Senate conferee \none that I can support when we take the final action on this \nproposition when the conference report is returned to the Senate.\n  In conclusion, this is not an enthusiastic vote I cast today. I have \nlistened with great interest to my colleagues who oppose this bill. I \nshare many of their concerns. I share many of their suspicions.\n  I am still leery of the cumbersome separate enrollment process that \nwas tossed into the pot at the last minute. I wish we could have had a \nthorough hearing on it. Separate enrollment could\n turn into the dreaded hydra of which Senator Byrd warns. There are \nalso serious constitutional considerations which I believe could haunt \nus for years to come. Fortunately, we now \n[[Page S4465]] have a sunset provision that will allow Congress to \nrevisit this legislation in 5 years.\n  But, Mr. President, I will vote for this bill because it's our only \nhope for a line-item veto. There is a certain irony not lost on this \nSenator. Just as the President often has to accept the bad with the \ngood in a critical spending bill, so must I accept the bad with the \ngood in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I wish we did not need a line-item veto at all. I wish \nCongress had the raw courage to make the sound fiscal decisions that \nwould make this bill unnecessary. But a rising deficit and a nearly $5 \ntrillion debt underscores the necessity of this legislation.\n  No, this bill will not balance the budget. No, this bill will not \neradicate the national debt. No, this bill will not solve all of our \nproblems with a wave of the hand. No, this legislation is not perfect, \nbut it is one important step to blot out the red ink. It is one \nimportant step to put an end to out-of-control spending that is \nbleeding future generations dry. It is one important step to change the \nNation's wasteful spending habits. And that is how we will solve our \nNation's fiscal ills--one step at a time. I ask my colleagues to join \nwith me today and take this first crucial step.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia now controls 2 hours.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield some time, if \nSenators wish. I ask the distinguished Senator from Michigan [Mr. \nLevin] how much he needs?\n  I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I think it is appropriate for the President to be able \nto single out spending items that he believes to be wasteful, and to \nrequire a separate congressional vote on those items. For that reason, \nI was supportive of a bill similar to that originally introduced by \nSenators Domenici and Exon. That is why I also voted for the bill that \nwas introduced by the Democratic leader. However, I cannot vote for the \nbill before us for three reasons.\n  First, I believe the bill is unconstitutional. The Constitution \nspecifies the mechanism by which laws are made. This bill establishes a \ndifferent mechanism. We cannot do that. We cannot amend the \nConstitution by legislation.\n  Second, the bill would cut up legislation into pieces which standing \nalone are bits and pieces.\n  In a statement earlier this week I went through a sample piece of \nlegislation that the Senator from Indiana had put together as a test \nrun of how the bill would work, and the results speak for themselves. \nThe bits and pieces that result would be standing alone, as they are \nleft to do, would be incomprehensible and would bear no relationship to \nthe bill that was passed by the Congress.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the bill does not achieve its intended \npurpose of enabling the President to cut spending by vetoing earmarks. \nI do not think most of our colleagues even realize that. But under the \nDole substitute, unlike the original S. 4 or S. 14, if the President \nvetoes an earmark, he will not save the taxpayers a dime. He still has \nthe appropriations to spend. He will just spend it for something other \nthan the purpose specified by Congress.\n  The Constitution establishes the method by which laws are enacted and \nrepealed. It specifies how a bill becomes law. It says that when a bill \nis passed by both Houses of Congress, it must go to the President. It \ndoes not have an exception. The bill before us would attempt to carve \nout an exception. The House bill, which is passed by both Houses, would \nnot under this substitute go to the President. Instead, it gets carved \nup into bits and pieces, and the bits and pieces go to the President. \nWe cannot amend the bits and pieces. We cannot refer the bits and \npieces back to committee. The bits and pieces go to the President as if \nthey were bills passed by the Congress, although the Congress never \nlegislated on those bits and pieces the way we legislate on any bill by \nhaving it introduced, having it go through a committee process, a \nhearing process, an amendment process, a motion process, a conference \nprocess. The bill which we passed does not go to the President. The \nbills which he is given to sign have never been passed by us. That \nviolates the Constitution. We cannot do that.\n  What is ironic here also is if the President wants to sign a bill in \nits entirety, an appropriations bill, he cannot do so. He does not have \na bill to sign. The bill disappeared. It was splintered into shards. \nUnder this process, if the President wants to sign the bill, an \nappropriations bill which has been splintered into 500 parts, he cannot \nsign the bill. He has to sign 500 pieces of the bill even if he wants \nto sign the whole appropriations. If he wants to veto the entire \nappropriations bill, he cannot veto the entire appropriations bill. The \nPresident has vetoed appropriations bills in their entirety. Presidents \nunder this approach cannot, but would have to veto each of the shards, \neach of the bits and pieces that were submitted to the President.\n  I wonder if my time is up? I wonder if the Senator from West Virginia \nwould yield me 1 additional minute?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Laurence Tribe, who is a constitutional \nexpert, has been quoted on this floor. I was somewhat surprised by his \nmost recent statement about this.\n  The Assistant Attorney General for interpreting the Constitution \nunder the Bush administration concluded--his name was Timothy \nFlannigan--concluded that you cannot have separate enrollment. This was \nthe Bush Assistant Attorney General. In his view, the Constitution \n``requires that the bill be presented to the President as passed by the \nCongress.''\n  Separate enrollment is unconstitutional.\n  I believe Mr. Dellinger, President Clinton's Assistant Attorney \nGeneral, in his statement in his most recent letter says that the best \nreading of the Constitution is that separate enrollment does not work. \nBut what is interesting was Laurence Tribe's earlier opinion which I \nwant to just briefly read, because, while Laurence Tribe is, indeed, a \nconstitutional expert, a few years before his current opinion, he wrote \na book. In that book called ``American Constitutional Law,'' this is \nwhat Professor Tribe wrote.\n\n       The core issue is whether Congress may statutorily expand \n     the meaning of the term ``Bill''--which denotes a singular \n     piece of legislation in the form in which it was approved by \n     Congress--by defining as a separate ``Bill'' each and every \n     item, paragraph, or section contained within a single bill \n     that has passed both Houses as an entirety. The method would \n     be to direct the enrolling clerk of the House where the bill \n     originates to disassemble a bill and enrol each numbered \n     section and unnumbered paragraph as a separate bill or joint \n     resolution for presentation to the President in compliance \n     with clauses 2 and 3 of section 7 of article I. But it is far \n     from certain whether the myriad bills thus presented to the \n     President could be said to have been considered, voted on, \n     and passed by the two Houses in accord with the \n     Constitution's ``single, finely wrought and exhaustively \n     considered procedure.'' The choice of whether to adopt and \n     submit one appropriations bill or a hundred, and the decision \n     as to the form the bill or bills should take, might well be \n     deemed the ``kind of decision[s] that can be implemented only \n     in accordance with the procedures set out in article I.'' And \n     delegation to an enrolling clerk in either house of the power \n     to make decisions which would otherwise be part and parcel of \n     the political, deliberative, and legislative process is \n     constitutionally suspect.\n  Mr. President, I think it is appropriate for the President to be able \nto single out spending items that he believes to be wasteful, and to \nrequire a separate congressional vote on those items. For that reason, \nI was prepared to vote in favor of a bill similar to that originally \nintroduced by Senators Domenici and Exon. That is also why I voted for \nthe substitute proposed by the Democratic leader.\n  However, I cannot vote for the bill before us for three reasons.\n  First, the bill is unconstitutional. The Constitution specifies the \nmechanism by which laws are made; this bill purports to establish a \ndifferent mechanism. We can not do that. We can not amend the \nConstitution by legislation.\n  Second, the bill would cut up legislation and cut it in pieces which \nstanding alone are gibberish. In a statement earlier this week, I went \nthrough a sample piece of legislation that the Senator from Indiana had \nput together as a test run of how this bill would work. I think the \nresults speak for themselves. \n[[Page S4466]] The hundreds of bits and pieces of a bill that result \nwould be incomprehensible and would bear no relationship to the one \nbill Congress actually passed.\n  Finally, the bill does not achieve its intended purpose of enabling \nthe President to cut spending by vetoing earmarks. I do not think most \nof my colleagues realize that. Under the Dole substitute--unlike the \noriginal S. 4 or S. 14--if the President vetoes an earmark, he will not \nsave the taxpayers a dime. He will still spend the money; he will just \nspend it for something other than the purpose specified by Congress.\n  So while I support the version of a line item that comports with the \nrequirements of the Constitution and the system of checks and balances \nestablished by our Founding Fathers, the bill before us fails that \nfundamental test.\n  The Constitution establishes the method by which laws are enacted and \nrepealed. It specifies that a bill becomes law when it is passed by \nboth Houses of Congress and signed by the President, or, if the bill is \nvetoed by the President, when that veto is overridden by a two-thirds \nvote in each House. This bill purports to create a third way by which \nlaws can be made, by giving the Clerk of the House of Representatives \nand the Secretary of the Senate the power to take a bill passsed by \nboth Houses of Congress and disaggregate it.\n  Despite the efforts of the sponsors, that is simply not consistent \nwith what the Constitution requires. Article I, section 7 of the \nConstitution states that ``Every bill which shall have passed the House \nof Representatives and the Senate'' shall be presented to the President \nfor signature. It does not say that some bills shall be presented to \nthe President for signature.\n  So here we have an appropriations bill that has passed both Houses of \nCongress. Under the substitute before us, it does not go to the \nPresident. It goes to the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the \nSenate instead, to tear it up into different bills. That is not the \nprocedures established in the Constitution. The Constitution says that \nevery bill passed by Congress shall be sent to the President for \nsignature or veto. It does not give us leeway to pass a bill and then \nhide it and try to pass something else.\n  The President, if he wanted to sign that appropriations bill in its \nentirety, could not do so. To achieve the same result, he would have to \nsign hundreds of different bills. If we wanted to veto it in its \nentirety, he could not do so. To achieve the same result, he would have \nto veto hundreds of different bills.\n  But suppose the President went ahead and vetoed each of the hundreds \nof little bills. The Constitution says that he shall return each bill, \nwith his objections, to the House in which it originated, which ``shall \nproceed to reconsideration.'' The Constitution then provides that we \nmust have a recorded override vote on each such bill. The Constitution \nstates:\n\n       [I]n all such Cases, the Votes of both Houses shall be \n     determined by Yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons \n     voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the \n     Journal of each House respectively.\n\n  So we cannot have a voice vote on veto overrides, and we cannot do it \nen bloc. The Constitution says that we shall act on each bill vetoed by \nthe President, and we shall do it by recorded vote. So if the President \nvetoes 500 little bills, we have to have 500 recorded votes.\n  Simply put, Mr. President, the procedure that this bill would put us \nthrough is a charade. It is a fiction, designed to pretend that we have \npassed bills that we did not write, did not introduce, did not report \nout of committee, did not debate on the floor, could not amend, and did \nnot have any legitimate opportunity to vote on.\n  Here is how the procedure would work. We would go through the entire \nlegislative process of introducing legislation, reporting it out of \ncommittee, amending it, voting it through both Houses, going through a \nconference, approving a final product--a single appropriation bill.\n  Further, this bill passed both Houses in identical form. Under the \nConstitution, it is supposed to be sent to the President. But that is \nnot what we are going to do.\n  Instead, we will give the bill to the Clerk of the House or the \nSecretary of the Senate, and tell them to disaggregate it into hundreds \nof different bills. The Clerk and the Secretary, who are not elected at \nall, but are appointed officials of the majority party in each House, \nwould be directed to take the careful work of the Congress--a bill \nwhich, under the Constitution is supposed to be sent to the President--\nand tear it up into shreds.\n  This process of splintering a bill would involve a substantial \nexercise of discretion. The enrolling clerks would have to determine \nwhich provisions are tax expenditures. They would have to decide if \nthese provisions affect a limited group of taxpayers differently from \nother, similarly situated people? What, exactly is a ``limited group'' \nof taxpayers? Who is ``similarly situated''? How do we expect the \nenrolling clerks to know?\n  The enrolling clerks would have to determine which pieces of a \nparagraph, or a single sentence, contain allocations or suballocations \nof appropriations. They would have to decide where in a sentence to \nstop one bill, and start another. They would have to decide whether a \nprovision is an allocation of funds creating a positive obligation to \nexpend funds, or simply a limitation on funds.\n  These are all legislative tasks, but they would be performed by an \nenrolling clerk, not by the Congress as the Constitution provides. We \nare supposed to make these legislative decisions, not the enrolling \nclerks.\n  When the clerks have done their work, these shreds of the bill we \npassed would then be brought back to the House or Senate for what is \ncalled a vote en bloc. This vote is a charade. A Member who objected to \none or more of the new bills would not have an opportunity to vote \nagainst them. No Member would have any opportunity to offer a motion to \nrecommit. No Member would have any opportunity to offer an amendment. \nNo Member would have any opportunity to offer an objection. No Member \nwould even have the opportunity to correct an error in the shredding \nprocess.\n  The only recourse that we would have, if we had a problem with any of \nthe bills, for any reason, would be to vote against the entire package \nof disaggregated bills. And what would happen if we were to reject this \nproduct of the enrolling clerks? We would not have any opportunity to \nvote on a corrected product. We would have to start the entire \nlegislative process over.\n  The absence of any opportunity at all for Members to correct errors \nmade in the process of disaggregation gives the Secretary and the Clerk \nextraordinary powers and raises the potential for real mischief by \nappointed officials.\n  This is not the legislative process established in the Constitution. \nIt is a charade, designed to create the appearance that we have \ncomplied with the constitutional requirements. That is not good enough. \nThe Constitution says that a bill passed by both Houses of Congress \nshall be sent to the President for signature. There are no exceptions \nfor momentarily convenient ends. This bill does not comply with that \nrequirement.\n  The Supreme Court said in the Chadha that we cannot amend the \nConstitution by legislation. The Court explained:\n\n       The explicit prescription for legislation action contained \n     in Article I cannot be amended by legislation. . . . The \n     legislative steps outlined in Article I are not empty \n     formalities; they were designed to assure that both Houses of \n     Congress and the President participate in the exercise of \n     lawmaking authority.\n\n  The Court explained its decision as follows:\n\n       The bicameral requirement, the Presentment Clauses, the \n     President's veto, and Congress' power to override a veto were \n     intended to erect enduring checks on each Branch and to \n     protect the people from the improvident exercise of power by \n     mandating certain prescribed steps. To preserve those checks, \n     and maintain the separation of powers, the carefully defined \n     limits on the power of each Branch must not be eroded. . . . \n     With all the obvious flaws of delay, untidiness, and \n     potential for abuse, we have not yet found a better way to \n     preserve freedom than by making the exercise of power subject \n     to the carefully crafted restraints spelled out in the \n     Constitution.\n\n  Mr. President, I intend to vote against the measure before us because \nit is unconstitutional.\n  Second, I oppose the bill, because it would turn carefully considered \npieces \n[[Page S4467]] of legislation into gibberish. Earlier this week, I \nshowed my colleague a document prepared for the Senate enrolling clerk, \nat the request of the Senator from Indiana, as a test run of how this \nbill would work in practice.\n  What the enrolling clerk put together was one appropriations bill, \ncut up into separate pieces as required by the measure before us. He \nproduced a stack of paper 3 inches thick, containing 582 separate \nbills, each of which would be separately enrolled, signed by the \nSpeaker of the House and the President of the Senate, and sent to the \nPresident for signature.\n  As I pointed out at that time, many of these so-called bills are, \nstanding by themselves, simply gibberish. For example, I read one, \nwhich states, in its entirety:\n\n       of which $200,000 shall be available pursuant to subtitle B \n     of title I of said Act, and\n\n  That is it. That's the entire text of the bill, which we are going to \nsend to the President for signature. Who is authorized to spend this \nmoney? What are they authorized to spend it for? What account does it \ncome from? $200,000 out of what appropriation? ``Subititle B of title \nI'' of what act? It makes no sense. And there are hundreds more bills \nthat are equally incomprehensible. This is not the enrolling clerk's \nfault--he just did what the bill directed him to do.\n  This is not supposed to be a jigsaw puzzle, Mr. President. It is \nlegislation. Each of these sentences I read the other day is an \nindependent, freestanding bill, to be sent to the President for \nsignature. After they are pulled out of a bill and separately enrolled, \nnot one of them means a thing. The measure before us would result in a \nproduct that simply makes no sense.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I oppose this bill, because it would give the \nPresident extraordinary powers, without achieving its stated purpose of \nallowing the President to cut spending by vetoing earmarks.\n  I do note that the proposal before us has been improved by the \namendment that I offered with the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] \nand the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon]. Under the substitute \noriginally introduced by the majority leader, the President could have \nused his line item veto power to increase spending or to veto \nrestrictions on spending.\n  Under the substitute, as originally proposed, the President could \nhave used his line-item veto power to reject rescissions and \ncancellations of spending. He could have used this power to veto \nlimitations and conditions placed on an appropriation, without vetoing \nthe appropriations itself. In other words, he could veto the \nlimitations, and spend all of the money anyway. The President could \nhave rejected provisions in appropriations bills that attempt to reduce \nGovernment waste. He could have vetoed limitations on spending for \nconsultants, for entertainment of Government officials, for Government \ntravel. That means he could have spent more money for these purposes.\n  Fortunately, we have corrected part of the problem. Under the Levin-\nMurkowski-Exon amendment, items of the type I have just described would \nnot be separately enrolled. The President would no longer be able to \nveto rescissions or cancellations of funds. He would no longer be able \nto veto restrictions on appropriations and still spend the money. He \ncould no longer spend money for purposes inconsistent with the specific \nintent of the Congress.\n  That was an important amendment, but my colleagues should be under no \nillusion that we have eliminated the problems with this bill. We have \ndone the best that we could with a flawed approach, but the approach \nremains seriously flawed.\n  Despite the adoption of the Levin-Murkowski-Exon amendment, the \nsubstitute before us gives the President broad powers to substitute his \npersonal priorities for the budgetary priorities voted by the Congress. \nIf, for example, we were to require the President to spend a specified \namount appropriated funds for the Strategic Defense Initiative, or a \nparticular approach to SDI, the President could veto that requirement \nand spend the money based on his own personal priorities.\n  Moreover, the substitute before us would cede this power to the \nPresident without giving him the authority to save the taxpayers money \nby eliminating an earmark. Despite the extraordinary powers given to \nthe President by this bill, when it comes to cutting spending, it is \nweaker than either of the two bills reported out of the Budget and \nGovernmental Affairs Committees.\n  How can that be? How can a bill that gives so much power to the \nPresident give him so little power to reduce spending?\n  First, this substitute gives the President the power only to veto, \nnot to reduce, an appropriation. So while the President is given great \npower to veto an earmark within an appropriation, he would not thereby \nreduce the appropriation itself, unless he were prepared to veto the \nentire appropriation.\n  Here is where we need to understand what an earmark is. An earmark is \nnot an appropriation. It does not give the President any additional \npower to spend money; it simply says that of the money already \nappropriated, a certain amount must be spent for a specified purpose. \nThis is what we call an allocation or suballocation of an \nappropriation. Here's how it works.\n  We start with an appropriation. For example, the following: ``The \nfollowing funds are appropriated: For the purpose of program X, $600 \nmillion.''\n  We then want to specify more precisely how that money will be spent, \nso we have an allocation. For example: ``of which $20 million shall be \navailable for purpose A; $12 million shall be available for purpose B; \n$15 million shall be available for purpose C; etc.''\n  That is an allocation of an appropriation. If one of these \nallocations is further divided into pieces, that would be a \nsuballocation.\n  Now, let us look at the difference between the two bills reported out \nof Committee and the Dole substitute. The two reported bills both took \nthe rescission approach. They authorized the President, subject to \ncertain limitations, to rescind any amount of budget authority provided \nin an appropriation. That means that the President could veto all or \npart of an appropriation.\n  In the case of the example I just gave, if the President decides that \nthe $20 million for project A was a wasteful earmark, he could rescind \nthe budget authority for that project. Under either of the two \nrescission bills, the President would, in effect, put a blue pencil \nthrough that $20 million. At the same time, and this is the important \npart, the President would also reduce the overall $600 million \nappropriated for purpose X by the same $20 million.\n  The appropriation would be reduced to $580 million, and we would have \na real cut in spending. In fact, both bills contain a so-called lock-\nbox amendment, under which the money rescinded by the President could \nnot be spent for any other purpose. That means we would really reduce \nGovernment spending.\n  But now let us look at what the Dole substitute does. Under this \nsubstitute, the $600 million appropriation and each of the allocations \nof that appropriation are enrolled as separate bills. If the President \ndecides that the $20 million for project A is wasteful, he can veto the \nbill containing that allocation.\n  But what happens to the $600 million appropriation if he vetoes the \nallocation? That appropriation is in a separate bill. He can not reduce \nit by $20 million as he could under the bills reported from Committee; \nhe must either sign it or veto the whole thing. If he vetoes it, he is \nrejecting not only the wasteful earmark, but the entire program to \nwhich it is attached. If he signs it, however, he will not have saved a \ndime by vetoing the earmark.\n  So under substitute amendment before us, the President can veto an \nearmark, but it will not do the taxpayers any good, because that will \nnot reduce the appropriation. We will still have the same amount of \nspending that we would have had without the veto. There is no money to \nput into a lockbox, because spending has not been reduced by a dime. \nThe only difference is that the President will spend the money on his \nown pet project, instead of the project specified by Congress.\n  Let us look at a classic earmark. We could have an appropriation for \npost office construction, with allocations for specific post offices to \nbe built in specific locations. That is what we are after in this bill, \nand I do not have a great problem with giving the President the power \nto veto those earmarks. But I will say, Mr. President, that I \n[[Page S4468]] would prefer a rescission bill, which gives the money \nback to the taxpayers, over this bill, which leaves the appropriation \nintact for the President to spend on post offices of his own choosing.\n  Mr. President, some Senators appear to be under the misapprehension \nthat the substitute before us would enable to President to cut spending \nby vetoing an earmark. In fact, it does not. The original version of S. \n4 would have enabled the President to do that. The Domenici bill would \nenable the President to do that. The Daschle substitute would enable \nthe President to do that. But the Dole substitute does not. Under the \nDole substitute, if the President vetos an earmark--or an allocation, \nas it is called in the bill--he can still spend the money, unless he \nvetoes the entire appropriation, which may cover many worthwhile \nprojects in addition to the earmark.\n  Some will say that, even so, we would be better off without the \nearmark.\n  But not all allocations and suballocations are ``earmarks''. Many are \nbasic statements of congressional priorities, and many place important \nconditions, limitations, and restrictions on presidential spending.\n  Let us look at some real world appropriations, with their allocations \nand suballocations. I gave a few examples yesterday, all from last \nyear's appropriations bill for Commerce, Justice and State. Let me go \nthrough them again, to explain what the President can do, and what \nhappens to the money.\n  One example I gave was the so-called bill which would state: ``of \nwhich $200,000 shall be available pursuant to subtitle B Title I of \nsuch Act''. Let us set aside the fact\n that, standing by itself, this is gibberish, and assume that the \nappropriating committees will figure out a way to write this so that it \nmakes sense. What does it do?\n\n  Here is the answer. Last year's bill appropriated $62 million for \nState and Local Narcotics Control and Justice Assistance under the \nOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. The largest \nallocation out of that appropriation was $50 million for state and \nlocal law enforcement programs. The $200,000 was an allocation for \nenforcement of anti-car theft provisions for preventing motor vehicle \ntheft.\n  The $50 million allocated for State and local law enforcement \nprograms and the $200,000 for enforcement of anti-car theft provisions \nwas a statement of congressional priorities. We determined that the \nanti-car theft program was a relatively minor priority, compared to the \nassistance provided to state and local law enforcement programs. That \nis what we do in appropriations bills. We establish priorities.\n  Under the bills reported out of committee, the President could \nrescind the $200,000 allocation and save that money for the taxpayers. \nBut he can't do that under the Dole substitute.\n  Under the bills reported out of committee, the President could \nrescind the $200,000 allocation and save that money for the taxpayers. \nBut he can't do that under the Dole substitute.\n  Under the substitute, the President could veto the $50 million \nallocation, the $200,000 allocation, or both, but that would have no \neffect on the overall appropriation of $62 million. The President would \nstill be required to spend that money; he could simply substitute his \nown priorities for those established by Congress. Perhaps he thinks the \ncar theft program is more important than local law enforcement; he \ncould reverse the allocations. But he would not save any money without \nvetoing the full appropriation.\n  These priorities are no small matter. In the last Congress for \nexample, we spent weeks fighting over the relative priority to be given \nin the crime bill to hiring additional cops, building additional \nprisons, and establishing crime prevention programs. We will \nundoubtedly refight some of those battles in this Congress. But unless \nwe are very, very careful about the way we write our appropriations \nbills, the President could use the veto power provided in this \nlegislation to reverse our priorities. Moreover, he could do it without \nsaving the taxpayers a dime.\n  In short, Mr. President, the substitute before us is likely to do \nlittle good, and a lot of harm. In particular, the power given to the \nPresident to veto allocations and suballocations will enable him to \nsubstitute his own personal priorities for those established in bills \npassed by Congress, but will not save the taxpayers a dime, because \nunless the underlying appropriation is vetoed, the money will still be \nspent.\n  This provision is well-intended. The sponsors of the substitute \nundoubtedly think that they are striking out at earmarks. But they have \nmissed the mark.\n  Mr. President, I will vote against this bill, because it is \nunconstitutional. I will vote against it, because it would turn bills \ncarefully considered and passed by the Congress into gibberish. And I \nwill vote it because for all this trouble, we would not even succeed in \ngiving the President the power intended, to cut spending by eliminating \nearmarked funds. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia, not just for yielding time \nbut for his stalwart defense of the Constitution. The spirit of Henry \nClay is on this floor. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for the \nkind of defense of the Constitution which Henry Clay put up when he was \nhere.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Michigan for his \nmost generous and charitable words. I deeply appreciate them. I am \nflattered by them.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Pell], did he wish time?\n  Mr. PELL. Three minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 3 minutes to Mr. Pell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I find myself in opposition to the line \nitem-veto legislation before us, both on philosophical as well as \npractical grounds.\n  Philosophically, I simply believe that Congress should be extremely \nchary in yielding its power of the purse to the executive branch. I \nhold this view on the basis of my Senate service under eight Presidents \nof both parties during my 34 years in the Senate, and notwithstanding \nthe cordial relationships I have had with all of them.\n  The fact is that the executive branch, under our Constitution, quite \nproperly is a separate power center with its own agenda and its own \npriorities. Inevitably, it will seek and use any additional power to \nachieve its objectives. And the pending grant of veto power over \nspecific items, I fear, will surely give even the most benign and well \nmotivated Chief Executive a new means for exercising undue influence \nand coercion over individual members of the legislative branch.\n  So my preference would be to simply retain the present system of \nPresidential recommendation of rescissions. I fully recognize that \nunder that system our appropriations bills do sometimes cater to narrow \nspecial interests. It was for that reason that I favored the substitute \noffered by the minority leader to require congressional action, by \nmajority vote, on proposed rescissions. It is unfortunate that the \nmajority saw fit to withdraw its support for the earlier version of \nthis approach, as originally proposed by Senator Domenici.\n  It is even more regrettable that the only viable compromise that \ncould be devised involves the dismemberment of all appropriations bills \ninto hundreds of separate bills. Quite apart from the constitutional \nquestions which have been raised with respect to the form of \npresentation of bills, the compromise is mind boggling in its \ncomplexity.\n  Separate enrollment, it seems to me, is so cumbersome and unwieldy as \nto invite ridicule on this body for even considering it. More to the \npoint, it invites bureaucratic confusion or at worst tampering with the \nlegislative process. It is the kind of jerry-built solution which seems \nalmost certain to spawn more problems than it was designed to fix. We \nshould reject it, or failing that, hope that the conferees in their \nwisdom will set it aside.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland [Mr. Sarbanes], 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished and able \nSenator from West Virginia for yielding me time.\n  I wish to join my colleague from Michigan in the comments he made a \nfew moments ago in expressing my \n[[Page S4469]] deepest appreciation to the Senator from West Virginia \nfor the very strong fight he has been making in the Chamber on this \nissue and on other issues which touch the Constitution of the United \nStates. He has been a true champion of our Constitution and the Nation \nis in his debt.\n  I am deeply troubled that this body appears to be into the symbolism \nbut not the reality of addressing important national problems. There is \na dedicated craftsmanship in dealing with problems of public policy \nwhich members of a legislative body are supposed to bring to the task. \nAnyone can stand up and thump their chest and holler there is a problem \nand we need to have a response.\n  The real question is will the response be a sensible one? Will it in \nfact, in real practical terms, improve the situation? Too few want to \nface those questions and deal with them in a tough-minded way. Witness \nthe proposal before us. The Congress is going to send thousands of \nlittle ``billettes'' down to the President to sign or veto. As the able \nSenator from Michigan pointed out, there are manifestly serious \nconstitutional questions about this approach.\n  There was a path the Senate could have followed, pursuant to the \nconcept of expedited rescission, which I think would have commanded \nvery broad support in this body. An approach which would have gotten at \nsome of the spending problems people have criticized without bringing \nabout a radical and fundamental shift in the allocation of powers \nbetween the executive and the legislative branches.\n  I said earlier on in the debate that it is no great trick to have a \nstrong executive. If you go through history, many countries have had \nstrong executives. In fact, when it is carried to extreme, we call them \ndictatorships. The hallmark of a free society is to be able to have a \nlegislative branch and a judicial branch in addition to an executive \nbranch and for those two branches to have independence of judgment and \nreal decisionmaking power, with the ability to check and balance \nexecutive authority.\n  I can understand executives wanting to maximize their authority, but \nI have difficulty understanding legislators who in a blind way, are \ngiving up a significant part of their role in the operation of the \npolitical system.\n  I do not say that from the point of view that they should guard their \nown personal power and authority but from the point of view of guarding \ntheir role under the Constitution as representatives of the people. The \nFounding Fathers devised a constitutional system which has been the \nmarvel of the world. They established a National Government with \nindependent branches that check and balance one another; to have not \nonly the executive with power and authority but also to have a \nlegislative branch with power and authority.\n  The thing we must be careful about as we consider these various line-\nitem veto proposals is not to erode the balance, the basic balance and \nconstitutional arrangement that has served the Republic well for over \ntwo centuries.\n  The Congress passed the Budget Impoundment and Control Act in the mid \n1970's, to address this balance between the executive and the \nlegislative branches which provided a rescission process. It is \npossible to do further refinements with respect to the rescission \narrangements that currently exist in the law and it is down that path I \nbelieve we should be proceeding.\n  The current approach has been criticized. It is said the President \nmakes rescissions, sends them to the Congress, the Congress simply \nignores them.\n  A proposal was offered by the minority leader which would have \naddressed this problem by requiring the Congress to act upon \nrescissions sent to it by the President. The Congress would not simply \nbe able to ignore it. The President would be able to focus the \nspotlight on the issue and require the Congress to act on it. The \nexpedited rescission proposal provided that if a majority in both \nHouses did not agree that the item should be rescinded then it would \nnot be rescinded. That seemed to me to be a sensible way of trying to \naddress some of the problems that have been raised without \nfundamentally altering our constitutional arrangements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Could the Senator yield me just 2 more minutes?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I yield the Senator 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator.\n  I just want to touch finally on a point made immediately preceding me \nby the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island. Namely, that the \nproposal before us places enormous power in the hands of the Executive \nto bring pressure on the legislative branch. What the executive branch \ncan do under this proposal is link items in an appropriations bill with \ntotally unrelated issues on which a Member of the legislative branch \nmay be challenging the Executive.\n  For example, the Executive may have a nomination it is trying to move \nthrough the Senate. A Senator opposes that nomination. The Executive \ncan pick out of an appropriations bill an item of critical importance \nto the Senator's home State, an item which everyone would concede is \nmeritorious, but yet the Executive would be able to use his veto to \nnegate that item, not on the merits of the item itself, but because the \nexecutive branch would relate it to a totally separate item in which \nthey are being opposed by the Member in the legislature.\n  Think very carefully about that. I believe it will happen. In the \nhands of a vindictive President, it could be absolutely brutal.\n  But I think the temptation for its use in this manner will be \ntempting to any Chief Executive who is concerned about moving some \nother matter through the legislative body and finds himself being \nthwarted or frustrated.\n  Finally, let me go back to the point with which I opened. My deepest \nconcern is the manner in which we are trivializing very important \nissues. The Senator from West Virginia has rendered an extraordinary \nservice to the people of the country by highlighting that. He has stood \nhere on the floor and underscored that we are dealing with serious \nmatters. This is serious business. Decisions are being made in the rush \nof the moment that may well alter in a fundamental way our basic \nconstitutional arrangements. We ought to be very careful about doing \nthat, Mr. President. I regard the measure before us as a giant step \ndown that path and, therefore, I very strongly oppose it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very able and distinguished \nsenior Senator from Maryland for his vision, his dedication to this \nConstitution of ours, his love for the Senate, and his patriotism which \nhas stood the test many times on this floor in recent days and in \nmonths and years past. It has always been with great pride that I have \nlistened to him and been thankful for someone of Paul Sarbanes' stature \nand courage.\n  I know of others in this institution who treasure their membership in \nthis body and who cherish the Constitution. I perhaps should not \nmention names because, inevitably, I would not think of all the names \nthat should be mentioned at a time like this.\n  But I shall mention the name of the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin. \nHe is a master craftsman when it comes to legislation. He is meticulous \nand careful and exact.\n  I have often thought that in that Convention which met from May 25 to \nSeptember 17, 1787, he would have been an appropriate man to appoint to \nthe Committee of Detail. He is so methodical, so very, very thoughtful \nin probing the depths of every word. He would have been well placed in \nthat great gathering, because there are very few words in that \nConstitution that are without great purpose. Not many words were \nwasted.\n  I suppose that if I could flatter myself by thinking that I might \nfind a few words in that Constitution that perhaps ought not to have \nbeen there--and I cannot say this with certitude, of course--it would \nbe those words in that veto clause, in the second part thereof, which \nrefers to ``every order, resolution, or vote,'' in saying that they \nshould be presented to the President for his consideration.\n  Of course, we do not send votes to the President. We do not enact \norders of a nature to be approved or disapproved by a President. We do \nenact simple resolutions, concurrent resolutions, and \n[[Page S4470]] joint resolutions, neither of the first two of which \ngoes to the President.\n  But as to the words ``order'' and ``vote,'' I have never been able to \nunderstand why the Framers put those words in the Constitution. But \nthey, too, were afraid that something would be sent to the President \nand called a bill which was, in reality, not a bill. Bills have to be \npresented to the President for his approval or rejection. And so the \nFramers took every precaution to make sure that anything that went to \nthe President for his signature or for his veto would, indeed, be a \nbill or a joint resolution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. First of all, for a thank you and to say how grateful I am \nfor your comments, but also for a question.\n  First, on that clause that the Senator just made reference to, \n``Order, Resolution, or Vote,'' I have not wondered as long or as hard \nas the Senator from West Virginia has about that, but I wondered a bit \nabout it.\n  I am wondering whether or not that might have been intended precisely \nto avoid the Congress from failing to send to the President something \nto which the concurrence of both Houses was required but which they \nwould put a different label on in order to avoid it going to the \nPresident; that they might call it an order or a vote instead of a \nresolution to avoid the clear intent of the Constitution that something \nto which the concurrence of both Houses may be necessary go to the \nPresident.\n  I wondered whether that might be the reason for those words so that \nthe Congress could not put the label, some label other than resolution \non something, and avoid a document which required concurrence of both \nHouses from going to the President.\n  But my question of the Senator from West Virginia is this: The \nSenator has focused a great deal of attention--needed attention--on \nsection 7 of article I, which requires that ``Every Bill which shall \nhave passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before \nit become a Law, be presented to the President . . .'' It does not say \n``some bills,'' it says ``Every Bill.''\n  The Senator has pointed out eloquently and persuasively that what is \nattempted here legislatively is that a bill which passes both Houses \nnot go to the President and we cannot amend the Constitution by \nlegislation.\n  There is another part of that section 7 which has had less attention, \nand I would like to ask the Senator from West Virginia a question about \nit.\n  That is, currently if the President decides to veto an appropriations \nbill, he can just simply veto the bill. But under this proposal, after \nthe bill is divided into these bits and pieces, or ``billettes,'' as \nthe Senator from West Virginia calls them, in order to veto an \nappropriations bill, the entire bill, the President would have to veto \neach of the bits and pieces of that bill.\n  Let us say that the appropriations bill is divided by an enrollment \nclerk, assuming this politically appointed enrollment clerk can figure \nout what represents a tax and a general tax and a tax which is limited \nto a group, and he can properly put the limitations to the right \nappropriation and do all these other things which are really \nlegislative--these are not ministerial functions, these are critical \npolicy decisions--but assuming you have an enrollment clerk who does \nall that and sends these 500 bits and pieces to the President and the \nPresident says, ``I want to veto this entire appropriations bill,'' it \nis my understanding that under the pending substitute, he would have to \nveto each of the 500 bits and pieces in order to get to the entire \nbill.\n  If that happened, if he wants to veto the entire bill, he would then \nreturn all the bits and pieces--all of them would come back to the \nCongress--and then, as I read article I, section 7, it says that in all \ncases of a veto, each bill vetoed--now we have 500 of them--``. . . the \nVotes of both Houses'' on the override ``shall be determined by yeas \nand Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill \nshall be entered on the Journal of each House, respectively.''\n  So that as I read the Constitution, if the President decides to veto \nthe entire bill, therefore he has to do all the bits and pieces. Each \nof the vetoed bills would have to come separately before the Congress \nfor an override vote, and they could not be voice voted and they could \nnot be voted en bloc.\n  Is that the Senator's reading of that language of the Constitution? \nIt seems clear to me, but the Senator is the constitutional expert, I \nbelieve, around here, in my judgment, at least, and I am wondering \nwhether he might indicate whether that is the way he also reads that \nprovision.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator flatters me, but aside from \nthat, he has posed a very significant question.\n  I think what it amounts to is, we are doing indirectly what we cannot \ndo directly. And that is, that we are conveying a share of power over \nthe purse to the Executive. We are purporting to send him a line-item \nveto, when, under the Constitution, the Senate and the House, in my \njudgment, cannot give away that power, cannot give to the President of \nthe United States a line-item veto. Only the people can do that through \nan amendment to the Constitution.\n  The Framers gave to the President a qualified veto. They did not give \nto the President an absolute negative. He has to take it all or leave \nit all. But there are so many questions that are raised by this \nsubstitute. I wish we could have gone on with this debate for a few \nmore days. Several flaws have already been brought to light during the \nlimited debate that we have had on this measure, and only God knows \nwhat additional ones might have come to light upon further examination. \nThe Senator raises a very important question.\n  Each of the little ``billettes'' would have to be signed or vetoed by \nthe President or, if he did not sign them, and if Congress were in \nsession, they would become law without his signature. But if the \nPresident vetoes one or several or all, there is no provision in this \nmeasure whereby a House, in which the bill first originated, has any \nauthority to collect those vetoed bills and vote to override them en \nbloc. I raised that question in this Chamber yesterday.\n  In most cases, the House, being by custom the originator of \nappropriations bills, would be the first to decide and, in many cases, \nthe only House to decide, because if the House chose not to attempt to \noverride, the Senate would never have a voice and, to that extent, the \nSenate is being subordinated to the other body by this legislation.\n  Many of the ``billettes'' would, by virtue of their having been \noffered to the bill as amendments in the Senate, thereby have \noriginated in the Senate and, under the Constitution, the measure which \nis vetoed is to be returned to the House in which it originated. Even \nthough an amendment in the form of an enrolled bill may have been \noffered in the Senate by the Senator from Michigan, the Senator from \nMichigan may never see that measure again. The House will determine, \nbecause the overall bill originated in the House, whether or not there \nwill be an attempt to override a veto.\n  In short, there is no provision for escaping the strictures of that \nconstitutional provision that the Senator has mentioned. The bill goes \nback to the originating body and that House then votes to pass it over \nthe President's veto, or it fails to do so. It cannot put two of those \n``billettes'' together and vote en bloc to override the presidential \nvetoes. It cannot put a dozen or 50 or 100 of them in a package, and if \nthe President chose to veto all of them, there is no provision to \noverride en bloc.\n  Oh, I know, we have decided by way of the Abraham amendment that, \nafter the House and Senate have voted on the conference report and the \nenrolling clerk of the originating body has enrolled all of these \nlittle billettes, packaged them into one big bill again and it is put \non the calendar, all of the little billettes are to be voted on en \nbloc.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Without amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Without amendment, with very limited debate, no motion to \nrecommit, no motion to reconsider. It mystifies me.\n  I have to say that I have heard Jefferson's name invoked so many \ntimes during the debate on the ``unbalanced'' budget amendment \neuphemistically called the balanced budget amendment. Jefferson's name \nwas invoked so many \n[[Page S4471]] times, so often in that debate, to the total disregard, \nalmost, of what Madison thought about the Constitution, or what \nHamilton had to say. Jefferson's name was invoked. He was not even at \nthe Convention. He was in Paris at the time.\n  We will see what Jefferson says in his manual, The Parliamentary \nPractice for the use of the Senate of the United States, printed 1801. \nOn page 73, thereof, one sentence: ``After the bill is passed there can \nbe no further alteration of it in any point.'' Why it would have been \nanathema to Jefferson to have even mentioned letting the enrolling \nclerk break that bill up into several parts, and thus, through a \nfiction, created a multiplicity of bills.\n  Reading further what Jefferson says about that: ``When the bill is \nenrolled, it is not to be written in paragraphs, but solidly''--\nsolidly, solidly--``and all of a piece, that the blanks between the \nparagraphs may not give room for forgery.'' That is Thomas Jefferson, \nin his parliamentary manual.\n  So, the Senator asked a question which, if this measure ever becomes \nlaw, which God avert, somebody will have to answer. And at some point, \neven though the courts may try to avoid a political thicket, they may, \nindeed, have to make a decision there. That is a problem with this \nmeasure. It is not just a thicket, it is a political thicket.\n  That is what is behind this whole exercise here, this whole effort--\npolitics. We have to act on the line-item veto and, under the so-called \nContract With America, send the President a line-item veto.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his question. It \nis a penetrating one, one which we will have time to ponder. I see \ngreat difficulty, great difficulty. Never again will a bill, which \noriginally passed the House and the Senate, through a process of \ndebate, amendment, recommittal, and reconsideration of votes, resume \nits original form. Instead it will be sent to the President in the form \nof 100, 500, 1,000, 2,000 little billettes. Never again will that bill \nbe the same original bill that passed both Houses. Never.\n  Never again will there be a public law that refers to that bill in \nthe manner in which appropriations bills are now cited as public laws. \nWhen it comes to overriding a veto, just think of the time that will be \nconsumed in any effort to override the vetoes of 15 or 20 of those \nlittle billettes that have been enrolled by a clerk in the other body.\n  When we annually consider 13 bills, plus supplemental bills, plus \npossibly continuing resolutions, plus certain authorization bills, it \nboggles the mind to think of the waste of time in trying to override \nsuch vetoes. Even the thought itself is intimidating.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank all Senators. I think this has been a \nfairly good debate. It is highly regrettable, Mr. President --and I do \nnot say this with any rancor--highly regrettable that this bill on \nwhich the Senate is about to vote was brought to the Senate on Monday \nof this week and offered as a complete substitute to S. 4. The minority \nhad no opportunity, as far as I know, to participate in the writing of \nit. There has been no committee hearing on it. There has been no \ncommittee markup of the Dole substitute. There was no committee report, \nno minority views, no supplemental views, no additional views by \ncommittee members. Yet, the Senate was immediately faced with the \nprospect of a cloture motion offered on that substitute.\n  Now, what was done was within the rules of the Senate. I do not \nquestion that at all. Some may say, well, the former majority leader \noften offered a cloture motion the very moment that a motion to proceed \nwas made. That is true. I never thought of those instances as \nfilibusters and have said so. I never considered it to be a filibuster \nsimply because the former majority leader could not get unanimous \nconsent to take up a measure. He made the motion to proceed and offered \na cloture motion immediately. I have never thought of that as a \nfilibuster.\n  But he was offering a motion to invoke cloture on a motion to \nproceed. I do not recall any instances--there may have been instances--\nI do not recall any instances, however, in which the previous majority \nleader--while he often offered a motion to invoke cloture on a motion \nto proceed--I do not remember any instances in which he immediately \nupon the Senate's proceeding to take up a measure or matter, I do not \nremember any instances in which he immediately thereupon offered a \ncloture motion on the matter itself. There may have been some such \ninstances. I do not recall such.\n  But even if he did so, it was certainly not a matter of this gravity, \na matter of this nature. We are talking now about a matter here which \ngoes to the heart of the Constitution. It is not a constitutional \namendment, but it seeks to amend the Constitution without appearing to \namend the Constitution.\n  It seeks to do indirectly that which it cannot do directly. Congress \ncannot give to the President of the United States line-item veto \nauthority. That would require a constitutional amendment. I know there \nare some who maintain that the line-item veto authority is in the \nConstitution already. I do not believe that for a moment.\n  If it were in there, surely some President, along the line somewhere, \nwould have been advised by his chief counsel that there, in that \nConstitution, is something that you can use, and it is the line-item \nveto.\n  It has never been discovered up until this time. It has never been \nused up until this time. And the reason it has not been used is because \nit is not there.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is my understanding there have been Presidents, \nChief Executives, who have urged their lawyers within the executive \nbranch to do exactly that: Look in the Constitution to find an existing \nline-item veto authority. And as much as the Presidents have wanted \nthat authority, it is my understanding his lawyers have always come \nback to him and said, ``We cannot find that authority in the \nConstitution that enables us, in good conscience, exercising our \nprofessional judgment, to say that authority is there to be found.''\n  Mr. BYRD. I think that is true. In the instance of Mr. Bush, for \nexample, I think he was so advised. I know George Washington maintained \nthat he had to sign or veto the whole bill. The first President of the \nUnited States maintained that he had to sign the bill or veto it in its \nentirety. He could not take part and reject part.\n  So, Mr. President, here a cloture motion was offered immediately on a \nmeasure which the minority only saw for the first time, a far-reaching \nmeasure, a measure which we, even after these 4 days of debate, cannot \nreally comprehend. We really do not know what this bill does. And I \nregret that the Senate was faced with that fait accompli: Here it is. \nHere is a new bill. We do not have a committee report on it. We have \nnever had any committee hearings on it. But here it is, and here is a \ncloture motion along with it--which means that come the following day \nbut one, the Senate will vote on cloture.\n  It would seem to me that a minority should find that pretty hard to \nswallow, the application of a gag rule immediately upon a bill which \nhad not seen the light of day until the moment that it was introduced.\n  As I say, I do not speak with rancor. I speak only with sadness that \nwe have come to this in the U.S. Senate. When I came to the Senate, the \nminority would not have stood for that, that approach. The minority at \nthat time was on the Republican side of the aisle. Nor would the \nmajority have sought to take advantage of the minority in that way. \nSenators in that day would have rebelled at the thought.\n  But that day is gone now. And I will say this. If a minority does not \nseek to protect its rights, then it cannot blame the majority for \nriding and running over it, trampling it under foot.\n  This substitute is an absurdity, an absolute absurdity. Here we are, \ngrown men and women. We have taken the oath to support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States. We have been favored and blessed \nwith the high title of ``Senator.'' And we are judged to be craftsmen \nof the art in legislating. We are thought to be men and women who \nshould take great pride in our work here, but alas, we fall far short.\n  The very idea that for the first time in all history, as far as I am \nconcerned--I know of no precedent for this \n[[Page S4472]] approach. I know of no precedent for the handling of a \nbill such as is outlined in this substitute. There is no precedent in \nBritish history, the history of Parliament; in the history of the \nColonial legislatures; in the history of the State legislatures; in the \nhistory of our republic under this Constitution--absolutely no \nprecedent for handling a bill in this manner. And not only does \ntradition and custom refute this approach, but the great \nparliamentarians of the past refute it.\n  I have just read from Jefferson's manual, and he, in turn, refers to \nthe great authority on the British Parliament and its parliamentary \nprocedures, William Hakewill, in whose treatise on parliamentary \nprocedures, dated 1671, are noted the various authorities referred to \nin so many instances by Jefferson in his book on parliamentary \nprocedure. There is nothing like it. I have never seen anything like \nit. I could never have thought that here in the Senate we would be \nvoting on such a deformity as is this piece of legislation.\n  If we can do what we are doing with this bill, we can do almost \nanything. Do not be surprised at anything when a legislative body \nallows itself to be hoodwinked, blinded, cajoled, or whatever, into \nstamping its imprimatur on such a piece of legislation, if it can be \ncalled that. It will go to conference. I hope it never sees the light \nof day after it gets to conference. But for us to put our imprimatur on \nit?\n  I have to stand before God when I leave this life and give an \naccounting of my stewardship here. There is no way out of it. It is \nunavoidable. And I have to give an accounting to my children and my \ngrandchildren.\n There is no way out of that. I have to give an accounting to myself \nwhen I look in the mirror. I have to say, ``Old boy, you did not do \nvery well today. You have seared your conscience. You voted to do \nindirectly what you could not do directly.'' I would have to look at it \nin that way. How others may wish to look at it, is up to them. But I \ncannot in good conscience ever look back upon this hour and think that \nthe Senate did the right thing.\n\n  This thing is going to pass. I wish that this bill had been before \nthe Senate for at least another week. Several flaws have been detected \nand made visible by the distinguished Senior Senator from Georgia [Mr. \nNunn] and others. There have been attempts to correct the flaws that \ncame to light.\n  So for the time that this measure has been on the Senate floor, the \ntime has been well spent. But we were deprived of further examination \nand study by the very fact that a cloture motion was entered on the \nvery day that this substitute was introduced. We were deprived of the \nopportunity to thoroughly probe it, uncover it, and look at it \nminutely. I do not think that is the proper way to legislate.\n  I am sorry that the minority took it lying down. I will bet that when \nthe Republican side was in the minority, it would not have taken that \nlying down. I praise our minority leader, Mr. Daschle. He has done \neverything that he could do. But the minority leader with 39 others \ncannot block cloture. It takes the minority leader plus 40 others to \nblock cloture.\n  I chose to agree with the minority leader. There was no point in \nmaking the effort when we knew the votes were not there. It would only \nbe an embarrassment. So let us do the best we can, fight the good \nfight, and be on to the next battle.\n  Mr. President, this is indeed a sad moment for the Senate. I remember \nwhat Brutus said in a letter to Cicero. Cicero, in order to gain favor \nwith Anthony and Octavian, came to agree with them on certain things, \nand Brutus criticized Cicero for doing so, according to Plutarch, in a \nletter: ``Our forefathers would have scorned to bear even a gentle \nmaster.''\n  Mr. President, our forefathers, too, would have scorned to bear even \na gentle master.\n  As I look around this Chamber tonight, I think of Everett Dirksen. I \nthink of Norris Cotton, George Aiken, Bob Kerr, Richard Russell, Lister \nHill, Allen Ellender, Spessard Holland, and others whose voices have \nlong been stilled, how they would have been ashamed, ashamed, to see \nthe Senate accept without a fight, and a long fight, a piece of junk \nlike this. This is a piece of junk out of keeping with any precedent in \nany legislative body that I know of. In the words of Brutus, ``Our \nforefathers would have scorned to bear even a gentle master.''\n  Yet, there are some in the minority who cannot stand and vote against \ncloture once. Do not mention twice, or three times.\n  When the Republicans were in the minority, and I was the majority \nleader, I offered cloture eight times on the campaign financing bill, \nand eight times that cloture motion was rejected. No majority leader \nhas ever offered cloture on the same measure eight times. I offered a \ncloture motion eight times. Never were we able to get more than three \nvotes for cloture from the Republicans. They stood like a stone wall. \nYou have to respect that kind of unity.\n  I am sad. I am sad that we have a more powerful minority than the \nRepublicans had, as far as numbers go.\n  We have a good leader. He has demonstrated leadership, statesmanship, \nheroism, and patriotism and great courage on the balanced budget \namendment, and on this measure. But a leader cannot lead, if there are \nthose who will not follow. You have to let the followers lead.\n  Can you depict a leader who has to follow? That is what a leader is \nreduced to, if his troops will not stand behind him.\n  I have been a leader. I was elected by my party to be leader six \ntimes, three terms in the majority and three terms in the minority. I \nknow. If you look behind you and your troops are not there, you may \ncarry the title of leader but in name only. Of all times when Senators \nshould have stood, immovable, it is in an instance when the very \nstructure of our constitutional system is being endangered.\n  Mr. President, I want to read from a book that has just been \npublished. This book is titled ``Constitutional Equilibrium: Mainstay \nof the Republic.'' And I begin by reading from page 183, under the \nsubtitle ``Decline and Fall of the Roman Republic.''\n\n       The theory of a mixed constitution--\n\n  That is what ours is, a mixed constitution, with checks and balances, \nand separation of powers--\n\n       The theory of a mixed constitution had its great measure of \n     success in the Roman republic. It is not surprising, \n     therefore, that the Founding Fathers of the United States \n     should have been familiar with the works of Polybius, or that \n     Montesquieu should have been influenced by the checks and \n     balances and separation of powers in the Roman constitutional \n     system, a clear and central element of which was the control \n     over the purse, vested solely in the Senate in the heyday of \n     the republic.\n\n  And what happened to Rome? Rome had its legendary founding in 753 \nB.C. Under the old republic and the middle republic, the Senate was \nsupreme. The Senate had control, complete control over the finances.\n\n       In short, Rome's fate was sealed by the one-by-one \n     donations of power and prerogative that the Roman Senate \n     plucked from its own quiver and voluntarily delivered into \n     the hands, first, of Julius Caesar and then Octavian, and \n     subsequently into the trust of the succession of Caligulas, \n     Neros, Commoduses, and Elagabaluses who followed, until at \n     last, the ancient and noble ideal of the Roman republic had \n     been dissolved into the stinking brew of imperial debauchery, \n     tyranny, megalomania, and rubble into which the Roman empire \n     eventually sank.\n       At the height of the republic, the Roman Senate had been \n     the one agency--\n\n  And the same can be true of this Republic. This Senate was the most \nbrilliant spark of ingenuity that came out of that Constitutional \nConvention in 1787. The Senate was part of the Great Compromise. And \nevery Member who has ever stood at that desk up there and taken the \noath ought to take great pride in being a Member of this body, a \ncontinuing body. There has never been a new Senate since the original \nSenate sat, began its sittings on April 6, 1789.\n  The same as can be said about the Roman Senate could be said about \nthis Senate.\n\n       At the height of the republic, the Roman Senate had been \n     the one agency with the authority, the perspective, and the \n     popular aura to debate, investigate, commission, and correct \n     the problems that confronted the Roman state and its \n     citizens. But the Senate's loss of will, and its eagerness to \n     hand its responsibilities over to a one-man Government . . . \n     a dictator, and later an emperor, doomed Rome and predestined \n     Rome's decline and ultimate fall.\n       Mr. President, let us learn from the pages of Rome's \n     history. The basic lesson that we \n     [[Page S4473]] should remember for our purposes here is, that \n     when the Roman Senate gave away its control of the purse \n     strings, it gave away its power to check the executive. From \n     that point on, the Senate declined and, as we have seen, it \n     was only a matter of time. Once the mainstay was weakened, \n     the structure crumbled and the Roman republic fell.\n\n  This lesson is as true today as it was two thousand years ago.\n  And it pains me to see Members come into this body who seem to have \nabsolutely no conception of what this body is all about, no conception \nof the constitutional system, no conception of the system of separation \nof powers and checks and balances, no conception of the wisdom of the \nFounders in placing into the legislative branch the power over the \npurse, little conception, apparently little respect for or regard for \nthe lessons of history.\n\n       Does anyone really imagine that the splendors of our \n     capital city stand or fall with mansions, monuments, \n     buildings, and piles of masonry? These are but bricks and \n     mortar, lifeless things, and their collapse or restoration \n     means little or nothing when measured on the great clock-\n     tower of time.\n       But the survival of the American constitutional system, the \n     foundation upon which the superstructure of the Republic \n     rests, finds its firmest support in the continued \n     preservation of the delicate mechanism of checks and \n     balances, separation of powers, and control of the purse, \n     solemnly instituted by the Founding Fathers. For over two \n     hundred years, from the beginning of the Republic to this \n     very hour, it has survived in unbroken continuity. We \n     received it from our fathers. Let us as surely hand it on to \n     our sons and daughters.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I have said about all that I wish to say. It \nwould not matter if I spoke for days. The die is cast. This bill will \ngo to conference. What comes therefrom nobody knows. It may be this \nbill; it may be H.R. 2; it may be a blend of the two; it may be \nnothing. Nobody knows. But the record will have been written here, and \nit is a record of which I cannot be proud. And the roll of Senators \nwill soon be called.\n  Let me read the roll of the great men who wrote this Constitution. \nHere it is:\n\n       New Hampshire: John Langdon, Nicholas Gilman; \n     Massachusetts: Nathaniel Gorham, Rufus King; Connecticut: \n     William Samuel Johnson, Roger Sherman; New York: Alexander \n     Hamilton; New Jersey: William Livingston, David Brearley, \n     William Patterson, Jonathan Dayton; Pennsylvania: Benjamin \n     Franklin, Robert Morris, Thomas Fitzsimons, James Wilson, \n     Thomas Mifflin, George Clymer, Jared Ingersoll, Gouverneur \n     Morris;\n      Delaware: George Read, John Dickinson, Jacob Broom, Gunning \n     Bedford, Jr., Richard Bassett; Maryland: James McHenry, \n     Daniel Carrol, Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer; Virginia: \n     John Blair, James Madison, Jr; North Carolina: William \n     Blount, Hugh Williamson, Richard Dobbs Spaight; South \n     Carolina: J. Rutledge, Charles Pinckney, Charles \n     Cotesworth Pinckney, Pierce Butler; Georgia: William Few, \n     Abraham Baldwin; and President and deputy from Virginia, \n     George Washington.\n\n  Mr. President, what would they think of us?\n  Nathan Hale was a young schoolteacher who answered the call of his \ncommanding chief, General George Washington to go behind the British \nlines and bring back drawings and notes concerning the fortifications \nof the British. Hale was 21 years old. He was a schoolteacher.\n  He went behind the British lines, disguised as a Dutch schoolmaster. \nHe completed his work. He made drawings of the batteries and the \nBritish fortifications.\n  On the night before he was to return to the American side, he was \napprehended and arrested as a spy. The next morning, he was brought \nbefore the gallows with his hands tied behind him. His last request was \nfor a Bible, and the request was denied.\n  The British commander, whose name was Cunningham, asked Nathan Hale \nif he had anything he wished to say. Nathan Hale, looking at the stark \nwooden coffin in which his lifeless body would soon be placed, said, \n``I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.''\n  Nathan Hale was willing to give his one life. It is sad to say that \nthere are Members of this body who are not willing to give one vote for \nthe Constitution which was written by this illustrious list of Framers \nwhose names I have just read. Not one vote to save their country, to \nsave the constitutional system.\n  On a monument in Atlanta Georgia, these words are inscribed to the \nmemory of the great Senator and orator Benjamin Hill:\n\n       Who saves his country, saves all things, saves himself, and \n     all things saved do bless him. Who lets his country die, lets \n     all things die, dies himself ignobly and all things die curse \n     him.\n\n  Mr. President, I wish that it could be said that we Republicans and \nDemocrats alike tonight had conspired to save our country and to \npreserve the liberties of the American people. Because in saving the \nConstitution, we preserve the liberties of our people.\n  Claudius Marcellus was a Roman consul. His colleague was Paulus. They \nboth were enemies of Caesar. Curio was a tribune, also an enemy of \nCaesar. But Caesar with 1,500 talents had bought off Paulus and with an \neven greater sum had secured the services of Curio. The vote was put. \nClaudius Marcellus could not be bought. Marcellus was of the opinion \nthat Caesar should lay down his arms. Curio, in the pay of Caesar, \nopposed the motion by Claudius Marcellus, and moved instead that both \nPompey and Caesar lay down their arms. Most of the Senators who had \ntheretofore been of the same opinion as Marcellus went over to the \nother side and voted with Curio. Whereupon, Claudius Marcellus closed \nthe doors of the Senate and exclaimed to his fellow Senators, ``Enjoy \nyour victory. Have Caesar for your master.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from West Virginia has \n28 minutes remaining. Does he wish to yield that time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. As always, I am \nextremely impressed by the power of his thoughts and his speech.\n  Mr. President, I will be brief. The Senate has debated this \nlegislation for a full week. The concept of a line-item veto has been \ndebated on this floor for many years. For eight years, I have sought \nthe Senate's consideration of a legislative line-item veto. I believe \nthat in a few minutes the issue will be decided. And I am hopeful that \nthe issue will be decided in favor of the proponents of this measure.\n  As I am not known for my great patience, it would be hard to \noverstate how gratified I am to have finally arrived at this moment. It \nhas been a long, difficult but worthwhile contest. And one in which I \nfeel honored to have participated--honored to have participated \nirrespective of the outcome.\n  Much of that honor derives from the quality of the opposition to this \nlegislation. I know that some of the best minds and ablest legislators \nin the Senate have argued in opposition to the line-item veto. Their \neloquence and their skill at debate surely exceed my own powers of \npersuasion. I had to rely heavily on the skills of the majority leader, \nthe persuasiveness of my fellow proponents, and the merits of the cause \nto advance this legislation.\n  The senior Senator from West Virginia, the estimable Senator Byrd, \ndistinguished this debate--as he has distinguished so many of our \nprevious debates--with his passion, his eloquence, his wisdom, and his \ndeep and abiding patriotism. Although my colleagues might believe that \nI have eagerly sought opportunities to contend with Senator Byrd, that \nwas--to use a sports colloquialism--only my game face. I assure you, I \nhave approached each encounter with trepidation. Senator Byrd is a very \nformidable man.\n  Senator Byrd has solemnly adjured the Senate to refrain from \nunwittingly violating the Constitution. His respect, his love for our \nConstitution is profound, and worthy of a devoted public servant. But \nmy love for our Constitution is no less than his, even if I cannot \nequal the Senator's ability to express that love.\n  Like Senator Byrd, my regard for the Constitution encompasses more \nthan my appreciation for the genius of that document, for the wisdom \nand skill of its authors. It is for the ideas it protects, for the \nnation born of those ideas that I would ransom my life to the defense \nof the Constitution of the United States.\n  No ethnicity, no tribal identity, no accidents of geography or birth \ndefine this Nation. We are defined by ideas; ideas whose antecedents \nare found in antiquity, as Senator Byrd has so often and so eloquently \nrecalled for us, but whose application has been so well \n[[Page S4474]] refined in our Nation's history that we are now without \npeers in this world.\n  It is to help preserve the notion that government derived from the \nconsent of the governed is as sound as it is moral that I have \nadvocated this small shift in authority from one branch of our \nGovernment to another. I do not think the change to be as precipitous \nas its opponents fear. Even with line-item veto authority, the \nPresident can ill afford to disregard the will of Congress. Should he \nabuse his authority, Congress could and would compel a redress of that \nabuse.\n  I contend that granting the President this authority is necessary \ngiven the gravity of our fiscal problems and the inadequacy of \nCongress' past efforts to remedy those problems. I do not believe that \nthe line item veto will empower the President to cure government's \ninsolvency on his own. Indeed, it is and will always remain mostly \nCongress' burden to restore our government's fidelity to the principle \nof spending no more than it receives. The amounts of money that may be \nspared through the application of the line-item veto are significant, \nbut--as the opponents contend--certainly not sufficient to remedy our \ndeficit.\n  But granting the President this authority is, I believe, a necessary \nfirst step toward improving certain of our own practices--improvements \nthat must be part of any serious redress of our fiscal problems. The \nSenator from West Virginia reveres--as do I--the customs of this \nhonorable institution. But I am sure he would agree that all human \ninstitutions, just as all human beings, must fall short of perfection.\n  For some years now, Congress has failed to exercise its power of the \npurse with as much care as we should have. Blame should not be unfairly \napportioned to one side of the aisle or the other. All have shared in \nour failures. Nor have Congress' imperfections proved us to be inferior \nto the other branches of Government. That is not what the proponents \ncontend.\n  What we contend is that the President is less encumbered by the \npolitical pressures affecting the spending decisions of Members of \nCongress whose constituencies are more narrowly defined than his. Thus, \nthe President will take a sterner view of public expenditures--be they \nin the form of appropriations or tax concessions--which serve the \ninterests of only a few or which cannot be reasonably argued as worth \nthe expense given our current financial difficulties.\n  In anticipation of a veto and the attendant public attention to the \nvetoed line-item appropriation, narrowly targeted tax break, or a new \nentitlement, Members should prove more able to resist the attractions \nof unnecessary spending--and, thus, begin the overdue reform of our \nspending practices. It is not an indictment of Congress nor of any of \nits Members to note that this very human institution can stand a little \nreform now and then.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the legislative line-\nitem veto, and show the people of this country that for their sake we \nare prepared to relinquish a little of our own power. I thank the \nchair, and thank all my colleagues for their patience during this very \nlong debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIndiana has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from West Virginia \nhad not expended all of his time. If he seeks to be recognized, I think \nit is in order.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may desire to the \nSenator from Indiana [Mr. Coats]. Will he tell me how much time he \nwould like?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I believe under the previous order, the \nSenator from Indiana was reserved 5 minutes of his own time. I inquire \nof the Senator from West Virginia, if he wishes to use or delegate any \nof the remainder of his time?\n  Mr. BYRD. I think the Senator from Vermont wants time. If the Senator \nwishes to use his own time, if he needs a few more minutes, I will be \nhappy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 23 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will take but a minute.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nVermont such time as he may require.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier today I made a statement, I put an \nadditional statement in the Record, of my opposition to the amendment, \nso I will not expand on that, other than to say I wish all Senators, no \nmatter how they vote, will either listen to or read what was said by \nthe distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  I have served with him here for 20 years. Throughout that time, we \nhave had times of agreeing and times of disagreeing. One thing I always \nagreed on is his sense of history, his allegiance to the Constitution. \nI know of no Member of this body now serving or previous serving who \nstood stronger for the Constitution or stood stronger for history as \nSenator Byrd.\n  Mr. President, we should ask ourselves, in a Nation as powerful as \nours, in a Nation, really the most powerful democracy known to mankind, \nthe most powerful economy, the most powerful military worldwide reach, \nbut a democracy and the most powerful democracy, one based on three \nseparate branches of Government, the ability for them to be separate, \nthe ability for them to have the respect of the people, we should ask \nourselves as we continue to try to destroy any one of those branches of \nGovernment, what do we do to our democracy?\n  If we give up the power of the purse to the executive, that is \nchipping away. We find Members who want to denigrate the very bodies in \nwhich they serve--both this and the other body--and that chips away at \nour democracy. We find those who want to destroy the Presidency no \nmatter who holds it. That chips away at our democracy.\n  Mr. President, each one of us should take a little bit of time out, \nread some history, consider what maintains this great and powerful \ndemocracy and ask ourselves: Are we supporting it or are we whittling \naway at it?\n  I yield the floor and thank the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, though the legislation is seriously \nflawed, I am willing to support an experimental line-item veto \nauthority and to see it tested over the next several years. The so-\ncalled sunset clause of the legislation, which terminates the expanded \nveto authority unless Congress takes action, was the key to my support \nfor the bill.\n  If the Congress decides that we have gone too far in delegating \nauthority to the President, the sunset clause will make it much easier \nto act. The burden will be on those who want to retain the authority.\n  Without a sunset clause, Congress would have to pass a bill to \noverturn the line-item veto authority, and it is likely that any \nPresident would veto such a bill, thus retaining this extraordinary new \npower.\n  The continuing Federal budget deficits justify granting this \ntemporary authorty to the President, but I have a number of grave \nconcerns with the proposal as it passed the Senate.\n  First, and foremost among those concerns is the threshold of a two-\nthirds vote in each House to overcome this new expended veto authority.\n  That kind of threshold is provided in the Constitution for entire \nbills, but extending that authority for individual sections of a bill \nmay be going to far.\n  There are many uncertainties in this new authority that we are \nproviding the President, and no one can anticipate all the potential \nabuses that might flow from this new authority.\n  In Wisconsin, we have seen the abuse of a line-item veto authority by \na number of Governors, and it is safe to say that no one anticipated \nthe extent of those abuses when the line-item veto authority was first \ncontemplated. Governor Thompson has used the veto authority not only to \nrewrite entire laws, but to increase spending and increase taxes.\n  The two-thirds threshold will compound the uncertainty about possible \nabuses by making it that much more difficult for Congress to respond to \nthat possible abuse.\n  I am also concerned about the potential unconstitutionality of the \nmeasure. A number of serious questions on this very issue were raised \nduring the debate, and I am glad that the proposal also includes \nexpedited judicial review to help resolve this matter.\n   [[Page S4475]] The provisions relating to tax expenditures may not \nbe adequate. I am troubled that the language in this proposal may be \ntoo protective of tax loopholes for the wealthy. Tax expenditures \ncontribute greatly to pressure on the deficit, and if any area should \nbe subjected to the scrutiny of line-item veto authority, it is this \none.\n  The basic structure of this particular line-item veto authority also \nraise problems. If it becomes law, the measure could mean sending the \nPresident hundreds, even thousands, of tiny bills. That could be a \nprocedural nightmare, and I would much prefer to have seen a different \napproach.\n  On the positive side, unlike the recently debated balanced budget \namendment, this line-item veto authority is established by statute, not \nas part of the Constitution. By providing this new authority by law \ninstead of through the Constitution, the measure does not raise the \nserious concerns that making a permanent change to our basic law would \nraise.\n  Also unlike the balanced budget amendment, this proposal is no \ngimmick. Though it is not a substitute for making real spending cuts, \nit can help the cause of deficit reduction because it does convey real \nauthority to the President.\n  Indeed, the danger is that it conveys authority that is too broad, \nand because of that, I will watch how the President uses this new \nauthority, and will lead the charge to oppose any extension of this \nparticular line-item veto authority if problems arise.\n  The proposal now goes to a conference committee to settle the \ndifferences between the two Houses, and I will revisit my support for \nthis bill when it comes back to the Senate. I would certainly oppose \nthe measure if the sunset clause it removed, and may well oppose the \nmeasure if other changes are made, but for now, I support this \ntemporary new authority.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, the Senate failed to take \nwhat would have been a courageous and historic step toward fiscal \nresponsibility when it defeated the balanced budget amendment. It was \none of the most disappointing and discouraging votes I have been a part \nof.\n  That's because we failed the American people, who sent us a very \nclear message last November. They said they wanted an end to business \nas usual. Their message was emphatic: they want less spending, less \nGovernment and more freedom. But we turned a deaf ear.\n  I hope the Senate has another chance to pass the balanced budget in \nthe future and I will continue to fight for its passage. But in the \nmeantime, there are other steps we can take to significantly reform the \nway the Federal Government spends the American people's money. today, \nwe can take a giant step in the direction of fiscal sanity by passing \nthe line-item veto.\n  The biggest threat to America's long-term prosperity is out-or-\ncontrol deficit spending. The result of 26 straight years of deficit \nspending is a mountain of debt. In fact, our national debt now totals \nnearly $5 trillion. Every day that we fail to impose fiscal discipline \non ourselves we are mortgaging our children's future.\n  Giving the president the line-item veto will not solve the larger \nproblem--massive deficits as far as the eye can see. But it will begin \nto restore fiscal sanity to a broken budget process. It will allow \npresidents to strike out specific wasteful and unnecessary programs \nthat get stuck into huge and complex appropriations bills. Now, if a \nPresident wants to cut out a specific item, no matter how big or small, \nhe must veto the entire funding bill. The line-item veto, a power some \n43 governors already have, would allow the President to eliminate those \nprograms without having to send the entire bill back to Congress. It's \na common-sense reform that is long overdue.\n  The line-item veto is only one of what I hope will be a number of \nreforms in the budget process. There are other reforms that would force \nCongress to finally get its spending under control. For example, I am \nproposing a Spending Reduction Commission which would serve as a fail-\nsafe mechanism to help ensure we achieve the spending cuts necessary to \nget to a balanced budget. There are other proposals to change the \ncurrent process that I believe we should seriously consider as well.\n  But the issue before us today is the line-item veto. The American \npeople are demanding that we act, and act now, to control Government \nspending. Passing the line-item veto is an important step in that \ndirection. I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport this bill.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I sat in your chair on Tuesday, when the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia made an eloquent \nargument against this bill. I agree with him that Senators should take \ngreat care to consider the Constitution. And his arguments were very \nhelpful to me, as I am sure they were to all our colleagues. I believe \nthat the Abraham amendment addresses the constitutional arguments that \nSenator Byrd raised concerning orphan bills. The original Dole \nsubstitute prompted questions concerning the constitutional requirement \nof article I, section 7, that a bill that has passed the House and \nSenate must be presented to the President for his approval or \ndisapproval. Under the original Dole substitute, neither House would \nhave passed the orphan bills in that form. However, both Houses would \nhave passed the same legislative language.\n  Even without the Abraham amendment, S. 4 is constitutional. Congress \nhas the power under article I, section 5 to establish its rules. We can \nenact a rule that deems an item of a bill to be a bill. More \nimportantly, the Supreme Court has held that it is a political question \nwhether both Houses have actually passed the same language if the bill \nthat is presented to the President is authenticated by both the Speaker \nof the House and the President of the Senate. In other words, courts \nafford conclusive effect to a congressional determination that both \nHouses have passed identical bills. But there can be no doubt that the \nAbraham amendment removes any question under the presentment clause. \nAnd I commend my fellow freshman for his significant contribution.\n  There is little doubt that when this bill becomes law, a \nconstitutional challenge will be raised. And that challenge will go all \nthe way to the Supreme Court. And the result will be an important \nSupreme Court decision on separation of powers. When courts consider a \nconstitutional challenge to a statute, a level of deference is paid to \ncongressional resolution of the constitutional issue. This Senator's \nremarks are not legislative history in the sense that they illuminate \nstatutory language. But they do demonstrate that Congress had expressly \nconsidered and resolved constitutional issues raised by the bill. \nCourts will therefore provide the level of respect due to a coordinate \nbranch's considered constitutional conclusion. So I will take this \nopportunity to address some of the constitutional arguments that have \nbeen raised apart from the presentation clause.\n  The charge is made that this bill would transfer power, in particular \nthe power of the purse, unconstitutionally from the legislative branch \nto the President. But this is not the case. It cannot truly be said \nthat Congress alone has the power of the purse. Like so many powers in \nthe Federal Government, the power of the purse is not vested solely in \none branch of government. Powers are shared as well as separated in our \nconstitutional system. The branches do not operate as hermits in \nsplendid isolation. They need each other. They were designed to \nfunction with each other, and occasionally even against each other. The \nauthority that each branch legitimately exercises sometimes overlaps \nwith the legitimate authority of another branch. It is this mutual \ndependence that makes checks and balances possible. And it is this \nsystem of checks and balances that reduces the likelihood that the \nGovernment will trample over the liberties of the people.\n  The power of the purse is a classic example of a shared power. It is \ntrue that if Congress will not appropriate money for an expenditure, \nmoney from the Federal Treasury cannot be spent for that purpose. But \nit is also the case that an appropriation is not made merely because \nCongress votes to create it. The President shares the power of the \npurse. If he signs the appropriations bill, the money is appropriated--\nnot because the Congress voted for it, \n[[Page S4476]] but because the President also approved of the \nexpenditure. One person's opinion in the executive branch counts as \nmuch as the vote of the Congress. And if the President vetoes the \nexpenditures, then the President's power of the purse counts more than \nup to two-thirds of both Houses. If the appropriation fails, that does \nnot mean that Congress has transferred any power to the President.\n  S. 4 is fully consistent with the constitutional arrangement that the \nFounders created. Indeed, the better argument is not that the bill \nwould transfer power to the President that the\n President never had, but that it restores to the President the power \nthat Congress wrested away from him. In the early years of the \nRepublic, appropriations bills were essentially line items. Congress \nsimply did not pass appropriations bills that contained hundreds or \nthousands of items and that directed the spending of billions of \ndollars. Rather, Congress acted on each item on its merits. And the \nPresident signed or vetoed the item on its merits.\n\n  Over the years, the level playing field the Framers anticipated has \nbeen tilted sharply in favor of the Congress. Late in the session, \nCongress passes enormous bills with a large number of provisions of \nvarying merit. Not only is the bill presented to the President, but so \nis a Hobson's choice: Sign the bill and let it become law regardless of \nthe merits of some of its line items, or veto the bill and shut down a \ndepartment of Government upon which every American depends. Unlike \nCongress, Presidents have historically been responsible, and have \nprevented the Government from shutting down by accepting Congress' \nterms. By passing individual items, Congress will give the President \nonly the power that the Framers always intended for him to exercise.\n  Even apart from the supposed loss of power that Congress will suffer, \nit is also contended that under this measure the Senate will lose power \nat the expense of the other body. Because the other body is normally \nthe one where appropriation bills originate, the decision whether to \noverride the veto of an item that originated in the Senate is solely up \nto the other body. If they do not override vetoes of such items, the \nSenate cannot work its will.\n  Of course, that can happen now as well. If an appropriations bill is \nvetoed, and the President successfully persuades the American people \nthat the bill should have been vetoed because of items that the Senate \ninsisted upon, the other body may choose not to override the bill. The \nSenate cannot then succeed in overriding the veto. Under the new \nsystem, that may occur as well, but the Senate will not be defenseless. \nThe other body may choose to override vetoes of items of its choice. \nBut if the Senate does not concur, the House's override vote will be \nmeaningless. In practice, both bodies will cooperate to override vetoes \nof each other's truly important items because each House has the power \nof mutually assured destruction of the other's vetoed items.\n  The language of the Constitution rarely answers the difficult \nquestions. It is necessary to examine the court decisions. And no \nSupreme Court decision has ever struck down a statute based upon a \ngeneralized contention that it violates the separation of powers. Many \nspecific constitutional provisions together create the doctrine of the \nseparation of powers. Only if the statute violates one or more of those \nspecific provisions is the Constitution violated. No one has made an \neffective argument that S. 4 violates any specific constitutional \nprovision.\n  Therefore, S. 4 complies in every respect with the Constitution. In \nfact, it restores the constitutional balance between the President and \nCongress that was originally contemplated. And it does not change the \nbalance of power between the two Houses. Its enactment today will be a \nhistoric step in making Congress more accountable for its spending \ndecisions, one which will preserve, not harm, the liberties of the \nAmerican people.\n            EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE LINE-ITEM VETO\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, at this time I ask the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona to enter into a colloquy with me.\n  Two days ago, the distinguished Senator joined me in passing an \namendment to ensure expedited review of any remaining constitutional \nquestions raised by the line-item veto proposal. The intent of that \namendment was to provide a speedy way of removing any cloud regarding \nthe separate enrollment provision I would like to thank the \ndistinguished Senator for his support in this matter.\n  Upon review of the amendment, I believe the amendment warrants \nadditional clarification. As written, the amendment permits ``any \nMember of Congress'' to bring an action under the expedited review \nprocedures. However, it has come to my attention that the Federal \ncourts have raised some question about whether a Member of Congress has \nstanding to pursue such a suit under article III of the Constitution. \nIf the Federal courts ruled that a Member of Congress lacked standing \nin such a case, the expedited review procedures would become null and \nvoid.\n  To take account of this contingency, I believe that it is important \nalso to allow any person adversely affected by the act to bring an \nappropriate test challenge under the act's expedited review procedure. \nDoes the distinguished Senator from Arizona agree?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, I do.\n  Mr. SIMON. Does the Senator from Arizona further agree that, when the \nbill proceeds to conference, it will be the intent of the manager of \nthe bill to specify that both Members of Congress and persons adversely \naffected by the act may utilize the review procedures.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, I do.\n  Mr. SIMON. To eliminate any misapprehension, let me specify that \nsubsection (a)(1) of the expedited review procedure should read as \nfollows:\n\n       (a) Expedited Review.--\n       (1) Any Member of Congress or any person adversely affected \n     by the Act may bring an action, in the United States District \n     Court for the District of Columbia, for declaratory judgment \n     and injunctive relief on the ground that a provision of this \n     Act violates the Constitution.\n\n  Does the Senator from Arizona concur with my modification?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, I do, and I very much appreciate the Senator's \nefforts to clarify this issue.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nseparate enrollment version of a line-item veto. In the 103d Congress, \nI cosponsored S. 92, the Legislative Line-Item Veto Separate Enrollment \nAuthority Act, which was sponsored by my good friend and colleague \nSenator Hollings. I am pleased that the separate enrollment approach is \nnow emerging as the compromise version of the line-item veto that will \nhopefully pass Congress and be signed into law by the President.\n  In my judgment, the line-item veto, if enacted into law, would \nprovide the President with an effective weapon with which to fight \nwasteful Government spending. Over the past few years, a consensus has \ndeveloped, even among most Members of Congress, that, as the 1989 \nreport of the National Economic Commission stated: ``The balance of \npower on budget issues has swung too far from the Executive toward the \nLegislative Branch.'' This imbalance has most likely contributed to the \ndeficit spending of recent years.\n  It is believed by many that the President, exclusively representing \nthe general, national interest of the country as a whole, is more \ninclined to oppose Government spending which only serves parochial \ninterests, yet increases the national debt. Increasing the budgetary \npower of the President relative to the Congress would therefore lessen \nthe current bias toward more pork barrel spending and strengthen the \nbias which favors national priorities.\n  The largest obstacle that we face as a nation to sustainable, long-\nterm economic growth is our huge national debt. Although we have made \nsubstantial progress in reducing our annual budget deficits over the \npast 2 years, cutting them in half in real terms, the national debt is \nstill standing at an unacceptably high level.\n  The national debt as a percentage of the economy, as measured by \ngross domestic product, or GDP, now stands at 52 percent. In other \nwords, the size of our national debt is just over half the size of the \noutput of our economy for 1 year.\n  To put today's figure in historical perspective, the national debt as \na percentage of the economy reached a peak of 114 percent in 1946 \nbecause of the debt incurred to finance our efforts in \n[[Page S4477]] World War II. After 1946, the size of the national debt \nrelative to the economy declined steadily over the years even during \nthe Vietnam war and Great Society years, to a low of 26 percent by \nfiscal year 1981. This is because our economy grew much faster than the \nnational debt during this period.\n  This downward trend in the size of the national debt, which is common \nin times of peace, reversed itself in 1981 and rose over the next 12 \nyears. The national debt doubled in real terms, from a low of 26 \npercent in fiscal year 1981 to a high of 52 percent in 1993 due to the \nhuge deficits we ran in the 1980's. In other words, our national debt \ngrew twice as fast as the economy, the first time in American history \nthis has happened in peacetime.\n  The debt runup of the 1980's is unique in American history, and it is \nworth repeating that it is the only time in our history that the \nnational debt has grown substantially in peacetime. We have had only \nthree similar runups in the national debt during the 219 years of the \nexistence of the United States: during the Civil War, during World War \nI, and during World War II.\n  During the peacetime periods after each of the three major wars just \nmentioned, during which it was necessary to increase the national debt, \nwe returned to prewar levels of national debt. Now it is time to return \nto pre-1980's levels of debt. We have made a good start by cutting the \ndeficit in half, and thereby halting the growth of the national debt. \nIt ha been stabilized at 52 percent of GDP for the last 2 years, as the \neconomy and the debt have grown at about the same pace.\n  Our next task is to start reducing our level of debt by balancing the \nbudget, thereby allowing the economy to grow much faster than the debt, \nbecause the debt will not be growing at all. In my judgment, it will be \nnecessary to reform the current budget process in order to achieve the \ndesired end of budget balance. That is why I have fought so hard for a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution and for a Presidential \nline-item veto.\n  Constitutions in 43 States provide for a line-item veto whereby the \nGovernors have the ability to eliminate individual provisions or reduce \namounts of spending in legislation presented for their signature. The \nline-item veto has a proven track record on the State level at \ndiscouraging and preventing unnecessary and wasteful spending. Because \nit has been a proven, effective tool against excessive spending on the \nState level, it would make an effective tool on the national level as \nwell.\n  In 1992, 188 Governors and former Governors, including Presidents \nCarter, Reagan, and Clinton, were surveyed with regard to the line-item \nveto. Nearly 70 percent of those who responded said that, as Governors, \nthey had found the line-item veto useful. Ninety-two percent of the \npast and present Governors surveyed support a line-item veto on the \nFederal level in order to restrain Federal spending.\n  Also in 1992, the General Accounting Office evaluated the potential \neffectiveness of the line-item veto on the Federal level. The GAO \nreport stated, and I quote at length:\n\n       If the President had line-item veto authority from fiscal \n     years 1984 through 1989 and used that authority to reduce or \n     eliminate each item to which an objection was raised in the \n     Statements of Administration Policy, we estimate that the \n     savings would have ranged from $7 billion to $17 billion per \n     year, for a cumulative 6-year total of about $70 billion. . . \n     . This would have reduced Federal deficits and borrowing by \n     6.7 percent, from the $1,059 billion that actually occurred \n     during that period to $989 billion. . . . In addition, the \n     reduced federal borrowing associated with the program savings \n     explicitly shown would have resulted in interest cost \n     savings.\n\n  The line-item veto has bipartisan support in both Houses of Congress. \nIn addition, Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton are advocates of the \nline-item veto at the Federal level. In addition, according to Gallup \nsurveys, large majorities of Americans spanning more than four decades \nhave consistently favored the line-item veto.\n  There has been some talk of the separate enrollment line-item veto \ncreating a bureaucratic ``cut and paste'' nightmare in the enrolling \nclerk's office. But these nightmare scenarios are unfounded. Due to the \nmodern computer technology we enjoy in Congress, separate enrollment \nwould not pose a prohibitive burden on the clerk's staff. In fact, such \ntechnology makes the process quite simple.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the line-item veto. This is a clear \nopportunity to seriously address our biggest national problem--\nexcessive deficit spending--with a realistic, proven solution. The \nvoters have spoken; it is time to end wasteful Government spending. Let \nus give the President the line-item veto through the separate \nenrollment mechanism.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of a broad-based \nline-item veto which would allow the President to strike spending as \nwell as tax provisions.\n  I am a relative newcomer to this institution. But in my time here I \nhave observed that the system of rules we live under makes it far \neasier to spend money than to save money. Maybe that is just a fact of \nlife. Most Americans would probably agree that spending is easier than \nsaving. We have the same problem here in Congress.\n  The line-item veto may not fix all of our budgetary problems; in \nfact, I am reasonably sure it will not do so. But I do believe it is \nworth a try to make a dent in those problems, and for that reason, I \nsupport giving the President greater authority to strike spending as \nwell as tax expenditures, subject to a congressional override. And if \nthe line-item veto does not work, I support getting rid of it--for that \nreason I am pleased that there is general agreement among both sides \nthat any line-item veto provision ought to have a sunset provision.\n  Certainly the current system has its flaws. Let me give you just one \nexample, a $16 million urban tree-planting program at the Small \nBusiness Administration. I do not believe in governing by anecdote, but \nthe repeated and unsuccessful attempts to kill this program are \nillustrative. The administration has tried to get rid of this program \nat least twice. The SBA does not want the money--tree planting is not \ntheir specialty. The House has tried on numerous occasions to get rid \nof this program because it simply makes no sense for the SBA to be in \nthe business of planting trees. The Kerrey-Brown group, of which I was \na participant, tried to get rid of this program. But it has proved to \nbe the Freddy Krueger of Federal programs--no matter what you do to \nkill it, this program survives.\n  I am hoping the line-item veto proposals before us will make it \npossible to finally get at programs like this tree-planting program. I \nhappen to be a big fan of trees and I spend a lot of my time working to \nkeep our air and water clean enough to keep those trees alive. I just \ndo not think we can afford to have the SBA running a program like this, \nand I suspect most of my colleagues agree with me. I am also convinced \nthat the reason we have had a tough time getting at this program is \nbecause it has been wrapped into larger bills. When I was in the State \nSenate in Connecticut, it was common wisdom that the way to pass the \ntough items was to bury them in the big bills and keep your fingers \ncrossed that they would slip through unnoticed. Given our deficit, I \njust do not think we can afford this approach anymore.\n  In addition, I am firmly convinced that tax expenditures should also \nbe subject to any line-item veto passed by this Chamber. Put simply, \nnew taxes should be put to the test in the same way as new spending. As \na proponent of a capital gains cut as a way to increase needed \ninvestment and saving in this country, I am well aware that adding new \ntax expenditures to the\n line-item veto bill could put some tax investment incentives at risk. \nHowever, that is a risk I am willing to take if the end result will be \nmore discipline, and fewer loopholes, in our Tax Code.\n\n  We have heard a lot about possible abuses of the line-item veto by \nthe executive branch. I come from one of the 43 States with a line-item \nveto in our State Constitution. It is a pretty tough provision--\nallowing the Governor to ``disapprove any item or items of any bill \nmaking appropriations of money.'' And the provision has worked just \nfine--the legislative branch has not been overthrown, and no \nrevolutions have occurred. By most accounts, the provision has been a \nsuccess.\n  Despite all of this, I do harbor some concerns that an Executive \nmight use this provision for political ends. Surely we are not above \npolitics. I have \n[[Page S4478]] watched with some dismay as the other body has targeted, \nor appeared to target, programs which are priorities of this \nadministration--programs like national service and the various \ntechnology programs like TRP and ATP. For this reason, I am pleased \nthat there is general agreement that passage of a line-item veto should \nbe something of an experiment--that it should sunset after a few years \nso that we can debate its effectiveness and, if it has been successful, \npass it again. A sunset provision should help keep the executive branch \naway from abuses.\n  Mr. President, I support a line-item veto which covers a broad range \nof spending and tax cuts, and I hope my colleagues will do so as well.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have long held that separate enrollment \nis the solution to the tough question of how to provide the President \nwith line-item veto power.\n  Since 1984, when I joined Senator Mattingly and others in introducing \na separate enrollment line-item veto bill, until this year, as \ncosponsor of Senator Bradley's bill, I have supported both the \nprinciple of a line-item veto and the specific approach of separate \nenrollment.\n  Today, I want to explain my position on this important issue, a \nposition that has, until just last week, had little support on either \nside of the aisle. I am gratified by the recent embrace of this \napproach as the compromise position that could finally permit a \ncontrolled experiment with a line-item veto to go forward.\n  Mr. President, a controlled experiment is just what this proposal \ncalls for.\n  Mr. President, I share the concerns of many of my colleagues that a \nline-item veto could threaten the balance of power established in the \nConstitution between the Congress and the President.\n  That is why I argued unequivocally against any constitutional version \nof line-item veto just 2 months ago in the Judiciary Subcommittee on \nthe Constitution.\n  Because this is a statutory line-item veto, Mr. President, and one, I \nmust emphasize, with a built-in sunset it remains the prerogative of \nCongress to decide if this is, in the end, what we want to do and how \nwe want to do it.\n  And that is, indeed, the intended effect of the legislation before us \ntoday. It grants new power to the President--to veto separate items in \nappropriations bills, not the whole bill as would be required today. \nThis change permits the President to target specific spending programs, \nnot whole categories of Government activity.\n  But this change would not only provide the executive with additional \nresponsibility for controlling Federal spending at the margins. It \nwould put additional responsibility on Congress to remove those items \nthat would be easy targets for a presidential veto.\n  No one can look upon the deplorable state of our Federal finances and \ntell me that a little more fiscal responsibility, at both ends of \nPennsylvania Avenue, is not in order.\n  Of course, if the question were that simple, we would not be at the \nimpasse we have reached today.\n  There is honest, deeply held disagreement on whether we should go \nforward with any experiment in a line-item veto.\n  Everyone of us in the Senate, and every citizen of this country, \nshould be grateful for Senator Byrd's tireless efforts to remind us of \nthe historical significance and constitutional implications of the step \nwe are contemplating here.\n  But I would like to make two points in defense of separate enrollment \nline-item veto legislation.\n  First, our Constitution was intended to be flexible enough to adjust \nto a variety of new circumstances. Within the limits I believe are \nrightly imposed in this case--a statutory change, with a built-in \nsunset provision, in the year 2000--we should be willing to make \nincremental adjustments in our procedures that have some prospect of \npromoting our shared goal of deficit reduction and more responsible \nbudgeting.\n  Second, Mr. President, it could be argued that by enrolling each \nelement in our spending bills separately, we are restoring a historical \nrelation between the President and Congress, a relationship that took a \nnew course when we began to write appropriations bills that lumped \nhundreds, even thousands, of items of spending together.\n  I am pleased that some of my colleagues have cited arguments I made \nseveral years ago in the Judiciary Committee in defense of the \nconstitutionality of the separate enrollment approach.\n  It is my considered opinion that this approach can survive any court \nchallenge on constitutional grounds. I am persuaded that the Congress \nmay choose--as it will, if we accept this legislation--its own \nprocedure for enrolling and presenting legislation to the President. \nThere is nothing inappropriate about choosing to present our bills to \nthe President in a way that will expose them to the same veto power \nthat he has always possessed.\n  I must stress, Mr. President, that I do have some concern about the \ndifference between S. 4, the proposal before us today, and S. 137, the \nversion I cosponsored this year and--with one exception--identical to \nthe bill I introduced a decade ago with Senator Mattingly.\n  That difference is in the level of detail that is required of the \nbills that we will send separately to the President. The version that I \nhave consistently supported required the separate enrollment of \nnumbered items or unnumbered paragraphs.\n  To use one example, one of those items or paragraphs might include \nthe budget for veterans' construction projects. Under the versions I \nhave consistently supported, the President could veto that element of \nthe Veterans' Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, independent \nagencies appropriations bill, rather than the whole bill.\n  Now, some of my colleagues have expressed concern that the new \nrequirement, added in S. 4, that Congress has to include additional \ndetail, detail that could, to continue my example, include specific \nconstruction projects at specific veterans' hospitals in specific \nStates.\n  The temptation for a President to use the line-item veto to extort \nconcessions, or to punish transgressions, may be greater under this new \nformulation than under the legislation I have supported in the past.\n  Mr. President, we still retain the authority to determine the level \nof detail that we include in our committee reports, and thus the level \nof detail that will be required under S. 4.\n  And again, Mr. President, the new process we will adopt here today is \nnot a constitutional change, but a statutory one, and a statutory \nchange with a date certain--5 years from now--when its authority \nautomatically ends.\n  Now, I supported a quicker sunset of line-item veto power in the \nversions that I cosponsored, this year and in the past. But I am \nsatisfied that we have built in sufficient safeguard to give this \nexperiment a chance to succeed--or to fail.\n  Because of the sunset provision, we have reserved the right to \nreverse this decision if the anticipated benefits of this bill do not \noutweigh its potential costs.\n  Its benefits, I believe, will come not only in the form of reduced \nspending; in these times, any money saved is important, but we should \nnot expect this to affect deficits in any fundamental way.\n  Its benefits are likely to be more subtle, in the reduction of \nspending programs that can't pass the ``laugh test''--that would be \nlaughed at if they were\n exposed to public ridicule.\n\n  That is the real promise of this line-item veto bill, that it will \nimprove, at the margin, the quality, as well as the quantity, of our \nspending decisions.\n  Mr. President, a major improvement of this proposal over earlier \nline-item veto proposals is that it includes those programs that spend \nmoney through the Tax Code--what we call tax expenditures, and what \neveryone else knows as loopholes.\n  This is an approach I supported when I cosponsored Senator Bradley's \nseparate enrollment bill this year.\n  This is a substantial and far-reaching line-item veto proposal that \nwe will vote on this afternoon. And we must recognize that it will \ngrant power to the President that he does not have today.\n   [[Page S4479]] Again, I prefer the language of S. 137, Senator \nBradley's separate enrollment bill, defining just what a tax \nexpenditure is. And I supported Senator Bradley's attempt to clarify \nthe tax expenditure definition in S. 4, that could be open to ``back-\nloaded'' tax cuts that lose revenue more than 5 years in the future.\n  But the debate here on the Senate floor has convinced me that the \nlanguage of S. 4 covers real tax loopholes, both the narrowest gimmicks \nand the broadest, that are such a drain on the Federal Treasury.\n  Mr. President, at the heart of S. 4 is the traditional veto power \nthat the President has always possessed. The change that this bill will \nbring about is a change in the way we choose to send our bills to the \nPresident.\n  I have no doubt that this will shift some influence over spending \npriorities to the Executive; this is, of course, one purpose of the \nline-item veto--to exchance executive budget authority, and to put the \nCongress on notice that our spending proposals will be exposed to an \nadditional level of scrutiny.\n  This may well add to the President's influence on the legislative \nagenda, and, at the extreme, could provide a President with the \ntemptation to use the line-item veto to threaten or to retaliate \nagainst Members of Congress.\n  If some future President chooses to make such use of this new budget \ntool we offer him, then we will take it away.\n  In the end, should we not examine each of our spending decisions \nindividually? Should we not subject our spending plans to the closest \npossible scrutiny, down to presenting them separately to the President?\n  In the face of the deficit problem we now confront, and in the face \nof corrosive public cynicism about our ability to get our houses in \norder, Mr. President, do we want to send the message that business as \nusual is good enough for us?\n  In passing S. 4, we will take more care with our spending decisions, \nand in a small but important way, end business as usual.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 4, the Legislative \nLine Item Veto Act, as modified by the Dole compromise amendment.\n  This landmark legislation promises to bring some long overdue \nprogress in fiscal responsibility and in our war on government waste.\n  When it finally becomes law in the coming weeks:\n  It will help reduce the deficit;\n  It will subject a lot of questionable pork provisions to the \nwithering bright sunlight of Presidential and public scrutiny; and\n  It will also subject the President to increased scrutiny--we'll see \nif his veto pen matches his promises.\n  I recognize that the Daschle amendment--which we tabled earlier \ntoday--is essentially the same as S. 14, which was cosponsored by \nseveral Senators on this side, including myself.\n  I was an original cosponsor of both S. 4 and S. 14 as introduced, \nbecause I wanted to increase the chances of the Senate passing a \nlegislative line item veto, passing the strongest one we can, passing \none that was carefully crafted, and passing one that is bipartisan.\n  I voted to table the Daschle amendment--as did some of the other \ncosponsors of S. 14;\n  This is because we now have a chance to pass a bill that is stronger \nthan S. 14, and like S. 14, is carefully crafted to do the variety of \nthings that the large majority Senators want to do.\n  That is what we now have in the Dole amendment. As in the original \nMcCain-Coats S. 4, we have a \\2/3\\ vote required to override an item \nveto.\n  As in both S. 4 and the original S. 14, we now have a process that \nprevents circumventing the veto by passing a one-line appropriation \nbill and putting hundreds of detailed directions in a committee report; \nand we will avoid extending the item veto to policy items that are non-\ndollar items.\n  As in S. 14, and somewhat similarly to the Bradley proposal, we apply \nthe line item veto to targeted tax breaks.\n  As in S. 14, we apply the item veto to new direct spending, and will \ninclude a deficit-reduction lockbox.\n  As in bills introduced by Senators Hollings and Bradley, in a \nbipartisan spirit, we use the process of separate enrollment.\n  I said before that I preferred a strengthened rescission process to \nseparate enrollment; I still do; but taking each proposal as a whole, \ntaking all the provisions in each, the Dole amendment is the best \npackage to come before this body.\n  Of all the versions discussed, the Dole amendment is the least likely \nto be subject to constitutional problems and court review.\n  It is clear that, under Article I of the Constitution, the Congress \ndetermines the form of bills it sends to the President.\n  This approach does not involve any of the issues raised in the past \nthat might question the constitutionality of legislative vetoes or \nimpoundment powers that might cross the barriers separating the \nlegislative and executive powers.\n  Some Senators supported the Daschle substitute as being the ``middle \nground'' version. But now, by extending the veto to targeted tax breaks \nand new direct spending, the Dole amendment also is in the middle \nground and covers a range of Senators' concerns.\n  The only material difference remaining between the Dole and Daschle \nversions is whether you want a line item veto to be overridden by a \nmajority vote or a \\2/3\\ vote.\n  I agree with President Clinton on this one: I want the stronger line \nitem veto.\n  In this case, it is possible to pass the better of 2 proposals, and a \n\\2/3\\ override is better than a majority override. It is that simple.\n  In all other important respects, the Dole amendment and other \namendments that we are accepting incorporate the other positive aspects \nof S. 14 and the Daschle substitute into the bill we are going to pass.\n  The bottom line is this: The principal difference between separate \nenrollment and enhanced rescission in how the papers are bundled. That \nis all.\n  As improved here on the floor, that difference in bundling will not \nbe a problem.\n  Separate enrollment under the Dole amendment would wind up \naccomplishing essentially the same ends a the McCain-Coats type of \nenhanced rescission process in S. 4, with improvements from S. 14 \nadded.\n  I also wanted to address some of the concerns about separate \nenrollment raised by Senator Nunn and others.\n  Some Senators are concerned that moving the details of committee \nreports into separately enrolled bills would present the President with \n10,000 appropriations bills to sign or veto instead 13 or so.\n  If writer's cramp truly becomes a concern, the Constitution allow the \nPresident simply to let the least controversial or least notable of the \nthese bills become law without signature or veto.\n  Article I, section 7 says, in part:\n\n       If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within \n     ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been \n     presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as \n     if he had signed it, . . .\n\n  This simple answer is more than this concern deserves.\n  Some Senators are concerned that, conversely, to thwart the President \nand the line item veto, bills may be reduced to one-line \nappropriations, with the details, earmarks, requirements, directions, \nand requests that now appear in committee reports being moved instead \ninto floor colloquies and letters.\n  Senators who raise this kind of concern are assuming that business as \nusual will not change, but will just get more difficult under the new \nrules.\n  They are missing the point: This bill will change how we conduct \nbusiness around here.\n  The new rules mean it is a whole new ball game.\n  Senator Nunn correctly points out that, as a matter of accommodation, \ncurrently, report language is treated as ``sort of binding'' on \nagencies as they spend appropriations.\n  The point is, this part of the process should change.\n  Now, so-called ``earmarks'' will have to appear right out there in \nthe open--not hidden from view by an obscure comment in a conference \nreport that the lack of mention of contradiction in the Senate \ncommittee report means that the Congress expects an agency to honor a \ndirection given in the House \n[[Page S4480]] report as implicitly modified by a floor colloquy.\n  How many of my colleagues even understand that this is the way we do \nbusiness now?\n  I can guarantee that most Americans do not know that--and would be \nincredulous if they did.\n  The current process leads to ambiguity at best, evasion of \nresponsibility at worst.\n  Here is an actual example of how the current system breaks down--it \nhappened to this Senator:\n  In 1994, the House report on one appropriation bill took position on \na matter of agency discretion; several Senators entered into a Senate \nfloor colloquy directly contradicting the House position; the \nconference committee should have resolved that disagreement but did \nnot. As a result, the agency had no idea what, if any, guidance it had \nfrom Congress or how binding it was.\n  Well, under this bill, if we put it in law, we know it is binding. If \nit is in a floor colloquy, we know it is advisory, interpretative, \nclarifying.\n  That is well-known and well settled.\n  There is no doubt--no doubt--that no court ever would find a floor \ncolloquy to have the binding effect of law.\n  So, what this line item veto means is that a lot of unimportant \nearmarks and so-called ``directions'' simply will disappear from the \nformal parts of the process. The important ones will become law or be \nvetoed.\n  That is the way it should be.\n  What a novel idea--that we should put into law the instructions that \nwe expect agencies to carry out.\n  Some Senators are concerned that reprogrammings would have to be \naccomplished through an act of Congress instead of over the telephone \namong committee chairman and ranking members.\n  The possible problems pointed out with reprogramming, once again, are \nonly problems if you keep trying to do business as usual under the new \nprocedure.\n  Now, under this bill, we will have to decide when micromanagement of \nan item is so important that it should be in law, and when we are just \ngoing to let the agency have some discretion in how it does its job.\n  We will need fewer reprogrammings, because this new process creates a \ndisincentive for Congress to micromanage agencies through the \nappropriations process.\n  When we do handle that reduced number of reprogrammings, they ought \nto become routine legislation, basically technical corrections.\n  And, after all, if an item of reprogramming is so controversial that \nit would be subject to contention on the floor of the Senate, then it \nis too important to go through the status quo's ``informal'' process.\n                             line-item veto\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, several weeks ago I voted ``no'' when this \nbody voted on the proposal to send to the States for ratification an \namendment to the Constitution to require a balanced budget. I \nenumerated the reasons for my opposition. Principal among them was that \nthe constitutional amendment proposal was a fraud; its proponents \nclaimed that it was essential to achieving a balanced Federal budget--a \ngoal to which I fervently subscribe--when, in reality, the amendment \nwould not cut so much as a thin dime from the deficit. In addition, the \namendment, had it been approved by Congress and ratified by the \nrequisite number of States, would have created a dangerous situation \nand a disturbing precedent of sinking not only into standard procedure \nbut into the U.S. Constitution requirements that several key types of \nCongressional fiscal policy decisions would have to be made by \nsupermajorities. I was persuaded than and remain persuaded now that the \nFounding Fathers--rightly--would be spinning in their graves in anxiety \nfor our Union if they knew what was then being proposed and debated.\n  But I promised at that time, Mr. President, that I would vote for \nproposals that would make--or make likely--real savings in the Federal \nbudget, and that did not sink fraudulent or untested methods into the \nConstitution or trample on the basic tenets of that Constitution.\n  And tonight, Mr. President, the Senate is considering the kind of \nproposal I promised to support, a proposal that is very different than \nthe Balanced Budget Amendment. The proposal on which we are about to \nvote--to which some refer loosely as a ``line-item veto'' although it \nhas features quite different than proposals that carried that moniker \nfor many years--is not a fraud. It is real. It provides the ability to \nthe President of the United States to achieve real economies in the \nfederal budget much more easily than such economies can be achieved \ntoday.\n  Is this a cure-all? No, of course not, Mr. President. The passage of \nthe line-item veto will not instantaneously and surely erase our \nnearing-$200-billion deficits. But it is one tool--a new tool with \nteeth--that any President can use to remove less essential spending \nfrom the budget. And it gives strength to such a Presidential decision \nby requiring a two-thirds vote of both houses to overturn the \nPresident's decision and reinstate the spending he vetoed.\n  I believe this tool can and will make a beneficial difference. It \napplies to tax expenditures as well as to direct spending.\n  But if it proves not to work as advertised--as those of us who vote \nfor it believe it work--we can return to this floor and, by engaging in \nthe Constitutional process of enacting a law, we can repeal it or \nmodify it. And, in any event, the provision on which we vote tonight \nwill disappear automatically--it will sunset--in the year 2000 unless \nwe act to extend it.\n  Mr. President, this is worth a try. It could have--and I hope and \ntrust it will have--a sobering effect on those who seek to lard \nappropriations bills with special-purpose pork. It can provide--and I \nhope and trust it will provide--a tool to the President to achieve \nsignificant economies in the federal budget by eliminating programs \nthat are not in the national interest, or have outlined their \nusefulness but not their political patronage.\n  We must take real steps to achieve a balanced budget. This will not \nbe sufficient by itself to achieve that balance--we have much and very \ndifficult work ahead of us to cut the deficit the old fashioned way by \ncutting programs and expenditures and bringing revenues in line with \nspending. But this truly is a real step, and I support it.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Senate is debating a truly \nfundamental change to our system of government. We have before us \nlegislation which proposes to reconsider some of the most basic \nprinciples of our democracy. For over 200 years, the Federal government \nhas maintained a careful balance between the powers of the legislative, \nexecutive, and judicial branches. That balance has stood the test of \ntime, and has helped sustain our nation's cherished liberties for \ngenerations.\n  Mr. President, given that remarkable record, we need to be very \ncautious before altering this historic balance of powers. It's not \nsomething we should do lightly. It's not something we should rush \nthrough.\n  We do, however, have to be prepared to respond to changing \nconditions, and to make needed changes in the way we do business. \nDespite all that's good about our democratic system, we also face some \nreal problems. And one of the most important is government waste, and \nthe deep public anger that it provokes.\n  Mr. President, as much as any time in our history, it is critical to \nreduce waste in government. We are continuing to load debt on our \nchildren and grandchildren. The tax burden is heavy. Americans are \nlosing faith in government as they are repeatedly bombarded with \nexamples of unnecessary spending--from fraud in government programs to \nthe Lawrence Welk Center--and taxpayers are infuriated. They have a \nright to be.\n  They also have a right to demand that we do something about it. And \nthere is broad public support for trying some form of line item veto.\n  Yet, Mr. President, we should not exaggerate what a line item veto \ncan accomplish. It won't eliminate all government waste. Nor will it \nbalance the budget. It may result in eliminating unnecessary pork \nbarrel projects and special-interest tax loopholes.\n  This is not to say, Mr. President, that all narrowly--targeted \nspending or tax provisions are wasteful. But many are. And the most \negregious examples get the most publicity, and erode public confidence \nin the Congress and our government. Surely that's one \n[[Page S4481]] reason why the public is so angry with Washington.\n  We need to look for ways to address this problem. And the line item \nveto might help, by giving the President additional power to eliminate \nitems that are truly indefensible.\n  Under current law, when the Congress sends the President a broad \nspending or tax bill, the President's options are pretty limited. He \ncan sign the whole bill into law. Or he can veto the entire package.\n  Once an appropriations bill is enacted, the President can proposed to \nrescind specific items of spending, and send Congress a rescission. But \nthis rescission power is extremely limited. First, it does not apply to \ntax breaks. And, in the case of proposed rescissions to appropriations, \nCongress can simply ignore them.\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, that it's worth trying to give the \nPresident additional powers to eliminate waste. But, as we move into \nthese uncharted waters--fundamentally changing our form of government--\nwe should build in certain protections against abuse of executive \npower. Restraint of executive power has been a hallmark of our \nConstitution and guided our Founding Fathers in its creation.\n  We can strengthen the President's rescission power by making sure the \nCongress considers all Presidential rescission proposals, and does so \non an expedited basis. That would be a significant step forward in the \nfight against waste. Currently, if the President sends rescissions to \nus to eliminate wasteful spending, we can just ignore them. And we \nusually do. Forcing review of wasteful expenditures, in the glare of \npublic debate, would be a healthy antidote to our current way of doing \nbusiness.\n  We can also build in protections against abuse of this expanded \nexecutive power by retaining the democratic practice of majority rule. \nThe pending legislation would permit the President to kill any \nincreases in spending or changes to entitlement programs if he can \nconvince just one-third of one house of Congress to support him. That's \nan enormous expansion of executive power. It would permit the President \nto nullify what a majority of the people's representatives have already \napproved.\n  Finally, we can guard against abuse of power by the Executive by \nrequiring the Congress to review the line item veto after a prescribed \ntrial period. Initially, I think the shorter this trial the better. If \nthe line item veto works as its authors intend, it will have a salutary \neffect on our government and there will be no problem extending it.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the proposal before us fails to protect \nagainst executive branch abuses. It also puts power in the hands of a \nsmall minority, undermining majority rule. It lets one-third of \nCongress rule with the President, controlling Federal policy on \nvirtually all new spending and entitlement programs.\n  The legislation also could unintentionally hurt smaller States, with \nsmaller congressional delegations, like my State of New Jersey. The \nproposal would load the deck in favor of bigger States which have a leg \nup on building the necessary two-thirds vote to override a Presidential \nline-item veto. In my view, that's unwise.\n  Mr. President, the case for a line item veto rests largely on the \nneed to eliminate narrowly targeted pork-barrel spending. But the \nmajority leader's amendment goes much further than that. It would allow \na President to unilaterally eliminate funding for entire programs. This \nwould give a single individual the power to kill major initiatives in \neducation, law enforcement, health care, veterans, mass transit, \nimmigration enforcement, housing, you name it. All would be at risk.\n  It would also put Medicare, veterans benefits, and other entitlement \nprograms under the control of a small minority of Congress aligned with \na President.\n  Mr. President, I'm not suggesting that President Clinton or any \nfuture President would abuse this new power. But we really don't know.\n  That's not a Democratic concern or a Republican concern. It's a \nnonpartisan concern.\n  That's not a liberal concern or a conservative concern. It's a \ndemocratic--with a small `d'--concern.\n  It has nothing to do with party or ideology. It has everything to do \nwith the potential for abuse of power and rule by a congressional \nminority.\n  Let's take one example, Mr. President, of a President of my own \nparty, Lyndon Baines Johnson. President Johnson was a strong leader who \nexcelled at cajoling and pressing Members of Congress into voting with \nhim. I never experienced it myself, but the ``Johnson treatment'' was \nsomething that is legendary.\n  Lyndon Johnson used every tool in his arsenal to win.\n  Looking to the future, a President with strong leadership skills and \nstrong convictions would gain enormously in power. With just one-third \nof one House of Congress, he could wipe out essential benefits for \nordinary Americans and a majority in Congress could do nothing to stop \nhim.\n  Mr. President, I'd urge against giving the President that virtually \nunbridled power.\n  I'm not willing to risk that a future President would be able to \noverrule a majority in Congress and eliminate all school lunches.\n  Or deny middle-class students the opportunity to go to college.\n  Or deny working families assistance with child care.\n  Or take police officers off the streets.\n  Or force young children to go hungry.\n  Or increase the number of the homeless on our streets.\n  Or deny veterans the benefits they've earned by serving our country.\n  Or deny senior citizens needed benefits under Medicare.\n  Mr. President, these expenditures and these benefits are not pork. \nBut they all would be vulnerable to the line-item veto under this \namendment. And a President bent on eliminating them could wield this \nnew tool as a meat ax against ordinary Americans. There need to be some \nreal protections against that if we are to have a line-item veto.\n  Mr. President, I also am concerned that a line-item veto could open \nthe door to what some have called ``political extortion''. I use that \nterm to convey how a President would be able, in effect, to hold a gun \nto the head of Members of Congress.\n  This is what could happen. A President could go to a Member of \nCongress and say this:\n  ``I need your support for my favorite new initiative. If you don't \nagree to support it, I'm going to rescind that bridge, or highway, \nthat's so important to your district.''\n  Mr. President, that kind of political pressure occurs in some States \nthat have a line-item veto. And it can lead to more wasteful spending, \nnot less.\n  Mr. President, to limit the possibility that a line-item veto will be \nabused, it's important to keep the Executive on a short leash. One way \nis to require Congress to reauthorize the line-item veto on a routine \nbasis. Another is to allow a majority in Congress to overrule the \nPresident. These protections would preserve the constitutional \nprinciple of balance of power and avoid shifting power extraordinary \npower to the executive branch, or to larger States at the expense of \nmedium sized or smaller States.\n  They would make it less likely that a future occupant of the White \nHouse would ride roughshod over the people and Congress.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the pending proposal doesn't include \nadequate protections. It's a serious flaw in the legislation.\n  I'm also concerned about the provisions in the pending amendment \nrelated to tax expenditures. Those provisions, though drafted \nambiguously, apparently are intended to provide a ``loophole for \nloopholes'' that will protect many special interest tax breaks from \nrescission.\n  Mr. President, we all know the many special tax breaks that have been \nincluded in tax bills over the years. There are special rules for the \ntimber industry. For the oil and gas industry. For cruise liners. In \nfact, a few years ago we even tried to enact a special loophole for the \ntuxedo industry.\n  Once enacted, Mr. President, most tax breaks enjoy a special status \nthat even the most popular spending programs would envy. They never \nhave to be appropriated. They never have to be reauthorized. They never \nhave to compete for scarce budgetary resources. Instead, they simply \nnestle quietly and \n[[Page S4482]] unobtrusively into the nooks and crannies of the Tax \nCode, never to be seen or heard from again. But, they lose substantial \nrevenue, and their costs are made up by ordinary taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, unwarranted tax loopholes go to the heart of what \nbothers so many Americans today. Loopholes generally are provided only \nto special interests and wealthy individuals who either have special \nconnections, or enough money to hire a lobbyist with access to Members \nof Congress.\n  Meanwhile, ordinary Americans don't have these connections. They \ndon't have personal relationships with powerful Senators. And they \ndon't have lobbyists working for them.\n  So when ordinary Americans see the clients of lobbyists getting \nspecial treatment in the Tax Code, they resent it. And they resent it \nvery, very deeply.\n  Mr. President, the pending amendment includes some ambiguous language \non targeted tax benefits. But, according to statements made on this \nfloor, that language is intended to be very narrow. Apparently, if a \ntax break benefits a particular company, it may be subject to a \nrescission. But if the loophole benefits two companies, or an entire \nindustry, it will get special protection.\n  Mr. President, that's a loophole for loopholes, and I cannot support \nit.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, let me again emphasize that we're \ntalking about the basic structure of Government that was established \nover 200 years ago, and we should proceed with caution. To help \neliminate waste in Government, it's worth trying a line-item veto. But, \nwe should not support proposals that are vulnerable to abuse, that fail \nto adequately protect the public interest and our constituents, or that \nprovide a loophole for special interest tax loopholes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, would the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia give me about 3 minutes?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield as much time as is under my control, \nas the Senator from Kentucky requires.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Senator, and I thank the Chair.\n  Not many people in this Chamber--several, probably--have operated \nunder the line-item veto. As Governor of Kentucky, I was given the \nopportunity for use of the line-item veto. I had three things I could \ndo. I checked with the legislative research commission to be sure that \nthere have been no changes, or whether they have broadened some.\n  I had three things I could do when an appropriations bill comes to \nyou. You can veto the whole bill. But you can run a line through the \nitem, initial it, then you have to give your reason for that veto, and \nsend it back to the legislature within 10 days. They either sustained \nor overrode your veto.\n  Second, I had the opportunity to reduce a number from $1 million to \n$500,000 and give the reason for the reduction. I had 10 days to send \nit to the legislature. I also had the authority to veto a phrase in the \nlanguage of the appropriations bill.\n  That is all it was. Simple is better, in my opinion here. Either give \nthe President the authority to line item, initial it, send it back up \nhere, and say ``These are the reasons I had to line-item veto this \nparticular position in an appropriation bill.''\n  I am beginning to worry that we have gotten to a point where our \ndistinguished friend from West Virginia is calling them billettes. I \nhave heard of ``sermonettes.'' They are probably better than billettes. \nBut we hear all Governors have had this authority. Governors use it. So \ndo many States.\n  Well, we are not modeling after what the Governors have at all. Maybe \nthis is a little bit different, but still we deal with the legislative \nbody, we deal with appropriations bills, and third, we have a \nresponsibility to give the reason, and the legislative body then has \nthe opportunity.\n  I am hoping that when this bill goes to conference and comes back--\nand it is going to conference--that it will be a somewhat better bill. \nThere has been a lot of Members that have had enthusiasm for the \nDomenici-Exon bill legislation and it was voted out. Some could not get \ntogether on it, and as we have heard about Henry Clay, Henry Clay was \nthe great compromiser. Come to Lexington, KY, sometime, and see his \nlibrary. You would be quite impressed with that. Henry Clay said, \n``Compromise was negotiated here.''\n  Well, we have seen no negotiation here except on one side, 49-48 a \nwhile ago. When we said all this money that is going to be saved ought \nto reduce the deficit, there was a lot of blustering going on around \nhere, and they said, ``No, we don't want it to go to the deficit, we \nwant to use it for something else.'' We will see how that comes out.\n  Mr. President, I hope when this bill leaves the Chamber tonight and \nit goes to conference that the conference will have the wisdom to send \nback something we can all join in, and have an opportunity to give the \nPresident line-item veto. And if this line-item veto we are passing \ntonight is the one that comes back from conference, and it is finally \npassed and the President does sign it, I am not sure how long it will \nlast because I was amazed at the statement by my friend from Arkansas, \nSenator Bumpers. He thought he would have a sense of the Senate that \nthey would save so many acres of timber in order to be sure we had \nenough paper to be used to all of these 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, billettes \nthat are going to come back.\n  I remember when I was Governor, we had to go get bond issues. We may \nhave to do this for the President. You would have 49 pens you were \nlooking at, and one in your hand, and you would sign on the bottom. So \nyou would write Wendell H. Ford and all those pens go up and down with \nyou, and you would sign 50 sheets, as they would slide across. Then you \ngot 50 more you have to sign, they slide across. That is what you are \ndoing.\n  Maybe we could have a patent on the pens that are going to be used by \nthe President, so when he signs hundreds and hundreds of billettes that \nhe will just be able to use one pen, and one pen will work on all those \nbillettes.\n  It will be an interesting day and an interesting night. The future is \nnot yet here. We will have to wait and see how it comes. I hope this \nbill leaves here and comes back with something we can all join together \non.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 14 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, how much time does the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia need?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 4 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend from West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I will be brief. The hour is late and there has been \nan excellent debate on this. I really had not planned to speak. I have \nwritten something that is going to go in the Record to explain why I am \nvoting ``no'' on this bill.\n  But I was really moved to come over to the floor and to shake the \nhand of my friend from West Virginia. I am so proud to serve in this \nbody with so many extraordinary people, but I have to say that I really \ndo not think there is anyone in this Chamber--this is my opinion--who \nunderstands the Constitution so well--but more than that, feels it \ninside.\n  It is a combination that is just extraordinary. His ability to put it \ninto the history of the world, it is such a gift. I wanted to thank the \nSenator for sharing his wisdom, his thoughts, here.\n  I have to say when I was over in the other body for 10 years and \nsomeone said, ``Well, what do you think of Senator Byrd,'' I would not \nhave said all these glowing things because I did not understand what I \nunderstand now.\n  Having been exposed to him in this debate and other debates, we are \nso privileged here. I hope that everyone understands when we cast our \nvote on this, how it will be viewed in the long term.\n  Things may lack real power on the surface, but I guess I have to ask \nthis question on this bill: Why do we want to be here if we are going \nto give away our ability to fight for the people we represent? Why do \nwe want to be here? We do not have to be here.\n  Why not just give up the power to the executive branch--and I do not \ncare who is there. I happen to like this President. I think this \nPresident is compassionate and smart. He is a good deficit cutter. I \ntrust him. But that is not what we are legislating about.\n\n[[Page S4483]]\n\n  I see my colleagues on the other side are smiling and are happy \ntonight because they are going to win something in the contract. Well, \nI will put that contract up against the Constitution any day of the \nweek, and I am picking the Constitution. I am proud that I am here and \nI thank the people of California, 31 million people, the people who \nsent me here to stand up for the Constitution tonight.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will be glad to yield time to any Senator \non either side if any Senator wishes it. If not, I am ready to yield \nback my time if the other side is ready to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, earlier the Senator from West Virginia read \nthe names of the distinguished Americans who signed the Constitution, \nwhich is a document that we all revere. He asked the question: What \nwould they think if they observed what we were doing this evening?\n  And I ask the question: What would they think if they were able to \nobserve the spending habits of this Congress, the abuse of the power of \nthe purse that has resulted in a $4.8 trillion debt, the practice of \ntaking every penny of appropriations and putting it into one continuing \nresolution, placing it on the desk of the President at 11:59 of the \nlast day of the fiscal year and saying, ``Mr. President, take it all or \nclose down the entire Government of the United States.''\n  What would the Founding Fathers think of that practice? What would \nthe Founding Fathers think of the practice of taking appropriations \nbills and titling them ``Emergency Supplemental Appropriations'' or \n``Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations,'' to provide relief for \nhurricane victims in South Carolina or Florida, or earthquake victims \nin California, or flood victims in the Midwest--and attaching to that \nspending that is totally irrelevant to the question, totally \nunnecessary, at a time when we are running deficits of several hundred \nbillion dollars and increasing a debt which our children and \ngrandchildren and our posterity will find extraordinarily difficult to \npay? Mr. President, $20,000 now for every new child born in America, of \ndebt that child assumes. What would they think of that?\n  We are not new to this issue. Line-item veto was first introduced \nnearly 120 years ago by a gentleman from West Virginia, Congressman \nCharles Faulkner. He was the first to introduce line-item veto in 1876. \nIt was referred to committee, the Committee of Judiciary, where it \ndied. Since then, nearly 200 attempts at line-item veto have been \nintroduced, each time buried in committee, filibustered to death, or \nprocedurally blocked from direct consideration.\n  Last November the long-building anger against this Congress for such \nabuses of the power of the purse erupted, and with their votes the \nAmerican people decisively demonstrated their deep frustration with \nbusiness as usual, with the status quo, with the practice of the \nCongress in exercising the power of the purse.\n  Recently the U.S. Senate fueled that anger by failing to pass a \nbalanced budget amendment and in doing so clearly demonstrated that we \nas an institution are more concerned with preserving our power than \nprotecting our Nation's posterity. Let us, by our vote tonight, show \nthe American people that we heard their message in November; show them \nthat we are serious about fundamental changes in the way the Congress \nworks and does its business. Let us show them that we intend to present \ntax and appropriations bills without subsequent embarrassment. Let us \nsend the message to taxpayers that under our guidance, their dollars \nwill no longer be wasted on pork-barrel spending or tax benefits that \nfavor the few at the expense of the many. Let us act boldly to \neliminate the dual deficits of public funds and the public trust. Let \nus tonight show the American people that business, as the Senate has \npracticed, it is over.\n  Mr. President, it has been 120 years since that Congressman from West \nVirginia offered line-item veto. The time has come for this Congress to \nfinally pass that measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia still has 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not choose to use the 10 minutes. I \nwill be glad to yield it to others.\n  Mr. DOLE. I will only take 1 minute of my leader's time.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the long awaited moment has finally arrived. \nIt has been a long time in coming, but it is welcome nonetheless.\n  As with the balanced budget amendment, the line-item veto has the \noverwhelming support of the American people, and I hope it will receive \nthe overwhelming support of the Senate.\n  Those of us on the Republican side have supported giving the \nPresident the line-item veto for years. During the 1980's, opponents of \nthe line-item veto used to say that Republicans supported it only \nbecause the President happened to be a Republican at that time. With \npassage of the measure we hope to dispel that myth once and for all. We \nbelieve that any President of the United States, as Chief Executive, \nshould be given more power to reduce Federal spending.\n  If we cannot control ourselves--maybe the Chief Executive can help.\n  As Governor and as a candidate for President, President Clinton \njoined with 10 former Presidents and a great many Governors in calling \nfor a line-item veto. We intend to give him that authority.\n  Many in this body deserve our thanks for bringing us this far along. \nFormer Senator Mack Mattingly of Georgia first suggested the idea of \nseparate enrollment in 1985. The distinguished Senator from new Jersey, \nMr. Bradley, had a similar interest.\n  The distinguished Senator from Indiana, Senator Coats, The \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, and my \ndistinguished friend from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, have worked \ntirelessly in support of legislation to give the President this \nadditional authority. Each time the Senate has voted on the line-item \nveto, we have been able to garner a few more votes. Tonight we will \nhopefully have more than we need to ensure final passage.\n  We are familiar with the issue. We have debated it and discussed it \nbefore and again at length this week.\n  Our substitute was not perfect. The amendments offered by Senators \nSimon, Levin, Murkowski, and Abraham, have all served to improve the \nbill. I am sure there will be other issues to address in the conference \nbut we are almost there.\n  The status quo just wasn't working. We have all at some point in time \nhad some special project or concern that we felt had to be included in \na bill. All these small things added up and here we are today--out of \ncontrol.\n  Can we still add our special projects--yes, but it will truly be \ngovernment in the sunshine. Those items will be front and center. We \nhave the opportunity to propose--and the President has the opportunity \nto oppose.\n  It may not be perfect--but it is the best chance we have got. Let us \ngive it a try. If it does not work, we can change it.\n  But first--let us try.\n  I would just say, as the Senator from Indiana just indicated, it has \nbeen a long time coming. We are now going to have the vote. This \nmeasure may not be perfect, but I think it is an indication that we are \nserious about it and, again, I thank many of my colleagues, especially \nmy colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, and my colleague from \nIndiana, Senator Coats, for their untiring, ceaseless efforts over the \npast several years.\n  I agree with the distinguished Senator from Indiana we have stubbed \nour toe on the balanced budget amendment. We sent the wrong message to \nthe American people. They do not want business as usual. We had \nbusiness as usual on the balanced budget amendment but that took 67 \nvotes. I hope we will have many more than a majority on this important \nmeasure.\n  So I suggest, as I have said--I know my colleagues would like to \nleave. This will be the last vote tonight.\n  I remember back when Senator Mattingly from Georgia was here and we \n[[Page S4484]] debated this and offered the amendment and we talked \nabout separate enrollments at that time. The distinguished Senator from \nNew Jersey, Mr. Bradley, had a similar interest.\n  In any event, I think we have had some amendments adopted that have \nimproved the bill. We will go to conference with the House. They have a \nsomewhat different version in some respects, as far as separate \nenrollment is concerned. I think perhaps we can work this out. We are \nprepared, as we said, to give a Democratic President--I remember the \ndays when we had Republican Presidents, we were always accused, on the \nother side: Oh, well, the Republicans want this for a Republican \nPresident.\n  Now we are in the majority and we are prepared, nearly all of us on \nthis side, to give this authority to a Democratic President, President \nClinton, who sent me a letter today saying he supported this measure \nand asked that we move it as quickly as we can.\n  I would also like to thank my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle--I think we have handled this matter expeditiously. It has not \ndragged on. We have not had a lot of extraneous amendments. I thank \nalso the Democratic leader.\n  Finally, I also thank my friend from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, \nwho worked with Senator Stevens and Senator Coats and Senator McCain in \nsort of molding this compromise package, and also members of my staff \nand the various Senators' staffs who have worked so hard over the past \n3 or 4 weeks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n         This Act may be cited as the ``The Separate Enrollment \n     and Line Item Veto Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. STRUCTURE OF LEGISLATION.\n\n       (a) Appropriations Legislation.--\n       (1) The Committee on Appropriations of either the House or \n     the Senate shall not report an appropriation measure that \n     fails to contain such level of detail on the allocation of an \n     item of appropriation proposed by that House as is set forth \n     in the committee report accompanying such bill.\n       (2) If an appropriation measure is reported to the House or \n     Senate that fails to contain the level of detail on the \n     allocation of an item of appropriation as required in \n     paragraph (1), it shall not be in order in that House to \n     consider such measure. If a point of order under this \n     paragraph is sustained, the measure shall be recommitted to \n     the Committee on Appropriations of that House.\n       (b) Authorization Legislation.--\n       (1) A committee of either the House or the Senate shall not \n     report an authorization measure that contains new direct \n     spending or new targeted tax benefits unless such measure \n     presents each new direct spending or new targeted tax benefit \n     as a separate item and the accompanying committee report for \n     that measure shall contain such level of detail as is \n     necessary to clearly identify the allocation of new direct \n     spending or new targeted tax benefits.\n       (2) If an authorization measure is reported to the House or \n     Senate that fails to comply with paragraph (1), it shall not \n     be in order in that House to consider such measure. If a \n     point of order under this paragraph is sustained, the measure \n     shall be recommitted to the committee of jurisdiction of that \n     House.\n       (c) Conference Reports.--\n       (1) A committee of conference to which is committed an \n     appropriations measure shall not file a conference report in \n     either House that fails to contain the level of detail on the \n     allocation of an item of appropriation as is set forth in the \n     statement of managers accompanying that report.\n       (2) A committee of conference to which is committed an \n     authorization measure shall not file a conference report in \n     either House unless such measure presents each direct \n     spending or targeted tax benefit as a separate item and the \n     statement of managers accompanying that report clearly \n     identifies each such item.\n       (3) If a conference report is presented to the House or \n     Senate that fails to comply with either paragraph (1) or (2), \n     it shall not be in order in that House to consider such \n     conference report. If a point of order under this paragraph \n     is sustained in the House to first consider the conference \n     report, the measure shall be deemed recommitted to the \n     committee of conference.\n\n     SEC. 3. WAIVERS AND APPEALS.\n\n       Any provision of section 2 may be waived or suspended in \n     the House or Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-\n     fifths of the Members of that House duly chosen and sworn. An \n     affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members duly chosen \n     and sworn shall be required to sustain an appeal of the \n     ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under that \n     section.\n\n     SEC. 4. SEPARATE ENROLLMENT.\n\n       (a)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when any \n     appropriation or authorization measure first passes both \n     Houses of Congress in the same form, the Secretary of the \n     Senate (in the case of a measure originating in the Senate) \n     or the Clerk of the House of Representatives (in the case of \n     a measure originating in the House of Representatives) shall \n     disaggregate the items as referenced in section 5(4) and \n     assign each item a new bill number. Henceforth each item \n     shall be treated as a separate bill to be considered under \n     the following subsections. The remainder of the bill not so \n     disaggregated shall constitute a separate bill and shall be \n     considered with the other disaggregated bills pursuant to \n     subsection (b).\n       (2) A bill that is required to be disaggregated into \n     separate bills pursuant to subsection (a)--\n       (A) shall be disaggregated without substantive revision, \n     and\n       (B) shall bear the designation of the measure of which it \n     was an item prior to such disaggregation, together with such \n     other designation as may be necessary to distinguish such \n     measure from other measures disaggregated pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) with respect to the same measure.\n       (b) The new bills resulting from the disaggregation \n     described in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) shall be \n     immediately placed on the appropriate calendar in the House \n     of origination, and upon passage, placed on the appropriate \n     calendar in the other House. They shall be the next order of \n     business in each House and they shall be considered and voted \n     on en bloc and shall not be subject to amendment. A motion to \n     proceed to the bills shall be nondebatable. Debate in the \n     House of Representatives or the Senate on the bills shall be \n     limited to not more than 1 hour, which shall be divided \n     equally between the majority leader and the minority leader. \n     A motion further to limit debate is not debatable. A motion \n     to recommit the bills is not in order, and it is not in order \n     to move to reconsider the vote by which the bills are agreed \n     to or disagreed to.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Mr. President, I would like to continue my discussion \non the integrity of the Department of Defense budget.\n  Yesterday, I examined accounting disconnects in four key areas of the \ndefense budget.\n  Now, I would like to turn to the budget/future years defense program \ndisconnect or the plans reality mismatch, as it is sometimes called.\n  This is about the disconnect between the Future Years Defense Program \nor FYDP and the President's budget.\n  I first became aware of this problem in the early 1980's, after \nhearing about the work of Mr. Chuck Spinney--an analyst in the \nPentagon's Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation.\n  Mr. Spinney treated the Senate Armed Services and Budget Committees \nto a stack of his famous spaghetti diagrams at a special hearing held \nin the Caucus Room in late February 1983.\n  This was an unprecedented event.\n  It was the only joint Armed Services/Budget Committee hearing ever \nheld.\n  Moreover, it took place despite a concerted effort by certain DOD \nofficials to suppress Mr. Spinney's work and block the hearing.\n  In a room filled with TV cameras and bright lights, Chuck Spinney \nengaged the Reagan defense heavyweights in battle.\n  Cap Weinberger was the Secretary of Defense at the time.\n  When the day was over, Mr. Chuck Spinney had skewered them with their \nown spear.\n  Mr. Spinney had used Secretary Weinberger's own FYDP data to expose \nthe flaws in his massive plan to ramp up the defense budget.\n  This was the crux of Mr. Spinney's Plans/Reality Mismatch briefing:\n  The final bill for Weinberger's fiscal year 1983-87 FYDP would be \n$500 billion more than promised.\n  Mr. Spinney's outstanding performance won him a place on the cover of \nTime magazine on March 7, 1983.\n  That was 12 years ago.\n  Again, all of this stuff happened before 54 of my colleagues ever set \nfoot in this chamber.\n  Well, the brawl over the build-up led to a slew of reform \ninitiatives: The Carlucci Initiatives; the Grace Commission; Nunn-\nMcCurdy legislation; two Packard Commissions; Goldwater-Nichols \nlegislation; and the Defense Management Review.\n  We were told that these initiatives would cure the disease, but they \ndidn't.\n  The same old problem persists. Nothing has changed. Nothing has been \nfixed.\n  And things may be getting worse--as the budget vise is tightened \ndown.\n  The money gap between the Pentagon programs and the budget persists.\n  Today, the GAO figures that the FYDP is overprogrammed by at least \n$150 billion.\n  That's a conservative estimate, too.\n  The CBO has come up with a somewhat lower estimate but a gap \nnonetheless.\n  There is a consensus on the problem but not on the solution.\n  Should we pump up the defense budget to close the gap--as some of my \nRepublican colleagues suggest?\n  My Republican friends seem bound and determined to start up that \nslippery slope toward higher defense budgets.\n  They want to repeat the mistakes of the 1980's.\n  They want to rip open the national money sack at both ends and get \nout the big scoop shovel.\n  But why and for what?\n  The Soviet military threat is gone.\n  The cold war is over.\n  We need to begin balancing the budget.\n  And DOD's finance and accounting operation is flat busted.\n  And if it is really busted like I think it is, then DOD does not know \nhow much money it needs right now.\n  Nor does anybody else.\n  Leadership and better management are the only solution--not more \nmoney.\n  Well, in the 1980's--at the height of the cold war, Congress did \napprove major increases in the defense budget.\n  That is true.\n  But Congress refused to close the massive gap between the Pentagon \nFYDP's and the Reagan budgets.\n  The gap was just too big.\n  Yet that is exactly what some of my Republican colleagues want to do \ntoday.\n  Cap Weinberger was Secretary of Defense when we argued this out 10 \nyears ago.\n  He kept asking for more and more money.\n  But Mr. Spinney's analysis of DOD's own data showed that the military \nwas getting less and less capability.\n  The topline kept rising.\n  But so did the gap.\n  The money sacks were piled high on the Pentagon steps, but there was \nnever enough.\n  By the mid-1980's, Secretary Weinberger's 5-year funding roadmap \ntopped out at $2 trillion. That was the fiscal year 1986 FYDP.\n  Congress just did not buy it.\n  Congress put the brakes on and slapped a lid on defense spending.\n  With the help of my Democratic and Republican allies, I was able to \nput a freeze on defense spending in 1985.\n  We were convinced that all the extra money was just making matters \nworse.\n  It was generating waste and abuse rather than more military strength.\n  The spare parts horror stories kept pouring out and finally and \ncompletely discredited the defense budget buildup.\n  Congress literally carved up Secretary Weinberger's ambitious 5-year \nplans.\n  Take, for example, the fiscal year 1983-87 FYDP.\n  It's price tag was a staggering $1.6 trillion plus.\n  Congress balked and cut the plan back to $1.1 trillion.\n  The final amounts appropriated were $600 billion below Weinberger's \nrequest.\n  We never got close to the $400 to $500 billion a year defense budgets \nthat Secretary Weinberger wanted.\n  Mr. Weinberer's plans were unrealistic. They were not affordable, and \nthey were totally out of line with what was really needed.\n  That is exactly where we are today.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my statement for today.\n  Tomorrow, I hope to complete my discussion of the Program/Budget \nmismatch.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/23/senate-section/article/S4486-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENT BY THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SAMUEL BRODER, DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, at the end of this month, Dr. Samuel Broder, \nDirector of the National Cancer Institute, will formally leave his post \nto return to private life. This is an enormous loss to the National \nCancer Institute, the American people, and the fight against cancer.\n  Dr. Broder has served with distinction at the National Cancer \nInstitute since 1972, first with the Metabolism Branch in the Division \nof Cancer Biology\n and Diagnosis, and since 1981 with the Division of Cancer Treatment. \nIn 1989, he was appointed by the President to serve as Director of the \ninstitute, capping his career there as laboratory researcher, attending \nclinical oncologist, and administrator.\n\n  As a strong supporter of the National Cancer Institute, and in \nparticular, of its information dissemination programs, including the \nInternational Cancer Research Data Bank, I am personally grieved to see \nDr. Broder move on to the well-deserved quiet and independence of \nprivate life. He has been a strong leader and administrator, fighting \nhard for the NCI's autonomy and priorities. And he has worked hard to \ncreate a balance between the critically important research that NCI \nconducts and supports, and the information dissemination and cancer \nprevention and control activities that make the NCI a national treasure \nfor all citizens.\n  Dr. Broder's own scientific accomplishments in the areas of cancer \nand AIDs are well-known to all in the scientific community. He came to \nthe job of Director with the respect of his colleagues, a solid \nunderstanding of the science he was to direct and the Institute he was \nto lead, and a deep dedication to the fight against cancer.\n  It is my hope that Dr. Broder will find professional and personal \nsatisfaction in his new position and in his new life in Florida. I have \nno doubt that this is not the last that we will hear of him, because I \nbelieve that a person of his talent and dedication will continue to \nmake enormous contributions to the cause of eradicating cancer wherever \nhis path may take him. My family and I wish him and his family the very \nbest and hope that his legacy at NCI will result in the choice of a \nsuccessor who is as knowledgeable, responsive, and dedicated to the \nmission of the NCI as he has been.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/23/senate-section/article/S4487-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        RUSSIA CREDITWORTHINESS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am releasing a GAO report that I \nrequested when I was chairman of the Agriculture Committee.\n  The report concludes that the Bush administration inappropriately \nused USDA's export credit guarantee programs to expedite billions of \ndollars in loans to the Former Soviet Union [FSU] and its successor \nstates.\n  This misuse of taxpayers funds leaves me deeply concerned.\n  I have said time after time that the GSM-102 export credit guarantee \nprogram is not a foreign aid program. It is a U.S. commercial program \nthat allows creditworthy countries to use short-term debt to finance \nthe purchase of quality U.S. agricultural products.\n  But, eligible countries must be determined capable of repayment.\n  This was not the first time that the Bush administration chose \nforeign policy objectives over creditworthiness considerations in the \nuse of this program. Throughout the late 1980's, foreign policy \nconsiderations were the prevailing criteria.\n  I am all too familiar with the Government of Iraq's receipt of \nbillions of dollars through the GSM-102 Program.\n  When we responded to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Iraq defaulted on \nthese loans forcing the USDA to pay claims of over $2 billion with \ntaxpayer money.\n  That is why, in the 1990 farm bill, I inserted a provision that \nrequires the Secretary of Agriculture to determine that a prospective \nborrowing country is capable of adequately servicing the debt it incurs \nunder these export credit guarantee programs.\n  It is also why in 1992, at my request, the Senate struck a Bush \nadministration proposal that would have allowed USDA to balance \ncreditworthiness against market development objectives in using the GSN \nprograms.\n  I made it very clear on the floor, in committee, and in statements \nthat the law did not permit loans to countries that were not \ncreditworthy. Other foreign aid programs serve that purpose.\n  This GAO report confirms my suspicions about the Bush \nadministration's use of the GSM-102 Program. When these loans were \nfinanced, the FSU was not creditworthy and should not have qualified \nfor GSM-102 Program.\n  Instead, funds from one Government agency were allocated to support \nother administrative objectives. In a similar way, the Bush \nadministration loaned money to help Saddam Hussein just before Iraq's \ninvasion of Kuwait.\n  The Clinton administration understands the distinction between \nforeign aid and commercial trade.\n  Under this administration, no additional credit guarantees have been \nallocated for the Russian public sector.\n  In the spring of 1993, when Russian President Boris Yeltsin requested \nadditional foreign aid, President Clinton simply supplied the import \nneeds of Russia by using the Food for Progress Program--a foreign \nassistance program that I have long supported.\n  The Bush administration should have told taxpayers what was going on. \nIf the executive branch wishes to provide foreign aid to another \ncountry they should at least say that to taxpayers. The aid could have \nbeen provided through established aid programs.\n  The Bush administration did a disservice to the taxpayers by hiding \nforeign aid under the guise of a commercial export program.\n  The GAO report comes too late to stop the Bush administration's \ninappropriate use of a commercial export program to help the states of \nthe Former Soviet Union. But, it serves as a reminder that our \nagriculture programs are most effective when used for the purpose for \nwhich they are designed.\n  As we proceed through the 1995 farm bill debate, it will be important \nto create and enhance agricultural policies that best enable U.S. \nfarmers, ranchers, and agribusiness to compete in the new world trade \nregime.\n  As part of that debate, we will examine the trade title closely to \ndetermine what programs are most effective in developing U.S. \nagricultural export markets.\n  And, we will ensure that sufficient safeguards are in place so that \nthe experiences with Iraq and the FSU are not repeated.\n  I am confident that the Clinton administration will continue to do \nits utmost to ensure that all moneys borrowed under this and other USDA \nloan programs are repaid in full.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/23/senate-section/article/S4487-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4487-S4488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           KENNETH HALL: A GREAT ILLINOISAN AND A GOOD FRIEND\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, the Illinois General Assembly and \nthe people of Illinois suffered a great loss this week. The death of \nState Senator Kenneth Hall on Tuesday has left his family, friends and \ncolleagues mourning this loss of an extraordinary person and a great \npublic servant. I have known Kenny for a long time. I had the privilege \nof serving in the Illinois legislature with Senator Hall for 10 years. \nI am proud to have been able to call him a friend.\n  Kenneth Hall was born in 1915 in East St. Louis, Illinois and \nattended high school and college in the area. After military service \nduring World War II, Senator Hall began his public service career as a \nSt. Clair County Sheriff's Investigator. He later served as \nCommissioner of the St. Clair County Housing Authority. He also served \non the St. Clair County Welfare Service Committee and as a commissioner \non the East St. Louis Park District. In 1949, he was appointed by \nformer Governor Adlai Stevenson III to serve on the State Rent Control \nBoard.\n  Senator Hall's primary concern was always to his community, and he \nserved for 28 years as a Democratic \n[[Page S4488]] Precinct Committeeman. He was elected to the Illinois \nHouse of Representatives where he served two terms, and in 1970 was \nelected to the Illinois State Senate. Five years after election to the \nState Senate, he became the first black Assistant Majority Leader. \nDuring his 25 years in the Illinois Senate, he served on several \ncommittees including the Education, Veteran's Affairs, Executive \ncommittees, and served as Chairman of the Appropriation II Committee \nuntil 1992. His legislative agenda reflected his primary interests in \nhelping the poor and disenfranchised. He firmly believed that \ngovernment should play a role in helping those who cannot help \nthemselves. He strongly supported education as a way out of poverty.\n  Those who knew Senator Hall remember him for his unfailing \ngraciousness, and the way he cared about the people in his district. He \nwas in many legislative battles during his career, but he was never \ndisagreeable. He will be remembered most for his integrity and his \nhonesty, and for the way he always had time for people.\n  He was an inspiration to many in his community, pushing them to find \nthe best in themselves. East St. Louis Mayor Gordon Bush called Senator \nHall a ``pioneer for racial harmony, and people living together as \nGod's children''.\n  State Senator Kenneth Hall's career epitomizes what is best about \npublic service. President Kennedy once said about politics as a \nprofession, ``* * * if you are interested, if you want to participate, \nif you feel strongly about any public question, * * * governmental \nservice is the way to translate this interest into action, the natural \nplace for the concerned citizen is to contribute part of his life to \nthe national interest''. Kenneth Hall was such a concerned citizen and \nhe contributed a very large part of his life to the interest of his \ncommunity, his state, and his country. In his own way he worked hard to \nmake this world a better place. We could all learn something from his \nlife.\n  I had the pleasure of working with Kenny in Springfield, when I was \nin the legislature. He was always helpful, and I always benefited from \nhis counsel and advice.\n  Mr. President, Kenny was one of my mentors, and a shining light. His \nsmile brightened every room and discussion he was in. He was tireless \nfighter and advocate who was never too busy to be kind. I will greatly \nmiss him.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/23/senate-section/article/S4487-4", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF DR. HENRY FOSTER\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I recently had the opportunity to meet with \nDr. Henry Foster, President Clinton's nominee for the position of \nSurgeon General. I did so because, as a member of the Senate Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee, I will be called upon to cast one of the \nfirst votes on this nomination before it is brought to the floor of the \nSenate. And I wanted to know what kind of man this is, who has been \ndemonized by some and canonized by others.\n  Mr. President, what I found before me was a man of substance, who has \nworked very hard all his life to achieve the kind of success that is \nneither materialistic nor public. Dr. Henry Foster was raised in the \nrural South at a time of segregation so intense that he was forced, \neven while in medical school, to drink from a separate water fountain. \nHe suffered the indignities of segregation with the kind of dignity, \nintelligence, and vision that enabled him both to see that he could \nachieve something very important in his life--and to do it. He spoke of \nhis father's teachings of the value of education and hard work, and he \nincorporated those values into everything he has done in his life.\n  Dr. Foster's credentials alone certainly render him a qualified \ncandidate for Surgeon General. A practicing obstetrician-gynecologist \nfor 38 years, Dr. Foster is also a medical educator who has devoted \nmuch of his professional life to reducing infant mortality and \npreventing teen pregnancy. He has served as both Dean of the School of \nMedicine and acting President of Meharry Medical College in Nashville--\none of the Nation's most prominent historically black colleges. Dr. \nFoster is currently on sabbatical from Meharry and is scholar-in-\nresidence at the Association of Academic Health Centers in Washington, \nDC. He has been the recipient of many awards and honors--too numerous \nto mention here--but ranging from induction into the Institute of \nMedicine to receiving a ``Thousand Points of Light'' award from \nPresident George Bush for his ``I Have A Future'' program that promotes \nself-esteem and positive life choices among at-risk teens.\n  But as has been pointed out by his detractors, qualifications alone \nmay not be sufficient for a person to hold a position of leadership and \ntrust in our government. Especially with a position attracting as much \nattention as Surgeon General, it is important that the person appointed \nbe an example of the best that our country has to offer.\n  Mr. President, from what I know of Dr. Foster, and\n   from what I expect the Labor Committee hearings to bring out, Dr. \nFoster is such a person. In addition to excellent academic and \nleadership qualifications, Dr. Foster has traveled an admirable path, \nin the early years forfeiting a life of great wealth in a more \ncomfortable, ivory tower setting and returning to his roots--this time \nto poor, rural Alabama--to help an under-served population that needed \nhis care. Since then, Dr. Foster has helped train the minds and \ninfluence the careers of hundreds of Meharry Medical College students, \nmany of whom have followed in Dr. Foster's footsteps.\n\n  While Dr. Foster's life and career have not been without their \ncontroversial moments, there are few, if any, individuals of prominence \nand principle in this country who have not experienced such moments in \nlife. I have reviewed carefully the information available to me about \nthose times in Dr. Foster's life and the actions that he took, and I \nhave asked him about others. I am satisfied that Dr. Foster is telling \nthe truth about discrepancies that arose shortly after his nomination \nwas announced, and I am comfortable that Dr. Foster's actions can be \nexplained in the context of both the times and the nature of his work.\n  While I realize that it is still possible to learn information that \nmight raise questions or cause concern about Dr. Foster's suitability \nfor this position, I must say that I doubt that this will occur. I have \nbeen most impressed by the strong support he has received from the \nmedical community, from public health and social service advocates, and \nfrom many individuals--including several Rhode Islanders who have \ncontacted me to say that they personally know and admire Dr. Foster.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that prompt hearings can be held on Dr. \nFoster's nomination. I believe that the Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee, and its able Chairwoman, Senator Nancy Kassebaum, \nwill hold fair, even-handed and comprehensive hearings on Dr. Foster's \nnomination. In my view, it is very much our duty to hold such hearings \non any nominee forwarded to us by the President of the United States. \nAs my colleagues know, I have voted to confirm many nominees of \nPresidents not of my own party, and I have voted to confirm numerous \nnominees who did not share my view of the world and who would not have \nbeen my choice. But I believe that every President deserves great \ndeference in the choice of nominees and--at the least--deserves to have \nthe Senate consider every nominee in a prompt fashion.\n  I urge my colleagues to meet and talk with Dr. Foster, and to \ndiscover a person of compassion, and humor, and dedication, whom I \nbelieve deserves the chance to serve his Nation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/23/senate-section/article/S4488-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4488-S4489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

CLAIRE LOUISE CAUDILL NAMED ``COUNTRY DOCTOR OF THE YEAR''\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nremarkable Kentuckian who has been named 1994/95 ``Country Doctor of \nthe Year.'' Dr. Claire Louise Caudill of Rowan County, KY, has \nunselfishly dedicated herself to the medical profession and the \ncitizens of Rowan County for 46 years.\n  Dr. Caudill was one of two women to graduate from the University of \nLouisville Medical School in 1946. Since that time, she has devoted \nherself to ensuring that proper medical attention was given in her \ncounty. She and her faithful nurse assistant, Susie Halbieb, often went \nabove and beyond the call of duty. The two trudged through streams and \ndown impassible country roads to provide care to people. In 1957, Dr. \nCaudill and nurse Susie opened a maternity clinic in Morehead and \ndelivered about 600 babies a year.\n  Dr. Caudill's clinic was essential to Rowan County, as the next \nclosest facility was over 70 miles away. Her practice was largely \ncomprised of Medicare/Medicaid patients in one of the nation's poorest \nareas. She only required payment if the patient could afford it.\n  She made the dream of a proper medical facility a reality when she \ninitiated fundraising to build a hospital. She spearheaded the effort \nto raise over $250,000 and then sought the assistance of the Sisters of \nNotre Dame to assist with funding, management, and staffing. The \nhospital was built in the 1960's and was duly named the St. Claire \nMedical Center. The hospital has since emerged as a noted regional \nfacility. It is equipped with a cancer treatment center, a maternity \ncenter, a hospice, and a home health care department.\n  Dr. Caudill has been responsible for delivering over 8,000 babies in \nher lifetime. Although she no longer delivers babies, she still sees \naround 20 patients a day. Dr. Caudill is a credit to her community and \nthe medical profession. Mr. President, I ask the Chamber to join me in \npaying tribute to Claire Louise Caudill, MD, Country Doctor of the \nYear. Her commitment to the welfare of her community continues to be an \nexample for us all.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/23/senate-section/article/S4489-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO HENRY WARD JANDL\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I rise today to report to the Senate the \nsad news of the loss of one of our Nation's preeminent historic \npreservation professionals, Henry Ward Jandl, who died unexpectedly on \nSaturday, March 18, at George Washington University Hospital.\n  I came to know and respect Ward Jandl's fine work through many years \nof involvement in historic preservation legislation through the Senate \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources as well as through my own \npersonal interest, and that of my wife Mary, in historic preservation \nin Louisiana.\n  Ward Jandl graduated from the Hotchkill School in 1964 and Yale \nUniversity in 1968. He spent 2 years in the Peace Corps teaching \nEnglish in Ankara, Turkey. In 1971, he received a Graduate Certificate \nin Historic Preservation from Columbia University while working at the \nNew York Public Library.\n  A resident of the District of Columbia since 1974, Ward's entire \nprofessional career was spent in the U.S. Department of the Interior, \nNational Park Service. He began as an architectural historian at the \nNational Register of Historic Places. At the time of his death, he was \nChief Appeals Officer, Cultural Resources, and Deputy Chief, \nPreservation Division.\n  For his dedicated service to historic preservation, Ward received \nseveral honors from the Department of the Interior. In addition to \nbeing a valued policymaker, Ward coauthored two books: Houses by Mail: \nA Guide to Houses from Sears, Roebuck and Co., in 1986, and Yesterday's \nHouses of Tomorrow: Innovative Homes: 1850-1950, in 1991.\n  Mr. President, Ward Henry Jandl accomplished many things in his \nrelatively brief, but filled career and has left a legacy for our \nNation to follow as we attempt to preserve our past in preparation for \nbrighter days ahead. I hope this legacy will help ease the loss of his \npassing for his father, Henry Anthony Jandl of Richmond, VA, and his \nsister, Margaret Marie Jandl of Cambridge, MA, to whom I extend my most \nsincere condolences.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/23/senate-section/article/S4489-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/23/senate-section/article/S4489-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/23/senate-section/article/S4489-4", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:08 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to the \nprovisions of Public Law 96-388, as amended by Public Law 97-84 (36 \nUnited States Code 1402(a)), the Speaker appoints the following Members \non the part of the House to serve as members of the United States \nHolocaust Memorial Council: Mr. Gilman, Mr. Regula, Mr. LaTourette, Mr. \nLantos, and Mr. Yates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/23/senate-section/article/S4489-5", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 1158.

A bill to require the Secretary of Agriculture to issue \nregulations concerning use of the term ``fresh'' in the \n[[Page S4492]] labeling of poultry, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                   the truth in poultry labeling act\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Truth in \nPoultry Labeling Act of 1995. This legislation directs the Secretary of \nAgriculture to restrict the use of the term ``fresh'' to poultry that \nhas never been kept frozen.\n  The bill closes a loophole in Federal law that allows frozen chickens \nand turkeys to be labeled and sold as fresh.\n  I am frankly disappointed that I have to introduce this legislation. \nI have been repeatedly assured that the Agriculture Department was \nprepared to act to end the fraud allowed by current law. In January, a \ndraft rule to restrict the use of the term ``fresh'' to poultry that \nhas never been kept frozen was actually issued, but there are no \nassurances that the rule will be finalized any time soon.\n  In fact, evidence suggests that we are likely to see more delay than \naction on this issue. Two weeks ago, the Food Safety and Inspection \nService decided that it will grant an extension of the comment period \non its proposed rule. The extension had been sought by the very \nindustry groups which have dedicated themselves to protecting the \nstatus quo. The new rule was proposed in January, and the original 60-\nday comment period was set to expire last week.\n  I strongly object to the decision to delay--once again--the rule \nprotecting consumers against mislabeled poultry.\n  The Agriculture Department did the right thing in January when it \nproposed the new rule.\n  Unfortunately, the announced delay is just another in a series of \ndelays stretching back to 1988, when this same rule was first proposed: \n7 years is far too long for consumers to wait for basic truth in \nlabeling.\n  USDA has had a chance to act responsibly on behalf of consumers and \nhas failed. I am therefore introducing this bill to require USDA to \nissue the new rule within 30 days of enactment, and will seek early \nconsideration of the bill.\n  This legislation is supported by Consumers Union, the National \nConsumers League, Public Voice, the California Poultry Industry \nFederation, the Consumer Federation of America, and the United Food and \nCommercial Workers International Union.\n  Current law promotes consumer fraud, allowing chickens and turkeys \nthat have been frozen hard as bowling balls to be thawed out and \nlabeled fresh. Consumers are paying a substantial premium for fresh \npoultry that has no right to the label. It is time to end the delays \nand end the fraud, and I ask my colleagues to support this important \npiece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nappear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 600\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Truth in Poultry Labeling \n     Act of 1995.''\n\n     SEC. 2. REGULATIONS ON LABELING OF POULTRY.\n\n       Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall issue final \n     regulations under the Poultry Product Inspection Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 451 et seq.) that prohibit the use of the term \n     ``fresh'' on labeling of any poultry or poultry part, or of \n     any edible portion of the poultry or part, that has been \n     frozen or previously frozen to below 26 degrees \n     Fahrenheit.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BROWN (for himself, Mr. Simon, Mr. Dole, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        Roth, Mr. McConnell, and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 602. A bill to amend the NATO Participation Act of 1994 to \nexpedite the transition to full membership in the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization of European countries emerging from Communist domination; \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n              the nato participation act amendment of 1995\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I sent to the desk just a few minutes ago \nthe NATO Participation Act Amendments of 1995. Included as sponsors, \nalong with myself, are Senator Simon, Senator Dole, Senator Mikulski, \nSenator Roth, and Senator McConnell. And I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator McCain be added as a cosponsor of this measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this NATO Participation Act deals with the \nhopes and fears and the concerns, I believe, of every American, because \nit deals with our very freedom.\n  Every American has a special place in their heart for the people of \nCentral Europe and perhaps even a special place in their conscience. It \nwas in Central Europe where we saw the treachery of Hitler plunge the \nworld into the Second World War. No one can forget that his treachery \nsaw the demise of what was then Czechoslovakia. Few Americans will ever \nforget the treachery of both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in \ncarving up Poland. And I cannot think of a more apt description than \nthe quote of Edmund Burke, when he said:\n\n       The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil in this \n     world is for good men to do nothing.\n\n  Mr. President, that is what happened in Central Europe. Good men and \nwomen concerned about democracy and freedom stood by and did nothing \nwhile Fascist and Communist forces carved up Central Europe. We paid \nfor it in a cold war that lasted more than half a century.\n  Mr. President, we must never allow that tragedy to happen again. We \nmust be very clear that the men and women of Central Europe are \nentitled to freedom. That is what the NATO Participation Act Amendments \nare all about--clarity, making it clear that we believe the Czech \nRepublic, Poland, Hungary, and the Republic of Slovakia should be free \nand should be masters of their own destiny.\n  The NATO Participation Act of 1994 was a step forward because it \nauthorized the establishment of a program within this Government to \ntransition those eligible countries to NATO membership, and this \nfollow-on act does four basic things to improve on that situation.\n  First of all, it helps to set aside the uncertainty of powers in this \nworld about the countries' future by making it clear our policy is to \nmove them into NATO. It develops a program and a focus for this \nNation's foreign policy to proceed on a regularized path to include \nthem in NATO, to move them toward full membership. But let me emphasize \ntheir membership is not free. It will involve major new \nresponsibilities as well as cost for them.\n  Second, Mr. President, this act moves to reallocate funds for \nmilitary training that will include those four countries. By training \ntogether and by working together, we will lay the groundwork for a \npartnership in NATO in the years ahead.\n  And third, it sets forth a clear policy of encouraging United States \nsupport for observer status in NATO for these four countries, a \nprerequisite and an important part of their training for full \nparticipation.\n  Last, in the event these four countries are not fully members of NATO \nby the end of this decade, it calls on the President in January 1999 to \nreport fully to Congress on the progress of these countries in entering \nNATO. It will give us the tools and the ability to evaluate the \nprogress, evaluate the program, and take the additional steps that may \nbe necessary to accomplish our goal.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is this: Those countries in Central \nEurope lost their freedom and lost their right to independence when the \ndark cloud of Nazism spread across Europe. It could have been prevented \nif good men and women had not stood aside.\n  They, again, saw their hoped-for independence snuffed out when the \nIron Curtain fell across Europe and Soviet domination extinguished \ntheir freedom.\n  More than anything, this act says to the world that Americans will \nnot stand idly by, unconcerned about Central Europe's security. The \nloss of the freedom of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Slovak \nRepublic, and other eligible countries may ultimately mean the loss of \nour freedom.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor. Let me \naddress one concern that people have, \n[[Page S4493]] that this will be viewed as somehow anti-Russian. There \nis no question the Russians do not like this move toward expanding \nNATO, and there is no question that there are genuine fears, whether \njustified or not, on the part of some of the countries of Central \nEurope with Russia. There is no reason, at some point in the future \nwhen democracy is insolubly established in Russia--and it is moving in \nthe right direction--that Russia cannot become a part of NATO. As a \nmatter of fact, if I were a Russian leader looking at a potential foe, \nI would not be looking to the West, I would be looking to the East--\nChina, with all the population and potential there. I think this is not \nonly in the best interest of the countries of Central Europe. I think \nthis is in the best interest of Russia, and I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor.\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to rise as a cosponsor \nof the NATO Participation Act Amendments of 1995. This bipartisan \nlegislation will increase security and stability in eastern Europe, and \nwill contribute to the security of the United States.\n  This year we are marking the 50th anniversary of our victory in World \nWar II. But the end of the World War was also the start of the cold \nwar. Soviet expansionism forced us to prepare to defend western Europe. \nAnd the captive nations of eastern Europe were forced behind the Iron \nCurtain.\n  After more than 40 years of living under Soviet tyranny, Poland, \nHungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia are free and independent. \nThey are not asking for protection. They are merely asking to be full \npartners in the new Europe. By transforming their countries into free-\nmarket democracies, they have earned this right.\n  If our international organizations are to survive--as I believe they \nmust--they must adapt to the post-cold-war world. This sounds so \nobvious. Yet NATO is still mired in its cold war structure. We still \nhave not established the criteria for NATO membership--let alone a \ntimetable for admitting new states.\n  In recent months the United States has more explicitly stated that \nNATO will be expanded. I applaud this. But our NATO partners have been \ndragging their feet. This legislation will help to clarify the United \nStates position on NATO expansion--and will enable us to lead the \nalliance to meet the challenges of the post-Soviet world.\n  We have all heard the arguments against expanding NATO. Some believe \nthat we will offend Russia by expanding NATO membership. I disagree. \nNATO is a defensive organization. A country that doesn't have \nexpansionist aims has nothing to fear from an expanded NATO.\n  Mr. President, for many years I have worked with Senator Brown and \nSenator Simon to make the United States a more effective advocate for \ndemocracy and economic development in eastern Europe. I commend them \nfor their leadership and look forward to working with them to enact the \nNATO Participation Act Amendments into law.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Pell, and Mr. \n        Kerry):\n  S. 601. A bill to revise the boundaries of the Blackstone River \nValley National Heritage Corridor in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\nthe blackstone river valley national heritage corridor reauthorization \n                              act of 1995\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure today to \nintroduce legislation to reauthorize and expand the boundaries of the \nBlackstone River Valley National Heritage corridor. I am delighted to \nbe joined in this effort by my colleagues from Rhode Island and \nMassachusetts, Senators Pell, Kennedy, and Kerry, all of whom have \nworked hard on this issue through the years.\n  Before I describe our legislation in detail, allow me to provide a \nlittle historical background for the benefit of my colleagues.\n  Known as the cradle of the Industrial Revolution, the Blackstone \nValley is the place where modern America begins--200 years ago on the \nbanks of the Blackstone River, in Pawtucket, RI, Samuel Slater built \nour Nation's first water-powered textile mill, an event which changed \nthis country forever. Backed by capital from Providence, other \nentrepreneurs followed Slater's lead. Factories and villages sprang up \nalong the river's banks. Families migrated from farms into the towns. \nCanals--and later railroads--were built to improve the transportation \nof goods. Immigrants from all over Europe came to the region in search \nof work and opportunity.\n  In the 1920's, the region's prosperity began to fade. Mills closed \nand moved south. The Great Depression made matters worse. In subsequent \nyears, the Blackstone, which had been renowned as ``the hardest working \nriver in America'' became just another neglected, polluted body of \nwater.\n  But people in the valley recognized that the river still had a story \nto tell. Evidence of the region's glorious past remained in abundance. \nBeautiful dams, bridges, mills, villages, farms, and pastures--all \nthese things contribute to a special sense of place, identity, and \nhistory. Many began to realize that preserving and celebrating the \narea's past was the key to a brighter future.\n  In the early 1980's, we prevailed upon the National Park Service to \nconduct a study of the Blackstone Valley. They too concluded that its \nresources were of national significance and were well worth preserving. \nThe question was: How? With half a million people living there, the \nvalley does not lend itself to the traditional national park strategy \nwhere the Federal Government owns and manages the land.\n  What was needed was an approach that would encourage cooperation \namong communities, across State lines, and between the private and \npublic sectors. And so, in 1986, through legislation which Senators \nPell, Kennedy, Kerry, and I advanced together, the Blackstone River \nValley National Heritage corridor was born.\n  Stretching 46 miles along the Blackstone River, from Worcester, MA to \nProvidence, RI, the corridor encompasses 20 cities and towns over a \n250,000-acre area. Efforts to interpret and preserve the valley's \nhistorical and scenic resources are coordinated by the Blackstone \nCorridor Commission, which receives modest Federal funding to support \nits operations. The National Park Service works closely with the \nCommission, providing invaluable technical assistance and guidance.\n  Not surprisingly, there were some who doubted that the corridor \nconcept could work. It was, of course, unlike anything that had been \ntried before. But I can say with great confidence that the Blackstone \ncorridor is working. And it is working precisely because it is not \nmanaged like the traditional national park. Under the umbrella of the \nCorridor Commission, individuals from different communities, \nbusinesses, levels of government, and walks of life are working \ntogether toward a common vision, and with impressive results.\n  Historic treasures are being uncovered, interpreted, and restored. \nOld mills are being converted for modern use. Visitors now can enjoy \nthe Blackstone by riverboat or canoe. Parks are being established along \nits banks. A greenway, for bicyclists and hikers is well underway. A \nFriends of the Blackstone group is cleaning up the river. National Park \nService rangers and volunteers are educating visitors about the \nvalley's rich history. A strategy for reintroducing salmon to the \nBlackstone river is being developed. Imagine that, salmon coming back \nto a river that was once an environmental disgrace.\n  And all this is being done with relatively little money from the \nFederal Government, because every Federal dollar that goes into the \ncorridor is leveraged many times over by the Commission, sometimes by \nas much as twenty to one. In fact, often the Commission provides no \nmoney at all, just the expertise and cando attitude needed to shepherd \na project from concept to reality.\n  This bill, which is identical to legislation introduced in the last \nCongress by Senator Kennedy and approved by the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee last year, builds upon that success. It \nextends the life of the Blackstone Corridor Commission--which, under \ncurrent law, will expire in November 1996--for another 10 years, and \ngives the Secretary of Interior the authority to extend the Commission \n[[Page S4494]] for an additional 10 years thereafter, providing the \nCommission meets certain criteria.\n  In addition, the bill will add to the corridor five new communities--\nthree in Rhode Island and two in Massachusetts--which are culturally \nand historically tied to the existing corridor and contain the \nheadwaters of the Blackstone River. This logical expansion will allow \nthe Commission to interpret and protect the region's resources in a \ncomprehensive and unified fashion. Finally, our legislation increases \nthe Commission's annual authorization from $350,000 to $650,000, in \nrecognition of its tremendous success and new responsibilities, and \nauthorizes up to $5 million over 3 years in matching funds for \ndevelopment projects within the corridor.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that protecting and preserving our \nNation's special places, like the Blackstone Valley, is one of the \nFederal Government's most important functions. But as we all know, \npreservation does take money, and money is tight. I would submit that \nin these tough budgetary times, the Blackstone Corridor, which has \naccomplished so much with so little, offers us a model that should be \nencouraged and expanded upon. I thank my colleagues from Rhode Island \nand Massachusetts for their hard work and support, and urge the Senate \nto give this measure its swift approval.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 601\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it is with great pride in the Blackstone \nRiver Valley National Heritage Corridor and great hope for its \ncontinued success that I join Senator Chafee of Rhode Island, Senator \nKennedy of Massachusetts, and Senator Kerry of Massachusetts in \nintroducing legislation to reauthorize the corridor.\n  [[Page S4495]] As I have said before about this exceptional \npartnership project, nothing succeeds like success. The Blackstone NHC \nis a wonderful example of success. Our bill both reauthorizes and \nexpands the Blackstone NHC--the largest national park or affiliated \narea in New York or New England: 250,000 acres, including 20 towns or \ncities in 2 states.\n  The expansion is a logical one. We should increase the boundaries to \ninclude the communities of Burrillville, Glocester, and Smithfield in \nRhode Island, and Worcester and Leceister in Massachusetts. All are \nwithin the watershed of the 46-mile long Blackstone River.\n  More than a decade ago, I convened the first planning meeting for the \ncorridor involving Federal, State and local officials. Ever since then, \nthe corridor has been a bipartisan project enthusiastically supported \nby both the Rhode Isand and Massachusetts congressional delegations.\n  Senator Chafee introduced the initial authorization. I introduced the \nexisting authorization, and I am delighted that Senator Chafee is \nworking hard to continue our bipartisan, bistate effort. All of us want \nthe corridor to showcase the cradle of the American Industrial \nRevolution.\n  I would like to underscore what I consider a very important point. \nThe Heritage Corridor Commission has used its relatively meager Federal \nresources to leverage dramatic expenditures and results.\n  The Blackstone NHC is an extraordinary bargain for the taxpayers. \nWith only a modest Federal contribution, the corridor has leveraged \nfunds by sometimes as much as a 20 to 1 match.\n  My own State of Rhode Island has invested more than $7.7 million and \nhas acquired more than 250 acres of land in the Blackstone River \nValley. A linear park and bikeway are in the planning stage, as is \ncompletion of an Anadramous fisheries restoration program that has met \nwith initial success.\n  We continue to look for examples of imaginative, efficient, and cost-\neffective concepts. We need to look no further than the Blackstone \nValley--not only for where those concepts were born but where they \ncontinue to be practiced and developed to this day.\n  The legislation that we are submitting today is intended to safeguard \nthe integrity and coherence of the Corridor Commission by including \nareas that are functionally, ecologically, and historically integral \ncomponents of the Blackstone Region.\n  In Rhode Island, the three communities that would be added are highly \nmotivated to join in the success of corridor and worked hard to develop \ncomprehensive town plans. Glocester also developed strategies, \nincluding local historic district zoning, to turn the village of \nChepachet into a visitor destination.\n  Calling the area a corridor is somewhat of a misnomer, since it must \nbe understood that we are not talking about some narrow strip of land \nand water. Its boundaries comprise an area more than 25 miles wide and \n46 miles long; a management unit that now would include an entire \nwatershed.\n  When future generations of Americans want to understand how \ncommunities and industries are made and grow, if we do our job right, \nthey will understand the entire system by a visit to the Blackstone \nValley.\n  We already have noticed a real transformation in confidence that is \noccurring in the Blackstone Valley. It is a transformation that is \ncoming about because our citizens are realizing the value of our \nheritage. The lessons of history are increasingly part of the fabric of \nthe valley.\n  I want to add the National Park Service has played a strong role and \ncompletely positive role in the corridor. These are people we trust, \nwho understand the meaning of the words ``public service.'' There have \nbeen no complaints about Federal intrusion, only praise for Federal \ncreativity and skill.\n  I am pleased to note that this new authorization by Senator Chafee \nbuilds on the foundation that we established--with Senators Kennedy and \nKerry--and improves the final product. It is worth noting that our own \nbipartisan commitment and collaboration mirrors the spirit of the \ncorridor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to be a sponsor of this \nlegislation introduced by Senator Chafee to improve the Blackstone \nRiver Valley National Heritage Corridor, and I commend Senator Chafee \nfor his leadership on this important matter. This legislation is \ndesigned to build upon the successful historic preservation effort \nalready underway in the Blackstone Valley in Massachusetts and Rhode \nIsland. It was approved by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee last year, and I hope it will receive the committee's support \nagain, so that it can be enacted by the 104th Congress.\n  This legislation is the result of bipartisan and bistate cooperation \namong several Senators and Representatives. Senator Chafee and I and \nSenators John Kerry and Claiborne Pell, and Congressmen Peter Blute, \nRichard Neal, Jack Reed, and Patrick Kennedy all have a strong \ncommitment to this historic preservation effort.\n  This bill will extend the current boundaries of the Blackstone \nCorridor to include neighboring communities that are essential parts of \nthe region's history, as recommended by a comprehensive National Park \nService study. It will also continue the Corridor Commission, which has \nbeen very effective in leveraging private support and bringing local \ngroups together to preserve these important historical, cultural, and \nnatural resources. The bill will modestly increase the Commission's \nfunding, in order to strengthen current preservation efforts and \naddress the broader responsibilities that will result from the larger \nboundaries of the corridor.\n  The Blackstone Corridor is unique in many respects, and it meets \nstringent criteria of national significance. Historically, it is \ndistinctive as the site of the birth of the Industrial Revolution in \nAmerica. It was here that the widespread use of water power for \nindustry was first developed in the United States.\n  Much of this early development is still intact, with approximately \n10,000 historic structures, including a canal system and dams that \nharness the force of the river, which drops dramatically at many points \nalong its 46-mile course. Dozens of 19th century mill villages and \ncommunities spring up along the river to take advantage of its power. \nMany other aspects of the area--the farms and pastures that provide \nfood for the mill workers, and the beautiful woods and scenic areas \nalong the river--remain intact for the enjoyment of visitors.\n  The Blackstone Corridor is also distinctive because it represents an \ninnovative and highly cost-effective way for the Federal Government to \nassist in preserving historic and natural resources. Rather than \nacquiring and managing vast acres of land and historic structures, the \nNational Park Service and the Blackstone Commission serve as guiding \nhands to foster restoration projects that are predominantly funded with \nlocal resources. The Federal role is to provide technical expertise, \nset high standards, and provide national recognition. These efforts \nencourage local citizens, businesses, nonprofit historic and \nenvironmental organizations, schools and universities, 20 local \nGovernments and two State Governments to work together to protect the \nvalley's heritage, and to do so in a way that is consistent with \nNational Park Service standards.\n  When the corridor was first established by Congress in 1986, this \ntype of public-private partnership was an experimental concept. Neither \nCongress nor the Park Service was certain that the concept--very \ndifferent from traditional\n Federal ownership and control--would work. Now it is clear that the \ncorridor is a success, and it serves as a model for similar efforts \nacross the country. A 1992 report by the Advisory Board of the \nSecretary of the Interior on National Parks gave Blackstone a glowing \nendorsement, calling it an outstanding initiative and partnership \nmodel. At a conference on heritage areas hosted by the National Trust \nfor Historic Preservation, the Blackstone project was featured as the \nprime example of the effective use of Federal seed money to encourage \nlocal preservation.\n\n  Because the corridor has been such an unqualified success, other \ncommunities in the valley want to participate, and they have petitioned \nfor official inclusion in the corridor boundaries. The Blackstone \nCommission has conducted a comprehensive evaluation of these \n[[Page S4496]] communities--Worcester and Leicester in Massachusetts \nand Burrillville, Glocester, and Smithfield in Rhode Island. The \nCommission found that each of these communities has significant \nhistoric and natural resources that merit inclusion in the project.\n  One of the most valuable features of the corridor, as described in \nits cultural heritage and land management plan approved by the \nSecretary of the Interior in 1990, is its wholeness--the survival of \nrepresentative elements of entire 18th and 19th century production \nsystems, power and transportation methods, communities, workplaces, and \nmachinery. The expansion will help ensure the protection of the entire \ncorridor, including the headwaters of the Blackstone River, to tell a \nfuller story of America's industrial revolution.\n  Continuation of the Blackstone Corridor Commission is also essential. \nExisting law terminates the Commission's authority in 1996, undermining \nopportunities for the new areas to participate in the corridor and \nundercutting the Commission's effective ongoing efforts within the \nexisting boundaries. The Commission has provided a vital framework for \nencouraging the local involvement and private sector financial \nparticipation that are the hallmark of the Blackstone project.\n  This legislation will extend the Commission for 10 years, and permit \nan additional 10-year extension if the Commission can satisfy criteria \nshowing it continues to be effective in protecting and interpreting the \ncorridor through the partnership approach. The Secretary's Advisory \nBoard recommended reconsideration of the 1996 sunset clause in its \nreport on Blackstone, stating that after the planning stage, there \nshould be ``a program into which the corridor can feed, one with \nparameters as carefully drawn as those governing traditional park \nunits.''\n  Our legislation also makes clear that the Commission will not \ninterfere with private property rights. In fact, one of the priorities \nof the Commission is to work cooperatively with all interested parties \nand, in many cases, to enhance the value of private property in the \nregion, by providing technical assistance to local communities. The \nCommission has no authority to issue regulations or impose its own \nrestrictions on land or property.\n  The legislation proposes a modest increase in the Commission's \noperating budget to $650,000 a year. It authorizes up to $5 million \nover the next 3 years in matching funds for development projects that \nwill be largely financed through local contributions. These funds will \nenable the Commission to continue its excellent work in the 20 towns \nnow comprising the corridor and to expand its outreach efforts to the \nadditional communities.\n  These investments are highly cost-effective. The corridor is the \nlargest National Park Service-affiliated area in New England. The \nCommission deserves this vote of confidence by Congress for the \nimpressive groundwork it has laid and for the important tasks it has \nset for itself in the years ahead.\n  Again, I commend Senator Chafee for leading the way on this \nlegislation. I believe it offers an excellent opportunity to build on \nthe success of the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor, \nand to keep an important part of our American heritage alive and \naccessible for future generations. I urge the Senate to move \nexpeditiously to approve this bill.\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased once again to join my \ncolleagues, the distinguished Senators from Rhode Island, Senator \nChafee and Senator Pell, and the senior Senator from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy, in sponsoring legislation to revise the boundaries of \nthe Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor. The bill we are \nintroducing today is identical to legislation that was passed \noverwhelmingly out of the Senate Energy Committee during the last \nCongress. I am hopeful that the committee will expeditiously act to \nsupport this important component of the National Park System.\n  When the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor was \nestablished in 1986, it represented a unique experiment which sought to \nreconcile resource preservation with economic growth through the \ncooperation of the community, its businesses, the State government, and \nthe National Park Service. Now, 8 years later, the success of this \npartnership can be seen in all of the 20 townships and 5 cities that \ncomprise the corridor. From the historic preservation of buildings to \nthe construction of parks, bikeways, and river access, the corridor has \neffectively blended the beauty of a New England landscape with the \npreservation of the region's history shaped so indelibly by the \nIndustrial Revolution. This project has been so successful for all \ninvolved that five additional cities and towns--two in Massachusetts \nand three in Rhode Island--have petitioned to be included in the \nCommission.\n  For those of us who represent States east of the Mississippi and who \nare concerned with the aesthetic value of the landscapes of our States, \nthis project is particularly exciting. Unlike Western States where \nlarge tracts of land are protected by the National Park Service, most \nEastern States simply do not have open expanses of land available to \ndevelop as national parks in the traditional sense. The Blackstone \nRiver Valley National Heritage Corridor is a model for other regions \ninterested in preserving their unique characteristics and their \nhistoric resources without disturbing their economic base. Just as the \ngreat national parks of the West symbolize the expansiveness and \nindependence that are part of our history, the Blackstone Corridor \ncaptures another aspect of our collective heritage--a heritage that is \nrooted in the communities and industries of the east coast and which \nhelped define the 19th century American experience. This architectural \nand industrial landscape stands today as a reminder of our past and its \ncontributions to both our spiritual identity and our industrial \ndevelopment.\n  The Blackstone Valley Corridor should serve as a model for the \npreservation of our unique heritage and for the process by which it has \nbeen developed and promoted. This project exemplifies a solid \npartnership of Federal, State, and local resources working in unison \nleveraged to produce the highest level of results. it also exemplifies \nan extraordinary effort in pulling together committed private local \nvolunteers and financial support to enhance the public investment. This \nis a prototype which could be duplicated in other National Park Service \nprojects throughout the country.\n  While the success of this project is attested to by all involved, we \nmust ensure that the hard work and resources that have contributed to \nthat success are not compromised. By extending the Corridor Commission \nanother 10 years and increasing the operating budget, this bill would \nallow the Commission the leeway it needs to continue in its unique \nmission. In addition, the boundaries would be expanded so that the five \ncommunities of Massachusetts and Rhode Island which have requested \ninclusion would be able to participate in the Commission-sponsored \nactivities.\n  I sincerely hope that the corridor's success as both a national park \nand as an example of a positive public-private partnership in pursuit \nof conservation objectives will be replicated in other areas of the \ncountry. If we are to hold Blackstone Valley up as such a model, \nhowever, we first must ensure that it is provided with the resources it \nneeds. Mr. President, for these reasons I look forward to continued \npositive action on this legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PRESSLER:\n  S. 604. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to relieve \nfarmers and retail farm suppliers from limitations on maximum driving \nand on-duty time in the transportation of agricultural commodities or \nfarm supplies if such transportation occurs within 100-air mile radius \nof the source of the commodities or the distribution point for the farm \nsupplies; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n             THE REGULATORY RELIEF FOR FARMERS ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, now is the time of the year American's \nare preparing their fields for planting of this year's crops. Planting \nseason can be unpredictable for farmers. Once the season begins there \nis the inevitable uncooperative weather conditions of rain, snow, hail \nor early spring frosts. Farmers must move quickly and put in long \nhours.\n  The demand for farm supplies escalates during planting season. The \nlast \n[[Page S4497]] thing farmers need are burdensome and unnecessary \nregulations that interfere with planting operations.\n  The Department of Transportation has issued hours-of-service \nregulations that could interrupt or stop planting. These regulations \nare highly impractical, burdensome and costly for farmers and farm \nsuppliers. Simply put, the regulations would require farmers to take \nthree days off--at the peak work time of the year--after working up to \n15 hours a day for 4 days straight. I might add these regulations would \ncause severe problems for farmers at harvest time, as well.\n  The solution to this dilemma is simple. The Department of \nTransportation should waive the hours of service requirements for \nagricultural purposes during harvest and planting seasons.\n  This issue is not new. Last year, 34 Senators, including myself, \nwrote to Transportation Secretary Pena urging a waiver from hours-of-\nservice requirements for agricultural purposes during planting and \nharvest seasons.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that letter \nappear in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I want to extend my deepest appreciation to the \nefforts of our colleague, Senator Exon, on this effort. He has been a \nleader in the effort to waive agriculture from the hours-of-service \nregulations. Senator Exon led Senate efforts last year to pass \nlegislation to provide this agricultural exemption. However, an \nagricultural exemption has never cleared the Congress.\n  I have worked with Senator Exon closely on this matter. I have let \nhim know that I would introduce this bill today.\n  I have worked with my House and Senate farm State colleagues for \nregulatory relief for farmers and farm suppliers. Department of \nTransportation regulations are unfair to farmers and farm suppliers. An \nagricultural exemption did not clear Congress last year. What did clear \nthe House last year was watered down and reduced to yet another \nmandated regulatory hurdle for farmers. That is the situation facing \nfarmers today.\n  Farmers and farm suppliers want to obey the law and rules on hours-\nof-service. However, the rules do not make sense. Because of what I \nview as a bureaucratic entanglement brought about the Department of \nTransportation, I am introducing this bill today. Legislative action is \nneeded so that American agriculture can have a sensible rule in place \nfor the 1995 planting and harvest seasons.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 26, 1994.\n     Hon. Federico Pena,\n     Secretary of Transportation, Department of Transportation, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Pena: We support the provision in the \n     Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (Public Law 103-311) \n     which requires you to initiate a rulemaking proceeding \n     relating to hours of service rules as they apply to retail \n     farm suppliers.\n       As you know, current section 395.3 hours of service \n     regulations require an on-duty worker to take three days off \n     and wait in order to accumulate enough off-duty time to \n     resume driving. Application of hours of service requirements \n     upon farmers and their farm suppliers is burdensome, imposes \n     costs and encourages violating the hours of service rules. \n     Therefore, we strongly support a waiver from the hours of \n     service requirements for agricultural purposes during the \n     harvest and planting season.\n       DOT has recognized that the on-duty time of certain \n     occupations are subject to special demands and has granted \n     seasonal exemptions from section 395.3 hours of service \n     requirements. We request your support for agriculture \n     regulatory relief at least as accommodating as that granted \n     under section 395.3(c) for small package delivery drivers \n     meeting holiday seasonal demands. Farmers and farm suppliers \n     engaged in the transport of fertilizer and fertilizer \n     materials, agricultural chemicals, pesticides, seed, animal \n     feeds, crops, and other essential farm supplies want to obey \n     the law and should be subject to an hours of service rule \n     which makes sense.\n       During certain weeks of each year in our agricultural \n     states, there is a small window of opportunity in the crop-\n     planting season when the demand for farm supplies escalates. \n     The same is true for amount of rainfall or freezing \n     temperatures. Because of farmer procedures and driver safety, \n     it is impractical and costly for these workers to take three \n     days off at the peak of agricultural production. Driving is \n     incidental to their principal work function of servicing \n     farmers' fields.\n       Increasingly, farmers utilize farm suppliers who are \n     agronomic experts to help them cope with environmental \n     regulations, develop, implement, and manage precision \n     agriculture, and harvest profitable crops that produce safe, \n     abundant and affordable food for Americans and the world. \n     Over 80 percent of our nation's farmers utilize farm \n     suppliers who are trained agronomic experts who service \n     farmers' fields, which is their principal job function and \n     driving is incidental to this principal job function.\n       As you draft this important regulatory relief proposed \n     rule, we respectfully request that you take our comments and \n     concerns into consideration. We look forward to working \n     closely with you on this important rulemaking for American \n     agriculture and having it finalized before the 1995 spring \n     planting season.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jim Exon, Wendell H.

A bill to establish a uniform and more efficient Federal \nprocess for protecting property owners' rights guaranteed by the fifth \namendment; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                the omnibus property rights act of 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, since last November's elections we have \npursued an ambitious program of reform to fundamentally change and \nimprove the relationship between the Government and its citizens. No \ndoubt about it, to the defenders of business as usual these are \nwrenching changes we propose: A balanced budget amendment; the line \nitem veto; regulatory reform; and even the elimination of cabinet level \ndepartments. Each of these reforms has been opposed by those who do not \nunderstand that the American people have instructed us to rein in the \nFederal Government. But we will continue to fight for these reforms, \nand for the American people.\n  Today, we add to these reforms, by confronting one of the most basic \nclashes between Government and individual liberty: The taking of \nprivate property for public uses. There is perhaps no greater \nfoundation for a successful free society than private property. The \nAmerican Revolution was fought in part because of the threat that \ntyranny posed to private property, whether it was taxation without \nrepresentation, restraints on trade, or violation of home and hearth by \nBritish soldiers. Private property rights are the rights to enjoy the \nfruits of our labor and our ideas and thus enjoy a special place in the \nU.S. Constitution.\n  Mr. President, one of the most basic of these protections is found in \nthe fifth amendment to the Constitution; ``nor shall private property \nbe taken for public use, with just compensation.'' As the Supreme Court \nhas stated, this protection is about basic fairness: Preventing the \nGovernment ``from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens, \nwhich in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a \nwhole.'' The fifth amendment thus provides a balance between public \nneed and individual liberty.\n  Today, however, this balance is missing. A regulatory state that \nseems only to grow and grow--that is increasingly intrusive--has \nprovided the means for a sustained assault on private property rights \nin America. It is our duty to ensure that we limit the arbitrary \nexercise of Government power and pursue worthwhile goals in ways that \nprotect the rights of our citizens.\n  Mr. President, I and my colleagues today are proud to introduce the \nOmnibus Property Rights Act of 1995. I want to especially commend my \ncolleagues who worked hard to bring a lot of good \n[[Page S4498]] ideas together in one comprehensive package. Senator \nHatch \n should be particularly commended for his leadership of the working \ngroup that consisted of Senators Shelby, Nickles, Heflin, Craig, Gramm, \nLott, Thomas, Brown, Kyl, and Abraham.\n\n  Mr. President, the Omnibus Property Rights Act of 1995 would \naccomplish four major objectives:\n  First, it would require the Federal Government to compensate property \nowners if Government action reduces the value of property by one-third;\n  Second, it would provide for alternative dispute resolution \nprocedures and clarify court jurisdiction for takings claims;\n  Third, it would require Federal agencies responsible for Endangered \nSpecies Act and section 404 of the Clean Water Act to provide for \nadministrative procedures to address takings claims; and\n  Fourth, it would require agencies to perform a takings impact \nanalysis of regulations, and ensure that agencies select the regulatory \nalternative that minimizes the taking of private property.\n  Mr. President, these are sweeping reforms. But it is important to \npoint out that our reforms do more than provide that just compensation \nis paid in proper circumstances. The real test is to minimize the \nnumber of takings that occur in the first instance. We need to ensure \nthat when we pursue otherwise laudable goals, that we do so in ways \nthat allow the Government to take private property only as a last \nresort, and when it is necessary to do so, to insist that just \ncompensation is paid to the property owner. The Omnibus Property Rights \nAct of 1995 accomplishes these goals, and I intend to bring this bill \nto the floor as soon as possible. I urge my colleagues to support this \nmuch-needed legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 605\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Omnibus Property Rights Act \n     of 1995''.\n                     TITLE I--FINDINGS AND PURPOSES\n\n     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the private ownership of property is essential to a \n     free society and is an integral part of the American \n     tradition of liberty and limited government;\n       (2) the framers of the United States Constitution, in order \n     to protect private property and liberty, devised a framework \n     of Government designed to diffuse power and limit Government;\n       (3) to further ensure the protection of private property, \n     the fifth amendment to the United States Constitution was \n     ratified to prevent the taking of private property by the \n     Federal Government, except for public use and with just \n     compensation;\n       (4) the purpose of the takings clause of the fifth \n     amendment of the United States Constitution, as the Supreme \n     Court stated in Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49 \n     (1960), is ``to bar Government from forcing some people alone \n     to bear public burdens, which in all fairness and justice, \n     should be borne by the public as a whole'';\n       (5) the Federal Government has singled out property holders \n     to shoulder the cost that should be borne by the public, in \n     violation of the just compensation requirement of the takings \n     clause of the fifth amendment of the United States \n     Constitution;\n       (6) there is a need both to restrain the Federal Government \n     in its overzealous regulation of the private sector and to \n     protect private property, which is a fundamental right of the \n     American people; and\n       (7) the incremental, fact-specific approach that courts now \n     are required to employ in the absence of adequate statutory \n     language to vindicate property rights under the fifth \n     amendment of the United States Constitution has been \n     ineffective and costly and there is a need for Congress to \n     clarify the law and provide an effective remedy.\n\n     SEC. 102. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to encourage, support, and \n     promote the private ownership of property by ensuring the \n     constitutional and legal protection of private property by \n     the United States Government by--\n       (1) the establishment of a new Federal judicial claim in \n     which to vindicate and protect property rights;\n       (2) the simplification and clarification of court \n     jurisdiction over property right claims;\n       (3) the establishment of an administrative procedure that \n     requires the Federal Government to assess the impact of \n     government action on holders of private property;\n       (4) the minimization, to the greatest extent possible, of \n     the taking of private property by the Federal Government and \n     to ensure that just compensation is paid by the Government \n     for any taking; and\n       (5) the establishment of administrative compensation \n     procedures involving the enforcement of the Endangered \n     Species Act of 1973 and section 404 of the Federal Water \n     Pollution Control Act.\n              TITLE II--PROPERTY RIGHTS LITIGATION RELIEF\n\n     SEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) property rights have been abrogated by the application \n     of laws, regulations, and other actions by the Federal \n     Government that adversely affect the value of private \n     property;\n       (2) certain provisions of sections 1346 and 1402 and \n     chapter 91 of title 28, United States Code (commonly known as \n     the Tucker Act), that delineate the jurisdiction of courts \n     hearing property rights claims, complicates the ability of a \n     property owner to vindicate a property owner's right to just \n     compensation for a governmental action that has caused a \n     physical or regulatory taking;\n       (3) current law--\n       (A) forces a property owner to elect between equitable \n     relief in the district court and monetary relief (the value \n     of the property taken) in the United States Court of Federal \n     Claims;\n       (B) is used to urge dismissal in the district court on the \n     ground that the plaintiff should seek just compensation in \n     the Court of Federal Claims; and\n       (C) is used to urge dismissal in the Court of Federal \n     Claims on the ground that plaintiff should seek equitable \n     relief in district court;\n       (4) property owners cannot fully vindicate property rights \n     in one court;\n       (5) property owners should be able to fully recover for a \n     taking of their private property in one court;\n       (6) certain provisions of section 1346 and 1402 and chapter \n     91 of title 28, United States Code (commonly known as the \n     Tucker Act) should be amended, giving both the district \n     courts of the United States and the Court of Federal Claims \n     jurisdiction to hear all claims relating to property rights; \n     and\n       (7) section 1500 of title 28, United States Code, which \n     denies the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction to entertain \n     a suit which is pending in another court and made by the same \n     plaintiff, should be repealed.\n\n     SEC. 202. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are to--\n       (1) establish a clear, uniform, and efficient judicial \n     process whereby aggrieved property owners can obtain \n     vindication of property rights guaranteed by the fifth \n     amendment to the United States Constitution and this Act;\n       (2) amend the Tucker Act, including the repeal of section \n     1500 of title 28, United States Code;\n       (3) rectify the constitutional imbalance between the \n     Federal Government and the States; and\n       (4) require the Federal Government to compensate property \n     owners for the deprivation of property rights that result \n     from State agencies' enforcement of federally mandated \n     programs.\n\n     SEC. 203. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this title the term--\n       (1) ``agency'' means a department, agency, independent \n     agency, or instrumentality of the United States, including \n     any military department, Government corporation, Government-\n     controlled corporation, or other establishment in the \n     executive branch of the United States Government;\n       (2) ``agency action'' means any action or decision taken by \n     an agency that--\n       (A) takes a property right; or\n       (B) unreasonably impedes the use of property or the \n     exercise of property interests;\n       (3) ``just compensation''--\n       (A) means compensation equal to the full extent of a \n     property owner's loss, including the fair market value of the \n     private property taken and business losses arising from a \n     taking, whether the taking is by physical occupation or \n     through regulation, exaction, or other means; and\n       (B) shall include compounded interest calculated from the \n     date of the taking until the date the United States tenders \n     payment;\n       (4) ``owner'' means the owner or possessor of property or \n     rights in property at the time the taking occurs, including \n     when--\n       (A) the statute, regulation, rule, order, guideline, \n     policy, or action is passed or promulgated; or\n       (B) the permit, license, authorization, or governmental \n     permission is denied or suspended;\n       (5) ``private property'' or ``property'' means all property \n     protected under the fifth amendment to the Constitution of \n     the United States, any applicable Federal or State law, or \n     this Act, and includes--\n       (A) real property, whether vested or unvested, including--\n       (i) estates in fee, life estates, estates for years, or \n     otherwise;\n       (ii) inchoate interests in real property such as remainders \n     and future interests;\n       (iii) personalty that is affixed to or appurtenant to real \n     property;\n       (iv) easements;\n       (v) leaseholds;\n       (vi) recorded liens; and\n       (vii) contracts or other security interests in, or related \n     to, real property;\n       (B) the right to use water or the right to receive water, \n     including any recorded lines on such water right;\n     [[Page S4499]]   (C) rents, issues, and profits of land, \n     including minerals, timber, fodder, crops, oil and gas, coal, \n     or geothermal energy;\n       (D) property rights provided by, or memorialized in, a \n     contract, except that such rights shall not be construed \n     under this title to prevent the United States from \n     prohibiting the formation of contracts deemed to harm the \n     public welfare or to prevent the execution of contracts for--\n       (i) national security reasons; or\n       (ii) exigencies that present immediate or reasonably \n     foreseeable threats or injuries to life or property;\n       (E) any interest defined as property under State law; or\n       (F) any interest understood to be property based on custom, \n     usage, common law, or mutually reinforcing understandings \n     sufficiently well-grounded in law to back a claim of \n     interest;\n       (6) ``State agency'' means any State department, agency, \n     political subdivision, or instrumentality that--\n       (A) carries out or enforces a regulatory program required \n     under Federal law;\n       (B) is delegated administrative or substantive \n     responsibility under a Federal regulatory program; or\n       (C) receives Federal funds in connection with a regulatory \n     program established by a State,\n\n     if the State enforcement of the regulatory program, or the \n     receipt of Federal funds in connection with a regulatory \n     program established by a State, is directly related to the \n     taking of private property seeking to be vindicated under \n     this Act; and\n       (7) ``taking of private property'', ``taking'', or \n     ``take''--\n       (A) means any action whereby private property is directly \n     taken as to require compensation under the fifth amendment to \n     the United States Constitution or under this Act, including \n     by physical invasion, regulation, exaction, condition, or \n     other means; and\n       (B) shall not include--\n       (i) a condemnation action filed by the United States in an \n     applicable court; or\n       (ii) an action filed by the United States relating to \n     criminal forfeiture.\n\n     SEC. 204. COMPENSATION FOR TAKEN PROPERTY.\n\n       (a) In General.--No agency or State agency, shall take \n     private property except for public use and with just \n     compensation to the property owner. A property owner shall \n     receive just compensation if--\n       (1) as a consequence of an action of any agency, or State \n     agency, private property (whether all or in part) has been \n     physically invaded or taken for public use without the \n     consent of the owner; and\n       (2)(A) such action does not substantially advance the \n     stated governmental interest to be achieved by the \n     legislation or regulation on which the action is based;\n       (B) such action exacts the owner's constitutional or \n     otherwise lawful right to use the property or a portion of \n     such property as a condition for the granting of a permit, \n     license, variance, or any other agency action without a rough \n     proportionality between the stated need for the required \n     dedication and the impact of the proposed use of the \n     property;\n       (C) such action results in the property owner being \n     deprived, either temporarily or permanently, of all or \n     substantially all economically beneficial or productive use \n     of the property or that part of the property affected by the \n     action without a showing that such deprivation inheres in the \n     title itself;\n       (D) such action diminishes the fair market value of the \n     affected portion of the property which is the subject of the \n     action by 33 percent or more with respect to the value \n     immediately prior to the governmental action; or\n       (E) under any other circumstance where a taking has \n     occurred within the meaning of the fifth amendment of the \n     United States Constitution.\n       (b) No Claim Against State or State Instrumentality.--No \n     action may be filed under this section against a State agency \n     for carrying out the functions described under section \n     203(6).\n       (c) Burden of Proof.--(1) The Government shall bear the \n     burden of proof in any action described under--\n       (A) subsection (a)(2)(A), with regard to showing the nexus \n     between the stated governmental purpose of the governmental \n     interest and the impact on the proposed use of private \n     property;\n       (B) subsection (a)(2)(B), with regard to showing the \n     proportionality between the exaction and the impact of the \n     proposed use of the property; and\n       (C) subsection (a)(2)(C), with regard to showing that such \n     deprivation of value inheres in the title to the property.\n       (2) The property owner shall have the burden of proof in \n     any action described under subsection (a)(2)(D), with regard \n     to establishing the diminution of value of property.\n       (d) Compensation and Nuisance Exception to Payment of Just \n     Compensation.--(1) No compensation shall be required by this \n     Act if the owner's use or proposed use of the property is a \n     nuisance as commonly understood and defined by background \n     principles of nuisance and property law, as understood within \n     the State in which the property is situated, and to bar an \n     award of damages under this Act, the United States shall have \n     the burden of proof to establish that the use or proposed use \n     of the property is a nuisance.\n       (2) Subject to paragraph (1), if an agency action directly \n     takes property or a portion of property under subsection (a), \n     compensation to the owner of the property that is affected by \n     the action shall be either the greater of an amount equal \n     to--\n       (A) the difference between--\n       (i) the fair market value of the property or portion of the \n     property affected by agency action before such property \n     became the subject of the specific government regulation; and\n       (ii) the fair market value of the property or portion of \n     the property when such property becomes subject to the agency \n     action; or\n       (B) business losses.\n       (e) Transfer of Property Interest.--The United States shall \n     take title to the property interest for which the United \n     States pays a claim under this Act.\n       (f) Source of Compensation.--Awards of compensation \n     referred to in this section, whether by judgment, settlement, \n     or administrative action, shall be promptly paid by the \n     agency out of currently available appropriations supporting \n     the activities giving rise to the claims for compensation. If \n     insufficient funds are available to the agency in the fiscal \n     year in which the award becomes final, the agency shall \n     either pay the award from appropriations available in the \n     next fiscal year or promptly seek additional appropriations \n     for such purpose.\n\n     SEC. 205. JURISDICTION AND JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\n       (a) In General.--A property owner may file a civil action \n     under this Act to challenge the validity of any agency action \n     that adversely affects the owner's interest in private \n     property in either the United States District Court or the \n     United States Court of Federal Claims.

COMPENSATION FOR TAKING OF PRIVATE PROPERTY.\n\n       (a) Eligibility.--A private property owner that, as a \n     consequence of a final qualified agency action of an agency \n     head, is deprived of 33 percent or more of the fair market \n     value, or the economically viable use, of the affected \n     portion of the property as determined by a qualified \n     appraisal expert, is entitled to receive compensation in \n     accordance with the standards set forth in section 204 of \n     this Act.\n       (b) Time Limitation for Compensation Request.--No later \n     than 90 days after receipt of a final decision of an agency \n     head that deprives a private property owner of fair market \n     value or viable use of property for which compensation is \n     required under subsection (a), the private property owner may \n     submit in writing a request to the agency head for \n     compensation in accordance with subsection (c).\n       (c) Offer of Agency Head.--No later than 180 days after the \n     receipt of a request for compensation, the agency head shall \n     stay the decision and shall provide to the private property \n     owner--\n       (1) an offer to purchase the affected property of the \n     private property owner at a fair market value assuming no use \n     restrictions under the Acts; and\n       (2) an offer to compensate the private property owner for \n     the difference between the fair market value of the property \n     without those restrictions and the fair market value of the \n     property with those restrictions.\n       (d) Private Property Owner's Response.--(1) No later than \n     60 days after the date of receipt of the agency head's offers \n     under subsection (c) (1) and (2) the private \n     [[Page S4502]] property owner shall accept one of the offers \n     or reject both offers.\n       (2) If the private property owner rejects both offers, the \n     private property owner may submit the matter for arbitration \n     to an arbitrator appointed by the agency head from a list of \n     arbitrators submitted to the agency head by the American \n     Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall be conducted \n     in accordance with the real estate valuation arbitration \n     rules of that association. For purposes of this section, an \n     arbitration is binding on--\n       (A) the agency head and a private property owner as to the \n     amount, if any, of compensation owed to the private property \n     owner; and\n       (B) whether the private property owner has been deprived of \n     fair market value or viable use of property for which \n     compensation is required under subsection (a).\n       (e) Judgment.--A qualified agency action of an agency head \n     that deprives a private property owner of property as \n     described under subsection (a), is deemed, at the option of \n     the private property owner, to be a taking under the United \n     States Constitution and a judgment against the United States \n     if the private property owner--\n       (1) accepts the agency head's offer under subsection (c); \n     or\n       (2) submits to arbitration under subsection (d).\n       (f) Payment.--An agency head shall pay a private property \n     owner any compensation required under the terms of an offer \n     of the agency head that is accepted by the private property \n     owner in accordance with subsection (d), or under a decision \n     of an arbitrator under that subsection, out of currently \n     available appropriations supporting the activities giving \n     rise to the claim for compensation. The agency head shall pay \n     to the extent of available funds any compensation under this \n     section not later than 60 days after the date of the \n     acceptance or the date of the issuance of the decision, \n     respectively. If insufficient funds are available to the \n     agency in the fiscal year in which the award becomes final, \n     the agency shall either pay the award from appropriations \n     available in the next fiscal year or promptly seek additional \n     appropriations for such purpose.\n       (g) Form of Payment.--Payment under this section, as that \n     form is agreed to by the agency head and the private property \n     owner, may be in the form of--\n       (1) payment of an amount equal to the fair market value of \n     the property on the day before the date of the final \n     qualified agency action with respect to which the property or \n     interest is acquired; or\n       (2) a payment of an amount equal to the reduction in value.\n\n     SEC. 509. PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNER PARTICIPATION IN COOPERATIVE \n                   AGREEMENTS.\n\n       Section 6 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1535) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, \n     when the Secretary enters into a management agreement under \n     subsection (b) with any non-Federal person that establishes \n     restrictions on the use of property, the Secretary shall \n     notify all private property owners or lessees of the property \n     that is subject to the management agreement and shall provide \n     an opportunity for each private property owner or lessee to \n     participate in the management agreement.''.\n\n     SEC. 510. ELECTION OF REMEDIES.\n\n       Nothing in this title shall be construed to--\n       (1) deny any person the right, as a condition precedent or \n     as a requirement to exhaust administrative remedies, to \n     proceed under title II or III of this Act;\n       (2) bar any claim of any person relating to such person's \n     property under any other law, including claims made under \n     section 1346 or 1402 of title 28, United States Code, or \n     chapter 91 of title 28, United States Code; or\n       (3) constitute a conclusive determination of--\n       (A) the value of property for purposes of an appraisal for \n     the acquisition of property, or for the determination of \n     damages; or\n       (B) any other material issue.\n                        TITLE VI--MISCELLANEOUS\n\n     SEC. 601. SEVERABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this Act, an amendment made by this \n     Act, or the application of such provision or amendment to any \n     person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the \n     remainder of this Act, the amendments made by this Act, and \n     the application of the provisions of such to any person or \n     circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\n\n     SEC. 602. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       Except as otherwise provided in this Act, the provisions of \n     this Act shall take effect on the date of enactment and shall \n     apply to any agency action of the United States Government \n     after such date.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to support the \nintroduction of the Omnibus Property Rights Act of 1995. This bill is \nan omnibus property rights measure that combines four different \napproaches, contained in separate titles in the act, designed to \nprotect private property from Federal Government intrusion. The \ncitizens of Utah understand that the right to own property is a \nprecious fundamental right, one which is vulnerable to an overbearing \nFederal Government.\n  At my urging, four different approaches contained in various bills, \nbills designed to protect private property from Federal Government \nintrusion and introduced by several Senators, were merged in a single \nbill. I believed that the combination of these approaches would be far \nmore efficacious in protecting private property than in just relying on \na single strategy. This omnibus bill is the product of almost a year of \nwork and countless drafts and represents the most sophisticated \nlegislative mechanism to foster and protect the private ownership of \nproperty. I want to commend Senators Dole, Gramm of Texas, Shelby, \nNickles, Brown, Craig, Lott, Heflin, Kyl, Abraham, and Thomas, and \ntheir staffs, for participating in this project. I intend to hold \nformal hearings on this bill in the very near future.\n  The first approach under the bill encompasses property rights \nlitigation reform. This approach, advocated by myself and in part by \nSenator Gramm of Texas, establishes a distinct Federal fifth amendment \ntakings claim against Federal agencies by aggrieved property owners, \nthus clarifying the sometimes incoherent and contradictory \nconstitutional property rights case law. It also resolves the \njurisdictional dispute between the Federal district courts and the \nCourt of Federal Claims over fifth amendment takings cases. It is a \nrefinement of a proposal I placed in the Congressional Record on \nOctober 7, 1994.\n  The second approach, promoted by Senator Dole, in essence codifies \nPresident Reagan's Executive Order 12630. Under this approach, a \nFederal agency must conduct a private property taking impact analysis \nbefore issuing or promulgating any policy, regulation, or related \nagency action which is likely to result in a taking of private \nproperty. Significantly, we have added to this section a reg. reform \nprovision that prohibits any rule from becoming final if the rule could \nreasonably be construed when enforced to result in an uncompensated \ntaking of private property.\n  The third approach, initiated by Senators Shelby and Nickles, \nestablishes an agency administrative appellate and compensation \nprocedure for takings of real property during enforcement and \nadministration of both the Endangered Species Act and the Wetlands \nPreservation Program under section 404 of the Clean Water Act.\n  These acts present special enforcement problems and an agency \nappellate and compensation procedure allows the agency and the \naggrieved party the option to avoid litigation. The fourth approach \nprovides for alternative dispute resolution in arbitration proceedings. \nI must add that the bill provides for a complete election of remedies. \nIf a decision of an agency appeal is unreasonably delayed, an aggrieved \nparty may drop the appeal and litigate according to the terms of the \nact. These four approaches, established by the Omnibus Property Rights \nAct, together function to empower the property owner with mechanisms to \nvindicate the fundamental constitutional right of private ownership of \nproperty, while instituting powerful incentives for Federal agencies \nboth to protect private property and include such protection in agency \nplanning and regulating.\n\n\n                     importance of private property\n\n  The private ownership of property is essential to a free society and \nis an integral part of our Judeo-Christian culture and the Western \ntradition of liberty and limited government. Private ownership of \nproperty and the sanctity of property rights reflects the distinction \nin our culture between a preexisting civil society and the state that \nis consequently established to promote order. Private property creates \nthe social and economic organizations that counterbalance the power of \nthe state by providing an alternative source of power and prestige to \nthe state itself. It is therefore a necessary condition of liberty and \nprosperity.\n  While government is properly understood to be instituted to protect \nliberty within an orderly society and such liberty is commonly \nunderstood to include the right of free speech, assembly, religious \nexercise, and other rights such as those enumerated in the Bill of \nRights, it is all too often forgotten that the right of private \nownership of property is also a critical component of liberty. To the \n17th-century English political philosopher, John Locke, who \n[[Page S4503]] greatly influenced the Founders of our Republic, the \nvery role of government is to protect property: ``The great and chief \nend therefore, on Men uniting into Commonwealths, and putting \nthemselves under Government, is the preservation of their property.'' \n[J. Locke, Second Treatise ch. 9, Sec. 124, in J. Locke, ``Two \nTreatises of Government'' (1698)]. The Framers of our Constitution \nlikewise viewed the function of government as one of fostering \nindividual liberties through the protection of property interests. \nJames Madison, termed the ``Father of the Constitution,'' unhesitantly \nendorsed this Lockean viewpoint when he wrote in the Federalist No. 54 \nthat ``[government] is instituted no less for the protection of \nproperty, than of the persons of individuals.'' Indeed, to Madison, the \nprivate possession of property was viewed as a natural and individual \nright both to be protected against government encroachment and to be \nprotected by government against others.\n  To be sure, the private ownership of property was not considered \nabsolute. Property owners could not exercise their\n rights as a nuisance that harmed their neighbors, and Government could \nuse, what was termed in the 18th century, its despotic power of eminent \ndomain to seize property for public use. Justice, it became to be \nbelieved, required compensation for the property taken by Government. \nThe earliest example of a compensation requirement is found in chapter \n28 of the Magna Carta of 1215, which reads:\n\n       No constable or other bailiff of ours shall take corn or \n     other provisions from anyone without immediately tendering \n     money therefor, unless he can have postponement thereof by \n     permission of the seller.\n\n  But the record of English and colonial compensation for taken \nproperty was spotty at best, although it has been argued by some \nhistorians and legal scholars that compensation for takings of property \nbecame recognized as customary practice during the American colonial \nperiod. [See W. Stoebuck, ``A General Theory of Eminent Domain,'' 47 \nWash. L. Rev. 53 (1972)].\n  Nevertheless, by American independence the compensation requirement \nwas considered a necessary restraint on arbitrary governmental seizures \nof property. The Vermont Constitution of 1777, the Massachusetts \nConstitution of 1780, and the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, recognized \nthat compensation must be paid whenever property was taken for general \npublic use or for public exigencies. And although accounts of the 1791 \ncongressional debate over the Bill of Rights provide no evidence of why \na public use and just compensation requirement for takings of private \nproperty was eventually included in the fifth amendment, James Madison, \nthe author of the fifth amendment, reflected the views of other \nsupporters of the new Constitution who feared the example to the new \nCongress of uncompensated seizures of property for building of roads \nand forgiveness of debts by radical State legislatures. Consequently, \nthe phrase ``[n]or shall private property be taken for public use, \nwithout just compensation'' was included within the fifth amendment to \nthe Constitution.\n\n\n                  the modern threat to property rights\n\n  Despite this historical pedigree and the constitutional requirement \nfor the protection of property rights, the America of the mid- and \nlate-20th century has witnessed an explosion of Federal regulation of \nsociety that has jeopardized the private ownership of property with the \nconsequent loss of individual liberty. Indeed, the most recent estimate \nof the direct--that is, not counting indirect costs such as higher \nconsumer prices--cost of Federal regulation was $857 billion for 1992. \nToday, the cost to the society probably is approaching $1 trillion. \nAccording to economist Paul Craig Roberts, the number of laws Americans \nare forced to endure has risen a staggering 3,000 percent since the \nturn of the century. Every day the Federal Register grows by an \nincredible 200 pages, containing new rules and obligations imposed on \nthe American people by supposedly their Government.\n  Furthermore, even the very concept of private property is under \nattack. Indeed, certain environmental activists have termed private \nproperty an ``outmoded concept'' which presents an impediment to the \nFederal Government's resolution of society's problems. It is this type \nof thinking that has led regulators, in the rush of governmental social \nengineering, to ignore individual rights. Here are just a few of the \nhundreds--if not thousands--of examples that occur nationwide:\n  Mrs. Nellie Edwards was the owner of 36 acres of prime land that was \nseized by the city of Provo, UT, last year for an airport expansion \nproject. Mrs. Edwards received only $21,500 for her land, which was \nwell below the expected market value of the land because, unbeknownst \nto her, the Army Corps of Engineers had arbitrarily classified part of \nher land as a wetland. Mrs. Edwards, in essence, was victimized by the \nlow-land value attached to wetlands. But the infuriating part of this \nsad story is that an investigator examined her land and saw absolutely \nno water or wildlife present on the land.\n  Ocie Mills, a Florida builder, and his son were sent to prison for 2 \nyears for violating the Clean Water Act for placing sand on a quarter-\nacre lot he owned;\n  Under this same act, a small Oregon school district faced a Federal \nlawsuit for dumping clean fill to build a baseball-soccer field for its \nstudents and had to spend thousands of dollars to remove the fill;\n  Ronald Angelocci was jailed for violating the Clean Water Act for \ndumping several truckloads of dirt in the backyard of his Michigan home \nto help a family member who had acute asthma and allergies aggravated \nby plants in the backyard; and\n  A retired couple in the Poconos, after obtaining the necessary \npermits to build their home, was informed by the Army Corps of \nEngineers--4 years later--that they built their home on wetlands and \nfaced penalties of $50,000 a day if they did not restore most of the \nland to its natural state.\n  See B. Bovard, ``Lost Rights,'' 35 (1944); N. Marzulla, ``The \nGovernment's War on Property Rights,'' Defenders of Property Rights \n(1994).\n\n\n            current protection of property rights fall short\n\n  Judicial protection of property rights against the regulatory state \nhas been both inconsistent and ineffective. Physical\n invasions and Government seizures of property have been fairly easy \nfor courts to analyze as a species of eminent domain, not so the effect \nof regulations which either diminish the value of the property or \nappropriate a property interest. This key problem to the regulatory \ntakings dilemma was recognized by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in \nPennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393 (1922). Just how do courts \ndetermine when regulation amounts to a taking? Holmes' answer, ``if \nregulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking,'' 260 U.S. \nat 415, is nothing more than an ipse dixit. In the 73 years since \nMahon, the Court has eschewed any set formula for determining how far \nis too far, preferring to engage in ad hoc factual inquiries, such as \nthe three-part test made famous by Penn Central Transportation Co. v. \nCity of New York,  438 U.S. 104 (1978), which balances the economic \nimpact of the regulation on property and the character of the \nregulation against specific restrictions on investment-backed \nexpectations of the property owner.\n\n  Despite the valiant attempt by the Rehnquist Court to clarify \nregulatory takings analysis in Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483 \nU.S. 825 (1987), Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 112 S.Ct. \n2886 (1992), and in its recent decision of Dolan v. City of Tigard, No. \n93-518 (June 24, 1994), takings analysis is basically incoherent and \nconfusing and applied by lower courts haphazardly. The incremental, \nfact-specific approach that courts now must employ in the absence of \nadequate statutory language to vindicate property rights under the \nfifth amendment thus has been ineffective and costly. There is, \naccordingly, a need for Congress to clarify the law by providing bright \nline standards and an effective remedy. As Chief Judge Loren A. Smith \nof the Court of Federal Claims, the court responsible for administering \ntakings claims against the United States, opined in Bowles v. United \nStates, 31 Fed. Cl. 37 (1994):\n\n     [j]udicial decisions are far less sensitive to societal \n     problems than the law and policy made by the political \n     branches of our great constitutional system. At best courts \n     sketch the outlines of individual rights, they cannot \n     [[Page S4504]] hope to fill in the portrait of wise and just \n     social and economic policy.\n\n  This incoherence and confusion over the substance of takings claims \nis matched by the muddle over jurisdiction of property rights claims. \nThe Tucker Act, which waives the sovereign immunity of the United \nStates by granting the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction to \nentertain monetary claims against the United States, actually \ncomplicates the ability of a property owner to vindicate the right to \njust compensation for a Government action that has caused a taking. The \nlaw currently forces a property owner to elect between equitable relief \nin the Federal district court and monetary relief in the Court of \nFederal Claims. Further difficulty arises when the law is used by the \nGovernment to urge dismissal in the district court on the ground that \nthe plaintiff should seek\n just compensation in the Court of Federal Claims, and is used to urge \ndismissal in the Court of Federal Claims on the ground that plaintiff \nshould first seek equitable relief in the district court. This Tucker \nAct shuffle is aggravated by section 1500 of the Tucker Act, which \ndenies the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction to entertain a suit \nwhich is pending in another court and brought by the same plaintiff. \nSection 1500 is so poorly drafted and has brought so many hardships, \nthat Justice Stevens, in Keene Corporation v. United States, 113 S.Ct. \n2035, 2048 (1933), has called for its repeal or amendment.\n\n  Title II of the Omnibus Property Rights Act, which I introduced as S. \n135 in January, addresses these problems. In terms of clarifying the \nsubstance of takings claims, it first clearly defines property \ninterests that are subject to the act's takings analysis. In this way a \nfloor definition of property is established by which the Federal \nGovernment may not eviscerate. This title also establishes the elements \nof a takings claim by codifying and clarifying the holdings of the \nNollan, Lucas, and Dolan cases. For instance, Dolan's rough \nproportionality test is interpreted to apply to all exaction situations \nwhereby an owner's otherwise lawful right to use property is exacted as \na condition for granting a Federal permit. And a distinction is drawn \nbetween a noncompensable mere diminution of value of property as a \nresult of Federal regulation and a compensable partial taking, which is \ndefined as any agency action that diminishes the fair market value of \nthe affected property by 33 percent or more. The result of drawing \nthese bright lines will not end fact-specific litigation, which is \nendemic to all law suits, but it will ameliorate the ever-increasing ad \nhoc and arbitrary nature of takings claims.\n  This title also resolves the jurisdictional confusion over takings \nclaims. Because property owners should be able fully to recover for a \ntaking in one court, the Tucker Act is amended giving both the district \ncourts and the Court of Federal Claims concurrent jurisdiction to hear \nall claims relating to property rights. Furthermore, to resolve any \nfurther jurisdictional ambiguity, section 1500 of the Tucker Act is \nrepealed.\n  Finally, I want to respond to any suggestion that may arise that this \nact will impede Government's ability to protect the environment or \npromote health and safety through regulation. This legislation does not \nemasculate the Government's ability to prevent individuals or \nbusinesses from polluting. It is well established that the Constitution \nonly protects a right to reasonable use of property. All property \nowners are subject to prior restraints on the use of their property, \nsuch as nuisance laws which prevents owners from using their property \nin a manner that interferes with others. The Government has always been \nable to prevent harmful or noxious uses of property without being \nobligated to compensate the property owner, as long as the limitations \non the use of property ``inhere in the title itself.'' In other words, \nthe restrictions must be based on ``background principles of State \nproperty and nuisance law'' already extant. The Omnibus Property Rights \nAct codifies this principle in a nuisance exception to the requirement \nof the Government to pay compensation.\n  Nor does the Omnibus Property Rights Act hinder the Government's \nability to protect public health and safety. The act simply does not \nobstruct the Government from acting to prevent imminent harm to the \npublic safety or health or diminish what would be considered a public \nnuisance. Again, this is made clear in the provision of the act that \nexempts nuisance from compensation. What the act does is force the \nFederal Government to pay compensation to those who are singled out to \npay for regulation that benefits the entire public. In other words, it \ndoes not prevent regulation, but fulfills the promise of the fifth \namendment, which the Supreme Court in Armstrong v. United States, 364 \nU.S. 40, 49 (1960), opined is:\n\n     to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear \n     public burdens, which in all fairness and justice, should be \n     borne by the public as a whole.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor to \nthe Omnibus Private Property Act. Since the beginning of this Congress, \nmany bills to protect private property rights have been introduced. \nThis bill encompasses those bills in a comprehensive proposal.\n  For too long, Washington has disregarded the fifth amendment to our \nConstitution. Laws, regulations, and other actions have allowed the \nrights of private property owners to be abused. Now we have the \nopportunity to provide a consistent Federal policy to encourage, \nsupport, and promote the private ownership of property and to ensure \nthe constitutional and legal rights of private property owners.\n  The legislation we are introducing reaffirms our private property \nrights. It requires compensation for a loss of property value when the \nFederal Government takes certain actions. The bill also allows for \ntaking disputes to be resolved through settlement or arbitration as an \nalternative to litigation. In addition, the Omnibus Private Property \nRights Act requires that the Federal agencies responsible for enforcing \nthe Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act establish procedures \nso private property owners may appeal actions and seek compensation.\n  Another important aspect of the bill deals with regulations. This \nbill requires that taking impact analysis be conducted prior to \npromulgating regulations. If these actions result in a loss of 33 \npercent of value of the property, compensation is required.\n  Montanans believe that protecting private property is of utmost \nimportance. And Congress should pass the Omnibus Property Rights Act \nwhich reinforces the Government's responsibility to protect property \nrights and will help get the Federal Government off the backs of \nMontana's working men and women.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nthe Omnibus Property Rights Act of 1995. I thank Senator Hatch and my \nother colleagues who drafted this bill which seeks to stop Government \nfrom infringing upon its citizens' private property rights.\n  Private property rights are fundamental to a free and fair society. \nLast June, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote on behalf of the majority, \n``We see no reason why the takings clause of the fifth amendment, as \nmuch a part of the Bill of Rights as the first amendment or fourth \namendment, should be relegated to the status of a poor relation.''\n  Over the past several years, we have seen Federal bureaucrats trample \nour fifth amendment right that private property shall not, ``* * * be \ntaken for public use without just compensation.'' There are countless \nexamples of people forced to spend their time and money fighting their \nown Government for the simple right to use their land. Unfortunately, \nthere are even more citizens who never make it to court because they \ncannot afford lawyers to help them fight for their rights. In these \ncases, Government has robbed its citizens of the use of their property, \nwithout even compensating them. It makes you wonder if the American \npeople still control their Government or if our U.S. Government now \ncontrols us.\n  The Omnibus Property Rights Act will restore the basic rights \naccorded to private property owners by our Founding Fathers in the Bill \nof Rights. It will slash through the bureaucracy that has rendered \nthose rights meaningless, and it will preserve for future generations \nthe essential freedoms and rights upon which America was founded.\n\n[[Page S4505]]\n\n      By Mr. BRADLEY (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 606. A bill to make improvements in pipeline safety, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n              THE PIPELINE SAFETY ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that will \nsave lives and property: the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Act. I am very \npleased to announce that my colleague, Senator Lautenberg, is joining \nwe as a cosponsor of this bill.\n  Exactly 1 year ago today, at 11:55 p.m., a fireball lit up the sky in \nEdison, NJ. This eery light was visible for miles around. At ground \nzero, a plume of fire and smoke rose hundreds of feet in the air. \nWithin minutes, nearby apartment buildings caught fire. Within hours, \nthese buildings were utterly gone. Hundreds of people were rendered \nhomeless, their possessions completely destroyed.\n  The physical casualties were miraculously low. Yet, damage was done. \nThe nightmares persist. The memory and the fear remain.\n  The community is rebuilding. The victims are healing and moving on. \nBut, issues raised by the blast remain unresolved.\n  Edison spurred a national debate on how we manage pipeline safety. My \ncomprehensive one-call legislation--introduced in the House by \nCongressman Pallone--came within a hairsbreadth of becoming law last \nCongress. The signals are positive for this year: it's a truly \nbipartisan issue--Senators Specter and Lott have joined Senators \nLautenberg and Exon and myself as cosponsors--pushed by a powerful \nprivate sector coalition.\n  Since the Edison accident and the introduction of legislation, the \nvalue of these one-call notification programs have been recognized by \nthe State of New Jersey, which now has a first-class program, the \nNational Transportation Safety Board and the U.S. Department of \nTransportation. In fact, the need for a better program is a central \nfeature of the pipeline safety reauthorization bill being proposed by \nthe Secretary of Transportation and the Administration.\n  There's more to the story, however. On February 7, 1995, the NTSB \nissued safety recommendations stemming from the Edison disaster. These \nrecommendations should be taken very seriously. Edison was a wake-up \ncall, where only by a miracle literally hundreds of people escaped \nserious injury. They certainly weren't saved by our public policies.\n  My legislation will codify the NTSB recommendations into law. My bill \nwill call for stronger materials in our pipelines, better pipeline \nidentification procedures, improved leak detection, more effective \nsafety inspection requirements and new analysis of siting risks. Every \none of these is included specifically in the NTSB report.\n  Mr. President, this is needed. This is also the least we can do. I \nurge my colleagues to consider this legislation carefully and pass it \nwithout delay.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a brief description of \nthe bill and the bill text be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 606\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This independent safety \n     board made specific safety recommendations to the federal \n     government on February 7, 1995. At that time, the NTSB \n     released a report on the natural gas pipeline disaster that \n     occurred at Edison, NJ, on March 23, 1994.\n       The Pipeline Safety Enhancement Act will include the \n     following five requirements which are identified specifically \n     in the Edison safety report:\n       (1) that the Secretary of Transportation develop minimum \n     standards for the strength of new pipe installed for natural \n     gas and hazardous liquid pipelines; the Secretary is to give \n     special consideration to the use of pipe in high-density \n     population areas (such as Edison, NJ);\n       [[Page S4506]] (2) that there be established minimum \n     standards for the permanent marking of pipelines in high-\n     density areas;\n       (3) that minimum safety standards for pipeline operators \n     include a protocol for periodic inspection and appropriate \n     tests for pipeline damage;\n       (4) that there be an assessment and improvement of public \n     education programs concerning pipeline leak detection;\n       (5) that ongoing studies on the safety risks associated \n     with pipeline siting be expedited and that the analysis also \n     include the effect of building standards on risk.\n       This legislation would be complementary to legislation \n     already introduced by Senator Bradley on comprehensive ``one-\n     call'' notification and other pipeline safety issues.\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I express my strong support for \nthe Pipeline Safety Enhancement Act of 1995. This legislation, which \nSenator Bradley and I are introducing today, is based upon \nrecommendations made by the National Transportation Safety Board as a \nresult of its investigation into the Edison pipeline exposition.\n  It was 1 year ago today that residents of the Durham Woods Apartments \nin Edison, NJ, ran for their lives to escape a ball of fire that lit up \nthe night sky. The heat of the fire was so intense that it burned the \nclothes off people's backs and singed their bare feet as they escaped \nover the hot pavement.\n  On this painful anniversary, people in New Jersey are reflecting on \nthe horror of a year ago. All too often, disasters get just 15 minutes \nin the news and are forgotten. But for New Jersey, the Edison explosion \nlives on. We are not prepared to rest until we can guarantee that this \ntragedy will not be repeated.\n  Mr. President, today Senator Bradley and I are introducing \nlegislation to significantly increase pipeline safety. This is the \nthird bill that we have introduced in the last year to protect the \nthousands of Americans who live, work, or go to school in the vicinity \nof a pipeline.\n  The Pipeline Safety Enhancement Act would:\n  Direct the Department of Transportation to develop toughness \nstandards for new pipes installed in gas and hazardous liquid \npipelines, particularly in urban areas;\n  Establish standards for permanent markings that identify the location \nof high-pressure natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines in urban, \nindustrial and commercial areas;\n  Establish minimum safety standards for pipeline operators, including \na protocol for periodic inspection and appropriate tests for pipeline \ndamage;\n  Assess and improve public education programs concerning pipeline leak \ndetection; and\n  Require that ongoing studies on the safety risks associated with \npipeline siting be expedited and that the analysis also include the \neffect of building standards on risk.\n  Over the last year, we have taken positive steps to increase pipeline \nsafety. However, I will not rest in my efforts to improve pipeline \nsafety until I can personally vouch for the safety of every American \nwho lives or works near a pipeline, and until we can promise the \nchildren of Edison that there will never again be an explosion like the \none they endured at Durham Woods.\n  Since last March, I have seen and heard the devastation that followed \nthis explosion. I have met with families who lost everything but the \nclothes on their back. I have heard from children who continue to wake \nup sweating in the middle of the night--still on the run a year later \nfrom that fiery ball of smoke.\n  I have learned about residents who lost their lives' work, like the \nscientist who was struggling to support his wife, his mother and two \nsmall children--and then saw his dissertation, his dream of a better \nlife for his family, disappear in the tangled plastic of a melted \ncomputer.\n  For New Jersey, the Edison pipeline explosion was an unparalleled \ntragedy. But the truth is that this was no isolated event. There were \npipeline problems in other places before March 23. And there have been \npipeline problems since. I want to put these events deep into the \nrecesses of history.\n  Senator Bradley and I believe that the Pipeline Safety Enhancement \nAct would do just that. If this bill and other bills Senator Bradley \nand I have introduced on this subject had been the law before March 23, \n1994, life at Durham Woods would not have taken such a tragic turn.\n  Mr. President, today, we all should reflect on the 1-year anniversary \nof the Edison explosion. I pray for the victims who still suffer from \nthe fallout of this disaster. I hope that Congress has learned an \nimportant lesson. And I pledge to continue to fight for improvements in \npipeline safety so no other community will ever be doomed to undergo \nthe trauma of a pipeline explosion.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 607. A bill to amend the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 to clarify the liability of \ncertain recycling transactions, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n               the superfund recycling equity act of 1995\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am introducing today, along with my \ndistinguished colleague from Nevada, Senator Reid, the Superfund \nRecycling Equity Act of 1995.\n  This bill will allow the private sector to respond more freely to \nincreased demands for recycling by removing many of the unintended \nimpediments that Superfund has placed on recycling activities.\n  As a member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, I have \ncome to learn from the many expert witnesses who have testified before \nthe committee that Superfund has the unintentional consequence of \npenalizing those who prepare materials for recycling. Federal courts \nhave ruled that Superfund imposes ``generator'' liability on persons \nwho sell secondary materials that are diverted from the waste stream \nfor recycling. These rulings come from an overly broad interpretation \nof the law's provision which imposes liability on those who arrange for \ndisposal of waste. Unfortunately, these courts have presumed that any \ntransaction of material which is no longer useful in its current form \nis a waste treatment or disposal transaction. This legislation \nclarifies that legitimate recycling transactions are not, and were not \nintended to be, subject to Superfund's liability scheme.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will place traditional \nrecyclable, or secondary, materials which are used as feedstocks in the \nmanufacturing process on closer to equal footing with virgin, or \nprimary materials counterparts. Traditional recyclables are paper, \nglass, plastic, metals, textiles, and rubber.\n  The sale of virgin material feedstocks--sold for the same or similar \npurpose as the recyclable feedstocks--is not considered to be an \narrangement for treatment or disposal of hazardous substance. The sale \nof recyclables should be treated the same. If recyclables are not \nsimilarly treated, and those who prepare recyclables for the market \nface greater liability exposure than their competitors who sell virgin \nmaterials, a market disadvantage is created to recycling.\n  The inequity in current law is impeding recyclers' ability to provide \nthe kind of environmentally beneficial recycling activities our society \ndemands. The existing liability scheme exposes recyclers to financial \nrisks that their competitors, virgin material suppliers, do not face. \nThis restricts financing for expansion and makes it more difficult to \nrespond to changing market conditions. In addition, many materials \nwhich can be properly recycled are now not being captured for reuse \nbecause of Superfund liability exposure.\n  Mr. President, I have been supportive of stimulating the\n   private sector marketplace for recycled materials--and certainly \nbelieve that Federal legislation should not stall recycling efforts. \nAmericans recognize that increased recycling means more efficient use \nof natural resources, which extends the life of those resources. \nBecause recycling utilizes significantly less energy than the use of \nvirgin materials, recycling is a key step toward energy efficiency. The \nuse of recyclables is also important to achieving the goals of \npollution prevention and waste minimization.\n\n  Let me now address what this bill provides. The Superfund Recycling \nEquity Act recognizes that the Congress did not intend to apply \nSuperfund liability to those who collect and process recyclables for \nsale as raw material feedstocks. The bill removes from liability those \nwho collect, process and \n[[Page S4507]] sell secondary paper, glass, plastic, metal, textiles, \nand rubber recyclables.\n  It should also be pointed out that this bill clarifies the \napplication of liability regarding the sale of the recycler's products. \nThe bill does not alter liability for contamination that is created by \na recycler or owner, or operator liability for a facility. CERCLA's \nexisting liability scheme remains in effect where a recycler is an \nowner/operator who contaminates a facility, or sends process waste for \ntreatment or disposal which contributes to contamination. Furthermore, \nfor the purposes of this bill, a series of tests or criteria are \nestablished to help determine if a bonafide recycling transaction has \noccurred.\n  During the Superfund legislation process in the previous Congress, I \nworked with a number of my colleagues to develop a recycling provision \nthat addressed the problems discussed, while providing strong \nenvironmental protection.\n  As a number of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, I will \ncontinue to work with my colleagues as we work on reforming the \nSuperfund program. I am introducing this legislation today to make \nclear my intention of clarifying the existing statute by placing \nsupplies of recyclables on more equal footing with suppliers of virgin \nmaterial.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 607\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Superfund Recycling Equity \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to promote the reuse and recycling of scrap material, \n     in furtherance of the goals of waste minimization and natural \n     resource conservation, while protecting human health and the \n     environment;\n       (2) to level the playing field between the use of virgin \n     materials and recycled materials; and\n       (3) to remove the disincentives and impediments to \n     recycling created by potential liability under the \n     Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and \n     Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish the New Bedford Whaling National \nHistorical Park in New Bedford, MA, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n           the new bedford whaling national park act of 1995\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today Senator Kerry and I are introducing \na bill to establish a Whaling National Historical Park in New Bedford, \nMA. This legislation is part of a bipartisan effort with Congressmen \nBarney Frank and Peter Blute, who are introducing an identical bill \ntoday in the House of Representatives.\n  Our bill is similar to legislation introduced in 1994. However, we \nhave made several changes to minimize the cost of this new park and \nenhance its public/private partnership components, in recognition of \nthe current budget pressures on the National Park System. The original \nbill's funding level of $10.4 million for development and an estimated \n$6 million for operations in the first 5 years was based on the \nrecommendations of a comprehensive study conducted by the Park Service. \nOur new legislation aims to achieve many of the same goals set forth in \nthat study, but to do so at the lower cost of $2 million for \ndevelopment and an estimated $2 million for operations in the first 5 \nyears.\n  The Park Service began its special resource study of New Bedford in \n1990. The study, completed in November 1993, strongly endorsed the \nestablishment of a national park unit in New Bedford. The Park Service \nnoted the important role of the whaling industry in 19th-century \nAmerican history. The study concluded that this theme is not currently \nrepresented in the National Park System, and New Bedford would be the \nideal site for a park commemorating that history. As the former whaling \ncapital of the world, New Bedford provided the oil that fueled the \nNation's lamps and kept the wheels of the Industrial Revolution \nturning. So prosperous was the whaling industry there that, by the mid-\n19th century, New Bedford had become the wealthiest city, per capita, \nin the world.\n  New Bedford's whaling history raises many significant social and \neconomic themes that are essential to a true understanding of our \nAmerican heritage. Among these are the spirit of technological \nprogress, the courage that motivated daring men and women to risk their \nlives on the seas, and the many cultures that took root here, brought \nby immigrants drawn from every corner of the globe. It was this \ndiversity which contributed to New Bedford's position as a center of \nthe abolitionist movement in the 19th century and made it a key stop \nfor fugitive slaves on the underground railroad. Frederick Douglas \nspent his first 3 years of freedom in New Bedford, working as a caulker \non the hulls of whaleboats.\n  New Bedford is also the port from which Herman Melville set sail \naboard the whaler Acushnet in 1841. The voyage inspired ``Moby Dick,'' \none of the greatest of all American novels. The streets that Melville \nand Ishmael wandered can still be seen in New Bedford today, as can the \nfamous Seamen's Bethel, where the whalers attended religious services \nbefore setting off on their voyages.\n  Much of New Bedford's old whaling waterfront still exists in the \ncity's National Historic Landmark District, and that 20-acre site has \nbecome a model for historic preservation. Businesses, residents, and \ntourists coexist in an environment of restored buildings, cobblestone \nstreets, and brick sidewalks from the whaling era.\n  New Bedford also is the site of the Rotch-Jones-Duff House and Garden \nMuseum, one of the finest examples of Greek Revival residential \narchitecture in the country and the only surviving whaling era mansion \nopen to the public complete with its original gardens and grounds.\n  New Bedford's historical and cultural assets are not limited to its \nstreets and buildings. They also include outstanding collections of \nartworks and archives associated with the whaling era and located at \nthe city's public library and the renowned whaling museum. The Museum \nhouses a half-size model of the whaling bark Lagoda that can be boarded \nby visitors.\n  The city is also home port to the restored, 100-year-old National \nHistoric Landmark vessel Ernestina, the oldest Grand Banks schooner in \nexistence. The Ernestina has had a distinguished maritime career as a \nfishing vessel, as an Arctic exploration vessel under Capt. Bob \nBartlett, and as a packet plying the route between the Cape Verde \nIslands and the United States. In her packet role, she was the last \ngreat sailing ship to bring immigrants to our shores.\n  National park designation will be a valuable economic stimulus for \ntourism and associated development for the city. While the proposed \nFederal funding level is modest, establishment of this national park \nwill spur extensive private sector preservation efforts.\n  The whaling park in New Bedford will help protect a nationally \nsignificant historic treasure and stimulate the economy of a city in \nneed. It is an investment in America's past and in a city's future. I \nurge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased once again to join my good \nfriend and colleague senator Kennedy in introducing legislation to \nestablish a whaling national historical park in New Bedford, MA. Our \ninitiative is based upon a special resource study completed by the \nNational Park Service in 1993 which found that the New Bedford area \nmeets the criteria for inclusion in the National Park System. However, \nthis legislation, while similar to a bill we introduced last Congress, \nis a much scaled-back version. Trying to balance the need for fiscal \nrestraint with the importance of protecting our National heritage, our \nnew bill calls for less than one-fifth of the Federal funding of our \noriginal initiative and would require significant matching \ncontributions from other interested parties.\n  The city of New Bedford, tucked by the sea in the southeast corner of \nMassachusetts, has a rich and diverse history. For decades it was the \ncenter of our Nation's whaling industry. And although the whaling \nindustry collapsed by the turn of the last century, New \n[[Page S4509]] Bedford is to this day remembered for its seafaring \nheritage.\n  As a national park, the New Bedford National Historic Landmark \nDistrict and surrounding area would enhance the National Park System by \nexpanding its maritime history theme to include a focus on our Nation's \nwhaling past. Particularly noteworthy are the historic town center, the \nwaterfront with the National Historic Landmark Schooner Ernestina, and \nan array of over three dozen historically rehabilitated buildings which \ncombine to provide a cultural resource that reflects the era of \nwhaling.\n  Since 1962, a public/private partnership--initiated by the waterfront \nhistoric area league of New Bedford in cooperation with the Bedford \nLanding Taxpayers Association, the Old Dartmouth Historical Society, \nprivate property owners and the city of New Bedford, has already raised \n$6.4 million, rehabilitated 37 buildings and created over 40 new \nbusinesses and 200 new jobs. That is just the kind of local \nentrepreneurship that we should be supporting. Creating a New Bedford \nWhaling Park will preserve an important piece of seafarer heritage \nwhile simultaneously permitting the public/private partnership to \nexpand and grow.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will look favorably upon this new, \nstreamlined initiative and I would encourage my colleagues to support \nthis important, historically significant addition to our National Park \nSystem.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 609. A bill to assure fairness and choice to patients and health \ncare providers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n            the health care quality and fairness act of 1995\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, despite the flurry of efforts in \nthe 103d Congress, many of us were deeply disappointed that healthcare \nreform legislation failed to be enacted. The American people, however, \nstill are concerned about this issue, and feel that reform of our \nhealthcare system should be a high priority for this Congress, although \nmost feel that small steps, rather than giant leaps are now best. While \nwe debate these issues in Congress, however, the number of uninsured \ncontinues to grow, particularly children, and health care costs, \nalthough moderating, may only be doing so transiently.\n  The private sector has not waited for Congress to act, and has been \nrapidly transforming the healthcare delivery system for those Americans \nwho are fortunate enough to have access to, and the ability to pay for \ncoverage. The proliferation of managed care systems has been \nextraordinary, although their ability to control healthcare costs in \nthe long run, particularly as older, sicker patients join, remains to \nbe proven. Health plan standards were included in many of the \ncompromise bills that emerged during the 103d Congress. There was wide, \nbipartisan agreement that there should be Federal standards to level \nthe playing field in the rapidly changing healthcare delivery \nenvironment. Such standards would assure fairness for consumers and \nproviders, while still encouraging health plans to pursue innovative \napproaches to providing high-quality, cost effective care.\n  The Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources recently conducted \na 2-day hearing on healthcare reform. We heard witnesses who eloquently \ndescribed the successes of our Nation's largest employers in \nnegotiating with providers and health plans, and holding down the \ngrowth of health costs. These large businesses have developed demanding \npurchasing and performance standards that they use to select plans and \ndevelop provider networks. Unfortunately, however, small employers and \nindividual purchasers often lack the expertise and resources necessary \nto navigate through the health plan maze. In order to ensure that \nhealth care of the highest quality is available to all consumers, it is \nessential that all health plans be required to meet minimum standards.\n  Discussions of these safeguards got lost in the tussle over larger \nand more contentious issues during the healthcare reform debate last \nyear. I believe now more than ever, especially with talk of \nrestructuring Medicare and Medicaid being framed along the lines of \nrestraining the growth of costs while maintaining choice and quality, \nthat provisions to ensure that consumers are adequately protected and \ninformed are absolutely imperative.\n  With these thoughts in mind, today I am introducing the Health Care \nQuality and Fairness Act of 1995, which is designed to assure fairness \nand choice to patients and health care providers. Its scope would \ninclude all health plans including those that are self-funded, not just \nHMO's or managed care plans. Its major provisions include:\n  Protection of consumer choice by requiring an employer to\n   offer a choice of at least three types of health plan--managed care, \npoint-of-service, and traditional insurance. Currently, only about half \nof all Americans who get their health insurance through employers are \noffered more than one plan. Evidence suggests that employers are \nincreasingly limiting their employees' choice of health plans, while \nthis bill would assure adequate choice is provided;\n\n  Establishment of an Office of Consumer Information Counseling and \nAssistance to perform public outreach and provide education and \nassistance regarding consumer rights with regard to health insurance. \nThis effort would build on an existing Medigap model that has been \nhighly successful in a number of States;\n  Development of health plan standards, including utilization review \nactivities, credentialing of health professionals, and handling of \ngrievances by providers or consumers. These standards would ensure \nfairness in the interactions between health plans, consumers, and \nproviders;\n  Requirements for health plan solvency standards to be developed to \nprotect employees and individual purchasers from being left high and \ndry;\n  Provision of information on plan coverage, benefits, loss ratio, \nsatisfaction statistics, and quality indicators to assist consumers in \nmaking wise purchasing decisions; and\n  Insurance market reforms including guaranteed issue and renewability, \nprohibitions on preexisting condition exclusions, and risk adjustment. \nInsurance reform, if carefully crafted, would stabilize premiums for \nsmall employers and individual purchasers and prevent plans from \nexcluding those who most need coverage.\n  This legislation has broad support among provider groups, including \nthe American Medical Association and the Advocates for Practitioner \nEquity Coalition which includes nonphysician provider groups like the \nAmerican Optometric Association, the American Podiatric Medical \nAssociation, the American Occupational Therapy Association, and \nconsumer groups, including Consumers Union and Citizen Action. Together \nthese groups hope to form a partnership to work with health plans to \nassure that fair, high-quality care is delivered, utilizing the \nstandards enacted in the Health Care Quality and Fairness Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 609\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Any economic profiling of \n     health professionals must be adjusted to recognize case mix, \n     severity of illness, and the age of patients of a health \n     professional's practice that may account for higher or lower \n     than expected costs, to the extent appropriate data in this \n     regard is available to the health plan.\n       (4) Termination, reduction or withdrawal.--\n       (A) Procedures.--A health plan shall develop and implement \n     procedures for the reporting, to appropriate authorities, of \n     serious quality deficiencies that result in the suspension or \n     termination of a contract with a health professional.\n       (B) Review.--A health plan shall develop and implement \n     policies and procedures under which the plan reviews the \n     contract privileges of health professionals who--\n       (i) have seriously violated policies and procedures of the \n     health plan;\n       (ii) have lost their privilege to practice with a \n     contracting institutional provider; or\n       (iii) otherwise pose a threat to the quality of service and \n     care provided to the enrollees of the health plan.\n\n     At a minimum, the policies and procedures implemented under \n     this subparagraph shall meet the requirements of the Health \n     Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986.\n       (C) Due process.--The policies and procedures implemented \n     under subparagraph (B) shall include requirements for the \n     timely notification of the affected health professional of \n     the reasons for the reduction, withdrawal, or termination of \n     privileges, and provide the health professional with the \n     right to appeal the determination of reduction, withdrawal, \n     or termination.\n       (D) Availability.--A written copy of the policies and \n     procedures implemented under this paragraph shall be made \n     available to a health professional on request prior to the \n     time at which the health professional contracts to provide \n     services under the plan.\n\n     SEC. 407. CONFIDENTIALITY STANDARDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A health plan shall ensure that the \n     confidentiality of specified enrollee patient information and \n     records is protected.\n       (b) Policies and Procedures.--A health plan shall have \n     written confidentiality policies and procedures.

DISCRIMINATION.\n\n       (a) Enrollees.--A health plan (network or non-network) may \n     not discriminate or engage (directly or through contractual \n     arrangements) in any activity, including the selection of \n     service area, that has the effect of discriminating against \n     an individual on the basis of race, national origin, gender, \n     language, socio-economic status, age, disability, health \n     status, or anticipated need for health services.\n       (b) Providers.--A health plan may not discriminate in the \n     selection of members of the health professional or provider \n     network (and in establishing the terms and conditions for \n     membership in the network) of the plan based on--\n       (1) the race, national origin, or disability of the health \n     professional;\n       (2) the socio-economic status, disability, health status, \n     or anticipated need for health services of the patients of \n     the health professional or provider; or\n       (3) the health professional or provider's lack of \n     affiliation with, or admitting privileges at, a hospital.\n       (c) License or Certification.--A health plan may not \n     discriminate in participation, reimbursement, or \n     indemnification against a health professional who is acting \n     within the scope of the license or certification of the \n     professional under applicable State law solely on the basis \n     of the license or certification of the health professional. A \n     health plan may not discriminate in participation, \n     reimbursement, or indemnification against a health provider \n     that is providing services within the scope of services that \n     it is authorized to perform under State law.\n\n     SEC. 409. PROHIBITION ON SELECTIVE MARKETING.\n\n       A health plan may not engage in marketing or other \n     practices intended to discourage or limit the issuance of \n     health plans to individuals on the basis of health condition, \n     geographic area, industry, or other risk factors.\n                TITLE V--HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET REFORM\n\n     SEC. 501.

Such a \n     risk adjustment program shall--\n       (1) with respect to a plan offered within the small group \n     market; or\n       (2) with respect to a plan offered within the individual \n     market,\n\n     provide for adjustments based on risk within the market in \n     which the plan is marketed.\n       (b) Process.--A program developed under subsection (a) \n     shall include a process designed to share the risk associated \n     with, or to equalize, high cost claims, claims of high cost \n     individuals, costs of variations among carriers based on \n     demographic factors associated with the individuals insured \n     which correlate with such cost variations, to protect health \n     plans from the disproportionate adverse risks of offering \n     coverage to all applicants. Risk adjustment mechanisms under \n     the program shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be \n     prospective to minimize the uncertainty associated with the \n     setting of premiums by health plans to maintain consumer \n     choice from among multiple health plans based on rates that \n     reflect the relative medical and administrative efficiencies \n     of health plans.\n\n     SEC. 505.

Such State \n     consumer protection laws which are not preempted under this \n     title include--\n       (1) laws that limit the exclusions for preexisting medical \n     conditions to periods that are less than those provided for \n     in section 502;\n       (2) laws that limit variations in premium rates beyond the \n     variations permitted under section 503; and\n     [[Page S4515]]   (3) laws that would expand the small group \n     market.\n       (b) State Reform Measures.--Nothing in this title shall be \n     construed as prohibiting a State from enacting health care \n     reform measures that exceed the measures established under \n     this title, including reforms that expand access to health \n     care services, control health care costs, and enhance the \n     quality of care.\n\n     SEC. 508. ASSOCIATION PLANS.\n\n       With respect to health plans offered to small employers and \n     individuals through associations or other intermediaries, \n     such plans shall meet the requirements of this title.\n                   TITLE VI--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 601.

A bill to provide for an interpretive center at the Civil War \nBattlefield of Corinth, Mississippi, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  corinth mississippi battlefield act\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nrelevant to historic preservation. This legislation proposes to \nestablish an interpretive center at the Siege and Battle of Corinth \nsites in Corinth, MS. The battlefield of Corinth is a significant part \nof our Nation's history. Corinth was the scene of a monumental battle \nduring the War between the States.\n  I would like my colleagues to know, that on two occasions during the \n103d Congress, legislation for this proposed interpretive center was \nfavorably reported out of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee. In addition, legislation for this proposed interpretive \ncenter was passed twice in the 103d Congress, by the full Senate. This \nlegislation needs to come to closure. It needs to be passed by both \nChambers of Congress and signed into law. It is long overdue.\n  The Siege and Battle of Corinth sites are the only sites in my home \nState of Mississippi, which have been included on a Department of the \nInterior's American Battlefield Protection Program. Also, the sites are \ntwo of only twenty-five nationwide placed on a list of Priority Civil \nWar Battlefields for preservation by former Secretary of the Interior, \nManuel Lujan.\n  The Battle of Corinth, the largest to take place in Mississippi, and \nthe Siege of Corinth, both rank, in terms of aggregate numbers of \ntroops involved, among the largest in the history of the Western \nHemisphere.\n  Of all the major Civil War crusades, the Battle of Corinth and the \nCorinth Siege are indisputably the least known and definitely the least \nrecognized. The site area has already received National Historic \nLandmark designation. It is time to go one step further to ensure that \nthis important chapter of American history is preserved.\n  It is most appropriate that we safeguard our national heritage and \nprotect this significant battlefield upon which our ancestors lost life \nand limb in pursuit of their most fundamental ideals. I encourage my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting the passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 610\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                SENATE RESOLUTION 91--RELATIVE TO TURKEY\n\n  Mr. PELL (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Feingold, and Ms. Snowe) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S. Res. 91\n\n       Whereas as a signatory to the Charter of the United \n     Nations, the Government of Turkey is obligated to maintain \n     international peace and security,to develop friendly \n     relations among states based on respect for the principle of \n     equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to \n     achieve international cooperation through the promotion and \n     encouragement of respect for human rights and fundamental \n     freedoms for all;\n       Whereas the Government of Turkey, as a party to the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the \n     International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural \n     Rights, has made additional and firm commitments to observe \n     and uphold the rights of all peoples;\n       Whereas as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization, the Government of Turkey undertook to refrain \n     in international relations from the threat or use of force in \n     any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United \n     Nations;\n       Whereas as a member of the Organization of for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe, Turkey is obliged to respect the\n      territorial integrity of other states, and to support the \n     human rights, fundamental freedoms and the self-\n     determination of peoples;\n       Whereas on March 21, 1995, more than 35,000 Turkish \n     military troops, with tanks, armored personnel carriers, and \n     air support, began an invasion of Northern Iraq;\n       Whereas the Government of Turkey declares that the invasion \n     is in response to acts of terrorism by the Kurdistan Workers \n     Party, also known as the PKK, and constitutes the hot pursuit \n     of terrorists;\n       Whereas reports indicate that the Turkish army has \n     penetrated 25 miles into Iraq along a 150 mile front, and \n     that hundreds of ethnic Kurds have been killed thus far;\n       Whereas independent international observers claim that some \n     of those killed are innocent civilians, and accuse Turkey of \n     torturing prisoners, and of forcibly evacuating and \n     destroying villages;\n       Whereas U.S. government officials have suggested that \n     Turkey's invasion could last more than 3 weeks in duration;\n       Whereas in scope, scale and duration, Turkey's invasion of \n     Iraqi Kurdistan appears to be an illegal act of aggression \n     and inconsistent with Turkey's obligations under the U.N. \n     Charter;\n       Whereas Turkey's actions jeopardize U.S. and international \n     efforts under Operation Provide Comfort in Northern Iraq, and \n     threaten the provision of vital humanitarian assistance by \n     nongovernmental organizations to the Kurds;\n       Whereas the U.S. Department of State reports that the \n     general human rights situation in Turkey ``worsened \n     significantly'' in 1994, and that in many human rights case, \n     the specific ``targets of abuse were ethnic Kurds or their \n     supporters;''\n       Whereas according to the U.S. Government, specific \n     violations of human rights by the Government of Turkey in its \n     campaign against the PKK include the illegal use of torture, \n     excessive force, and political and extrajudicial killings of \n     non-combatants;\n       Now, therefore be it resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) Condemns Turkey's invasion of Northern Iraq as an \n     illegal act of aggression and a violation of international \n     law, inconsistent with Turkey's obligations under the Charter \n     of the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty, and other \n     international agreements;\n       (2) Calls upon the President of the United States to \n     express strong U.S. opposition to Turkey's invasion of \n     Northern Iraq;\n       (3) Urges the United States at the United Nations Security \n     Council to condemn Turkey's illegal act of aggression and \n     bring about an immediate and unconditional withdrawal;\n       (4) Denounces Turkey's consistent pattern of human rights \n     violations against ethnic Kurds;\n       (5) Condemns all acts of terror, including those by PKK \n     forces against Turkish civilian, military and other targets;\n       (6) Supports the maintenance of Operation Provide Comfort \n     and the continuation of other non-governmental humanitarian \n     assistance for the Kurds of Northern Iraq.\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, five years ago, when Iraqi forces crossed \nthe border and invaded Kuwait, the international community--with the \nUnited States at the forefront--condemned the aggression and vowed that \nit would not stand. This week, more than 35,000 Turkish forces invaded \nIraqi Kurdistan under the assertion of being engaged in hot pursuit of \nKurdish terrorists. The truth is that Turkey's action is no less a \nviolation of international law than Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.\n  The official United States position is that Turkey faces a legitimate \nthreat from the Kurdish Workers Party--also \n[[Page S4517]] known as the PKK--a Kurdish separatist group based in \nTurkey that advocates the establishment of an independent Kurdish \nstate.\n  The PKK is a terrorist organization, and Turkey has a right to defend \nits citizens against the unlawful use of terror. Where I draw the line, \nhowever, is Turkey's use of terrorism as a pretense for its full-scale \ninvasion of Iraqi Kurdistan and as justification for its consistent \npattern of human rights violations against innocent Kurdish civilians \nin southeast Turkey.\n  There is no way that the Turkish forces can distinguish between the \nTurkish Kurds and Iraqi Kurds that presently reside in Northern Iraq. \nNor can they reasonably determine which Turkish Kurd is an armed \nterrorist, and which is an innocent civilian refuges. The result is \nthat innocent Kurds--be they Iraqi or Kurdish--are being harassed, \nterrorized, and killed by Turkish forces.\n  I think that there is a fundamental truth that Turkey attempts to \nobscure in its approach to the Kurdish issue. The fact is that Kurdish \nexperiment with self-rule in Northern Iraq threatens and undermines \nTurkey's identity. By conducting this invasion, Turkey has exposed that \nit cares little about Iraq's territorial integrity, and only wants to \nkeep the Kurdish people in check.\n  The United States apparently has given the green light to Prime \nMinister Ciller's military adventure. Moreover, it is nearly certain \nthat the Turkish military is using equipment and supplies of United \nStates origin in its brutal war against the Kurds.\n  Turkey's militaristic policy towards the Kurds goes beyond the pale \nof civilized behavior. It is time for the United States to take a \nprincipled stand, express its opposition to Turkey's invasion of Iraqi \nKurdistan, and cut off supplies of United States military equipment to \nTurkey. If, as reports today suggest, this operation is to extend for \nthe next 3 to 5 weeks, then it is an outright falsehood to say that \nTurkey is engaged in hot pursuit. We should condemn this invasion for \nwhat it truly is--a clear act of aggression and a threat to \ninternational peace.\n  In this regard, I am submitting today with Senators Kerry, Feingold, \nand Snowe a resolution that does just that. In addition to condemning \nthe invasion, the resolution calls upon the President to oppose \nTurkey's action, and urges the United States to lead an effort at the \nUnited Nations Security Council calling for an immediate and \nunconditional withdrawal. The resolution denounces both Turkey's \nconsistent pattern of human rights violations against the Kurds and the \nviolence perpetrated by terrorists, including the PKK. Finally, the \nresolution calls for the continuation of Operation Provide Comfort, \nwhich is crucial to the protection of civilians in Iraqi Kurdistan.\n  Mr. President, I would urge my colleague to join me in sponsoring \nthis resolution.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/23/senate-section/article/S4516-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n          subcommittee on forests and public lands management\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my \ncontinued support for the nation of Belarus and its citizens on the \nupcoming 77th anniversary of the creation of their great country.\n  On March 25, 1918, in the final months of World War I, the nation of \nBelarus was founded. Shortly after the war ended, the Red Army of the \nSoviet Union seized Belarus, beginning Belarus' long hard battle \nagainst Soviet communism. During World War II 25 percent of Belarus' \npopulation was obliterated while fighting the Axis Powers of Germany \nand Italy. Untold numbers died at the hands of the Soviets as well.\n  For over 70 years the Belarusan people were forced to live under the \niron fist of Communist rule. The Communist-led Soviet Union held no \nregard for the lives of any of its citizens, and the brutal Soviet \ndictators routinely incarcerated or shot anyone not conforming to their \nrule.\n  Then in 1990 the years of enslavement for Belarus came to an end as \nBelarusan freedom fighters issued a declaration of sovereignty, \ndetailing their goal to become a neutral, nonnuclear state. On December \n25, 1991, the United States recognized independent Belarus as a \nsovereign nation, allowing the people of Belarus to hold their heads \nhigh once again.\n  The end of one exhausting journey signifies the beginning of another. \nThe people of Belarus must now fight to maintain their right to liberty \nand territorial sovereignty. Extremists within the current Russian \nregime are once again attempting to control Belarus through unfair \neconomic and military treaties. This attempt to destroy the natural \nrights of the people of Belarus, a people who fought and overcame one \nof the most oppressive regimes in the history of man, must not be \nallowed to occur.\n  Mr. President, I want the Belarusan people, both in Belarus and here \nin the United States of America to know that I stand with them in their \nfight to maintain the right to freedom and self-determination that was \ndenied them for so long.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/23/senate-section/article/S4518-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          SESQUICENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY OF WINSLOW TOWNSHIP, NJ\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \n150th anniversary of the founding of Winslow Township, New Jersey. \nOriginally a sleepy farming community, Winslow has developed into a \nunique hybrid, encompassing both rural and urban elements within its 54 \nsquare miles.\n  With roots firmly planted in New Jersey's farming community, Winslow \nhas played an increasingly important role in the State's agricultural \nindustry throughout the years. It is Winslow Township's renowned \npeaches that help make New Jersey fourth in the Nation in production of \nthis crop. Blessed not only with fertile farmland, the Winslow Township \narea also enjoys a close relationship with two of New Jersey's greatest \nnatural resources, the Pinelands and the Great Egg Harbor River. The \nmagnificent Pine Barrens, a national wilderness preserve, is popular \nwith hikers, nature enthusiasts, and canoeists. The Great Egg Harbor \nRiver is also a favorite with canoeists and fishermen, and is home to \nhundreds of different species of fish, mammals, reptiles, birds, and \namphibians.\n  Coexisting with Winslow's natural riches are urban areas of great \ndiversity. Described by its residents as a ``microcosm of America,'' \nWinslow is ethnically, racially, and socio- economically diverse. The \nsmall town belief that fellow residents are actually friends and family \nhas allowed Winslow's different groups to live harmoniously as their \ncommunity has grown. Different communities and forces have influenced \nthe development of Winslow Township, and the town has profited from \nthem. The rolling farmlands and local winery shape Winslow Township as \nsurely as the new pockets of urban development. Children of New \nJersey's most recent immigrants share classes in Winslow's outstanding \nschool system with the great-great-grandchildren of the Italian farmers \nwho helped found the town.\n  Winslow Township may be a small town, but the lessons it offers us in \ncommunity and modern living are broad in scope. These lessons are \nsimple, for they are all rooted in one common theme and that theme is \nrespect. Respect for the beauty and riches of our environment, from \nwhich we can derive both pleasure in recreation and products with which \nto earn a living; respect for diversity and the lessons we cannot \nafford to ignore about the larger world in which we live; and finally, \nrespect for community--the civil society in which all Americans make \ntheir homes, sustain their marriages, raise their families, hang out \nwith their friends, meet their neighbors, educate their children, and \nworship their God.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Winslow Township once again, on their \nsesquicentennial anniversary.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/23/senate-section/article/S4518-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4518-S4519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO COMMANDER LORENZO ``PETE'' CASALEGNO\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the dedication, \npublic service, and patriotism of Comdr. ``Pete'' Casalegno, U.S. Navy, \nfor 30 years of unselfish service to our Nation in both the U.S. Air \nForce and the U.S. Navy.\n  Commander Casalegno's military service began in 1965 when he enlisted \nin the U.S. Air Force and served as a weather observer and forecaster. \nA veteran of the Vietnam war, he served as a member of the combat \nweather team at Tan Son Nhut, Vietnam, from December 1967 to December \n1968.\n  Upon graduation from the University of San Francisco, Commander \nCasalegno was commissioned and subsequently designated as a naval \nflight officer. After completion of advanced training in the E-2 \nHawkeye aircraft, Commander Casalegno was assigned to Carrier Airborne \nEarly Warning Squadron 114 and completed two overseas deployments \nonboard the U.S.S. Kitty Hawk (CV-63) and the U.S.S. Coral Sea (CV-43). \nDuring this assignment, Commander Casalegno completed arduous \nqualifications as officer of the deck and tactical action officer.\n  After graduating from the United States Postgraduate School in 1981 \nwith a master of science in systems engineering, Commander Casalegno \nwas assigned to the staff of Cruiser\n Destroyer Group Three as assistant air operations and electronic \nwarfare officer. Involved in frequent deployments to both the Western \nPacific and Southwest Asia, Commander Casalengo participated in \nmilitary operations following the fall of the Shah of Iran, and \nnumerous humanitarian operations.\n\n  In 1985, Commander Casalegno reported to Carrier Airborne Early \nWarning Squadron 116, where he served as operations officer and \nmaintenance officer during deployments to the Western Pacific and \nSouthwest Asia. Commander Casalegno was involved in operations which \nincluded escorting U.S. merchant ships through the Straits of \n[[Page S4519]] Hormuz and retributive strikes on Iranian oil \nfacilities.\n  Following this tour, Commander Casalegno was assigned to the staff of \nCommander Allied Forces Southern Europe in Naples, Italy. As a staff \nofficer, he was involved in numerous North American Treaty Organization \noperations, including support of allied forces during Operations Desert \nShield and Desert Storm.\n  In 1990, Commander Casalegno was assigned as the United States Navy \nExchange Officer to the Royal Navy's Maritime Tactical School in \nPortsmouth, England, where he trained senior allied officials in the \nemployment of naval forces. In 1994, Commander Casalegno returned to \nthe United States to serve at the Navy's Tactical Training Group, \nAtlantic Fleet, as the air defense instructor.\n  Commander Casalegno, his wife Marla, and his sons Cory and Phillip \nare stalwart Americans whom have sacrificed greatly for the past 30 \nyears. Commander Casalegno has honorably and faithfully upheld the \nNation's special trust and confidence conveyed through his military \ncommission. In every way, he has lived up to his oath of office and \nbore true faith and allegiance to our Constitution and the Nation. It \ngives me great pleasure to recognize Commander Casalegno before my \ncolleagues and wish him all of our best in his retirement.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/23/senate-section/article/S4518-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4519-S4520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             REGARDING IRAN\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to briefly discuss \nIran. As we have all read, Iran has placed chemical weapons on disputed \nislands in the Strait of Hormuz. They have also placed at least 6,000 \ntroops on these islands. It is becoming very clear that Iran is not \ncontent with projecting its twisted criminal acts of terrorism through \nthird parties. They are now, like with the case of the placement of \nHawk missiles a few weeks ago, issuing a direct challenge to the West \nin the waterway so vital to the flow of oil: the Persian Gulf.\n  As I have spoken on other occasions regarding Iran, we face a \ndangerous situation there. To compound this, we are forced to admit \nthat Iran's military and terrorist operations are being subsidized by \nthe purchase of Iranian oil by overseas subsidiaries of American oil \ncompanies, with the oil being resold overseas. This practice, stemming \nfrom a loophole in the regulations governing our embargo with Iran, is \nperfectly legal. This, however, does not make it morally right.\n  It is precisely for this reason that I introduced S. 277, the \nComprehensive Iran Sanctions Act of 1995. We need a total United States \ntrade embargo against Iran. We can no longer subsidize vast military \nbuildups and terrorist operations sponsored by Iran against United \nStates interests and United States allies.\n  In this regard, I ask that a statement by Prof. Patrick Clawson of \nthe Institute for National Strategic Studies of the National Defense \nUniversity, be printed in the Record, following the text of my remarks.\n  In this, ``Policy Watch'' statement of the Washington Institute, \nProfessor Clawson details effects of a total trade ban on Iran. I urge \nmy colleagues to read it to help them determine how we might best deal \nwith this burgeoning threat from Iran.\n  The statement follows:\nEstimating the Effects of Comprehensive United States Sanctions on Iran\n\n                          (By Patrick Clawson)\n\n       Secretary of Defense Perry's statements in Bahrain today \n     highlighting the ``potential threat'' of Iran's deployment of \n     ``8,000 military personnel * * * anti-ship missiles, air-\n     defense missiles and chemical weapons'' on disputed Persian \n     Gulf islands will renew debate over imposing comprehensive \n     economic sanctions on Iran. A key element of that debate is \n     the argument that sanctions would have no effect on Tehran \n     but would impose a considerable burden on the United States. \n     This claim is not accurate: unilateral U.S. sanctions would \n     cost Iran money. Lost revenue could affect Iranian actions, \n     and the forgone business would be no great loss to the U.S. \n     economy.\n\n\n                  how sanctions would cost iran money\n\n       Comprehensive U.S. sanctions on Iran would reduce Iran's \n     foreign exchange receipts several ways:\n       Oil Trade. Iran sells about one-fourth of its exported oil \n     to U.S.-owned firms. In the event of sanctions, Iran would \n     have to sell this oil to other oil companies. Iran would have \n     no difficulty finding other buyers for the oil, but the loss \n     of access to U.S. firms will have a price for Iran. U.S. \n     firms are prepared to offer slightly better terms than firms \n     from other countries, which is exactly the reason why Iran \n     has been selling to the U.S. companies. When it can no longer \n     sell to the U.S. firms, Iran will lose that extra margin. The \n     exact size of its margin is unclear, but most probably less \n     than $50 million per year--admittedly small relative to \n     Iran's oil income ($12-15 billion, depending on oil prices).\n       Planned Oil Swaps Involving Iran and Former Soviet States. \n     The U.S.-led consortiums producing oil in Kazakhstan and \n     Azerbaijan are planning to ship oil to Iran across the \n     Caspian Sea. Iran would use that oil in its northern cities, \n     especially Tehran, while increasing the export of Iranian oil \n     from the Gulf. This swap arrangement, which could start in a \n     matter of months, is supposed to be temporary. But nothing \n     lasts as long as a temporary deal. Iran will earn several \n     tens of millions of dollars a year in profits and cost-\n     savings from this arrangement. These swaps have all the \n     earmarkings of being another Conoco case--the U.S. government \n     signals the U.S. oil firms that the deal is permissible, but \n     when the public announcement is made, the political reaction \n     is such that the U.S. government has to feign shocked \n     indignation.\n       Oil Field Renovation and Expansion. Iran's oil fields are \n     old; production will decline unless Iran develops more \n     difficult-to-reach offshore areas and/or uses sophisticated \n     techniques to recover more oil from aging fields. European \n     oil technology is about as good as the United States, but \n     Iran has found that U.S. firms offer good terms for oil \n     equipment, as testified by Iran's desire to use Conoco over \n     the French firm Total for developing the fields off Sirri \n     Island. Now that President Clinton has ordered U.S. firms not \n     to invest, European firms will step in, at somewhat higher \n     cost to Iran.\n       Investor Confidence. Comprehensive U.S. sanctions will add \n     to the impression that Iran is a politically risky place to \n     do business. European investors and bankers are already \n     hesitant about Iran because of its heavy indebtedness, and \n     Iranian businessmen are worried about increasing government \n     restrictions. It is possible that comprehensive U.S. \n     sanctions would trigger a further run on Iranian currency, \n     which has already lost a third of its value in the last three \n     months.\n       In short, sanctions would cost Iran tens of millions, if \n     not a hundred million or more dollars a year in export \n     revenues and in capital invested in the country.\n\n\n           and the effect on the islamic republic's behavior\n\n       Because comprehensive U.S. sanctions could reduce Iran's \n     income by several tens of millions of dollars each year, the \n     pressure on the Iranian budget, already under tight \n     constraints, would be even greater. This could force Iran to \n     decrease its military spending, given the difficulties of \n     making adjustments elsewhere, e.g., on food supports and \n     social welfare projects.\n       Indeed, one of the unsung accomplishments of the current \n     U.S. policy towards Iran is its success in forcing Iran to \n     curtail its ambitious 1989 plan for acquiring a large-scale \n     modern military. Iran planned to buy $10 billion in arms in \n     1989-1993, primarily from the Soviet Union. The arms \n     purchases had to be cut in half when Iran was locked out of \n     world capital markets, thanks to both its own incompetent \n     economic practices and to U.S. pressure not to make \n     politically-motivated loans to Iran. The difference in \n     military potential is highly significant. Today Iran is a \n     threat in certain areas, mostly terrorism and weapons of mass \n     destruction. Had Iran carried out its 1989 plan, its \n     conventional forces would pose an even more urgent and \n     worrisome threat than they currently do.\n       The impact of comprehensive U.S. sanctions should not be \n     oversold, however. While they may reduce Iranian military \n     spending some, there is no prospect that the Islamic Republic \n     would fall because of sanctions. The fate of the Islamic \n     Republic will be decided largely by internal factors, over \n     which the U.S. has little or no influence.\n\n\n                  Iran's shrinking economic relevance\n\n       Some argue that the U.S. should woo Iran because it is the \n     strategic prize in the Persian Gulf region. As far as \n     economics are concerned, this view is outdated: Iran is no \n     longer a country with great economic significance.\n       Iran is not an oil superpower. Iran produces less oil today \n     than it did in 1970. While production has soared in other \n     parts of the world, it has steadily declined in Iran. In \n     1970, Iran produced almost 9 percent of the world's oil; \n     today, it produces only about 5 percent. Moreover, it has to \n     invest several billion dollars a year just to maintain its \n     present output.\n       Iran is not a lucrative market. Iran's imports in 1994 were \n     little more than $12 billion, which was less than it imported \n     in 1977. Iran's imports in 1994 were less than one-half of \n     one percent of world imports, whereas in 1977, its imports \n     were 1.5 percent of the world total. The simple fact is that \n     Iran's economic importance faded along with its oil wealth.\n       No one action itself will bring about the change Washington \n     wishes to see in Iran and in Iranian behavior. But the best \n     chances of success, especially over the long term, come from \n     a firm stance in defense of U.S. principles. The bitter \n     lesson of the last 15 years, learned from experiences like \n     the Iran- \n     [[Page S4520]] Contra affair, is that the United States \n     cannot expect moderation in Iranian foreign policy if it \n     extends a hand of friendship.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/23/senate-section/article/S4519-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4520-S4521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            A TRIBUTE TO LARRY PLOTT AN OUTSTANDING IDAHOAN\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mr. Larry \nPlott, the current director of the Idaho Peace Officers Standards and \nTraining Academy, who has announced that he will be retiring March 31, \n1995, after 37 years of service to the State of Idaho. Larry has had a \ndistinguished career in law enforcement, and I would like to enumerate \na number of his achievements and accomplishments.\n  Though he was born in Kansas, Larry was raised on a farm south of the \ncity of Twin Falls. Although he liked farming, he always had a dream of \nbeing an Idaho State patrolman. Upon graduation from Twin Falls High \nSchool in 1956, he went to San Francisco where he attended the City \nCollege of San Francisco, graduating with a degree in criminology.\n  At this point, he returned to Twin Falls where he was hired to work \nas a dispatcher and jailer with the Twin Falls County Sheriff's Office. \nHe married Marilyn Ruhter from Filer on March 1, 1959, and was promoted \nto roving deputy that same year. It was at this time that he began an \nillustrious career of revolver and automatic handgun shooting. Over the \n25 years that Larry shot competitively, he garnered over 250 trophies \nfor State and regional championships and was awarded the Distinguished \nPistol Shooting Medal for .22 .38 and .45 caliber by the United States \nArmy Reserve, one of only four Idahoans ever to receive this honor. He \nalso has been a member of the FBI's Possible Club since 1972. To \nachieve a Possible, one must shoot a perfect score over a 50-yard \ncourse from various positions using both the left and right hand. Larry \nalso augmented his shooting expertise by learning the art of quick-\ndraw. In the early 1970's he met Officer Dan Combs from the Oklahoma \nHighway Patrol, who was a national quick-draw specialist. Inspired by \nCombs' influence, Larry not only learned and mastered quick-draw \nhimself, but he then incorporated a demonstration of the technique into \nhis firearms safety programs at local schools and other community and \ncivic events.\n  In April 1960, Larry joined the Idaho State Police (ISP) and was \nstationed at the Huetter Port of Entry in Coeur d'Alene. After a year \nthere, he returned to Twin Falls and worked at the Hollister Port of \nEntry until 1962, at which time his dream came true and he was promoted \nto the ISP patrol. Driving the familiar black and white stripped car \n#476, with two whip antennas flipping in the back, Larry became a \nfamiliar site throughout the District #4 Twin Falls area. After three \nyears he was transferred to the Wood River Valley as the ISP resident \npatrolman, where he stayed until 1969.\n  In January 1970, he was offered a position as a training coordinator \nat the newly created Peace Officers Standards and Training (POST) \nAcademy in Pocatello, then under the auspices of the Idaho State \nUniversity. He resigned from the ISP, and moved his family to \nPocatello. After two years as training coordinator he was promoted to \nDirector of POST, a position where he has been responsible for training \nall the law enforcement officers throughout the entire state of Idaho.\n  Since his installment as Director of POST, Larry has supervised and \ninstructed at all of the 105 sessions that have come through the \ntraining academy. Officers in a session attend POST for seven weeks, \nand upon completion of the basic course, are awarded a diploma of \ncertification. These officers come from all the law enforcement \nagencies in the state including the Idaho State Police, the Idaho Fish \n& Game, Idaho Parks & Recreation, port-of-entry officers, prosecuting \nattorneys, and all county and city officers. Idaho law requires that an \nofficer must be certified by POST to remain in law enforcement.\n  As Director of POST, Larry has set new exemplary training standards \nthat other states are now attempting to follow. In 1972, Larry attended \nthe FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, and was impressed by the high \nquality of training given to the agents. There, attention was not only \ngiven to firearms expertise, but to physical fitness and knowledge of \nthe law. Larry has focused on all three of these areas at POST, and has \ndeveloped the Idaho POST Academy into one of the finest police \nacademies in the United States.\n  The programs and changes that have been implemented by Larry since he \ntook over as Director of POST and numerous and impressive. He:\n  Instituted the first mandatory physical fitness requirements for the \nPOST program in the United States.\n  Compiled/assembled the first Abridged Edition of the Idaho Criminal \nCode for Idaho police officers.\n  Developed the first law enforcement career camps for Idaho youth. For \nthis he received the Kiwanis International Award for Service to the \nCommunity and the Citizens of Idaho.\n  Brought the first Executive Command College to Idaho, taught by the \nFBI.\n  Developed requirements for 15 categories of training certification \nand classification for police, deputies, and detention officers. He \nalso developed a classification program for dispatchers and jailers.\n  Created a spouse relationship program for police officers, which was \nthe first of its kind in Idaho and the United States.\n  Originated the Governor's Ten pistol competition.\n  Authored, proposed, and was instrumental in getting a fee assessment \npassed through the Idaho legislature for funding of the POST Academy.\n  Obtained college credit approval for courses taught at POST, allowing \nofficers to earn up to 12 college credits.\n  Developed a public open house at the POST Academy.\n  Designed the following training certificates: Basic, Intermediate, \nAdvanced, Master, Supervisor, Management, Executive, Jailer, Canine, \nReserve, Marine Deputies, and Dispatchers.\n  Not only has Larry strived for a higher level of excellence for all \nthe police officers in Idaho, but has applied those standards to \nhimself, and is one of the best examples of an individual who practices \nwhat he preaches. For example, he not only designed the training \ncertificates awarded by POST, but earned several of them himself, \nincluding the Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, Supervisor, Management, \nand Instructor. The Idaho Department of Law Enforcement recently \nawarded him the Outstanding Administrator Award, one of their highest \nhonors.\n  Larry has written and had numerous articles published in various \nbulletins and magazines including: The FBI Bulletin, The Winning Edge, \nand The IPOA Magazine. He has also written special segments for the \nIdaho Association of Counties and Cities, and for the past 18 years has \npublished the POST Bulletin. He is currently the President of the \nInternational Association of State Law Enforcement Training Directors \n(IASLET) for the northwest Region, and is the Past President of the \nNational Association of State Directors of Law Enforcement Training \n(NASDLET). Larry also served as President of the Idaho Peace Officers \nAssociation (IPOA), and is currently a board member of the Law \nEnforcement Television Network (LETN).\n  Always urging his officers to stay physically fit, Larry began \nrunning in 1975 and has continued to this day. He has competed in \nseveral races since then, and won Gold, Silver and Bronze medals in \nvarying events at both the World Police/Fire Olympic Games in \nVancouver, and the northwest regional Games. He also served as Director \nfor the 1990 Northwest Police/Fire Olympic Games in Boise, and is a \ncurrent board member for the northwest region. In 1983 he ran the Great \nPotato Marathon in Boise. He and his wife Marilyn have already \nannounced their intent to hike the entire Appalachian Trail this year \nwhich extends from Georgia to Maine.\n  Finally, I would like to commend Larry not only for his brilliant \ncareer in law enforcement, but for his outstanding contribution to the \nofficers and individuals who have been blessed by his service. He and \nhis wife Marilyn have raised four beautiful children, Angela, Tony, \nStacey, and Marty, who are now pursuing careers and raising families of \ntheir own.\n  Larry's contribution to Idaho has been great and extensive. However, \nI know that his retirement from the \n[[Page S4521]] POST Academy will be the opening of another door and a \nnew challenge for this very exceptional individual. I am proud to have \nhad the opportunity to honor him here today.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/23/senate-section/article/S4520-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 831\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise to make a very brief statement and \nask for a speech to be printed in the Record. I attended the National \nVeterans of Foreign Wars Convention and heard a speech delivered by one \nof our colleagues that I think is one of the finest speeches I have \never heard any of our colleagues deliver, although it was not on the \nSenate floor. It was delivered before several thousand veterans of \nforeign wars.\n  It was delivered by our colleague, John McCain, from the State of \nArizona, in response to being the recipient of Legislator of the Year, \npicked by the veterans, the VFW.\n  I strongly commend it to my colleagues, because it is the most \narticulate statement I have ever heard, and I believe one of the most \narticulate they will ever read, about what it means to serve one's \ncountry.\n  I will say now what I said to John McCain after he delivered that \nspeech, after listening to him: That is the John McCain that I knew 20 \nyears ago. I am glad to see it is still the same John McCain.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the address by our colleague, Senator \nJohn McCain, at the National Veterans of Foreign Wars Convention, March \n7, 1995, be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Address by Senator John McCain, Before the Veterans of Foreign Wars, \n                             March 7, 1995\n\n       Thank you. I fear I cannot adequately express my deep \n     gratitude for the great honor you have done me by giving me \n     this award. As often as we are the targets of public abuse, \n     politicians also often find we are the recipients of \n     undeserved acclaim. After a while, one learns to keep both \n     scorn and praise in perspective. They come with the job.\n       Tonight is different. I am deeply moved to be recognized \n     for some small service by you who have distinguished \n     yourselves by your service to our country in war. For most of \n     us, it has been many years since we wore the uniform. But it \n     is still the opinion of those who wore the uniform that \n     matters most to us. I want to thank you very much for \n     choosing me to receive the VFW's Congressional Award. It is \n     an honor I will long cherish.\n       I will also long remember the honor the people of Arizona \n     have bestowed upon me by trusting me to represent their \n     interests in Congress. I believe they would understand, \n     however, when I say that I once knew a greater honor. It is \n     an honor I share with all of you, an honor we learned about \n     in America, but experienced in someone else's country. It is \n     the great honor of knowing your duty and ransoming your life \n     to its accomplishment.\n       I was blessed to have been born into a family who made \n     their living at sea in defense of their country's cause. My \n     grandfather was a naval aviator; my father a submariner. They \n     were my first heroes, and their respect for me has been the \n     most lasting ambition of my life. It was nearly pre-ordained \n     that I would someday find a place in my family's profession, \n     and that my fate would carry me to war.\n       Such was not the case for most of you. Your ambitions did \n     not lead you to war; the honors you first sought were not \n     kept hidden on battlefields. Most of you were citizen-\n     soldiers. You answered the call when it came; took up arms \n     for your country's sake; and fought to the limit of your \n     ability because you believed your country's welfare was as \n     much your responsibility as it was the professional \n     soldier's.\n       I did what I had been prepared for most of my life to do. \n     You did what I did but without the advantages of training and \n     experience that I possessed. You were kids when you saw \n     combat. I was thirty years old. I believe you outranked me.\n       I do not mean to dismiss the virtues of the professional \n     soldier. I consider my inclusion in their ranks to be the \n     great honor of my life. The Navy was and yet remains the \n     world I know best and love most. The Navy took me to war.\n       Unless you are a veteran you might find it odd that I would \n     be indebted to the Navy for sending me to war. You might \n     mistakenly conclude that the secret veterans' share is that \n     they enjoyed war.\n       We do share a secret, but it is not a romantic remembrance \n     of war. War is awful. When nations seek to resolve their \n     differences by force of arms, a million tragedies ensue. \n     Nothing, not the valor with which it is fought nor the \n     nobility of the cause it serves, can glorify war. War is \n     wretched beyond description. Whatever gains are secured by \n     war, it is loss that the veteran remembers. Only a fool or a \n     fraud sentimentalizes the cruel and merciless reality of war.\n       Neither do we share a nostalgia for the exhilaration of \n     combat. That exhilaration, after all, is really the sensation \n     of choking back fear. I think we are all proud to have once \n     overcome the paralysis of terror. But few of us are so \n     removed from the memory of that terror to mistake it today \n     for a welcome thrill.\n       What we share is something harder to explain. It is in part \n     a pride for having sacrificed together for a cause greater \n     than our individual pursuits; pride for having your courage \n     and honor tested and affirmed in a fearsome moment of \n     history; pride for having replaced comfort and security with \n     misery and deprivation and not been broken by the experience.\n       We also share--and this is harder to explain--the \n     survivors' humility. That's a provocative statement, I know, \n     and the non-veteran may easily mistake its meaning. I am not \n     talking about shame. I know of no shame in surviving combat. \n     But every combat veteran remembers those comrades whose \n     sacrifice was eternal. Their loss taught us everything about \n     tragedy and everything about duty.\n       I suspect that at one time or another almost everyone in \n     this room has been called a hero for having done their duty. \n     It is at that moment that we feel most keenly the memory of \n     our comrades who did not return with us to the country we \n     love so dearly. I cannot help but wince a little when heroism \n     is ascribed to me. For I once watched men pay a much higher \n     price for that honor than was asked of me.\n       I am grateful, as we all are, to have come home alive. I \n     prayed daily for deliverance from war. No one of my \n     acquaintance ever chose death over homecoming. But I \n     witnessed some men choose death over dishonor. The memory of \n     them, of what they bore for country and honor helped me to \n     see the virtue in my own humility.\n       It is in that humility--and only in that humility--that the \n     memory of almost all human experiences--love and hate, loss \n     and redemption, joy and despair, suffering and release, \n     regret and gratitude--reside. In the end, that is the secret \n     that veterans share.\n       It is a surpassing irony that war, for all its unspeakable \n     horrors, provides the combatant with every conceivable human \n     experience. Experiences that usually take a lifetime to know \n     are all felt--and felt intensely--in one brief moment of \n     life. Anyone who loses a loved one knows what great loss \n     feels like. Anyone who gives life to a child knows what great \n     joy feels like. The veteran knows what great joy and great \n     loss feel like when they occur in the same moment, in the \n     same experience.\n       That is why when we are asked about our time at war, we \n     often offer the contradictory response that it was an \n     experience that, if given the choice, we would neither trade \n     nor repeat. The meaning behind that response is powerful, and \n     I fear that my own powers of expression have failed to \n     explain it clearly. But you know what I am talking about, and \n     in gratitude for the honor you have bestowed on me, I wanted \n     to this evening talk about things I more often leave \n     unexpressed.\n       Perhaps, I should talk about the veterans issues before the \n     104th Congress. But no doubt you have by this point in your \n     convention heard from both Congress and the Administration a \n     great many promises to protect and advance the interests of \n     American veterans. For my part, I would simply affirm that \n     the sacrifices borne by veterans deserve to be memoralized in \n     something more lasting than marble or bronze or in the \n     fleeting effect of a politician's speech. Your valor and your \n     devotion to duty have earned your country's abiding concern \n     for your well-being. I am, I assure you, committed to \n     honoring that debt.\n       I suspect you already knew that or you would not have \n     honored me with this award. \n     [[Page S4522]] And, as I said, I wanted to talk of other \n     things as well tonight, of the experiences we share and the \n     memory that holds us to one another.\n       Let me talk now of what you gave your country, the \n     contribution for which the nation is in your debt. It is more \n     than the battles you won. More than Iwo Jima or Midway or the \n     Battle of the Bulge. More than the Chosin Reservoir or \n     Inchon. More than flights over that most heavily defended \n     enemy capital, Hanoi. More than Khe San or the I Drang.\n       All these battles, all these grim tests of courage and \n     character have made a legend of the American fighting man's \n     devotion to duty in every community in America. And it is the \n     lesson of your courage that will help instruct those who will\n      defend our country tomorrow in their duty. For they will \n     seek to immortalize in their own devotion to duty your \n     valor and the long and noble history of a free people's \n     defense of their liberty. Their character will be derived \n     in part from their appreciation of your character.\n       You know, as well as I, that the world in which they \n     shoulder their responsibilities is an uncertain one. Our \n     familiarity with man's inhumanity to man assures us that \n     Americans will be asked someday to again bear sacrifices that \n     only the brave can endure. That burden will be their honor, \n     as it was once ours.\n       I have memories of that honor that caution me to this day \n     to be careful when asking such sacrifices of others. But I \n     fear that the day will come when my caution is overcome by \n     necessity.\n       Last June, the free world celebrated one of the greatest \n     battles in the long struggle against tyranny--the invasion of \n     Normandy. President Clinton, quite appropriately, \n     memorialized the occasion by recognizing the profound debt \n     the world owes to the veterans of D Day. In the President's \n     words: ``they saved the world.''\n       Our world, then and now, is indeed the consequence of their \n     suffering on killing grounds that were once and are again \n     quiet beaches in a peaceful corner of the free world. But the \n     memory of their sacrifice, and the memories of sacrifice that \n     are held by all of you, caution us always to never assume \n     that peace is the normal state of world affairs.\n       I have memories of a place so far removed from the comforts \n     of this blessed country that I have forgotten some of the \n     anguish it once brought me. But my happiness these last \n     twenty years has not let me forget the friends who did not \n     come home with me. The memory of them, of what they bore for \n     honor and country, causes me to look in every prospective \n     conflict for the shadow of Vietnam.\n       I do not let that shadow hold me in fear from my duty as I \n     have been given light to see that duty. Yet, it no longer \n     falls to me to bear arms in my country's defense. It falls to \n     our children, and our children's children. I pray that if the \n     time comes for them to answer a call to arms, the battle will \n     be necessary and the field well chosen. But that will not be \n     their responsibility. As it once was for us, their honor is \n     in their answer, not their summons.\n       I trust in their willingness and ability to answer the call \n     faithfully. I hold that trust in deference to memories of \n     brave men lost long ago. I hold that trust in deference to \n     you and the courage with which you came of age during a \n     moment of violence and terror. I know that the cause which \n     you defended will not suffer in our children's hands. They \n     are born into the same traditions, with the same values that \n     empowered us.\n       I know that on some fitting, distant occasion, young men \n     and women will be instructed in their duty by recalling our \n     children's and our grandchildren's example. And on a quiet \n     beach somewhere, many years from now, the liberated will \n     again gather to pay tribute to the liberators, look upon \n     their seasoned faces and say: they were warriors once and \n     very brave. You and I know how great an honor that is.\n       Thank you for this award. I will always try to remain \n     worthy of the honor. Good night and God bless you.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/23/senate-section/article/S4521-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, MARCH 24, 1995\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I did not want to take the remaining \nmoments prior to the time people had the opportunity to vote on the \nline-item veto, but I did want to speak before the end of the day for a \ncouple of reasons.\n  First of all, to commend the distinguished Senator from Nebraska and \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia, on our side, for their \nadmirable leadership in the effort over the last many days. Their \nleadership, their expertise, the remarkable contribution that they made \nto this debate I think lent service to the entire body. I am very \ngrateful to them.\n  Let me also commend the distinguished Senators from Arizona and \nIndiana for their work. Certainly as a result of their leadership and \ncommitment they made to this issue for many years, we have now reached \nthe point where this legislation passed tonight on a vote of 69-29.\n  Mr. President, I voted in favor of this legislation, very, very \nreluctantly. It is no secret that I have had some very significant \nconcerns about this particular version of line-item veto.\n  A week ago tomorrow I went to the floor to express my grave concern \nabout the practicality of separate enrollment, about its \nconstitutionality, and about the shift in the balance of power away \nfrom Congress and to the White House. I addressed some of those \nconcerns again on several occasions, the latest of which was last \nevening. I have said all along it was my view that a legislative line-\nitem veto, if done properly, was a very important tool, budgetarily and \nlegislatively.\n  I have consistently supported the line-item veto on a number of \noccasions over the past 16 years. So my vote tonight was consistent \nwith that record. But I cast it, as I said, with some reservation.\n  I did so with the satisfaction that we also achieved some compromise \nover the course of the last several days. We achieved a better \nunderstanding of what would be included in the bill's tax expenditure \nprovisions. In our view, the Republicans have come some distance in \naccommodating our concern with regard to ensuring that tax expenditures \nbe included in this bill, that special-interest tax breaks be exposed \nto the same critical review by the President as other spending.\n  We were also able to ensure that the savings generated here would be \nlocked in, locked in to deficit reduction and nothing else. I was \ndisappointed with the vote tonight on the Byrd amendment, because I \nthought that would go even further toward ensuring that our purpose in \nthis regard would be clearly understood from the very beginning. I \nthought the leadership provided by the Senator from West Virginia was \nvery important in articulating clearly our desire to have all savings \ndesignated for purposes of deficit reduction and nothing else.\n  I was pleased, as well, that we were able to accommodate the concern \nthat many had about separate enrollment. While this was not a perfect \nsolution, at least we may have a little more practical understanding of \nhow this bill, with its many pieces, would be packaged and sent to the \nPresident in a form that may allow us constitutionally to deal with the \nissue of separate enrollment, if not practically.\n   [[Page S4523]] I still have some fundamental concerns about the \npracticality of requiring separate enrollment and separate signatures, \nabout the practicality of, line by line, taking a simple bill and \nmaking it as complex as the separate enrollment process will make it.\n  Clearly, it is a start. It is an effort at compromise. Indeed, I \nbelieve that we have accommodated that concern to the extent that it \nwas possible at the end of this debate.\n  In terms of the constitutionality of this proposal, I think it is \nimportant that we approved an amendment ensuring judicial review of the \nproposal. The courts will now have the ability to assess the \nconstitutionality of this legislation.\n  The constitutionality of this particular version of line-item veto \nmay be in doubt. But we have a provision in place now that will allow \nMembers to review and to come to some conclusion about the \nconstitutional viability of this legislation at an early date. That, \ntoo, in my view, was an improvement in this piece of legislation.\n  Third, let me say that I think it is very important that everyone \nunderstand this bill has a life--a life and a death, frankly. When the \nyear 2000 approaches, we will have a much better understanding of \nwhether or not this worked, whether or not it was practical, certainly \nwhether or not it was constitutional, whether or not we have succeeded \nin preserving the balance of legislative responsibility between the \nPresident and the Congress. So, in the year 2000, knowing all of that, \nwe will be in a much better position to determine whether or not this \nought to be extended, whether or not it ought to be given a new life.\n  So that sunset provision, in my view, was critical to coming to the \nconclusion I did about this particular piece of legislation. This is \nnot permanent. It is an experiment. It is an opportunity for us to see \nwhether it will work.\n  Senator Byrd and others have raised some very legitimate concerns, \nboth constitutionally and in many other ways. We will learn, over the \ncourse of the next 5 years, whether they need to be addressed, to what \ndegree they should be addressed, and ultimately what if any changes may \nbe necessary prior to the time this legislation is extended for any \nlength of time after the year 2000.\n  Finally, let me say I am very concerned about the budgetary \nimplications of what we do here. We have had a very vigorous debate on \na constitutional amendment to balance the budget, on proposals to lay \nout a plan by which we achieve a balanced Federal budget by a date \ncertain. We all recognize we have to make some tough decisions about \nwhat will be spent, how it will be spent, what if any tax changes we \nmake--ultimately, what conclusions we can make with regard to the \ndifficult, vexing problem we face with regard to the deficit in the \noncoming years. If we do not have the tools available to us to make \nthose decisions in a meaningful way, then I fear we will never achieve \nwhat we all say we want.\n  This is a tool. It may be a blunt instrument. It may be a precision \ntool. We do not know yet. But we do know it ought to give us yet one \nmore opportunity to say with some confidence that, indeed, we are going \nto get our hands on the budget, our grip on the deficit, in a way that \nwill allow us a greater degree of confidence that indeed we can succeed \nin these coming years.\n  It may not be the tool I would have chosen first. It may not be the \ntool I believe ought to ultimately be preserved in law in perpetuity. \nBut it is a tool that will allow us for the next 5 years to make some \neffort to do what we desperately need to do, and that is find a way to \nreduce the deficit, find a meaningful way to assess our expenditures, \nfind a way to ensure that we pass the best possible piece of \nlegislation each and every time it involves spending. That is what this \nallows us to do, and I am very hopeful that we have made the right \ndecision tonight.\n  This has been another in an ongoing series of debates about how best \nto accomplish deficit reduction and a meaningful plan for balancing the \nbudget. I hope that our colleagues can now come together on other \nissues, as well, especially on that which we have felt all along is \nneeded, if indeed this or anything else is going to work, and that is a \nbudget plan that will accomplish the deficit reduction we need.\n  There are now 8 days left before the legal deadline, before the \nBudget Committee must report a budget resolution. There are 23 days \nprior to the time this body must act on a budget resolution. We tell \nthe American people they need to pay their taxes by April 15. The law \nalso requires that we pass a budget resolution by April 15. That, too, \nis a tool. That, too, ought to be something that has the priority that \nthe line-item veto had this week.\n  I am hopeful we still can meet that goal. I am not optimistic. But \nwhether it is April 15 or some time shortly thereafter, let us use that \ntool as well to achieve what we know we must. We know we must make the \ntough decisions and it is time we get on with it.\n  We have made a tough decision tonight. I think, all things \nconsidered, it was the right decision.\n  Again, let me commend those who had a role to play in the debate. It \nwas a good debate, a debate that educated the American people and \ncertainly our colleagues with regard to the implications of this \nlegislation.\n  I think the Congress has served its role very well.
