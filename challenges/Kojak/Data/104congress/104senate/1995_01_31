Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert in the \nRecord a copy of an article written by Mr. Neely Mallory in the \nCommercial Appeal of Memphis, TN, on Sunday, January 29, dealing with \nthe importance of agriculture and nutrition programs.\n  It is a cautionary signal and call to the Congress to recognize the \nimportance of these programs as we work through the efforts for reform, \nreduction in spending, balancing the budget, and the other important \nchallenges that we are considering now in the Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Commercial Appeal, Jan. 29, 1995]\n\n                            A Proud Harvest\n\n                           (By Neely Mallory)\n\n       The new year is barely out of the bag but the debate \n     concerning the new farm bill already has begun in earnest. \n     Every five years, Congress must decide whether to reauthorize \n     a set of farm and nutrition programs that have been in place \n     for about 60 years.\n       An editorial in this newspaper Jan. 2 lent its voice to a \n     group that wants farm programs to be either abolished or \n     significantly changed. In so doing, this newspaper has done a \n     disservice to the thousands of Mid-South farmers who read it, \n     the needy who benefit from food assistance programs and the \n     American public.\n       As the editorial stated, there are far fewer farmers today \n     than there were 60 years ago--but there are many more mouths \n     to feed and bodies to clothe. The importance of food and \n     fiber to every person on this planet has not declined one \n     iota over these many years. Research, huge capital \n     investments, advancing technology and successful farm \n     programs have made this incredible jump in efficiency \n     possible--without for one moment jeopardizing our nation's \n     supply of reasonably priced food and fiber.\n       Agriculture and related businesses contribute more than $40 \n     billion annually to the Mid-South economy alone. Farming may \n     not be the nation's principal occupation, but it is, \n     nevertheless, an important one. About one job out of six in \n     the United States is somehow farm or food related. Certainly, \n     the jobs and economic activity created by farmers drive this \n     region's economy.\n       Farm programs are not the relics critics would lead the \n     public to believe. Farm programs have changed, evolved with \n     every farm bill and with changing economic conditions. In the \n     1930s, those programs were designed to keep farmers in place \n     and to prevent shortages of food and fiber for a hungry \n     nation. In the 1990s, these programs are a crucially \n     important component of industrial policy that enables U.S. \n     agriculture to remain viable in a world market where its \n     [[Page S1796]] comparative advantage is taken away by foreign \n     subsidies.\n       Today's commercial farm is a high-tech, capital-intensive \n     enterprise. The implications of this evolution in farm \n     organization and management are not understood nearly as well \n     as they should be. The relatively large gross sales of \n     farming operations lead many people to believe that farmers \n     have no need for government programs. The truth of the matter \n     is that the narrow margins on sales of agriculture \n     commodities are simply not adequate to compensate for the \n     tremendous risk associated with today's capital-intensive \n     farming. Neither a prudent farmer nor his banker would \n     consider making the kind of investment currently necessary \n     for commercial agriculture production in the absence of \n     either a farm program that provides the producer with a \n     safety net or much higher market prices that are commensurate \n     with the investment and risk involved.\n       There is a rather badly misplaced belief that the new \n     General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will do away with \n     agriculture subsidies around the world, after which U.S. \n     agriculture should be able to take advantage of its \n     competitive edge. If, in fact, GATT did away with subsidies, \n     U.S. agriculture would be generally well positioned, with its \n     vast agriculture land resources, favorable climate, \n     unequalled technology and excellent processing, handling and \n     transportation infrastructure.\n       The United States offered during the early stages of GATT \n     negotiations to end agriculture subsidization, but no other \n     country would hear of it. They cannot compete with us without \n     government help. The final agreement requires very minimal \n     changes in the subsidy programs of other nations. So U.S. \n     agriculture will continue to be confronted with a system of \n     foreign subsidies that undermines our comparative advantage \n     in agriculture production and marketing.\n       It is no accident or quirk of fate that every American \n     enjoys the lowest-cost and best available supply of food and \n     fiber in the world. This prized result came about because of \n     American ingenuity and successful farm programs that have \n     enabled U.S. farmers to compete worldwide and produce an \n     abundant supply of food and fiber for domestic consumption. \n     And it has happened in spite of foreign subsidies, tremendous \n     natural disasters and the huge financial risk associated with \n     farming.\n       The agriculture reforms suggested in this newspaper's \n     editorial already have been set in motion. A massive \n     reorganization and downsizing of the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture and the total revision of the federal crop \n     insurance program are but two examples. Farm program spending \n     (which makes up less than 1 percent of the entire federal \n     budget) has been cut by two-thirds since 1986. This is not \n     ``trimming,'' as the editorial suggests; this is slicing and \n     dicing. If the rest of this nation's federal spending had \n     been reduced by half as much as agriculture, we would be \n     running a federal surplus.\n       A review of farm programs is certainly in order during 1995 \n     as Congress considers new farm legislation. We would be the \n     first to admit that farm programs are not perfect, and that \n     some farmers have taken improper advantage of them. But on \n     balance, it is safe to say that farmers are no more or less \n     likely to cheat than any other person. Responsible lawmakers \n     should not ignore the plain success of U.S. farm and \n     nutrition programs. Abolition or weakening of programs whose \n     success can be measured every day does not quality as needed \n     reform. It would be imperiling a 21-million-job industry.\n       I believe the new secretary of Agriculture and those in \n     Congress responsible for writing the laws will know the \n     difference between so-called reform and preserving an \n     industry-government partnership that returns enormous \n     benefits to the American public.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, yesterday the Speaker of the House \naddressed the American Hospital Association. His comments should be \nreviewed by every Member of the Senate and by the American people as \nwell, because they are an unmistakable preview of what we can expect if \nthe constitutional amendment before us is enacted and of what the \nRepublican Contract on American really means.\n  The Speaker said that Medicare would be ``rethought from the ground \nup.'' He said that he would ``make every decision within the context of \ngetting to a balanced budget.''\n  I am not surprised by the Speaker's words, because the fact is that \nyou can't balance the budget, protect defense spending, and provide \nbillions in tax cuts for the rich without savage cuts in the Medicare \nProgram. If Social Security is kept off limits, the Treasury Department \nestimates that Medicare would have to be cut by $77 billion by 2002--an \nalmost unthinkable 31 percent of projected program outlays. If Social \nSecurity is also cut, the reductions would still be 21 percent of \nprogram costs--nearly $2,000 less Medicare for every senior citizen.\n  Speaker Gingrich and the other authors of the Republican contract \ndon't seem to know or care how dependent senior citizens are on \nMedicare. Even without any Medicare cuts, senior citizens spent an \naverage of $2,800 out of their own pockets for health care last year. \nThis is four times what nonelderly Americans spent. Just 7 years ago, \nin 1987, senior citizens had to spend 15 percent of their income for \nmedical care--and that was too much. Today, that proportion has soared \nto 23 percent--almost $1 in every $4 of limited\n incomes that are already stretched to pay for food, housing, heat, \nclothing, and other essential expenses of daily living. Senior citizens \nshould be paying less for medical care, not more.\n\n  A word we are hearing more and more from our friends on the other \nside of the aisle is restructuring the Medicare Program. All of us are \ninterested in improvements in Medicare, but restructuring is a barely \ndisguised euphemism for forcing seniors into managed care and cutting \nbenefits. Senior citizens should have the opportunity to join managed \ncare plans--as many do today. They should be entitled to share in any \nsavings from managed care in the form of better benefits and lower \npremiums--as many do today. But we should vigorously oppose any scheme \nto balance the budget by cutting Medicare and forcing senior citizens \ninto managed care programs that deny them the freedom to go to the \ndoctor of their choice.\n  When Speaker Gingrich and his allies talk about a balanced budget, \nthey don't seem to be very concerned about the budgets of American \nfamilies--and particularly the limited budgets of our senior citizens. \nWhen they talk about freedom from big Government, they don't seem to be \nvery concerned about the freedom of senior citizens to go to the doctor \nof their choice. But I say those are the budgets and the freedoms that \nwe ought to be protecting, not attacking.\n  The distinction between Medicare and Social Security is a false one, \nbecause Medicare is a part of Social Security. Social Security and \nMedicare are the twin pillars of retirement security for millions of \nsenior citizens. Like Social Security, Medicare is a sacred compact \nbetween the Government and the people. It says, ``Work hard all your \nlife, pay your dues, and we will guarantee you security in your old \nage.'' We have an obligation to protect that compact, not only for \ntoday's senior citizens but for their children and their grandchildren, \nfor all of us, if we are fortunate, will some day be old.\n  When Republicans in other years tried to break the promise of Social \nSecurity, senior citizens and their families all over this country told \nthem that the answer was ``no.'' And the Congress responded. Today, it \nis time to say to Newt Gingrich and his friends that, when it comes to \nbreaking the promise of Medicare, the answer is just as resounding and \njust as unequivocal. And once again, the answer is ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I would like to take \nthis time to comment on the event that occurred this weekend on \nSaturday and congratulate the President of the United States for \ncalling, for the first time, a bipartisan summit on the issue of \nwelfare reform.\n  The President of the United States, President Clinton, spent almost 5 \nhours sitting in an all-day meeting at the Blair House, and in that \nmeeting were Republican Governors, Democratic \n[[Page S1797]] Governors, Republican Members of the House, Democratic \nMembers of the House, Democratic Members of the Senate, as well as \nRepublican Members of the Senate. It was truly a bipartisan effort to \ndiscuss, I think, one of the most pressing problems that is facing this \nCongress today; that is, how do we fundamentally reform a system that I \nthink everybody agrees is fundamentally flawed.\n  I think everyone in that room agreed that welfare as we know it today \ndoes not serve well the people who are on it nor does it serve very \nwell the people who are paying for it, the taxpayers of the United \nStates.\n  I think that we found in that meeting that there was a great deal of \ncommon agreement about some of the things that we should embark upon to \ntry to fundamentally reform welfare. I think the Governors said \nessentially, ``We would like to have more responsibility. Let us be \ninnovative. Let us try to suggest things that work in a particular \nState,'' like my State of Louisiana that may not work in Vermont or in \nMississippi or in California or any other State in the country. ``Let \nus be innovative. Let us come up with solutions to welfare that fit the \npeople in our respective States.''\n  I think there is a common sense of agreement around that particular \nproposition.\n  There was also, I think, common agreement that there should be time \nlimits; that people should not be able to be on public assistance \nforever if, in fact, they are able to perform work in the private \nsector or even in the public sector.\n  But I think, Mr. President and my colleagues, that something has \nhappened, particularly since the November election. I think we have \nlost the proper focus of what welfare reform should concentrate on.\n  We have heard wonderful speeches about illegitimacy and the problem \nthat it is, and it is. We have heard speeches about crime related to \nwelfare. We have heard speeches about the breakup of the family which \nis a result of welfare programs. We have heard speeches about teen \npregnancy and what we should do to try to eliminate it in the problem \nareas in which we see it occurring.\n  But I think the fundamental focus of welfare reform should be work. \nThe fundamental focus should be how do we get a person who is a welfare \nrecipient into a job, because I believe that the best social program \nthat we could ever write is a good job.\n  You could talk about how to solve the problems of illegitimacy and \ncrime and breakup of the family and all of these other very important \nissues, but the fundamental focus, I think, has to be on how do we \nrefocus our attention on work and how do we get that person from \ndependency into the work force.\n  Now, the President's first proposal in this area was a good start. He \nsaid, ``Look, there should be a time limit on welfare. It should be no \nmore than 2 years. And then we should increase the opportunities for \neducation and training.'' But he did not provide the missing link, \nwhich is: How do we, after we reach that point, get the person from \nwelfare into the work force?\n  One of the first Republican proposals really just suggested a time \nlimit--2 years, and that is it--but it did not address the fundamental \nproblem of getting the person on welfare after that 2 years into the \nwork force.\n  The latest Republican proposal seems to say, ``Let's have block \ngrants and give it to the States.''\n  I addressed the Governors Conference this weekend, both the \nDemocratic Governors and the National Governors Conference. I suggested \nto them to be careful. Do not let Congress put all of the welfare \nproblems in a box and send the box to the States and say, ``Here, it's \nyours.'' And then, when the Governors and the legislators on the State \nlevel open up that box, they see a lot of problems, but they do not see \nany solutions and they do not see any money to help them solve the \nproblems. I suggest that is not a solution. That is passing the buck \nthrough a block grant to the States.\n  What I think we have to do is recognize that we on the Federal level \nwho raise taxes to pay for these programs have a fundamental \nresponsibility to see to it that these tax dollars are used in a way \nthat truly improves welfare as we know it, that provides real answers \nand suggestions on what should be done. Yes, of course, maximize the \nflexibility to the States. I support that very strongly. But also work \nwith the States. Do not walk away from our responsibility as Federal \nlegislators, who have a responsibility to the Federal tax dollar to see \nthat it is used wisely and not wasted, who have a real responsibility \nto come up with some ideas and suggestions as to what needs to be done.\n  Let me suggest one approach that has been developed by myself, along \nwith others, including the Progressive Policy Institute of the \nDemocratic Leadership Council, which spent a great deal of time working \non this effort, together with Republicans who have commented on it. The \nHudson Institute, essentially a Republican think tank, is one, I \nbelieve, that likes this idea.\n  I have discussed this with my colleague from Colorado, Senator Hank \nBrown, who I believe will hopefully be joining with me as a cosponsor \nof this effort.\n  Here it is: I suggest that there is a missing part of the puzzle, \nthere is a missing link, if you will, between the welfare recipient and \nthe job. How do we get this person into this position, which I happen \nto think is the best social program that we could ever devise. I \nsuggest that we consider taking existing welfare subsidies and use them \nto create job placement vouchers.\n  When a welfare recipient comes into his State welfare office seeking \nassistance, he enters into a contract arrangement with the State \nwelfare office and receives a voucher that is good for payment. He gets \na list of organizations, both public and private, that are in the job \nplacement business. That welfare recipient enters into a contract \narrangement with one of these corporations to help them find a job.\n  Some of these organizations will interview this welfare recipient and \nsay, ``They are ready to go into the workplace right now. They have the \ntraining. They are just down on their luck. We can find this person a \njob tomorrow.'' And they put that person in that job the next day.\n  Others will look at a welfare recipient and say,\n\n       No, this person needs more training or education or on-the-\n     job training. We know just the job that fits this person's \n     ability. We are going to put them in it because that job has \n     on-the-job training, on-the-job skill training and education \n     that will fit this particular welfare recipient's needs. We \n     can put them in this job next week.\n\n  Others will look at the welfare recipient and say,\n\n       No, this person really needs to brush up on reading and \n     writing and arithmetic and basic English skills. They are \n     going to have to have 6 weeks or 6 months of training, but \n     then I know exactly where I can place that person after that \n     particular period of time.\n\n  Now, the essential feature of this is that we are talking about \nprivatizing the job placement portion of finding a welfare recipient a \njob. There are a number of institutions that are doing this right now.\n  Let me refer you to America Works, which has programs in New Jersey \nand New York. Let me talk about Cleveland Works, which has a similar \nprogram in the city of Cleveland. The Goodwill Industries work program \nin the State of Florida and also in the State of Louisiana is this type \nof program.\n  Here is the good feature about this particular suggestion. That \nprivate sector corporation, when they enter into that contract with the \nwelfare recipient and receive a voucher to find them a job, only is \ngoing to get paid when that welfare recipient gets the job, No. 1, and \nstays in that job, No. 2, for a certain period of time. Somewhere \nbetween 7 months to 1 year has been suggested.\n  Let me tell you what that does to both parties. It creates a \ntremendous incentive for that job placement service to find that \nwelfare recipient a job that is a good job and one that they stay in, \nbecause they know they do not get paid unless they put that person in a \njob situation that meets their skills and allows them to stay in it for \na year or more.\n  Many of our welfare recipients will take a job, they will stay there \n2 days or 2 weeks, and they quit. They are back on welfare, because \nthey have not been put in the right circumstances that meets their \nability to perform.\n   [[Page S1798]] But this job placement voucher system, really, I \nthink, provides the missing link or the missing part of the puzzle \nbetween a person who is on welfare and the job they need to be put \ninto.\n  If you tell a company that they are only going to get paid if they \nfind that welfare recipient a job that they stay in for a year, then \none important thing happens. They pay a lot of attention to getting \nthat person into the right job, because they know if they put them in \nthe wrong job and that only lasts for 1 week, they are not going to get \npaid.\n So they make sure that the person has the proper skills and training \nto fit into a particular job that will allow them to stay in that job \nfor a year or more.\n\n  I would suggest, Mr. President, that in places where this type of \nprogram has been tried, a number of good things have happened. No. 1, \nwe have saved the State a lot of money, because if a person gets into a \njob position, he is earning a salary, paying taxes and is no longer on \nwelfare. The State who has contracted with these private placement \ncenters are paying the private placement center a lot less than they \nare paying the welfare recipient when he or she is on welfare.\n  Therefore, the concept of privatizing the missing link between the \nwelfare recipient and the job that he or she needs is provided by this \nconcept that we are suggesting today.\n  Mr. President, I think that welfare should not and cannot be a \npartisan issue. If it is, we will never solve it. We have to reach out \nto our Republican colleagues, and they to us, to sit down and come up \nwith real solutions to a very serious problem in this country.\n  All of these other problems that I talked about--illegitimacy and \nteen pregnancy and breakup of the family, the increase in the crime \nrate--I think if we resolve the welfare issue in this country we will \nhave created the best social program that we could ever create: That \nis, a good job. And a good job brings about responsibility and creates \nopportunities and helps solve the other tangential problems which are \nvery, very serious indeed.\n  I am suggesting that the missing part of the puzzle can be replaced \nwith a job placement voucher. We will be introducing such legislation \nthat still allows the State maximum discretion that they need to tailor \nthe needs of their respective State. I think if we move in this \ndirection, we will have taken a giant step toward doing what the \nAmerican people would like Members to do.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The manager can do that at this time. The hour has arrived.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move that we move to it.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a short \nstatement without losing his right to the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. I was hoping we could go back and forth, and then go to \nthe distinguished Senator from Arizona. I hope we will have comity \nhere, can speak and then whoever is next. If we can go back and forth, \nI think it would be a good thing.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Then I ask, Mr. President, unanimous consent that when I \nam finished, I be able to yield to the Senator from Arizona and then be \nable to yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. REID. Could someone restate this unanimous-consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous-consent request was that after \nthe Senator from Vermont is finished the Senator from Arizona would be \nrecognized and then the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. HATCH. We may be able to solve this problem. The distinguished \nSenator from Arizona has 3 minutes unrelated. He wanted to do it in \nmorning business. We have kind of jumped the gun.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was trying to accommodate the \ndistinguished manager and I thought this might do it. I think we are \ngoing to do it quickly. If we went on this we would probably take less \ntime than asking for the unanimous consent.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator from \nArizona wants to speak 3 or 4 minutes in morning business, is that \nright, and then we would go to the constitutional amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be the regular order of the \nunanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. REID. I just want to understand what is going on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, an objection to 4 minutes of morning \nbusiness, and then going to the bill, is that the question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the request.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and the Senator from \nVermont for accommodating my request.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kyl pertaining to the introduction of legislation \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/31/senate-section/article/S1796-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO KEN L. LOTT, JR.\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President. I want to pay tribute to one of my \nlongtime friends, Ken L. Lott, Jr., who passed away on January 16.\n  A native of Selma, and longtime resident of Mobile, Ken was known to \nmany as a leader and a friend.\n  Ken received a bachelor's degree in commerce from Auburn University, \nwhere he was an Army ROTC cadet.\n  The leadership skills he learned while a cadet helped him rise to the \nposition of a field artillery captain in the 29th Infantry Division. \nHis service to his country led to him receiving the Bronze Star and \nPurple Heart.\n  After Ken's enlistment in the Army ended, he began a professional \ncareer in the banking industry.\n  His professional affiliations included memberships with Southland \nBancorporation and the International Division of First Alabama \nBancshares, Inc. He was also the former chairman of Merchants National \nBank.\n  Although Ken was very involved in his professional career, he still \nfound time to devote to his community. He was cofounder of the \nCommunity Foundation in 1975 and served as its first president.\n  Additionally, his community involvement can be seen through the \ndirectorships and affiliations he once had. These included the Mobile \nKiwanis Club, the Country Club, Goodwill Industries, and the chamber of \ncommerce.\n  His community and State showed great appreciation to Ken by inducting \nhim into the Alabama Senior Citizens Hall of Fame in 1991.\n  The Mobile community is highly grateful for what Ken gave it over the \nyears. He will be greatly missed by those fortunate to have known him. \nMy deepest condolences are extended to his family and loved ones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/31/senate-section/article/S1798-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1798-S1799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MUSICIAN VERNON RAINES\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, conductor Vernon Raines is one of those \nrare individuals who has been truly blessed with a divine talent for \nmusic, and who has worked effortlessly to spread musical enlightenment \nto the citizens of south Alabama. It is as if the music has always been \nin his heart, as if it were his destiny.\n  At the age of 6, Vernon had already written his first violin \ncomposition, and had begun to play the piano by ear. By the time he was \n18, he had become the musical director of the Mobile Chamber Orchestra \nand had begun a career that included over 28 years as conductor and \nmusical director of the Meridian Symphony Orchestra. He also \n[[Page S1799]] served for 3 years as the conductor of the University of \nSouthern Mississippi symphony, opera, and ballet; and was the associate \nprofessor of music and the chairman of the music department at \nLivingston University, in Livingston, Alabama for nearly 8 years.\n  In addition, Mr. Raines was an organizer of the Mobile Chamber \nOrchestra, was a key facilitator of the Mobile Symphonic Society, and \nserved as the guest conductor of the Kwangju Philharmonic of Korea in \n1987. He has also performed many times on public radio and television, \nand has made five guest appearances at the Mobile Opera Guild Workshop.\n  Mr. Raines graduated from Murphy High School in Mobile, and received \nhis bachelor of music degree from the University of Alabama. He then \nwent on to receive his master of music degree from Florida State \nUniversity, studied at the American Symphony Orchestra League's Eastern \nInstitute of Orchestral Studies, and studied privately under such noted \nconductors as Leo Mueller and Ernst von Dohnanyi.\n  It is my sincere pleasure and honor to commend and congratulate Mr. \nVernon Raines on his outstanding career as a musician and conductor. He \nis truly a guiding force in the Greater Gulf Coast musical scene, and \nis an inspiration to the young musicians of Alabama. May he continue to \nenlighten the hearts of Alabamians with the beautiful music of our \npast.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/31/senate-section/article/S1798-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. JOHN M. LONG\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \naccomplishments of musician Dr. John M. Long, who recently was inducted \ninto the National Band Association's Hall of Fame. When looking back at \nJohn's accomplishments, one can see why he has had such an impact on \nthe music industry.\n  John's phenomenal career began while directing the Robert E. Lee High \nSchool Band in Montgomery, AL. This band set several records and became \nthe envy of many others.\n  John later went on to Troy State University to even greater \nachievements. In the 29 years he directed the Troy State band, it made \nnumerous recordings; appeared at four U.S. Presidential inaugurations, \nand played for the President twice. His accomplishments have obviously \nmade his coworkers and students think highly of him. In fact, they \nnamed the band room at Troy State in his honor.\n  While directing his various bands, he has received numerous honors. \nIn 1977, he was the first active director to be elected to the Alabama \nBandmasters Hall of Fame. Later on in 1984, he was the first person to \nreceive the Alabama Music Educator of the Year award. This is a great \naccomplishment because no one has been the recipient of this award for \n40 years. There is no question in my mind that School Musician magazine \nmade the right choice in choosing him as one of the 10 outstanding band \ndirectors in the United States.\n  Additionally, the hard work he has put forth for the love of his job \nand music can be seen through the various music-related organizations \nhe has associated himself with. They are the American Bandmaster's \nAssociation; the College Directors Association; the National Band \nAssociation.\n  Dr. Long's influence on students, musicians, and the public truly \nmake him a legend in the music industry. His accomplishments in the \nfield have opened up a whole new world for many people, young and old \nalike. It is my pleasure to congratulate Dr. Long on all of his \nachievements and wish him much happiness for the future.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/31/senate-section/article/S1799-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO LT. GEN. ROBERT B. JOHNNSTON, U.S. MARINE CORPS, ON \nRECEIVING THE MARINE CORPS RESERVE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION ``NON SIBI; SED \n                            PATRIAE'' AWARD\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, on Saturday, February 4, at Camp Lejeune, NC \nthe Marine Corps Reserve Officers Association will bestow upon Lt. Gen. \nRobert B. Johnston its highest award. The award is ``Non sibi, sed \npatriae, which is Latin for ``Not for self, but for country.''\n  Lieutenant General Johnston, currently commander of U.S. Marine Corps \nForces, Atlantic, headquartered at the base the marines call ``The Home \nof Expeditionary Forces in Readiness'' richly deserves this award. \nNothing better characterizes this man than his selfless service to his \ncountry. Commissioned a second lieutenant in 1961, he ended up 30 years \nlater as Chief of Staff of the U.S. Central Command during Operation \nDesert Shield and Operation Desert Storm.\n  Along the way, General Johnston completed two tours of duty in \nVietnam, where he was decorated for valor in combat. He then went on to \nperform a host of other assignments with great distinction.\n  Mr. President, it is most fitting that Robert Johnston was in the eye \nof the American military hurricane that swept the Iraqi Army from \nKuwait. General Johnston's association with Desert Storm was no mere \ncoincidence. He was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and we know the Scots \nare a fighting people. This is clearly true when they become U.S. \ncitizens and marines. Moreover, General Johnston has more than a few \nitems in common with Scotland's Robert Bruce, later King Robert the \nFirst, who gained Scotland's independence from the English in 1314 by \nhanding them a defeat in battle that Sir Charles Oman, the great \nhistorian of the Middle Ages, called ``the most lamentable defeat which \nan English army ever suffered.'' In the Battle of Bannockburn, which \nwas as cleverly planned as Desert Storm, Robert Bruce, lured an English \narmy half again the size of his own into a well-disguised trap, and \nmanaged to destroy it, inflicting on it four times the number of \ncasualties as his own army suffered.\n  Robert Bruce devoted his life to creating a country; Robert Johnston \nhas devoted his to defending one. Neither Robert is known for self-\npromotion or loquaciousness, which may explain why both names are \nassociated with country, not self.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Marine Corps Reserve Officers \nAssociation for selecting Lieutenant General Johnston to receive this \naward, and I add my congratulations and thanks to Lieutenant General \nJohnston for his outstanding service to our Nation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/31/senate-section/article/S1799-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO KENTUCKY FIRST LADY MILDRED WATKINS CHANDLER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of \nformer Kentucky First Lady Mildred Watkins ``Mama'' Chandler, who \npassed away on January 23 at her home in Versailles.\n  Over the course of her 95 years, Mrs. Chandler's strength of spirit \nand keen intellect were clearly evident in every facet of her life. For \nKentuckians, her legacy begin in 1925 when she wed Mr. Albert B. \nChandler and soon became his most accomplished campaigner and political \nsupporter. The grace of Mrs. Chandler's musical talents and attentive \ndemeanor provided invaluable support to her husband Albert's \ndistinguished service as Kentucky's Governor, U.S. Senator, and \ncommissioner of major league baseball.\n  Politics did not embody her whole life, however. Mrs. Chandler \ndeveloped strong career interests of her own. She taught piano and \nvoice prior to her marriage. During her husband's term in the U.S. \nSenate, she worked as a writer for 20th Century Fox in Hollywood. At \nhome in Kentucky, her award-winning weekly column for the Woodford Sun \nwas enjoyed by many. Above all, she most cherished her time as mother \nand mentor to her children and grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues join me in sending this \nChamber's sincere condolences to the family of Mrs. Mildred Watkins \n``Mama'' Chandler. Kentucky will remember Mrs. Chandler as one of our \nmost beloved first ladies, and I am confident that her breadth of \naccomplishment and strength of character will remain a standard of \nexcellence for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/31/senate-section/article/S1799-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1799-S1800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, the National Voter Registration Act of \n1993, often called the motor-voter bill, was one of the most important \npieces of bipartisan legislation approved by the 103d Congress. \nRecently, several Senators have suggested they intend to try to delay \nfinal implementation of motor-voter, or to repeal it outright. Today a \nhearing was to be held on these issues in the Rules Committee. That \nhearing has now been postponed indefinitely, I hope as an indication of \nwaning enthusiasm for this proposal. We must resist any efforts to \nweaken or to delay final implementation of this landmark measure, which \nis providing access for so many Americans to one of their most \nfundamental rights: the right to vote.\n  Most States have moved forward quickly, responsibly, and effectively \nto implement the motor-voter bill at very low cost, with only a few \nStates resisting. States which have recently implemented the motor-\nvoter provisions have seen tremendous increases in the number of people \nregistering to vote. For example, since the first of the year Florida \nhas been averaging over 3,000 new voter registrations per day from \npeople getting driver's licenses. Approximately 3,700 voters were \nregistered in Washington State in the first week of motor-voter \noperation through the combined use of motor-voter procedures, \nregistration by mail, and agency-based registration. In Georgia, over \n18,000 people have been registered since the new procedures went into \neffect on January 1, 1995. In Kentucky, in the first 10 days of \nimplementation of the act, over 10,000 new voters were registered, and \nover 15,000 changes of address for voters were completed through the \nmotor-voter procedures. Since Minnesota implemented its own motor-voter \nprocess in 1987, our Secretary of State estimates that we have \nregistered over 700,000 voters using those procedures. We must not \nreverse this extraordinary progress, which is allowing many more people \nto participate in our political system.\n  In order to protect the fundamental right to vote of all U.S. \ncitizens regardless of their State of residence, the U.S. Justice \nDepartment has filed suit against three States--California, Illinois, \nand Pennsylvania--which have so far refused to implement the motor-\nvoter procedures. As Attorney General Reno observed in the complaints \nagainst these three States,\n when Congress enacted the motor-voter bill we were exercising our \nconstitutional right to regulate Federal elections under article I, \nsection 4. States cannot simply ignore the direct statutory directives \nof Congress as the Attorney General said just after the law suits were \nfiled:\n\n       Congress has the authority to regulate Federal elections, \n     and it used that authority when it passed the law. We now \n     must use the authority that Congress gave us to enforce it.\n\n  The motor-voter law enacted last year was designed to protect \npotential voters in all States, and not just in States where elected \nofficials choose to obey properly enacted Federal laws. It is in our \nnational interest to ensure access to the voting both for all, whether \nyou live in Minnesota, California, or Alaska.\n  In light of the importance of the Motor-Voter Act, and the support it \nis receiving from around the country, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing editorial appearing in the Washington Post on January 25, \n1995 be reprinted in the Congressional Record, along with the full text \nof my statement.\n  The 1993 National Voter Registration Act was passed with bipartisan \nsupport because many of our colleagues understood how important the \nright to vote is in our society. The motor-voter law is part of a long \nline of landmark protections for the right to vote, starting with the \nadoption of the 15th amendment to the Constitution, through the \nenactment of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and culminating with its \npassage. We must not return to the days when access to the voting \nbooths in our country was limited by serious barriers to registration. \nWe must stand up for the fundamental right to vote. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in opposing any effort to undermine the motor-\nvoter law, or to delay its full implementation.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Why Resist the `Motor Voter' Law?\n\n       On Monday the Justice Department filed suit against \n     California, Illinois and Pennsylvania for refusing to comply \n     with the National Voter Registration Act, popularly known as \n     the ``motor voter law.'' The 1993 law requires that states \n     allow people to register to vote when they get their driver's \n     licenses, when they apply for social service and other \n     government benefits, and by mail. The law was a good idea. \n     Its purpose was to streamline the U.S. voter registration \n     system, which is unusually cumbersome by the standards of \n     most other democracies.\n       What are the arguments being made against the law? A group \n     of Republican governors that includes California's Pete \n     Wilson, who has already sued to have the law overturned, \n     objects on four principal counts: (1) that voter registration \n     is a state responsibility and the federal government has no \n     right to impose prescriptions as specific as those contained \n     in the new law; (2) that the law is another unfunded mandate \n     requiring states to spend their own money to achieve a \n     purpose dictated by Congress; (3) that it is also a ploy by \n     Democrats to strengthen the party's electoral chances, since \n     many of those whom easier registration might add to the voter \n     pool are groups inclined to vote against the GOP; and (4) \n     that the law could facilitate voter fraud.\n       The issue of the power of the federal government on this \n     particular matter will now be settled by the courts, but \n     Attorney General Janet Reno made a plausible point when she \n     argued that ``Congress has the authority to regulate federal \n     elections, and it used that authority when it passed this \n     law.'' As for the mandates argument, it's true that the \n     Congressional Budget Office estimated the new law would have \n     a cost, though less than an average of $1 million in each \n     state annually. This has not bothered most states. On the \n     third point (that the GOP would be hurt and the Democrats \n     helped), the evidence is not so clear. Back in 1989, for \n     example, Newt Gingrich urged his party to support eased voter \n     registration ``not only because it's good policy but also \n     because it's good politics.'' Since young people are \n     disproportionately unregistered and since many in their ranks \n     lean Republican, he said, the party might actually gain from \n     an expanded electorate. Mr. Gingrich is not a fan of this \n     law, but that was a good point. As for fraud, registration at \n     motor vehicle offices and by mail already works fine in many \n     parts of the country, including in the District.\n       Both political parties should want to take their chances \n     with the broadest possible electorate. The governors ought to \n     reconsider.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/31/senate-section/article/S1800-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1800-S1801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 HOMICIDES BY GUNSHOT IN NEW YORK CITY\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to announce to the Senate that \nduring the past week, 14 people were killed with firearms in New York \nCity, bringing this year's total to 58.\n  A recent national study released by the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention indicated that homicide is the second leading cause of \ndeath among teenagers aged 15 to 19. If current nationwide trends \ncontinue, it is estimated that annual deaths from gunshot wounds will \nsurpass annual deaths from automobile accidents by 2003. In New York \nState, as in the District of Columbia and five other States, this has \nalready occurred. In 1992, there were 2,345 gunshot-related deaths in \nNew York State, compared with 1,959 motor vehicle-related deaths.\n  By the middle of the century, we recognized that traffic accidents \nconstituted perhaps the greatest of the Nation's public health \nproblems. So we did something about it. We passed the Motor Vehicle \nSafety Act in 1966 and increased the use of seatbelts, padded \ndashboards, and, more recently, air-bags. As a result, traffic death \nand injury was reduced by 30 percent, even as the number of miles \ndriven by Americans increased dramatically. Estimates suggest that we \nprevented as many as 250,000 deaths.\n  We should apply our experience in reducing traffic fatalities to \nreducing the \n[[Page S1801]] death rate by gunshot. There are certainly ways we could \nachieve this: by establishing stricter requirements for gun ownership, \nby restricting access to the guns used most often to commit crimes, by \nmaking guns themselves safer, and by teaching people to use them \nsafely. However, I propose that we can best reduce the incidence of \nfirearm-related deaths not by restricting the supply of guns, but by \nrestricting the supply of ammunition, particularly those rounds used \ndisproportionately in violent crime. Even if we were able to resolve \nthe intense conflicts surrounding the gun control debate, we would \nstill have enough guns on the street to last us more than a century. \nOur current supply of ammunition, on the other hand, might well last \nonly 3 or 4 years.\n  We must heed the lessons of the past. Clearly we cannot change the \nbehavior of criminals overnight, as we could not change the behavior of \ndrivers. But there are other ways to control the escalating death \nrates. I believe that ammunition control is the best way, and I hope my \ncolleagues will agree.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/31/senate-section/article/S1800-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    FUNDING FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today we find ourselves in the midst of \nan information services technological revolution. At no time in our \nhistory has access to information and information services been more \nimportant. In light of this, I am concerned about recent proposals to \nreduce drastically or to eliminate Federal support for public \nbroadcasting, a primary source of information for millions.\n  As we consider the future of public broadcasting, let us not forget \nthat cable television, which many have suggested can fill the gap, \ncurrently reaches only 60 percent of U.S. households. Forty percent of \nAmerican households do not have cable television primarily because it \nis cost prohibitive or because cable service is simply unavailable in \ntheir communities. While cable television has given millions of \nAmericans remarkable access to information and entertainment, it is not \nan adequate substitute for public broadcasting. Mr. President, \ncurrently on no other network can you find the variety of programming \nwhich public broadcasting offers.\n  Children's programming on public broadcasting provides parents with a \nguaranty of quality without violence. Programs such as ``Ghostwriter,'' \n``Reading Rainbow,'' ``Bill Nye the Science Guy,'' ``Sesame Street,'' \nand ``Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego'' educate and entertain our \nchildren without bombarding them with commercials. In addition, from \n``Wall Street Week With Louis Rukeyser'' to ``MacNeil/Lehrer \nNewsHour,'' from ``Austin City Limits'' to ``Live From Lincoln \nCenter,'' millions of adult Americans turn to public broadcasting for \nexposure to cultural events, news and commentary, documentaries, and \ninstructional programming. Public broadcasting has brought our Nation \nunparalleled historical and political documentaries such as ``Eyes on \nthe Prize'' and ``The Civil War.'' For a little less than $1 per \nAmerican annually, we make an investment in our children and in the \npreservation and dissemination of our culture and our history.\n  I am proud that my own State of Maryland has a State public \nbroadcasting network, Maryland Public Television [MPT], with an \nunequalled commitment to State historical and educational programming. \nMaryland Public Television produces more local documentaries than any \nother local station in the State. Marylanders can study for their GED \nor earn college credit through MPT. MPT has also been one of the \nleaders on the information superhighway. Through its electronic \nclassroom, MPT has made it possible for students to see and talk to \nscientists at the South Pole. MPT is just one example of the many \nsuperb public broadcasting networks across the Nation which, on very \nlimited budgets, manage to serve viewer needs while keeping up with the \ntechnological advancements currently sweeping the telecommunications \nindustry.\n  We have recently heard claims that public broadcasting is elitist. I \nwould suggest, Mr. President, that it is in fact anything but elitist. \nPublic broadcasting is the one network available to Americans \nregardless of where they live or how much money they earn. There are \ncommunities in my State, both rural and urban, in which a public \nbroadcasting station is one of perhaps two or three stations accessible \nwithout cable. In fact I grew up in one of those towns, Salisbury, MD, \nand my mother still resides there. Corporation for Public Broadcasting \n[CPB] statistics show that 48 percent of Americans who listen to \nNational Public Radio [NPR] have household incomes of $40,000 or less \nannually. Public broadcasting is often one of the tools used by rural \nAmerica to attract businesses and residents. The presence of a public \nbroadcasting radio or television station assures prospective businesses \nand residents that they will not be cut off from cultural events and \naccess to news and information.\n  Often when we discuss the future of public broadcasting we talk only \nabout television. We forget the importance of public radio. How will \ncable compensate for the loss of public radio? Nearly 90 percent of all \nAmericans have access to a public radio signal. Public radio provides \nits listeners with local community-oriented programming while also \nlinking them to the Nation and the world. Public Radio International \n[PRI] and National Public Radio [NPR] are the two major distribution \nservices for public radio. PRI's mission of operation is to engage \nlisteners with distinctive radio programs that provide information, \ninsights, and cultural experiences essential to understanding a \ndiverse, interdependent world. PRI distributes to public radio stations \nacross the Nation such widely popular shows as Garrison Keillor's--``A \nPrairie Home Companion'' and the ``Baltimore Symphony Orchestra,'' \njointly produced by WJHU of Baltimore and WETA in Washington, DC. NPR \nis known nationwide for producing outstanding programs such as ``All \nThings Considered'' and ``Morning Edition.'' Individual public radio \nstations can be affiliates of both PRI and NPR. This assures public \nradio stations of access to the broadest possible range of programming \nregardless of their location.\n  Many public radio stations serve rural communities which would \notherwise be entirely without radio service. Over 90 percent of public \nradio's share of public broadcasting funds goes directly to local \nstations serving local communities. These radio stations respond \ndirectly to the needs and wants of their communities. Many of these \ncommunities and ethnically disparate, therefore requiring a commitment \nto diverse programming. Commercial radio has declared many of these \nareas commercially inviable. These communities are often too small and \ntoo far flung to support stations on their own. In my own State of \nMaryland, public radio stations such as WESM on the Eastern Shore play \nan important role in supporting the goals of education, literacy, \nvolunteerism, and in working to combat youth violence. Are we now \nprepared to tell these communities that at a cost of 29 cents per \ntaxpayer, the Federal Government is also declaring them unworthy of \nradio access to news, information, and entertainment?\n  Mr. President, throughout its history public broadcasting has set the \nstandard against which we have measured the quality of commercial \nprogramming, and with the advent of the information superhighway public \nbroadcasting is needed now more than ever. Millions of Americans will \nfind themselves on byroads instead of the superhighway without public \nbroadcasting. In my view, we should protect the access of all Americans \nto reliable educational programming and quality entertainment. I look \nforward to working with all of my colleagues in affirming the \ncontributions of public broadcasting to our society and in ensuring \nthat public broadcasting continues to enhance our lives and enlighten \nour minds.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/31/senate-section/article/S1801-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1801-S1802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO FRANK E. RODGERS\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mayor \nFrank E. Rodgers, who may well have set a record that will stand \nforever as the longest serving mayor in the history of the United \nStates.\n  Mayor Rodgers has 58 years of experience in public service. He served \nfor 48 years as the mayor of Harrison, NJ. \n[[Page S1802]] That set the record for the longest successive tenure as \na mayor in the history of the United States.\n  That would be impressive enough by itself. But even while he was \nserving as mayor, Frank Rodgers also found the time to hold several \nother pubic service appointments. He served as secretary to the New \nJersey Racing Commission between 1963 and 1964. He served as clerk to \nthe Board of Chosen Freeholders of Hudson County from 1964 to 1982. And \nhe served as a member of the New Jersey Highway Authority from 1976 to \n1978.\n  In 1978, he was elected to the New Jersey State Senate where he \nserved until 1983. And from 1984 to 1994, Mayor Rodgers served as a \ncommissioner of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.\n  Mr. President, who could help but be in awe of this committed public \nservant? Who could help but wonder how he stayed so popular for so \nlong?\n  The answer is actually quite simple.\n  Mayor Rodgers has devoted his life to the people of New Jersey. He \nhas doggedly pursued our vital interests, although in the time he \nserved as mayor, those interests have changed dramatically.\n  When Mayor Rodgers was first elected in 1946, America had just won \nWorld War II. Mayor Rodgers was swept into office on a veteran's \nticket, and he focused, in his first term, on post-war concerns.\n  Over the years, Mayor Rodgers continued to respond to the needs of \nhis constituents, whether they were young or old, veterans or new \nimmigrants.\n  More recently, he has proved adept at tackling more contemporary \nissues, including transportation, crime, and economic development.\n  Mr. President, I believe that we can all learn a great lesson from \nMayor Rodgers, a gracious statesman who faced Harrison voters 29 times \nwithout a defeat.\n  Over the last five decades, Mayor Rodgers has developed a close \nworking relationship with the people of Harrison. He did so by \nlistening to their concerns, responding to their needs, and always \nsticking to his word.\n  Those are characteristics that all of us, in the private and public \nsectors, could learn a lot from.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/31/senate-section/article/S1801-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1802-S1803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF ROSE KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to honor the memory of a woman and a \nmother from Massachusetts. Not just any woman, not just any mother, but \na most extraordinary example of both.\n  Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy's long life will be remembered by a grateful \nNation as a legacy of parental strength and family leadership.\n  To those of us who remember images of her campaigning with her sons, \nor mourning in quiet dignity, she shall always reflect a moment in time \nwhen we believed in ourselves, in our families, in our faith, and in \nour ability to survive.\n  She lived through incredible victories and wrenching tragedies, but \nthrough it all her resolve, her deep religious devotion, and her \nprofound belief in family and community, gave this Nation a vision of \nwho we could be.\n  To my generation she defined faith, courage, and dignity, and once \nsaid, ``A mother should be a bulwark of strength.'' And in her \ncourageous response to sorrow, and in her reflections on how good life \ncan be, and on how lucky we are, she was that bulwark of strength for \nall of us.\n  During good times and bad times that touched the hearts and lives of \nevery American, we looked to her for guidance and for a mother's \nperspective, and she gave us both.\n  She set a standard of parental leadership that will live long after \nthose of us lucky enough to have shared God's Earth with her are gone.\n  I remember being invited to Hyannis, and meeting Rose Kennedy for the \nfirst time. And I remember being moved by her intensity and concern, by \na warmth and graciousness that recalled a proud time when our belief in \nourselves demanded that we accept what God has bestowed upon us, and \nthat we bare the burden and share the bounty.\n  Rose Kennedy was an extraordinary woman and mother. Now it is time we \npay tribute to her for what she sacrificed for service to the \ncommunity.\n  Mr. President, I know I speak for every member of this institution \nand for the people of Massachusetts in offering my deepest and most \nsincere condolences to my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, and the entire Kennedy family.\n  I say to Senator Kennedy and to his family that we will always \nremember Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, and that we are a better people for \nhaving had her among us for over a century.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the eulogy delivered by \nthe senior Senator from Massachusetts be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the eulogy was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                   Tribute to Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy\n\n       On my office wall, there is a note from Mother, reacting to \n     a comment I once made in an interview. ``Dear Teddy,'' she \n     wrote in the note, ``I just saw a story in which you said: \n     `If I was President * * *'. You should have said, `If I were \n     President * * *', which is correct because it is a condition \n     contrary to fact.''\n       Mother always thought her children should strive for the \n     highest place. But inside the family, with love and laughter, \n     she knew how to put each of us in our place. She was \n     ambitious not only for our success, but for our souls. From \n     our youth, we remember how, with effortless ease, she could \n     bandage a cut, dry a tear, recite, from memory the ``The \n     Midnight Ride of Paul Revere,'' and spot a hole in a sock \n     from a hundred yards away.\n       She sustained us in the saddest times--by her faith in God, \n     which was the greatest gift she gave us--and by the strength \n     of her character, which was a combination of the sweetest \n     gentleness and the most tempered steel.\n       She was indomitable for all her days. Each summer for many \n     years, we would gather `round at night, and sitting at the \n     piano, Mother would play ``Sweet Rosie O'Grady,'' the song \n     that became her own special ballad:\n\n     Just around the corner of the\n       street where I reside,\n     There lives the cutest little girl\n       that I have ever spied.\n     Her name is Rosie O'Grady,\n       and I don't mind telling you,\n     That she's the sweetest little Rose\n       the garden ever grew.\n     I love sweet Rosie O'Grady,\n       and Rosie O'Grady loves me.\n\n       When she finished, her voice would lilt, and her eyes would \n     flash, and she would ask if we would like to hear it one more \n     time. And we always would.\n       All her life, Mother also loved learning, and she was an \n     excellent student herself. We still have her report card from \n     Dorchester High School. In her 3 years there, she received 71 \n     A's, 22 B's, and 1 C. I asked her about that C, which was in \n     geometry. She said there must be some mistake. She didn't \n     remember anything but A's.\n       One spring some years ago, when she was in her nineties, I \n     took her on Good Friday to the Three Hours devotion. But the \n     nurse warned me in advance that Mother had to eat, so we \n     would have to leave after only an hour.\n       At one o'clock, I whispered: ``Mother, it's time to go.'' \n     She looked at me and sternly said: ``Not yet, Teddy.'' So I \n     asked a second time, and her answer came in a tone that was \n     distinctly not a whisper: ``Teddy, the service is not over \n     yet.''\n       By now, the congregation was discreetly staring at us and \n     clearly thinking: See, he's trying to get out of Church \n     early, but that sainted Mother of his--isn't she wonderful?--\n     just won't let him.\n       Later that night, of course, Mother and I said the Rosary, \n     as she did every night, by herself or with any of her \n     children or grandchildren who happened to be home. In the \n     Kennedy family, you learned the glorious Mysteries at an \n     early age.\n       You learned just as early how to catch a pass, sail a boat \n     or serve a tennis ball. All her life, Mother was interested \n     in our games. The summer she turned 101, I went into her room \n     and showed her my tennis racket. She said, ``Are you sure \n     that's your racket, Teddy? I've been looking all over the \n     house for mine.''\n       Jack once called her the glue that held the family \n     together. We learned a special bond of loyalty and affection, \n     which all of us first came to know in the deep and abiding \n     love that Mother shared with Dad for 57 years.\n       From both of them together, we inherited a spirit that kept \n     all their children close to each other and to them. Whatever \n     any of us has done--whatever contribution we have made--\n     begins and ends with Rose and Joseph Kennedy. For all of us, \n     Dad was the spark, and Mother was the light of our lives. He \n     was our greatest fan; she was our greatest teacher.\n       She was born in 1890, the year of the Battle of Wounded \n     Knee, when Benjamin Harrison was in the White House. And she \n     never let us forget that she had lived so much of the history \n     that we only read about. Our dinner table was her classroom, \n     and the subject was the whole world of human events.\n       One evening early in 1984, when mother was 93, she asked if \n     we thought President Reagan would run again. One of our \n     guests \n     [[Page S1803]] replied, ``Of course he'll run, Mrs. Kennedy. \n     After all, he's very young. He's only 73.'' Mother looked at \n     the guest for a second and then answered him with a twinkle \n     in her voice: ``You're just trying to flatter me. I know that \n     he's the oldest President in American history.'' Unless it \n     came from her, there was no blarney when Mother was around.\n       So what now secures for Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy the high \n     place in history that she will have? I think it is most of \n     all the warm place she holds in the hearts of so many people \n     everywhere, from Boston to Dublin, from Berlin to New Delhi \n     to Buenos Aires. Millions who never met her sensed the kind \n     of rare and wondrous person she was, a shining example of the \n     faith that sustained her through even the hardest sorrow. She \n     had an inner strength that radiated from her life. She was a \n     symbol of family in this country and around the world.\n       She cared for a retarded child as much as for the most \n     powerful statesman. She truly did believe that we are all, \n     royalty and disability alike, created in the image and \n     likeness of God.\n       She was the granddaughter of immigrants who saw her father \n     become the first Irish-Catholic Congressman from Boston, and \n     her son and grandson succeed him. She saw three sons serve in \n     the Senate--actually she was sure that it was her campaigning \n     that put us there--and we all thought that as usual she was \n     right. She saw the son who proudly carried her Fitzgerald \n     name become the first Irish-Catholic President of the United \n     States.\n       And she was just as proud to see a new generation of her \n     family carrying on her belief in public service.\n       But Mother also taught us that you do not have to run for \n     office to make a difference. She was equally proud of her \n     daughters and the contributions they have made. Jean--the \n     founder of Very Special Arts and now, like our father before \n     her, the Ambassador. Pat, for the pioneering support she has \n     given to young writers. Eunice, founder of Special Olympics \n     and the leader of a global revolution of human rights for the \n     retarded and disabled.\n       And Mother had a special place in her heart and prayers for \n     our sister Rosemary, for her bravery and the things she \n     taught us all.\n       Mother gave not only to her children, but she gave her \n     children, fired with her own faith, to serve the Nation and \n     the earth. To us, she was the most beautiful Rose of all the \n     roses in the world. Her life shows us the truth and the way.\n       Mother knew this day was coming, but she did not dread it. \n     She accepted and even welcomed it, not as a leaving, but as a \n     returning. She has gone to God. She is home. And at this \n     moment she is happily presiding at a heavenly table with both \n     of her Joes, with Jack and Kathleen, with Bobby and David.\n       And as she did all our lives, whether it was when I walked \n     back through the rain from school as a child, or when a \n     President who was her son came back to Hyannis Port, she will \n     be there ready to welcome the rest of us home someday. Of \n     this I have no doubt, for as they were from the beginning, \n     Mother's prayers will continue to be more than enough to \n     bring us through.\n       Not long ago, I found a beautiful poem that symbolizes what \n     all of us feel today. Its title is ``The Rose Still Grows \n     Beyond the Wall:''\n\n     Near a shady wall a rose once grew,\n       Budded and blossomed in God's free light,\n     Watered and fed by morning dew,\n       Shedding its sweetness day and night.\n\n     As it grew and blossomed fair and tall,\n       Slowly rising to loftier height,\n     It came to a crevice in the wall,\n       Through which there shone a beam of light.\n\n     Onward it crept with added strength,\n       With never a thought of fear or pride.\n     It followed the light through the crevice's length\n       And unfolded itself on the other side.\n     The light, the dew, the broadening view\n       Were found the same as they were before;\n     And it lost itself in beauties new,\n       Breathing its fragrance more and more.\n\n     Shall claim of death cause us to grieve,\n       And make our courage faint or fail?\n     Nay! Let us faith and hope receive;\n       The rose still grows beyond the wall,\n\n     Scattering fragrance far and wide,\n       Just as it did in days of yore,\n     Just as it did on the other side,\n       Just as it will for evermore.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/31/senate-section/article/S1802-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 THE BIOMATERIALS ACCESS ASSURANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be the primary cosponsor \nof the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act of 1995 to ensure the \navailability of raw materials and component parts for implantable \nmedical devices. This bill, which we introduced as S. 2215 last year, \nis necessary for Americans to have continued access to a wide variety \nof life-saving devices, such as brain shunts, heart valves, artificial \nblood vessels, and pacemakers.\n  Currently, the manufacturers and suppliers of materials used in \nimplantable medical devices are subject to substantial legal costs and \npossibly liability for selling small amounts of materials to medical \ndevice manufacturers. These sales generate relatively small profits and \nare often used for purposes beyond their direct control. Consequently, \nsome of the manufacturers and suppliers of these materials are now \nrefusing to provide them for use in medical devices.\n  It is absolutely essential that a continued supply of raw materials \nand component parts is available for the invention, development, \nimprovement, and maintenance of medical devices. Most of these devices \nare made with materials and parts that are not designed or manufactured \nspecifically for use in implantable devices. Their primary use is in \nnon-medical products. Medical device manufacturers use only small \nquantities of these raw materials and component parts, and this market \nconstitutes a small portion of the overall market for such raw \nmaterials.\n  While raw materials and component parts suppliers do not design, \nproduce or test the final medical implant, they have been sued in cases \nalleging inadequate design and testing of, or warnings related to use \nof, permanently implanted medical devices. The cost of defending these \nsuits often exceeds the profits generated by the sale of materials. \nThis is the reason that some manufacturers and suppliers have begun to \ncease supplying their products for use in permanently implanted medical \ndevices.\n  Unless alternative sources of supply can be found, the unavailability \nof raw materials and component parts will lead to unavailability of \nlife-saving and life-enhancing medical devices. The prospects for \ndevelopment of new sources of supply for the full range of threatened \nraw materials and component parts are remote, as other suppliers around \nthe world are refusing to sell raw materials or component parts for use \nin manufacturing permanently implantable medical devices in the United \nStates.\n  The legal concerns that are causing the unavailability of raw \nmaterials and component parts for medical implants are part of a larger \nproduct liability crisis in this country. Immediate action is necessary \nto ensure the availability of such materials and parts for medical \ndevices so that Americans have access to the devices they need. \nAddressing this problem will solve one important aspect of our broken \nmedical product liability system.\n  This issue initially came to my attention when I was contacted by one \nof my constituents, Linda Flake Ransom, about her 7-year-old daughter, \nTara, who requires a silicon brain shunt. Without a shunt, due to \nTara's condition called hydrocephalus, excess fluid would build up in \nher brain, increasing pressure, and causing permanent brain damage, \nblindness, paralysis, and ultimately death. With the shunt, she is a \nhealthy, happy, and productive straight-A student with enormous promise \nand potential.\n  Tara has already undergone the brain shunt procedure five times in \nher brief life. However, the next time that she needs to replace her \nshunt, it is not certain that a new one will be available due to the \nunavailability of shunt materials. This situation is a sad example of a \nmedical liability system that is out of control. It is tragic, but not \nsurprising that manufacturers have decided not to provide materials if \nthey are subject to tens of millions of dollars of potential liability \nfor doing so.\n  It is essential that individuals such as Tara continue to have access \nto the medical devices they need to stay alive and healthy. Enacting \nthe Biomaterials Access Assurance Act of 1995 \nwould help to ensure the ongoing availability of materials necessary to \nmake these devices. It would not, in any way, protect negligent \nmanufacturers or suppliers of medical devices, or even manufacturers or \nsuppliers of biomaterials that make negligent claims about their \nproducts. However, it would protect manufacturers and suppliers whose \nmaterials are being used in a manner that is beyond their control.\n  Mr. President, we must act quickly to pass the bill to ensure that \nthe lives of Tara and thousands of other Americans are not jeopardized.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/31/senate-section/article/S1803-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1803-S1804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      LBJ AND THE BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to include in the Record an \narticle by Jack Valenti that appeared \n[[Page S1804]] in the Los Angeles Times on Jan. 20 on the Presidency of \nLyndon B. Johnson.\n  Mr. Valenti enumerates many of President Johnson's accomplishments, \nincluding his fight for civil rights and voting rights for all \nAmericans, the initiation of the Medicare and Head Start programs and \nthe passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which helps \nprovide Federal loans, scholarships, and grants to all American college \nstudents.\n  Indeed, President Johnson's accomplishments are many. And I would \nemphasize one more, which no President since has matched. Lyndon \nJohnson not only balanced the Federal budget, but gave Richard Nixon a \nsurplus. In this era of a $4.8 trillion debt, that is one heck of an \naccomplishment.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to read this article and ask that \nit be printed in its entirety in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Jan. 20, 1995]\n\n                 Recalling a Man Who Stayed the Course\n\n                           (By Jack Valenti)\n\n       On this day 30 years ago, Lyndon B. Johnson was inaugurated \n     in his own right as the 36th President of the United States. \n     He had been elected President the previous November in a \n     landslide of public favor, with the largest percentage of \n     votes in this century, matched by no other victorious \n     President in the ensuing years. This day plus two is also the \n     22nd anniversary of his death.\n       Is it odd or is it merely the lament of one who served him \n     as best I could that his presidency and his passing find only \n     casual regard on this day?\n       He was the greatest parliamentary commander of his era. He \n     came to the presidency with a fixed compass course about \n     where he wanted to take the nation, and unshakable \n     convictions about what he wanted to do to lift the quality of \n     life. Against opposing forces in and outside his own party, \n     in conflict with those who thought he had no right to be \n     President, contradicting conventional wisdom and political \n     polls, he never hesitated, never flagged, never changed \n     course. He was a professional who knew every nook and cranny \n     of the arena, and when he was in full throttle, he was \n     virtually unstoppable.\n       He defined swiftly who he was and what he was about. He \n     said that he was going to pass a civil-rights bill and a \n     voting-rights bill because, as he declared, ``every citizen \n     ought to have the right to live his own life without fear, \n     and every citizen ought to have the right to vote and when \n     you got the vote, you have political power, and when you have \n     political power, folks listen to you.'' He promptly told his \n     longtime Southern congressional friends that though he loved \n     them, they had best get out of his way or he would run them \n     down. He was going to pass those civil-rights bills. And he \n     did.\n       He made it clear that he was no longer going to tolerate \n     ``a little old lady being turned away from a hospital because \n     she had no money to pay the bill. By God, that's never going \n     to happen again.'' He determined to pass what he called \n     ``Harry Truman's medical-insurance bill.'' And he did. It was \n     called Medicare.\n       He railed against the absence of education in too many of \n     America's young. He stood on public rostrums and shouted. \n     ``We're going to make it possible for every boy and girl in \n     America, no matter how poor, no matter their race or \n     religion, no matter what remote corner of the country they \n     live in, to get all the education they can take, by federal \n     loan, scholarship or grant,'' And he passed the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act.\n       He was in a raging passion to destroy poverty in the land. \n     He waged his own ``War on Poverty,'' giving birth to Head \n     Start and a legion of other programs to stir the poor, to \n     ignite their hopes and raise their sights. Some of the \n     programs worked. Some didn't. But he said over and over \n     again, ``If you don't risk, you never rise.''\n       He often said that no President can lay claim to greatness \n     unless he presides over a robust economy. And so he courted, \n     shamelessly, the business, banking and industrial proconsuls \n     of the nation and made them believe what he said. And the \n     economy prospered.\n       On the first night of his presidency, he ruminated about \n     the awesome task ahead. But there was on the horizon that \n     night only a thin smudge of a line that was Vietnam. In time, \n     like a relentless cancer curling about the soul of a nation, \n     Vietnam infected his presidency.\n       If there had not been 16,000 American soldiers in Vietnam \n     when he took office, would he have sent troops there? I don't \n     believe he would have. But who really knows? What I do know \n     is that he grieved, a deep-down sorrow, that he could not \n     find ``an honorable way out'' other than ``hauling ass out of \n     there.''\n       I think that grieving cut his life short. Every President \n     will testify that when he has to send young men into battle \n     and the casualties begin to mount, it's like drinking \n     carbolic acid every morning.\n       But it was all a long time ago. To many young people not \n     born when L.B.J. died, he is a remote, distant figure coated \n     with the fungus of Vietnam. They view him, if at all, \n     dispiritedly.\n       But to others, to paraphrase Ralph Ellison, because of \n     Vietnam, L.B.J. will just have to settle for being the \n     greatest American President for the undereducated young, the \n     poor and the old, the sick and the black. But perhaps that's \n     not too bad an epitaph on this day so far away from where he \n     lived.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/31/senate-section/article/S1803-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       COMMENDING TOMAS JICINSKY\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

I rise today to join with my good friend, the Senator \nfrom Arizona, Senator McCain, to discuss the measure we recently \nintroduced, the Emergency Spending Control Act of 1995.\n  I want to just first relate how Senator McCain and I came to work \ntogether on this.\n  After the election, of course, the results were not particularly \nhappy for those of us in the minority party at this point, but the \nSenator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], even though he is now in the \nmajority, was kind enough to call and say he wanted to work together on \na number of reform items during the 104th Congress and that he wanted \nto do so on a bipartisan basis.\n  We talked about the revolving door issue, the issue of Members of \nCongress and staff leaving this institution and going to work for some \nof the interests that they have worked with and regulated in the past. \nWe talked about the gift ban legislation. We also talked about the \nissue of what happens sometimes when we have a piece of emergency \nspending, a disaster bill, that comes before us and sometimes things \nare added to those bills that have very little to do with the disaster \nand sometimes have very little at all to do with what is being \naddressed.\n  So the Senator from Arizona and I decided to join together and \nintroduce a piece of legislation that would limit the abuse of the \nemergency legislation. I am happy to say we also have some good \nbipartisan support in the form of cosponsorship by the Senator from \nKansas [Mrs. Kassebaum]; the Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein]; \nand the Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell].\n  The goal of our bill is simple. It is to limit the consideration of \nnonemergency matters in emergency legislation.\n  Mr. President, I think this is the right time for this legislation \nfor many reasons but especially for two. The first is, of course, that \nonce again we have the tragic reality of yet another disaster in this \ncountry, in particular in the State of California. This time it is \nfloods, and there is a possibility of another bill arising out of the \nsympathy and concern and need to help the people of California.\n  Let me be clear. Even though this legislation is about preventing \nabuses on these disaster bills, my feelings and concerns for those who \nhave suffered from that disaster are very real, and I know that is true \nof the Senator from Arizona and everyone who is involved in this \nlegislation.\n   [[Page S1805]] This follows after bills that have had to do with \nCalifornia earthquakes, floods in the Midwest, hurricanes, fires, \ndroughts, you name it. We have had a terrible rash of these disasters \nin this country so there could, unfortunately, be more vehicles coming \nthrough the Congress that would allow the attachment of extraneous \nmatter to this must-pass type of legislation.\n  So that is one reason. The other is, this is a very good time to \nbring this up because what we are discussing here in the Chamber, is \nthe balanced budget amendment, the fact that we have got to find a way, \nwhether we agree with the balanced budget amendment or not we have got \nto find a way to clean up our budget process here. And the balanced \nbudget amendment is one approach. There are other examples of where the \nAmerican people have seen what they believe to be an abuse of process, \nthe insertion of pork items into pieces of legislation. That means \nmoney being spent that probably would not have been approved by the \nmajority of Members if they were subjected to a separate vote and held \nup to the plain light of day.\n  So I think it is very important, in looking at the need to achieve a \nbalanced budget and ways to do this, we find a way to stop this \npractice of funding some of these questionable items. Whether it be the \nLawrence Welk thing or the tea-tasting board, these are the things \nthat, even though they might not amount to a whole lot of money, stick \nin the craw of the American people as symbols of perhaps a fear that \nthe folks out here are not always keeping their eye on the ball and \nworrying about the tax dollars they have to work so hard to raise and \nsend to the Federal Government.\n  It is these types of things that wind up on the prime time type of \nshows, these types of things that cause other pieces of legislation \nthat would otherwise be worthy types of legislation to get names like \n``Christmas trees'' or ``gravy train,'' and this becomes particularly \nunpleasant when the purpose of legislation is to show the compassion of \nthe Federal Government, in particular the American people, for those \nwho have suffered horrible unnatural disasters in their States.\n  So these are good reasons to bring this legislation forward at this \ntime. The provisions of the bill limit emergency spending solely to \nemergencies by establishing a new point of order. The point of order \nlies against nonemergency matters if they are not rescissions of budget \nauthority or reductions in direct spending. A point of order would \napply to any emergency bill that contains a non-emergency measure or \nany amendment to an emergency measure or a conference report that adds \nnonemergency matters to the emergency measure.\n  Mr. President, there are also additional enforcement mechanisms. We \nprohibit the Office of Management and Budget from adjusting the caps on \ndiscretionary spending or from adjusting the sequester process for \ndirect spending for any emergency appropriations bill if that bill \nincludes the type of extraneous items that we have been discussing.\n  Mr. President, those are the main provisions of the Emergency \nSpending Act. I think they are timely also because of the progress that \nhas been made in the last couple of years in reducing the Federal \ndeficit by almost half, by almost $100 billion. It is encouraging but \nunfinished progress that has been made that has come from a willingness \nto identify and follow through on making specific spending cuts and \ncertain revenue increases. I realize that simply creating a point of \norder is not going to be sufficient to help us make the hard choices \nout here that we have to make in order to balance the budget. I would \nsay, though, Mr. President, that those points of order and the other \nrules we have and the rules that we have imposed upon ourselves in \nterms of caps are some of the effective things that buttress the \nefforts to identify specific spending cuts.\n  In terms of the progress in the last 2 years, I think we can very \nhonestly say that we made a downpayment on reducing the Federal \ndeficit, but we have a lot more ground to cover. The rules do help stop \nit, but no particular procedure, statute or even a constitutional \namendment can replace specific policy action, making the hard choices \nthat we must. I think this new point of order can assist us, at least, \nwhen it comes to emergency legislation.\n  The reason I rise on this issue and on this particular bill is that \nit is these exceptions that cause the people to feel we are not serious \nabout everything we do here.\n  I am also worried that if we do not go forward with cleaning up the \nprocess by which emergency legislation is considered, in the end it is \npossible people will not look kindly on the idea of having emergency \nlegislation at all--just let people fend for themselves in these places \nif there is a possibility this will be used to circumvent the fiscal \ndiscipline that is needed.\n  What I do suggest is emergency legislation that has to recognize the \nurgency but not allow the circumventing of the normal budget process. \nThere are two ways that this process has been circumvented in the past. \nOne way is to declare something an emergency and then have it attached \nto the emergency bill. That is possible. You do not have to have it be \nthe same set of circumstances or the same natural disaster. If an \nemergency designation is made, these bills can be put together. The \nother possibility is the adding of explicit nonemergency items to \nemergency legislation to get expedited consideration.\n  Mr. President, our bill does not take care of the first problem. It \ndoes not take care of the problem where somebody has actually declared \nan emergency that may not, in fact, be a real emergency. And I think \nthat is something we have to look at in the future.\n  Last year, on the California earthquake bill, I recall the Department \nof Defense managed to call an emergency a $1.2 million expenditure that \nwas supposed to be for peacekeeping operations, ongoing, continuing \npeacekeeping operations that we knew about for the operations in \nSomalia, Bosnia, Iraq, and Haiti. Unfortunately, in my view, that was \ndesignated an emergency and suddenly attached to the California \nearthquake bill. And even though I tried to stop it with an amendment, \nthat amendment was rejected, in part, out of fear that somehow this \nwould derail the California earthquake bill. So I think this is a \nproblem. I think it needs to be addressed. But at this point the \nproblem that I think we can actually address correctly is to establish \nnew rules when it comes to attaching specifically nonemergency items to \nemergency legislation.\n  Mr. President, let us look at the California earthquake bill. What \nwas it originally set up to do? Well, it had $7.8 billion for the L.A. \nearthquake. It had $1.2 billion for the peacekeeping missions which I \njust mentioned and which I think should not have been in there. It had \n$436 million for the Midwest floods and $315 million as a result of the \ncontinuing problems from the 1989 California earthquake.\n  Mr. President, that was the status as the bill came into the \nCongress. But by the time it left, these additional extraneous items \nhad been tossed on to the California earthquake bill: A $1.4 million \nexpenditure to fight potato fungus, a $2.3 million item to give the FDA \npeople pay raises, $14.4 million for the National Park Service, $12.4 \nmillion for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, $10 million for a new Amtrak \nstation in New York, $20 million for a fingerprinting lab, $500,000 for \nthe U.S. Trade Representative's travel office, and finally $5.2 million \nfor the Bureau of Public Debt.\n  All of this was thrown onto and became part of the gravy train pulled \nby the California earthquake bill. Under current law, if these \nnonemergency items are on a bill and they are still under the spending \ncaps, then the legislation can go forward. And that is exactly what \nhappened. In the case of the California earthquake bill, the caps had \nactually been reached but the rescissions had been used, a group of \nrescissions had been used essentially to offset the cost of these \nadditional items. That, I suppose you could say, is paying for what you \nwant to do.\n  But, the fact is, those rescissions could have been much better used \nto reduce our Federal deficit, to do a little bit about the problem we \nare going to be talking about so much here in the next couple of weeks \non the floor of the Senate. How do we specifically find ways to \neliminate the Federal deficit? So this process was an unfortunate one. \n[[Page S1806]] These items, of course, could have been considered \nseparately in an appropriate appropriations bill and in a more honest \nand direct manner.\n  So this issue of emergency spending and preventing nonemergency items \nfrom being attached to emergency spending is part and parcel of the \noverall goal of budgetary sanity and the goal of stopping the abuse \nthat so many Americans like to call putting pork into bills.\n  I think it could also help make sure that our bills that have to do \nwith disasters have some credibility as they go through the process. \nThey should not be the subject of laughter or derision or prime time \nshows. The disaster bills should be the expressions of the American \npeople's compassion for those who have been unlucky and subject to \ndisasters that they had nothing to do with creating.\n  This identical legislation passed the House, the other House, last \nsession, the 103d Congress, on a bipartisan vote as a substitute \namendment, 322 to 99, and then finally, as amended, 406 to 6.\n  I now urge my colleagues to join me and the Senator from Arizona, in \nsupporting this measure. As we engage in this very intense debate on \nthe balanced budget amendment, let us at least join together on a \nbipartisan basis to get rid of the abuses that have to do with \nemergency legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nan editorial from The Washington Post dated August 22, 1994, on this \ntype of legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. --\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Point of order regarding emergencies.''.\n\n                                                                    ____\n               [From the Washington Post, Aug. 22, 1994]\n\n                            Emergencies Only\n\n       The House voted 322 to 99 the other day in favor of a new \n     budget rule that's a good idea. The Senate should concur in \n     it. If not, the House leadership should find some other way \n     of putting it into effect, for Congress's own good.\n       The revolutionary notion is that emergency appropriations \n     bills should be limited to * * *  emergencies. There tends to \n     be at least one of these bills almost every year. They are \n     used not just to provide emergency funds, but often as \n     vehicles for funding lesser projects of a much more ordinary \n     kind. What better place for a little something for the folks \n     back home than in the fine print of a bill intended to rescue \n     a region from a natural disaster? Who would sink so low as to \n     complain about a minor extra favor in a bill with as generous \n     a purpose as that?\n       The emergencies-only rule--no hitchhikers in the \n     ambulance--is one of a series that have been proposed by \n     Reps. Charles Stenholm, Tim Penny and John Kasich to tighten \n     up the budget process. We've opposed some of the other \n     changes. This one is called for.\n       For the sake of the spending that matters, Congress ought \n     to learn to lay off the pork. You see the bad effects of \n     doing otherwise, of lapsing into self-indulgence, all the \n     time. The crime bill is only the latest example of a measure \n     in which critics have been able to use questionable spending \n     to tar and hold up constructive spending as well.\n       In fact, the amount of pork in the budget each year is \n     greatly exaggerated--and of course what seems to one man to \n     be pork may genuinely seem to another to be spending for an \n     essential public purpose. There's no magic line. But there is \n     some line--and some things seem to be pretty clearly on the \n     porky side of it. Those are the things that people remember, \n     the indefensible examples that come to typify all spending. \n     If only they'd cut out the pork, the public is led to \n     believe, there wouldn't be a deficit. It isn't true, and some \n     of the greatest critics of pork are also among the greatest \n     porkers on the side--but that doesn't matter.\n       The spenders ought to clean up their act. In this case, the \n     anti-spenders are helping to point the way. The leadership \n     should disarm them by doing as they suggest. Emergencies-only \n     in emergency bills makes sense.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/31/senate-section/article/S1804-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of House Joint Resolution 1, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 1) proposing a balanced \n     budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the joint resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the Senator from \nVermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are now, really, beginning debate on the \nproposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n  I think before we propose to alter our fundamental charter of \nfreedom, in fact, the blueprint for our representative democracy, I \nbelieve that we need to each step back from the political passions of \nthe moment. We are debating a constitutional amendment, not just a \npolitical slogan or plank of a campaign platform or partisan win or \nloss or something that is supposed to fit on a bumper sticker. This is \nthe Constitution. This is the bedrock of 200 years of the greatest \ndemocracy history has ever known. This is the standard set for the most \npowerful Nation on earth, the most powerful democracy ever imagined in \nhistory.\n  And even though we have very, very carefully amended this \nConstitution over the past 200 years--rarely amending, because we know \nthat our whole democracy is built on it--suddenly the floodgates open. \nWe have in the first 3 weeks of this new Congress 75 proposed \namendments to the Constitution--75 proposed amendments. Can you imagine \nwhat the Founders of this country would think if they actually thought \nthat in 1 year 75 proposed amendments would be here? Seventy-five.\n  The Founders of our country assumed that maybe once every several \ngenerations there might be some huge matter so necessary to amend the \nConstitution. Nobody ever assumed 75 proposals would come rushing in.\n  The House has passed one. It is not the extreme version supported by \nthe House Republican leadership, but they still passed one. The Senate \nJudiciary Committee sent a companion measure to the full Senate for \nconsideration.\n  Indeed, we have a backlog of proposed constitutional amendments in \nthe Judiciary Committee. After a single day's hearing, we have two \nconstitutional amendments to limit congressional terms on the \ncommittee's next agenda. There was also a hearing on another important \ntopic, line-item veto, on which are pending four more constitutional \namendments.\n  The proposals for constitutional amendments already introduced in \nthis \n[[Page S1807]] Congress range from the so-called balanced budget \namendments--incidentally, there are at least three Senate versions, six \nversions considered by the House--to congressional term limit \namendments, line-item veto amendments, school prayer amendments, \nretroactive tax amendments, and we are about to receive a proposed \namendment to the first amendment regarding the American flag.\n  I have not seen an amendment to rewrite the taking clause of the \nfifth amendment, but when you look at the revised name of the \nsubcommittee, the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Federalism and \nProperty Rights, you have to assume it is not far away.\n  Some of these constitutional amendments call for proposed \nratification through the State legislatures, but others demand a \nconstitutional convention be convened.\n  There is a feeling, I guess, that we can do far better by convening \none than those who wrote the original Constitution--Madison, Hamilton, \nFranklin, Morris, and Washington--that we can now do much better. They \ndid not have the advantage of radio talk shows, I guess, or multi-\nmillion-dollar political consultants.\n  I have to ask, with a new majority in both the House and the Senate, \nwhat are their plans for rewriting our Constitution? Why the sudden \nneed to change our 200-year Constitution? Do they want to have a host \nof constitutional amendments come forward or one, two, or five or six? \nEnough.\n  The Constitution is a good document. It is not a sacred text, but it \nis as good a law as has been written. That is why it survived as the \nsupreme law of this land for over 200 years with few alterations. It is \nbinding us together rather than tearing us apart.\n  Look at the great compromise in the Constitution that allowed small \nStates and large States to join together in a spirit of mutual \naccommodation and respect, an amazing step, not done because of the \npassions of the moment, but by great thinkers in this country. And it \nhas stood the test of time. It gives meaning to our inalienable rights \nto life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It requires due \nprocess, it guarantees equal protection under the law, it protects our \nfreedom of thought and expression, our freedom to worship or not to \nworship as we choose, and our political freedoms as well. It is the \nbasis for our fundamental right of privacy and for limiting \nGovernment's intrusions and burdens in our lives.\n  I worry that we are so bent on moving so rapidly, as though we are \npassing some kind of an amendment to a minor bill, that we can not \nfully debate this amendment. That is not the way the Constitution \nshould be amended.\n  I have to oppose what I perceive to be a growing fascination with \nlaying waste to our Constitution and the protections that have served \nus well for over 200 years.\n  The first amendment--the separation of powers, the powers of the \npurse--these should be supported and defended. It is the oath we all \nswore when we entered service in this great and historic Chamber. That \nis our duty, not only to the Senate and the American people today, but \nto those who forged this great document, our responsibility to those \nwho sacrificed to protect and defend our Constitution, often times \nlaying down their lives to do it, and our commitment to our \nconstituents today, and our legacy to those who will succeed us in this \nbody.\n  In this constitutional amendment to try to balance the budget, there \nis added irony. The Republican Party has assumed majority status in \nboth the House of Representatives and the Senate. They control the \nlegislative agenda. They can pass any budget they want. We are talking \nabout a two-thirds vote amendment, a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget in the year 2002. It only takes 50 percent plus 1 to \npass a balanced budget today. There are far more Republicans than that. \nThere are a majority of Republicans in the House and the Senate. They \ncould pass a balanced budget tomorrow if they wanted and not have to \nfiddle with our Constitution and say, ``Maybe in the next century, the \nnext millennium, in the year 2002, whoever is standing will do it for \nus.''\n  They want to balance the budget, eliminate the deficits, start paying \noff the debt, including the huge debt of the Reagan years. The \nRepublican majority could do that by a simple majority vote in both \nHouses of Congress in a matter of days.\n  I think that would show the leadership necessary. Instead, having \ntaken over the majority, they propose a constitutional amendment which \nbasically says we cannot trust the majority in the House and the \nSenate. There is somewhat of an irony here, Mr. President. If they \nreally trust themselves, let us pass one right now.\n  I am concerned that we are too ready to seek what appears to be the \nquick fix. The Constitution cannot be amended by sound bite. \nSupermajority requirements undercut our constitutional democracy. They \nevidence distrust not only of our Constitution but of the people who \nsent us here.\n  Proposed amendments to our fundamental charter require consideration \nwhether they are, in the language of article V of the Constitution, \nconstitutionally necessary. I hope that we are not going to burden the \npublic or the States with a hodgepodge of poll-driven, popular-sounding \nconstitutional amendments at some helter-skelter pace to beat some \nartificial deadline.\n  I hope that we will fulfill our responsibilities, not only in our \nindividual committees, but in the bodies of both the House and the \nSenate, to have fair and open discussion.\n  I have studied the so-called balanced budget amendment. I have \nsummarized 10 reasons to oppose the proposed constitutional amendment \nin my supplemental minority views contained in the Senate Report No. \n104-5. I will have occasion to speak to these and other reasons during \nthe course of our debate.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the views of Senators Biden, Heflin, \nand Kyl; the minority views, including those of Senators Kennedy and \nFeingold; the hearings of Senators Byrd and Hatfield on this last year. \nThese are, in my view, essential background for this debate.\n  Let us take a look at this. Let us turn away from what appears to be \na closed shop on this issue. Let us turn back from this path before \npartisan bickering and legislative gridlock overwhelm us to the \ndetriment of the American people. In the U.S. Senate, of all places, we \nshould not be afraid to have ideas debated, openly debated and voted \non. Let us not resort to tabling motions on amendments, which allow you \nto be on both sides of an issue; but let us vote straight up or down. \nYou do not come here to vote maybe, you come to vote yes or no. That is \nwhat we should do.\n  Our distinguished Judiciary Committee chairman has called this the \nmost important matter that we will consider this year. I agree with \nhim, but let us offer amendments and vote on their merits instead of \nengaging in procedural shortcuts.\n  There will be much more said. But, Mr. President, I come from a \nfamily that has revered the Constitution. I grew up with a father who \ntold me how important it was because it protected the rights of not \nonly the majority but of the minority.\n  I came from a family that found itself in the early part of this \ncentury in a religious minority and most of its life in a political \nminority in our State. But we knew the protections were always there. \nWe knew they were always there for everybody. We knew we had a \nConstitution that stood the test of time. That was strong, that could \nbe changed only by great effort, and only when there was an extreme \nneed in the Nation to do so.\n  Mr. President, that is the philosophy with which I grew up. It is \nneither a liberal nor conservative philosophy. It is an American \nphilosophy. I hope we hold to it.\n  I yield the floor, and I understand under the previous order that it \nwould go to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that as soon as I \nfinish my short remarks, the next person to be recognized be the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair.\n  [[Page S1808]] Now, there is nothing more important we can do than \nimprove the general welfare of all the American families and reduce the \nnational debt that is eating away like a swarm of termites on a log. \nThe way to do that is to pass the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. To me, unless we do this, we are going to be in real \ntrouble in this country. This past week, the House of Representatives \nanswered the question: If you have to balance your checkbook every \nmonth, should not the Federal Government have to balance its books \nevery year?\n  Their answer was ``yes,'' 300 to 132. They answered the question: Has \nWashington spent your tax dollars wisely? And their answer was ``no''--\n228 Republicans and 72 courageous Democrats bit the bullet and did the \nright thing. What a victory for all of us.\n  Right now, our debt is a staggering $4.8 trillion. That means that \neach and every one of us in this country, including every child, owes a \nwhopping $18,500, and it keeps going up every day.\n  We can no longer saddle our children with decade after decade of \nunbalanced budgets. We have not balanced this budget in 26 years, and \nit appears to me that we have not balanced it but a few times in the \nlast 60 years.\n  Current interest on the national debt is $300 billion a year and \nrising. Believe it or not, that is more than the total revenues that \ncame to the Federal Government back in 1975. If the current trends in \nFederal spending continue, the Federal Government will double in size \nand consume nearly half of our gross domestic product in the next 35 \nyears, where today it is consuming a lot less than that although more \nthan it should.\n  The annual deficit causes untold damage to our economy. It hurts our \nwages. It raises our interest. It reduces the number of job \nopportunities for all of us. For those Americans who are retired, the \nbiggest threat to Social Security is the Federal Government's fiscal \nresponsibility--fiscal irresponsibility, I should say--because they are \nmaking the Federal dollar less and less important, and actually we will \nreach a point where it will be worthless. If we do not stop the \nspending binge, it will kill Social Security.\n  Instead of supporting the balanced budget amendment, the \nadministration points to its so-called deficit reduction plan as the \nsolution to our problems, but in fact President Clinton's deficit \nreduction plan was his 1993 tax increase, the largest in history. If \nyou think raising taxes is the way to solve our budgetary problems, \nthen hang onto your hats. You had better hang onto your wallets and \npocketbooks as well.\n  Under the President's plan, the national debt will increase by $1 \ntrillion in the next 5 years alone, even if all of his optimistic \neconomic assumptions turn out to be true.\n  It is ironic that while many oppose the Balanced Budget Amendment Act \nbecause, they argue, it is nothing but a gimmick, the special interests \nare out in full force to protect their favorite, expensive, pork barrel \nspending programs. But whatever happened to the national interests? \nWhat about protecting the economic well-being of America and the future \neconomic well-being of our children and grandchildren? We have to make \nthese decisions now, and that is why this debate is important.\n  Personally, I do not like to amend the Constitution, but we have \nreached a point of no return where, if we do not amend the Constitution \nof the United States, we do not put this fiscal mechanism into the \nprocess, and we do not adopt a mechanism that forces Members of \nCongress to make priority choices among competing programs, this \ncountry will not be able to maintain its strength as the greatest \ncountry in the world and everybody, including every special interest in \nthis country, will suffer in the process.\n  I have taken enough time this morning. I know my dear friend from \nMinnesota is about to speak, and I will yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my good friend and colleague from Utah for his \ngraciousness, Mr. President. And he is, agree or disagree, a good \nfriend. It feels good for me to say that.\n\n\n                    Motion Intended to be Submitted\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a \nmotion printed in the Record which I intend to make at some time while \nHouse Joint Resolution 1 is pending.\n  There being no objection, the motion was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                Motion to Refer House Joint Resolution 1\n\n       Mr. Wellstone. Mr. President, I move to refer House Joint \n     Resolution 1 to the Budget Committee with instructions to \n     report it to the Senate accompanied by a report containing a \n     detailed description of a 7-year budget plan that would \n     achieve a balanced budget by 2002.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will in the course of my remarks \nrespond to some of what my colleague from Utah had to say, but first, \nso that my other colleagues in the Senate are aware of what I intend to \ndo on the floor of the Senate at the right time, let me summarize this \nmotion.\n  I intend at some time to move to refer this resolution, House Joint \nResolution 1, to the Budget Committee with instructions to report it \nback to the Senate, accompanied by a report containing a detailed \ndescription of a 7-year budget plan that would achieve a balanced \nbudget by the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a piece by Al Hunt in the \nWall Street Journal of Thursday, January 12, be printed in the Record \nat this point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 12, 1995]\n\n         The Balanced Budget Amendment: A Contract With Evasion\n\n       ``We propose * * * to restore the bonds of trust between \n     the people and their elected representatives. That is why, in \n     this era of official evasion and posturing, we offer instead \n     a detailed agenda. * * *''--The House Republicans' Contract \n     With America.\n       ``The fact of the matter is once members of Congress know \n     exactly, chapter and verse, the pain that the government must \n     live with in order to get to a balanced government [sic], \n     their knees will buckle.''--House Majority Leader Richard \n     Armey on ``Meet the Press'' last Sunday, justifying GOP plans \n     to pass a balanced budget constitutional amendment without \n     specifying how it'd be achieved.\n       Dick Armey probably remembers House consideration last year \n     of a real balanced budget measure offered by Rep. Gerald \n     Solomon (R. N.Y.). It proposed huge cuts in health care, \n     agriculture and income security for the poor, while \n     completely eliminating all aid to Russia and subsidies for \n     Amtrak and air service to remote areas.\n       The Solomon proposal got a grand total of 73 votes; \n     Republicans, by more than a 2-to-1 margin, voted against it. \n     Passing a balanced budget amendment may be easy; getting a \n     balanced budget isn't.\n       In a reasonable path to balance by 2002, the budget would \n     have to be cut by more than $1 trillion. This would be almost \n     30% larger than the 1990 deficit reduction legislation and \n     more than 40% bigger than the 1993 measure.\n       The Republicans have excluded Social Security and defense, \n     and discretionary domestic spending already is frozen. Thus a \n     huge burden would be borne by the budget's fastest growing \n     area, health: Medicare and Medicaid now are about 3.8% of \n     gross domestic product; by 2002, without congressional \n     action, these entitlements would soar to 6% of GDP.\n       The public is solidly behind a constitutional amendment; \n     that's why it's featured in the Contract With America. But, \n     as the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll revealed last month, \n     voters dramatically turn against it if that means 20% cuts in \n     Medicare, Medicaid and veterans benefits. Thus, Dick Armey & \n     Co. find evasion and posturing more attractive.\n       (Ironically, in contrast to this duplicitious measure, \n     Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici genuinely \n     worries about deficits and wants to atone for the fiscal sins \n     of the early 1980s. His House counterpart, John Kasich, is as \n     knowledgeable and honest as he is earnest on these matters.)\n       It's outrageous that the GOP's self-proclaimed foes of the \n     old politics whine that it's political suicide to address \n     Social Security now. Last year two old dinosaur Democrats, \n     Dan Rostenkowski and Jake Pickle, specifically proposed to \n     trim cost of living increases for Social Security, raise the \n     retirement age and cut benefits for more affluent recipients. \n     Is it too much to ask the supposedly fiscally responsible \n     Republicans to be as serious?\n       The $69 billion current trust fund surplus disappears in \n     less than 20 years when the baby boomers start retiring. To \n     suggest, as some Republicans do, that it'll be more \n     politically palatable to address Social Security when more of \n     these baby boomers are closer to actually retiring is, to be \n     charitable, illogical.\n       [[Page S1809]] Under a constitutional amendment, even if \n     unfunded federal mandates are abolished, the states will take \n     it on the chin. Governors will embrace a 10% reduction in the \n     600 categorical grants if they are turned into bloc grants \n     with fewer strings attached. But a balanced budget amendment \n     would necessitate more reductions. The big entitlements for \n     the states--Medicaid, food stamps and welfare--would be cut \n     drastically. Vermont's Democratic governor, Howard Dean, \n     calculates that state funding would be reduced by 40% over \n     seven years; on a state-by-state basis, it's calculated that \n     New York, for example, would lose $11.225 billion in fiscal \n     2002, two-thirds of that from Medicaid.\n       At least those would be real cuts and there would be real \n     debates. More commonplace would be gimmicks such as increased \n     use of loan guarantees or unrealistic assumptions. (The \n     measure doesn't require a balanced budget; it only requires \n     that actual outlays don't exceed projected outlays.) Look for \n     a huge increase in the use of regulatory instead of budgetary \n     measures to meet demands for action, affecting state and \n     local governments and business.\n       Conservative legal expert Robert Bork, an eloquent opponent \n     of this amendment, has noted that ``government need spend \n     nothing on a program if it can find groups in the private \n     sector that can be made to spend their own funds.'' He also \n     envisions that unelected judges would be dealing with \n     hundreds of suits to enforce--or not enforce--the amendment, \n     as does Ronald Reagan's solicitor general, Charles Fried, who \n     warns that the litigation would be ``gruesome, intrusive and \n     not at all edifying.'' (When House Republicans follow their \n     speaker's advice to read the Federalist Papers, they may \n     glance at number 78, where Alexander Hamilton proclaims that \n     the judiciary should have ``no influence over either the \n     sword or the purse.'')\n       Remember, the Gramm-Rudman legislation specifically \n     promised to eventually balance the budget; instead the \n     deficits soared. Democratic Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin sees \n     that pattern re-emerging: ``The cycle which quadrupled the \n     deficit in the 1980s will be repeated. The amendment says we \n     need 60 votes to pass a budget that's not balanced.'' When \n     that horse trading starts, Rep. Obey ventures, all the \n     pressures will be to add spending to attract votes. ``In all \n     my years as a legislator I don't think I've ever seen a \n     member say I'll vote for something if you take things out. If \n     this baby passes, I'll make a flat prediction: Three years \n     after it is passed we still have a deficit well over $100 \n     billion.''\n       More than adding to public cynicism, that will debase the \n     Constitution. Imagine a decade from now a businessman trying \n     to collect $100,000 because the state has unconstitutionally \n     taken part of his property for governmental use. When the \n     country is violating the Constitution by $100 billion or $200 \n     billion, who's going to worry about a paltry $100,000 \n     constitutional offense?\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. His piece begins with an interesting quote:\n\n       We propose * * * to restore the bonds of trust between the \n     people and their elected representatives. That is why in this \n     era of official evasion and posturing, we offer instead a \n     detailed agenda * * *.\n\n  This is a direct quote from the House Republicans' Contract With \nAmerica. And the following comes from House Majority Leader Dick Armey, \non Meet the Press:\n\n       The fact of the matter is that once Members of Congress \n     know exactly, chapter and verse, the pain that the Government \n     must live with in order to get a balanced budget, their knees \n     will buckle.\n\n  Mr. President, yesterday, in Minnesota, I called on the legislative \nleadership in our State to put together a task force to assess the \nimpact of a balanced budget amendment on the State of Minnesota. I did \nthis, Mr. President--and this has been met with a positive response by \nlegislative leadership--because last week I came to the floor with an \namendment based upon a resolution from my State of Minnesota. This \nresolution was passed unanimously by the State Senate, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, almost unanimously by the House of Representatives, \nand signed by our Republican Governor, Governor Carlson, on January 20.\n  What this resolution said was, ``when''--I changed my amendment to \n``if''--the constitutional amendment passes the Congress, Congress \nshould send to the States, send to Minnesota, an analysis of the impact \nof this balanced budget amendment on State and local government and on \nthe people in our State.\n  That amendment was defeated by essentially a party-line vote. I think \nI received 45 votes for that amendment. Talk about the right-to-know: \nmy amendment simply said that if we pass a balanced budget amendment, \nbefore we send the amendment to the States we should provide an \nanalysis of its impact on the people of the different States. I think \nevery single one of my Republican colleagues voted against it. Talk \nabout the importance of being straightforward, stepping up to the \nplate, being direct with the people we represent. Talk about the \nimportance of the right to know--people should have the right to know \nwhat the impact of this balanced budget amendment will be on their \nlives before we pass it. Talk about the sort of crazy proposition that \nbefore you buy a used car you shouldn't lift up the hood and look at \nthe engine. I was really dismayed that this amendment was defeated.\n  What I am now saying is very consistent with, I think, responsible \npublic policy. My fundamental disagreement with some of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle is that I think we owe it to people in \nthis country to lay out a detailed 7-year plan as to where we are going \nto make these cuts before we pass this. I think the reason my \ncolleagues do not want to do this is because they do not want to lay \nout their plans.\n  Let me give some context, which I think really gets to the heart of \nthis. Using conservative estimates, the Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that the interest savings that would come from the cuts--let \nus factor that in, let us be fair--even taking that into account we are \ntalking about a little over $1 trillion worth of cuts between now and \n2002. To get to a balanced budget --$1 trillion worth of cuts. Where \nare we going to make the cuts?\n  On the next graph, Mr. President, is illustrated some real numbers. \nPeople in the country have a right to know where we are heading. By the \nway, I think the analysis I am about to make is in many ways \nirrefutable, just in terms of the basic commitments that some of my \ncolleagues have already made. If you add the defense increases, and you \nalso add tax cuts--I think the defense increase was, roughly speaking, \n$80 billion over 5 years and I think the tax cut was, roughly speaking, \n$360 billion over 5 years--now we are not talking about $1 trillion, we \nare talking about $1.481 trillion.\n  Now we are no longer talking about $1 trillion, we are talking about \n$1.481 trillion that we are going to have to cut between now and 2002. \nThat is why I am going to move at the appropriate time that we refer \nthis resolution to the Budget Committee with instructions to the Budget \nCommittee that it bring to the Senate a report that contains a detailed \ndescription of a 7-year budget plan as to how we are going to cut \n$1.481 trillion.\n  Do we not at least owe that to people in the country? Is that not \ncalled truth in budgeting? Is that not called being straightforward? Is \nthat not called stepping up to the plate and being clear and being \nhonest about what we intend to do? Mr. President, $1 trillion says CBO, \nand in addition we have a bidding war to raise military expenditures, \nand in addition we have a bidding war for more tax cuts. Now we are \ntalking about $1.481 trillion.\n  Let me turn to the next graph. Here is what I believe my colleague, \nSenator Conrad from North Dakota called--and I say this to you always \nin good grace, ``the Republican credibility gap.'' So far the spending \ncuts we have heard detailed in the Republican Contract is about $275 \nbillion. We have seen specifics of $277 billion of budget cuts. Mr. \nPresident, $1,481 billion is what we have to cut to get to this \nbalanced budget by 2002. So far my Republican colleagues have laid out \nbudget cuts totaling $277 billion. There is a long ways from $277 \nbillion here to $1,481 billion. That is truly the Republican \ncredibility gap. And that is why at the appropriate time I will move to \nrefer this resolution to the Budget Committee with instructions to the \nBudget Committee that it lay out a detailed plan as to exactly where we \nare going to make these cuts. We are not going to do well with people \nin this country once they realize we are quite unwilling to specify \nwhere we are going to make the cuts. People are going to begin to see \nthis as a shell game, shifting burdens to the States, to personal \nincome, property, and sales taxes of the states.\n  When I was back in Minnesota yesterday I said one of the reasons why \nit was so important to have some truth in budgeting--so important that \npeople have a right to know where we are heading--is because of the \nlikely impact on my State.\n   [[Page S1810]] The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities issued a \nreport yesterday, and I have some preliminary figures from that report. \nBy 2002, in that 1 year alone where will we in Minnesota be? We will \nhave $143 million less in Federal education. Where will we be: $1 \nbillion, in 1 year, less in Medicaid; about $3 billion of cuts over the \nnext 7 years.\n  This is another part of what I consider to be, really, a shell game. \nThe cuts accelerate. They are less over the first 2 years and then they \nget deeper and deeper. When I say in the State of Minnesota we could \nvery well be faced with $1 billion of cuts in Medicaid in 1 year alone, \nI want my colleagues to understand that half of Medicaid expenditures \ngo to older people for nursing home expenditures. These are our parents \nand our grandparents. I think the figures on Medicare go even higher.\n  What do these figures mean? The Children's Defense Fund estimates \nthat such cuts in 2002 would result in almost 30,000 Minnesota babies, \npreschoolers, and pregnant women losing WIC nutrition supplements; over \n351,000 children losing food stamps; over 154,000 children losing free \nor subsidized lunches; over 2,004 blind or disabled Minnesota children \nlosing SSI; and over 24,000 children losing access to remedial \neducation.\n  I have heard my colleagues talk about our children and our \ngrandchildren and the debt. I have voted for deficit reduction. I have \nvoted for several years in a row for the deepest cuts we have seen in \ndeficit reduction in decades and I will continue to do so. But for many \nchildren, the future is now. We keep talking about our children and the \nfuture, and I bring an amendment to the floor of the Senate 2 weeks ago \nasking the U.S. Senate to go on record saying that nothing we shall do \nby way of spending cuts or legislation will increase the number of \nhomeless or hungry children in America and I cannot get a majority vote \nfor that.\n  Let me repeat that. My colleagues talk about our children and our \ngrandchildren. Maybe our children and our grandchildren are doing well \nnow. We have fairly high salaries, and do well economically. But a lot \nof our children and grandchildren are not doing well now. For them the \nfuture is now. And I came to the floor 2 weeks ago with a reasonable \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment that we would go on record saying we are \nnot going to do anything that would increase hunger or homelessness \namong children in America.\n  Mr. President, did you see the report today that one out of every \nfour children in the United States of America are poor? One out of \nevery four children under the age of 6. What about those children now? \nI could not get my colleagues to vote for that amendment. I think I \nunderstand why.\n  Let me go back to the chart on the credibility gap for a moment, if I \ncould. Let me tell you why, Mr. President, the two amendments I have \nintroduced in the last 2 weeks have failed with every single Republican \nvoting against it. The first amendment, we will not do anything that \nwill increase homelessness or hunger among children. The second \namendment said we will at least provide States with financial analysis \nof the impact of the balanced budget on them before we send it to them \nfor ratification. Why were those amendments voted down? What is it that \nmy colleagues do not want people in Minnesota or Tennessee or Utah or \nanywhere else in the United States to know about the implications of \nthis balanced budget amendment? It is the credibility gap.\n  These are the parameters. We are talking about, roughly speaking, \n$1.481 trillion worth of cuts, and so far my colleagues have specified \n$277 billion. That is a big credibility gap. And after you raise the \nPentagon budget, and after you do more by way of tax cuts--and then we \nare saying that we are not going to be cutting Social Security; there \nseems to be strong agreement on that--in addition you pay interest on \nthe debt. Do we think people do not see through this charade? It is \nclear where we are going to be making the cuts. Mr. President, I do not \nknow about other States, but I will tell you one thing. When we cut the \nWIC Program, the Food Stamp Program, subsidized lunches, remedial \neducation, law enforcement, environmental protection, higher education, \nand any number of other key areas, either our States will walk away \nfrom the people or our States will end up having to assume the costs.\n  These burdens are going to go back to the States. And I can predict \nwhat is going to happen. Just as we now, unfortunately, have moved to \nseveral tiers--people on the top and many people on the bottom--either \nwe are going to have States that are going to pick up the costs--I can \ntell you, I will speak for Minnesotans. We are not going to let \nchildren go hungry. We are going to make sure that our young people can \nafford higher education. We are not going to break our contract with \nveterans. If there are going to be deep cuts in Medicaid and Medicare, \nwe are going to make sure that people continue to have health care when \nthey need it.\n  So we are going to end up having to pay for it. That is the shell \ngame to this. That is why my colleagues are unwilling to specify what \nwe are going to do. My colleagues are unwilling to step forward and say \nwhat we are going to do.\n  Mr. President, for myself I have never signed on to the notion of a \nbalanced budget in the year 2002 because I think it is so political--\nand because it would depend on the economic circumstances at the time. \nFor example, we wouldn't want to do huge spending cuts if we were in a \nrecession. Of course, we have to continue with deficit reduction. Of \ncourse, we have to balance the budget. But the question is, What gets \ntaken off the table and what gets put on the table? I have not heard a \nword so far about cuts in the military budget.\n  Mr. President, Senator Bumpers, Senator Bradley and I and several \nother Senators 2 or 3 weeks ago had a press conference looking at a lot \nof analysis that has been done on defense needs and potential defense \nand other related cuts. We essentially made the argument that here are \nsome military expenditures that are just simply not necessary when we \nhave to make these difficult choices, and we had cuts totaling $33 \nbillion over the next 5 years; $114 million from 1996 to 2010. There \nare a lot of different programs listed. I will not itemize them today. \nI will later on in the debate.\n  Some of these are worthy programs. For example, let me say the space \nstation has many exciting possibilities. But I would far prefer to feed \nchildren on Earth in the United States of America than to send a \nstation into space. We have to start making these difficult choices. \nBut I do not hear people talking about any of these big military \ncontractors having to sacrifice. Oh, no. Oh, no. It is the children, a \nquarter of whom are poor, who do not have lobbyists, who do not have \npolitical power. So what we are going to do--which is why we are \nunwilling to specify the cuts beforehand--is we are going to make cuts \nbased upon the path of least political power.\n  It is interesting. Again, I borrow from the fine work of Senator \nBumpers. When I hear my colleagues say we have to raise the Pentagon \nbudget. But we will cut the School Lunch Program, we are going to do \nit. The arithmetic is compelling. We are not coming anywhere close to \ntelling people how we are going to cut $1.4 trillion. We know where we \nare going to cut. That is why we are unwilling to be clear about it. \nThat is why we are unwilling to specify before we pass the balanced \nbudget amendment. I have not heard any discussion about cutting \nmilitary contracts.\n  Just a couple of interesting figures on this chart. If we take the \nU.S. defense budget and you add NATO and other allies, altogether we \nare spending about $530 billion. Russia, China, and all the rest of our \npotential adversaries combined, total potential adversaries combined, \nonly spent $121 billion. The United States alone has a larger defense \nbudget--$280 billion--than all of our potential adversaries combined, \nwhich is $121 billion. Yet some are talking about raising the Pentagon \nbudget. We are talking about a little more to cut taxes for people, and \nthen we say we are going to have deficit reduction through a balanced \nbudget amendment, but we are unwilling to specify where we are going to \nmake the cuts. We are unwilling to tell people in Minnesota, Tennessee, \nand Utah, all across the country where they are going to be at 2002 and \nwhat they are going to be faced with.\n  There are, of course, other choices to be made. I will be on the \nfloor later on \n[[Page S1811]] with Senator Feingold and others talking about this. But \nit does strike me as odd and politically troubling, if you look at the \nRepublican contract, if you look at the Contract With America, there is \nno mention of anything that asks large corporations, or large financial \ninstitutions, or any other wealthy interests, to sacrifice at all.\n  They say we are going to cut nutrition programs for children. There \nis no question about that. We are going to cut child care. We are going \nto cut higher education. We are going to cut Medicaid. We are going to \ncut Medicare--deep, deep cuts that will accelerate as we approach the \nyear 2002. We will likely not do much the first year, before the \nelections. It is all carefully designed. It has to happen. The \narithmetic is clear. But we are not going to touch oil company \nsubsidies at all. We are not going to go after bloated military \ncontracts. We are not going to deal with some of the other loopholes \nand deductions that a variety of different large, powerful financial \ninstitutions are able to take. We are not asking them to sacrifice at \nall.\n  That is the reason, Mr. President, we do not want people to know \nwhere we are going to make the cuts. We are likely going to go forward \nand pass a balanced budget amendment without even being willing to be \nstraightforward and clear with the citizens we represent as to what \nthis means for their lives, as to what kinds of cuts we are going to \nmake, in what kinds of programs and how it is going to affect them and \ntheir children.\n  That is why I intend, at an appropriate time, to move to refer this \nresolution to the Budget Committee with instructions to report it to \nthe Senate accompanied by a report from the Budget Committee containing \na detailed description of a 7-year budget plan that would achieve a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002.\n  Should we not be honest with people and straightforward with people? \nWhy do we not do that? The answer is, we do not want to tell people \nwhere we are going to make these cuts. We want to pass perhaps the most \nimportant piece of legislation that has been passed in decades, with \nfar-reaching consequences for the people we represent, for the lives of \npeople we represent, and we do not want to, before we pass the balanced \nbudget amendment, lay out the plan as to where we are going to make the \nspending cuts and other policy changes required, and how they are going \nto affect our States and counties and our cities, how they are going to \naffect the people we represent.\n  Mr. President, it is interesting, I want to make this clear that this \nis not just an urban issue. I was this past weekend in Jackson County \nin southern Minnesota meeting with corn and soybean growers. I say to \nmy colleague from Utah that I will bet you the vast majority of the \npeople there are for a balanced budget amendment; I think that is true. \nBut what they are worried about is that they want to know where the \ncuts are going to take place. When we hear that subsidies are going to \nbe eliminated, we are all for it if we know where they are and if you \ngive us a fair price in the marketplace. For those of you who know this \nlanguage--and if you come from Minnesota, you certainly do--they are \ntalking about the loan rate and Commodity Credit Corporation. Give us a \nfair price, that is all we ask for. Then they say: We have not heard \npeople talk about the fair price and about cutting back on the \nconservation program, not giving us a fair price. If you do that, you \nare taking a good percentage of farm income of people who are barely \nhanging on.\n  Mr. President, under a balanced budget amendment there are going to \nbe deep cuts and a lot of people are going to be hurt. My colleagues \nsay, well, we have to do all this, it is in the national interest. It \nis in the national interest to continue to reduce the deficit. It is in \nthe national interest to move toward a balanced budget. It is in the \nnational interest to do it by the same standard that every single \nfamily in this country lives by when they balance their budget, which \nis a standard of fairness, not just targeting those with the least \namount of political clout, or going after health care and education, or \nchildren and leaving all sorts of other subsidies untouched. That is \nthe way we should do it.\n  But, Mr. President, we are not going to do it that way. Let me be \ncrystal clear. We are not going to do it that way. Instead, we are \ngoing to make deep cuts, we are likely going to pass a balanced budget \namendment, and ultimately we may not, because I think the longer this \ndebate goes on and the more people pay attention to this debate, they \nare going to say wait a minute.\n  Back to the chart on the credibility gap one more time. They are \ngoing to say, wait a minute, Senators, we heard there was going to be a \ntrillion dollars in spending cuts, and then we hear that there are \nthose saying they want to increase the Pentagon budget by $80 billion \nover 5 years; then we hear everybody is in this bidding war to cut more \ntaxes which means less revenue, which has to be offset somewhere. Now \nwe hear that the estimate, conservatively speaking, is $1.481 trillion. \nSo far, proponents of the amendment have only specified $277 billion \nworth of cuts they are willing to make. We would like to know, \nSenators, Democrats and Republicans alike, where are you going to make \nthe cuts? How is it going to affect us? Is it going to be according to \nsome standard of fairness? Are we going to have to pick it up at the \nState level? Is it going to be the property tax or sales tax that now \nwe are going to get hit with?\n  Well, people have every right to ask those questions. In fact, there \nis overwhelming support in the United States of America for the right-\nto-know proposition: Recent polls show over 85 percent in favor. Last \nweek, I came to the floor with an amendment that I thought would pass. \nIt was so reasonable. It said if we pass a balanced budget amendment, \nlet us send it to the States with a detailed analysis of how this will \naffect Minnesota or Tennessee, and the people who live in our States. \nIt was voted down, essentially a straight party vote.\n  Mr. President, over the weekend, I have been thinking long and hard \nabout this. I have decided, before we get too far into this debate, I \nshould come to the floor before we get too far into the amendments and \nmove to refer this resolution to the Budget Committee, with \ninstructions for the Budget Committee to come back with a report that \ncontains a detailed description of the 7-year budget plan. That is \nreasonable. It is consistent with being accountable. It is consistent \nwith being straightforward with people and with the people of the \nUnited States of America knowing exactly what we are going to do. I \nthink that is exactly what people believe in strongly.\n  So I have filed this motion, and a little later on I will go forward \nwith this motion. I thank my colleague from Utah.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened to my distinguished friend \nfrom Minnesota. As usual, he is an advocate for those who are poor and \nhave difficulty in our society. I admire him for that. On the other \nhand, I do not think there is a person in America who thinks for one \nsecond that this voracious, money-eating, money-grubbing Federal \nGovernment does not eat up an awful lot of this money right here in the \nbureaucracy. In fact, there are many authorities who seem to indicate \nthat of all the billions of dollars taxpayers are spending for the \npoor, welfare, food stamps, AFDC, you name it, and the thousands of \nprograms that we have, some believe that only 28 percent of all of that \nmoney we pay actually gets to the poor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a minute?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I want to make it clear that I know everything the \nSenator says he says in good faith, and he is always rigorous in his \nanalysis. When I hear the Senator talk about how there are all sorts of \noverly centralized programs and bureaucratized programs and there are \ncuts we can make, I say to the Senator: Fine, the only thing that I am \ngoing to do in this motion is to say to the Budget Committee, before we \nvote, let us be clear about where we are going to make the cuts.\n  I do not necessarily disagree with what the Senator is saying. I have \nto see the numbers. But let us lay them out. If the Senator and other \nmembers of the Budget Committee can tell me how we get from $277 \nbillion to over $1 trillion in cuts and where they are going to be, \nthat is what we should do.\n   [[Page S1812]] Mr. HATCH. I will get into that in just a minute. I \nwant to make this point, and I am glad the Senator recognizes there may \nbe some merit to this point. We, in the interest of controlling \neverybody--we liberals back here in Washington--and that is what you \nhave to call us--we have built such a bureaucracy that we are robbing \neverybody, and very little of that money actually gets to the people \nthat my friend is worried about. And I too worry about those less \nfortunate than most.\n  I am the author of the child care bill, along with Senator Dodd. He \nand I were there at the last minute of that particular Congress making \nsure it went through. Nobody in America was more concerned about child \ncare than I was, and I am a conservative. So I take second seat to no \none on this problem. It is not an unknown fact that I was the person \nwho helped to save the Job Corps Program, which is the only program for \nunemployed youth in our society. It is expensive. It costs over $20,000 \nper youth per year. On the other hand, if we just write them off, they \nare going to cost us better than a million dollars a person by the time \nthey die. We will all have to pay for that.\n  I can name a number of other programs I have helped to save and have \npassed here that are very important. I have just as much feeling about \nthe poor and the sick and the needy and our senior citizens as any \nSenator in this body, including the Senator from Minnesota.\n  But I know that this bureaucracy back here, that this liberal Federal \nGovernment which employs an awful lot of people here in Washington at \npretty high rates of pay compared to the average citizen's salary, is \neating us alive before the moneys get to those who really need it. And \nwhen the moneys finally get there, they are minuscule compared to what \nwe taxpayers have paid.\n  I hear the distinguished Senator talking about how we have to cut the \nmilitary so that children can eat. No, we have to cut the bureaucracy \nso both the military can be strong and children can eat. And we will \nnever do it without a balanced budget amendment.\n  We get credit for these programs. We get a lot more credit for \nspending than we do for standing on the floor and conserving.\n  Having said that, I have been very intrigued by colleagues on the \nother side, almost none of whom is for the balanced budget amendment. \nWhy? Because they like to spend. They do not want any hampering \nrestrictions on their ability to do good. And I am not questioning \ntheir sincerity, but I do question whether they are doing good all the \ntime, laundering the moneys to an all voracious eating Federal \nbureaucracy.\n  I would rather send those moneys to the States, where the States, who \nunderstand local problems, will do a far more efficient job than the \nFederal Government. Our Governors are begging us to send block grants \nfor welfare to them. They do a better job. They will make it more \nefficient. They will get more help to people and in the end people will \nbe better off.\n  When Reagan became President, I became chairman of the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee. That committee overviews between 2,000 and \n3,000 Federal programs. President Reagan came to me and said, ``Orrin, \nyou have six of the seven block grants in your committee.''\n   Now, it was an interesting thing, because I had a heck of a time \ngetting any block grants passed. It was still a pretty liberal \nCongress, even though the Republicans had taken over control of the \nSenate. But the House was still controlled by Democrats.\n  I was having a rough time. One day President Reagan called me and \nsaid, ``Orrin, what is the matter with you up there? Why can't you do \nwhat I have asked you to do?''\n  And I have to say that I was not quite as respectful to the President \nas I should have been--and I have always been. I said, ``Wait a minute, \nMr. President.'' I said, ``Have you looked at the makeup of our \ncommittee?'' There were seven total liberals on the Democrat side and \ntwo liberals on the Republican side. The committee was 9 to 7 in favor \nof what Senator Kennedy wanted. I said, ``How do I put through block \ngrants with that kind of a lineup?''\n  I will be honest with you. We did. We fought for them and we were \nable to get some of them through. Some of them were pure block grants \nand they work magnificently. Some of them were hybrids. They were \npartly block grants and partly categorical programs. And some were \ncalled block grants but were not.\n  I give a lot of credit to Senator Kennedy for working with me to do \nsome of the things that we did. And they worked. In fact, one of the \nleading liberals in the Congress came to me--in fact, I would say one \nof the three or four leading liberals in the Congress--came to me and \nsaid, ``Now, don't ever quote me by name''--and I am not--``but those \nblock grants work.'' They work. And the reason they work is because we \ndo not go through this voracious grab by Federal bureaucracy for \neverything.\n  When I see the little bit of money that gets back to the poor from \nthe programs advocated by those who share the viewpoint of my friend \nfrom Minnesota, who has been making these wonderful arguments about how \ndeeply he feels about the poor--nobody feels more deeply about them \nthan I do--when I see the little amount of money that gets back to them \nonce it is laundered through the Federal bureaucracy, where we see all \nthese sociologists, all these Ph.D.'s, and all these people who are \npaid pretty high wages as they manipulate, manage, fuss, and bother, \nand work on programs and come up with new ideas every time you turn \naround, when I see how little money gets to those people, I just \nshudder.\n  This balanced budget amendment will make the Federal Government more \nefficient. It help us help the poor more. It will make every dollar \ncount. And I do not care how liberal you are; I do not care how \nconservative you are. You are going to have to work within a structure \nthat requires us to live within our means, or at least go in that \ndirection.\n  This amendment does not always necessarily require a balanced budget. \nIt just puts on a fiscal mechanism which forces us to at least move in \nthat direction. Because if you want to increase the deficit, you are \ngoing to have to have a three-fifths vote to do it. That means 60 \nSenators in the Senate would have to vote for any increase in spending. \nIf you want to increase taxes, you are going to have to have a \nconstitutional majority, which means you cannot do that with less than \n51 actual votes in the Senate and 218 actual votes in the House. Most \nimportantly, you are going to have to vote, where now we just hide it \nby voice votes. We just go along with business as usual.\n  We do not worry about these things. The fact is this amendment would \nmake us worry about these things. It would make us a little more \nconcerned about where all the moneys go.\n  If there is waste in the military, and we all know there has been--I \ndo not think there are any more $600 toilet seats and $500 hammers or \nscrewdrivers--but the fact of the matter is, if there is waste, we as \nMembers of Congress can no longer blithely ignore that. We are going to \nhave to look for it and we are going to have to get rid of it, because \nwe are going to have to live within certain economic constraints, which \nis where we ought to be and what we ought to do.\n  (Mr. KYL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HATCH. The poor are being ripped off because, as the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois has said on many occasions, if we \nkeep going in the direction we are going, we are going to have to \nmonetize the debt. And once we do that, this country's power in the \nworld, economic clout in the world, its stability in the world will be \ngone, because nobody will believe in the dollar after that, because we \nwill have paid off all these debts with worthless dollars, or at least \nvery, very much devalued dollars.\n  Now, that is where we are headed unless we do what is fiscally \nresponsible, that which Thomas Jefferson indicated he thought we should \nhave put in the Constitution from the beginning: That is, put in a \nfiscal mechanism in the Constitution that is not so tight that you \ncannot operate within it, but is not so tight that you cannot have \nunbalanced budgets if that is in the best interests of the country.\n   [[Page S1813]] If military spending is not efficient or unnecessary, \nwe ought to correct the military. But there are not the incentives or \nthe pressures to do that today because we simply spend the money the \nmoney with virtually no restraint. We just spend the money.\n  If we are wasting money on social programs, we ought to correct those \nwastes. But we do not do it today because we just spend the money.\n  If there are other programs in the Federal Government that are not \nworking and are not as valuable as some programs, we ought to bite the \nbullet and get rid of them. But today we just spend the money.\n  Now I have seen for 18 years those who are against the balanced \nbudget amendment come on this floor time after time or speak in public \ntime after time or on television shows or on the radio, and say, ``We \nought to have the guts to do what is right here. We ought to balance \nthe budget and we ought to do it without a balanced budget amendment.''\n  Well, we ought to. But the fact of the matter is, there are not the \nvotes to do it. People will not do it because there is no fiscal \nmechanism in the Constitution that requires them to do it.\n  So when somebody comes on the floor and says, by the way, they have \nalways been an opponent of the balanced budget amendment, and almost \nall of these who are critics are, the new game in town is to say, \n``Show us how you are going to the get to a balanced budget in 7 \nyears.'' We have three or four plans around here that show that. The \nproblem is, we do not have the votes for any one of those plans to do \nit. So nobody in this context can show exactly how we are going to get \nit in the year 2002 unless we have a mechanism that forces us to do it. \nThat is what this is all about.\n  So when the new methodology to defeat the balanced budget amendment \nis, ``Show us how you are going to get there in 2002,'' I can give them \n20 plans that will show them that. The point is there is no incentive \nor power or force or mechanism to enact any of them in the current \nCongress without a balanced budget amendment forcing us to meet these \nproblems.\n  So that is why this is important. We do not want to put the cart \nbefore the horse. We need to pass the amendment. That puts the \nmechanism in that makes Members of Congress make priority choices among \ncompeting programs.\n  I happen to believe that Members of Congress believe in the \nConstitution. I happen to believe that they believe in the oath of \noffice that they have taken. I have seen a reverence for the \nConstitution no matter what the philosophy of people in the Congress. \nIt is the same in the States. The State legislators revere their \nconstitution. We revere ours.\n  I do not think it is a naive belief to say if we pass the balanced \nbudget amendment and it is submitted to the States and it is ratified \nby three-quarters of the States, that we will do what has to be done; \nwe will live within our budget limits; we will force ourselves to \ndebate the implementing legislation and how we get to a balanced budget \nby the year 2002, if possible; or we will vote to either increase taxes \nor to increase the deficit, because it cannot be done. But that will \nnever happen. But today that type of a debate will never happen--with \nany hope of fruition--unless we have the amendment mechanism in the \nConstitution to force Members to do it.\n  Government excess spending is our biggest threat, to our eyes on this \nside of the floor. To the distinguished Senator from Minnesota, failure \nto curtail excess spending in the military is one of the biggest \nthreats. Military spending is now the third largest item in the Federal \nbudget. The second is that interest against the national debt, that is \nover $300 billion and will approach $500 billion shortly after the \nfirst of the century if we do not do something now.\n  So, this call, to cut military spending without a balanced budget \namendment, is a fruitless call. Nobody has been able to do it so far. \nWe have tried through the statutory methodology. I was sitting right \nback there in 1978, and I remember when we passed the Byrd amendment \nthat required the Senate to balance the budget in what I believe was \n1980. Yet, an amendment was offered that required a 51-percent majority \nvote for a balanced budget. This completely subverted the very \nimportant Byrd measure that had previously just passed by an \noverwhelming vote on the Senate floor. There was no constitutional \nforce or requisite to meet that challenge that Harry Byrd made. It went \ndown to defeat.\n  Then we came up with Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. I cannot say that it did \nnot work at all. But in the end it was a simple statute that we did \naway with and changed its goal and timetables. Frankly, it never really \nworked well. And today we are right back where we started. True, with \nthe largest tax increase in history, the deficit trend line has gone \ndown and will go down until 1996, when it just shoots right straight \nback up again.\n  What are we going to do, raise taxes again and solve this problem \nthat way? Or are we going to start working on priority choices between \ncompeting programs in the budget? The only thing that will get Members \nto do that is a balanced budget constitutional amendment. It is not \nbecause people in Congress are bad people or they do not want to do \nwhat is right. It is that there is so much pressure to spend here. \nThere is so much pressure by every special-interest group in this \ncountry to cover their problems and solve their difficulties.\n  We are sincere. We want to do what is right. But right now we do not \nhave to because there is no mechanism forcing Members to consider doing \nwhat is right. This amendment is a bipartisan consensus amendment that \nwe have worked out over a period of almost 10 years now, since we \npassed the first balanced budget constitutional amendment through the \nSenate and lost in the House back in 1982.\n  A lot of us, somewhere, worked on it. It is important. A lot of \nDemocrats have worked on this. A lot of Republicans have worked on \nthis. Any one of us could write a tougher amendment, one way or the \nother. But this is a bipartisan consensus amendment. This is the only \none that has a chance of passage. It will do the job because it does \nthree things. It does more than three things, but three things I want \nto mention. It requires a recorded three-fifths vote to increase \nspending. To increase the deficit, you will have to get a recorded \nthree-fifths vote to do so. Once you do that, everybody in America will \nknow who voted that way. They may agree with it. But they may not, \neither. And everybody here will have the pressure on their backs to \ndetermine whether or not it is the right thing for them to do. Today, \nwe generally lift the debt ceiling by a voice vote. Nobody wants a \nrecorded vote on that issue, and thus raising the debt ceiling has \nbecome automatic because we do not have a recorded vote.\n  Second, if you want to increase taxes, you have to have a \nconstitutional majority. That is important. Any legislation could be \npassed here by a vote of 26 to 25 because we have 51 Senators making a \nquorum. Anything else could be passed by less than 51 votes. Once this \namendment becomes law, the only tax bills that could be passed through \nboth Houses will be those bills that get an actual 218 Members to vote \nfor them in the House, and an actual 51 in the Senate.\n  Third, and I have alluded to this before, we have a recorded vote to \nraise the debt ceiling and there is a three-fifths requirement to do \nso.\n  Those are three very important reasons why we should enact this \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  Now, there are good worries on both sides of the aisle on almost \nevery aspect of this. We can raise all kinds of hairy problems. The \nfact of the matter is that this is a bipartisan amendment, done by \nDemocrats and Republicans, which is the only one in history that has a \nchance of passage and, for the first time in the history of this \ncountry, has passed the House of Representatives. Back in 1982, an \namendment that was not quite as good as this one passed the Senate by \n69 votes; in other words, 2 more than we need. We have to have 67 votes \non a constitutional amendment in the Senate.\n  I believe this amendment is worthy of passage. I am fighting arm in \narm with my fellow Democrats who are linking arms with me and with \nothers on this side who have worked so hard to try to pass this \namendment. We are fighting together, side by side, trying to get it \nthrough. I believe we have a \n[[Page S1814]] chance at doing it if the American people really get on \nthe backsides of their Senators and let them know that this is \nsomething that has to be done. Nothing short of that will get this \ndone.\n  There are other things I would like to say, but I think there are \nothers on the floor who would like to speak to this matter. I defer \nother remarks to a later time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to support House Joint Resolution \n1. The significance of the No. 1 is very important. If Members go out \nand talk to people at the grassroots, they think, to have a balanced \nbudget, there is a need for a constitutional amendment. They think this \namendment is the first order of business of any Congress. I think the \nlast election said that it ought to be the first order for this \nCongress. It is very simple, particularly for middle-class people in \nAmerica, and the small entrepreneurs and to the farmers of America, \nthat Federal spending must be controlled, the deficit eliminated, and \nthe national debt brought down.\n  There are very important economic reasons to balance the budget, but \nmore essentially, there are moral reasons to balance the budget. The \nmoral issues, in fact, now, are more important than the economic \nreasons. Early on, I think we could justify the amendment on economic \nreasons, but now the immorality of our generation living high on the \nhog and leaving the bill to our children and grandchildren to pay makes \nit much less an economic issue. We are borrowing the future of our \nchildren and grandchildren through the bad fiscal policies. We must end \nthis practice.\n  Because every other means has failed to produce a balanced budget, we \nmust enact an amendment to the Constitution. Every other means has \nfailed. Gramm-Rudman I and II. I even remember when I was a Member of \nthe House of Representatives, I worked very closely with another person \nby the name of Byrd, Harry Byrd, who was a Member of this body, a \nSenator from the State of Virginia.\n He was very much a fiscal conservative. He thought, just pass a law \nthat would say that Congress cannot expend more than the taxes raised.\n\n  I was in the House of Representatives at that time, and I worked very \nclosely with former Senator Byrd of Virginia to make sure that \namendment he passed in the Senate would get through the House of \nRepresentatives. I had to, in a sense, camp out in the Chamber of the \nHouse of Representatives for about a 2-week period of time to be there \nfrom gavel to gavel. I knew that the leadership of that body would want \nto avoid the membership being forced to vote upon the Byrd amendment \nwhen it came over to that body.\n  Finally, when they knew I was going to stay in the Chamber of the \nHouse and force a vote on a motion to instruct, they let it come to a \nvote, and it was overwhelmingly adopted. So in 1978--maybe it was \n1979--we had a law on the books saying that Congress could not spend \nmore than it took in.\n  But did it do any good? No. The theory is one Congress cannot bind a \nsucceeding Congress, and I suppose that is good constitutional law. So \nwhen we passed the succeeding budget that was out of balance, it was \nthen read as overriding the Byrd-Grassley amendment.\n  So after that and after Gramm-Rudman 1 and 2, we still did not have a \nbalanced budget. Then there were several attempts on my part to merely \nfreeze the budget across the board, and I was joined in that effort, \nlet me say, by my good friend, Senator Biden of Delaware, and Senator \nKassebaum. The freeze in and of itself would not have brought about a \nbalanced budget in the first year, but in 2\\1/2\\ years we would have \nhad a balanced budget. But we could not get a majority for that. After \nall those efforts, I have become a supporter and advocate for a \nconstitutional amendment to require a balanced budget.\n  More so than what I have said is my rationale for the constitutional \namendment is the fact that in my own State of Iowa we have a \nconstitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, and I have seen \nour State legislatures faithfully abide by that, whether controlled by \nDemocrats or controlled by Republicans. I think it works. So we must \nenact an amendment to the Constitution because nothing else has or \nnothing else will work. Irresponsible debt threatens our future, not \njust the future of the young people that are our future but the very \nform of our society and the freedom, both political and economic, that \nis an integral part of our society.\n  I think the reason we look at it the way we should, as a moral issue, \nis because it threatens our children's future. Our deficits have not \noccurred because Congress has not taxed the American people \nsufficiently. Rather, these deficits have developed because of runaway \nspending. And all you have to do is look at efforts to increase taxes \nto reduce the deficit--and we have had four or five of those in the \nperiod of time I have been in this body--and the deficit does not get \nsmaller. It is still yet larger.\n  The reason for that is because the Government not only spends every \ndollar that comes in in taxes, but it borrows another 50 cents almost \nto spend in conjunction with it. So in fact I think lower taxes, less \nincome, is one less dollar to have an excuse to borrow another 50 cents \nagainst to ratchet up spending and ratchet up the deficit.\n  Washington has not only been irresponsible, but I think this process \nof our fiscal irresponsibility fosters the wrong values in our society. \nSpending is increased, and the results of the spending have not been to \naccomplish what was promised. Programs which have a philosophy that all \nyou have to do is tax and appropriate money and you are going to solve \na social problem just have not worked.\n  We have to stop the immoral behavior of passing along increased debt \nto our children and future generations and get out of this time warp \nthat we are in that somehow money spent through the Federal budget or \nthe creation of some new program is going to solve our problems.\n  A balanced budget amendment fits appropriately within the design of \nthe original document because, as the preamble says, the Constitution \nwas adopted by,\n\n       We the people of the United States, in order to form a more \n     perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic \n     tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the \n     general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to \n     ourselves and our posterity.\n\n  ``Posterity'' is a word that we do not hear much anymore. We run our \nGovernment as if the only relevant considerations are what are in \ntoday's newspapers, what we do today. We, in elective office, tend to \nbe more concerned about the next election just 2 years away than about \nthe next generation. We consider the consequences of our acts in short \ntimeframes. Rarely do we take account of the effects that our actions \nwill have on posterity's ability to enjoy the blessings of liberty in \nthe way that my generation has and the way that the preamble presumes \nthat our future generations should be able to enjoy the blessings of \nliberty.\n  Among the blessings of liberty that our constitutional system has \nmaintained is a standard of living that rises with each generation. \nKeys to this enhanced economy have been productivity, growth, and \ninvestment. In recent years, productivity, investment and savings rates \nhave declined with the concomitant negative impact upon the economy.\n  The 26-year continuous string of unbalanced budgets has contributed \nto these poor economic results. I do not think it coincidental that the \nstagnation of average wages over the last 20 years has been accompanied \nby high budget deficits by our Government.\n  Moreover, economic growth in the last 26 years of counting deficits \nhas fallen short of the prior 26 years. Budget deficits have been run \nup to fund current consumption. The effects of these deficits are \nalready negatively affecting the budget. When we last balanced the \nbudget--and that was in 1969--9 cents of every dollar of Federal \nspending went to payment of interest on the national debt.\n  Now, however, 26 cents of every dollar goes toward paying the \ninterest on the national debt. We receive nothing for making these \npayments, but we will force future generations to pay an even greater \nproportion of the budget as interest unless we act to pass this \nconstitutional amendment, because all the other acts in good faith that \nthis body has taken have not produced the desired results of a balanced \nbudget.\n\n[[Page S1815]]\n\n  Moreover, we will have to tax future generations at incredibly high \nrates just to pay the interest on the national debt if nothing is done. \nThe figures for that problem that lies ahead for future generations \nvary depending on the assumptions made.\n  Future generations will pay the vast majority of their lifetime \nearnings in Federal taxes. Various assumptions bring up various \npercentages of two-thirds or three-quarters or even 93 percent that \nfuture generations might have to pay in taxes just to pay interest on \nthe national debt.\n  So it is unacceptable that we live high on the hog by masking the \ntrue costs of the programs while leaving future generations to pay the \ncost, meaning the principal plus the interest.\n  That was not done to us by our grandparents or parents or great \ngrandparents or any of the 11 generations that we have had. It seems to \nme because it was not done to us, we have even more of a responsibility \nto make sure we treat future generations with the same respect that \npast generations have shown us.\n  I am concerned that some people think that the deficit and the \nnational debt are issues of declining importance. While it is true that \nthe deficit will fall this year, we cannot afford to declare victory \nand stop worrying about the deficit. The deficit will rise in the near \nfuture by the administration's own estimates.\n  Moreover, I believe that the administration's interest rate forecasts \nhave been too low. Higher interest rates will only increase the portion \nof the budget spent on interest on the debt. Moreover, deficits \nthemselves increase interest rates in the long run, and higher interest \nrates harm renters, home buyers, farmers, and small business people--\nmaybe everybody who borrows. But it seems to me that it particularly \nhurts those people who have to borrow for need or those people who have \ncapital-intensive industries and small businesses to create their own \njobs.\n  Deficit spending has produced other negative consequences. Last year \nat the hearings held on the amendment in the Judiciary Committee, the \nformer chief actuary for Social Security testified that deficit \nspending has led to lax Government accounting. If the balanced budget \namendment were enacted this actuary testified that Congress would \nfinally have to start examining Government accounting. Just the simple \naccounting procedures by the Federal Government are way off. There is \nno incentive to correct the procedures as long as the Government can \nborrow and borrow and borrow and not have to meet a legal, \nconstitutional requirement of a balanced budget.\n According to his testimony, one account at the Department of Defense \nhas been mismanaged for 30 years. The State Department has lost account \nof billions of dollars worth of property. And the Comptroller General \nhas said that some Government bills have been paid twice.\n\n  A balanced budget amendment will force us to take a tough look at \nGovernment accounting as well as Government spending. This is all to \nthe good. Rooting out wasteful spending is the best way to make headway \nagainst the deficit.\n  Yes, there is wasteful spending to cut.\n  Cutting spending does not have to mean that people will be hurt. We \nhave spent trillions on social programs, and the problems remain. In \nmany instances, the programs have made the programs worse. As Ronald \nReagan said, ``We fought a war on poverty--and poverty won.''\n  Even when a program has good ends, it is frequently mismanaged. We \nall know how much of the money is wasted on too many bureaucrats, \nregardless of how well intentioned they are or how much work must be \ndone. It may be true that there are now fewer Federal personnel than in \nthe past 30 years. But does anyone miss the ones no longer there? Has \nanyone's life suffered as these surplus employees have left and not \nbeen replaced?\n  I believe that the worthwhile and important programs could grow at a \nsmaller rate, and could be just as effective, if they were critically \nexamined and changes made. The programs that do not measure up should \nbe eliminated. We can balance the budget this way under the proposed \namendment. Cutting the Washington bureaucracy is the key.\n  Since the deficit itself is a significant problem, why not just cut \nthe deficit now? Why enact a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget? Because, as I hope I made clear, I see no other way. Congress \nhas passed statutes to reduce the deficit. Congress has raised taxes \nsupposedly to cut the deficit. But the deficit has risen. It rose after \nGramm-Rudman. It rose after the 1990 budget deal. That was a Republican \none.\n  And in a few years even by our President's own admission, and he is a \nDemocrat, his 1993 tax bill and the budget agreement that went with it \nwill still not keep the deficit from going up within 2 more years, and \ncontinue to go up unless we do something more.\n  We cannot ever eliminate the deficit if we continue on our present \npath.\n  If we are to reduce the deficit, we must put a binding obligation on \nCongress to balance the budget gradually until the deficit is \neliminated soon after the passage of the amendment.\n  Those who believe we can cut the budget deficit down to zero without \nthis amendment should offer an effective plan to accomplish the result. \nHowever I believe that they will not do it. Congress as an institution \nwill not cut spending or reduce the deficit unless it is forced to do \nso. And the only force I know is through the Constitution. There is \nplenty of will in this body, but that will is directed toward spending, \nnot cutting. It is toward deficits, not toward a balance of the budget.\n  We have heard it said that section 6 of the amendment which gives \nCongress the power to enforce the statute is inconsistent with the \nclaim that statutes alone will not end the deficit. But there is no \ncontradiction. As I have said, in 1978 I was a part of the Byrd-\nGrassley efforts by a statute that we got through and signed by the \nPresident to require a balanced budget. So I think I know. Many \namendments are given life by provisions extending Congress the power to \nenforce them. This constitutional amendment gives us a basis for what \nwas not there when the Byrd-Grassley amendment was law.\n  Implementing legislation is necessary to make the balanced budget \namendment function fully. But the difference between statutes enacted \nunder this amendment and Gramm-Rudman, or Byrd-Grassley is that the \nConstitution will demand that the new statutes be adhered to, unlike \nearlier legislation lacking the constitutional imperative.\n  Mr. President, we need to balance the budget. We can only do so if we \npass a constitutional amendment. The American people are watching to \nsee if we make this commitment. The quality of the existence of future \ngenerations is at stake. We cannot afford to fail again.\n We cannot afford to fail making tough decisions today to lighten the \nburden on our children and grandchildren. We must enact this \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n\n  I think this is the fourth time--maybe the fifth time--since I have \nbeen in the Senate that this issue has come before us.\n  We have passed it at least once. It was by two votes. It was defeated \nonce by one vote. Another time it was defeated by two or three votes, \nand then a couple of other times we could not get the votes to stop the \nfilibuster. I hope this time we will be successful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am sorry. I did not see the Senator from Colorado. I \nyield time for the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, thank you. I thank the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. President, I too, rise to speak on the balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution. As a person who has been a prime cosponsor of this \nlegislation three different times and on the House side voted for it, I \nam very permanently committed to it. In fact, in the 102d Congress, as \nthe Presiding Officer well knows since he was also a supporter when we \nserved together over there, we missed it by just six votes. It \n[[Page S1816]] was awfully close. A couple of times before that we both \nsigned a procedure in which to take the amendment directly to the \nfloor, and we could not even get it out of committee of the 101st \nCongress, as I remember.\n  So there have been a lot of efforts to move this along, and basically \ndo what people are saying now--that is, save us from ourselves. I know \nin the course of this debate, which may last a week or even 2 weeks, \nthere are going to be a lot of efforts to weaken it, lots of efforts to \nget us to succumb to the feeling by some Americans that we really do \nnot need to balance the budget, and in fact will hurt jobs or hurt \nindividuals. I do not subscribe to that, and would oppose weakening \nthis in any way, shape, or form.\n  As better speakers before me have already alluded to on the floor, we \nare simply in a downward spiral. Last year, $200 billion was wasted on \ninterest payments. As the Senator from Utah said, not one dime of that \nmoney helped build a square yard of highway, or helped build one cell \nfor a hardened criminal, or helped one youngster in need of counseling. \nAll we got for our efforts in the last few years was an $18,000 bill as \nthey said for every man, woman, and child in America.\n  There is no question in my mind--and I think everyone knows--that \nbalancing the budget will be perceived as hurting some people in the \nshort run. But in the long run balancing the budget will raise the \nNation's standard of living and the rate of savings. According to GAO, \na balanced budget by the year 2001 would produce a 36-percent \nimprovement in our standard of living by the year 2020.\n  OMB Director Alice Rivlin estimates that balancing the budget within \n5 years would raise the national savings rate to 6.1 percent. Yet, if \nwe fail to pass a balanced budget, the savings rate will be a mere 3.7 \npercent--that certainly means trouble for the United States in a \ncompetitive global economy where other nations save far more.\n  Our voters told us that it is time to draw the line. We know that we \ncannot pass a constitutional amendment to solve every problem. \nCertainly this is not an ordinary problem. This amendment is required \nbecause history has proven, as other speakers have said, that \nlegislation simply will not work.\n  I remember very well the days of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings act in \nwhich we ended up before we could finally get it passed exempting \nsomething like 72 percent of all spending and thereby trying to balance \nthe budget on the remaining 28 percent of the revenues. And it simply \nwill not work. If we make all kinds of exemptions to this legislation, \nthis will not work either.\n  In an ideal world, this amendment will not be necessary. But, in the \nreal world, it is necessary. I do not think that in fact the elected \nofficials should take all the blame for it because I know my office, \nlike many offices, is inundated with people who say in one breath, \n``Balance the budget, reduce my taxes, and get me $10 million more for \nmy special project.'' Those special interests, which we sometimes \ncalled the third House around here, has had so much influence in \nprotecting turf that we simply cannot balance the budget by \nlegislation.\n  Just look at the recently disbanded Kerry-Danforth bipartisan \nentitlement commission. It spent $1.8 million but failed to come up \nwith a unified proposal on where to cut entitlement spending, which is \nthe largest sector of Government spending.\n  This amendment gives Congress and the public a constitutional reason \nto bite the bullet. Congress will have to bite the bullet--we will have \nplenty of tough choices. Clearly, popular programs probably will be \ncut, and in fact some good programs may be cut. We must make our very \nbest effort to concern ourselves with the most vulnerable in our \nsociety and make sure that they do not get unduly hurt.\n  According to most estimates, about $1.2 trillion of spending cuts are \ngoing to be needed to balance the budget in the next 7 years.\n  Already, nearly 50 percent of spending programs have been removed \nfrom the new leadership's deficit reduction plan--Social Security, \ndefense, and net interest.\n  In addition, Congress will probably be required to find more cuts to \noffset the middle-class tax cut proposals, and other tax cut proposals, \nthat are being circulated around the Capitol.\n  Certainly, the challenge is enormous. Congress has a responsibility \nto come up with spending cuts before it passes any tax cuts, and our \neyes narrowly focused on a balanced budget in 7 years.\n\n\n                           the right to know\n\n  Congress also has a responsibility to tell the American people how it \nwill accomplish a balanced budget before it passes one. That is why I \nsupport Senator Daschle and Senator Exon in their efforts in the right-\nto-know budget amendment.\n  Congress must be honest with voters because they have a right to know \nwhat we already know. Congress cannot allow its knees to buckle at the \nprospect of making spending cuts.\n  We have a duty to fill in the blank lines of the promise of a \nbalanced budget, so that Americans can understand what it means for \ntheir lives.\n\n\n                      three-fifths tax limitation\n\n  Some have suggested that a provision be added to require a three-\nfifths approval for income tax increases. I oppose such a provision.\n  It would scare away many supporters of last year's version which \nalmost passed. We have worked far too long to see this opportunity \nmissed.\n  I also worry that this provision would allow a zealous minority to \nhijack our Nation's budgetary policies.\n  More importantly, I think a three-fifths requirement undermines the \namendment's flexibility. The amendment should be flexible, able to last \nthe ages, and not dictate the path to a balanced budget.\n  Congress will pass the balanced budget amendment this year. Passage \nof this amendment will not be the silver bullet to kill the deficit--\nonly tough choices will do that. I hope we can work together in a \nbipartisan, responsible fashion for a balanced budget and the future of \nour Nation and our children.\n  Certainly, the challenge is enormous. Congress has the \nresponsibility, and I am certainly willing to step to the plate, as \nmany of my colleagues are.\n  I yield the floor, and just say in passing that I certainly commend \nboth Senator Simon and Senator Hatch, who are going to be spending an \nawful lot of hours here on the floor in the next week, for their \nleadership on this balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Yes.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I certainly want to commend the Senator \nfrom Colorado for being solid on this issue.\n  He mentioned the GAO report--which has been largely ignored around \nhere--that says if by the year 2001 we balance the budget, by the year \n2020 we will have an average increase, adjusted for inflation, in \nincome of 36 percent per American.\n  Our choices are very, very striking. I happen to have that report \nhere. I would just like to read this:\n\n       Eliminating the budget deficit, and, if possible, achieving \n     a budget surplus, should be among the Nation's highest \n     priorities. Because of the accumulating burden of interest on \n     the mounting public debt, it is important to move rapidly in \n     this regard. Postponing action only adds to the difficulty of \n     the task.\n\n  Again, I want to commend our colleague from Colorado for standing up \nso solidly on this. I really appreciate his leadership.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. If I might say, too, in that report, it indicates that \nbecause of some severe actions we have taken in the last year or two \nthe deficit is going down a little bit now. But, clearly in next few \nyears, it is going to start to rise again. What we do legislatively is \nnot going to amount to a hill of beans, but it is still going to go up \nwithout this constitutional balanced budget amendment.\n  I look forward to supporting this amendment, and thank the Senator \nfor his nice comments.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I state the obvious. The Senate has begun \ndebate on a proposed amendment to the Constitution. This is, as it \nought to be, a solemn moment in the life of our Constitution, for what \nwe debate today, and I expect in the following weeks, is whether to \nchange, alter, or modify the basic document of governance that we have \noperated under.\n   [[Page S1817]] Since 1791, the year the Bill of Rights was ratified, \nMembers of Congress have introduced over 10,000 proposed amendments to \nthe Constitution. Admittedly, the new Republican majority is making \ntheir weight felt here. We have not only this amendment, but I do not \nknow how many more to amend the Constitution. But there have been over \n10,000 proposed amendments to our Constitution. Of those 10,000 since \n1791, we in Congress have approved just 22. And, of the 22, just 17 \nhave been ratified by three-quarters of the States and have become part \nof the Constitution.\n  We stand here again this year confronting one of our most profound \nconstitutional responsibilities as we consider a change in our \nfundamental charter. It is one of the glories of the U.S. Constitution \nthat it has been so resilient. Its authors' insight into human behavior \nand political institutions have proved accurate from our early years as \nan outpost on the coast of the new world to our current status of a \nspace-aged superpower.\n  Few changes have been necessary to permit the Constitution to keep \npace with our social, economic, and technological revolutions that have \ntransformed our Nation since its founding. But in recent decades, we \nhave faced the problem that we do not seem to be able to solve. We \ncannot balance our budget, or, more correctly, we will not. And to put \nit in even sharper focus, I think it is much less important that our \nbudget be balanced. There is nothing magic about the budget being \nbalanced. But what is critically important is that our deficit continue \nto decline, and that we have a small deficit, if any deficit at all.\n  At the beginning of the Reagan administration, we swerved from the \ncourse that had, since the end of World War II, shrunk the national \ndebt, and we turned onto a path that has led us to where we are today; \nthe so-called Laffer curve. Speaking of ``Laffers,'' it is probably the \nultimate ``Laffer''--the ``Laffer curve.'' Many of us have worked to \nimpose disciplines needed to restrain the temptation to spend beyond \nwhat we tax.\n  (Mr. GREGG assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BIDEN. When the Reagan administration deficits began, I proposed, \nalong with Senator Grassley and Senator Kassebaum--and he mentioned \nthis earlier--that we freeze every single solitary program in the \nGovernment, anything the Government had to do with, every single \nsolitary one, that we not spend a penny more, not even accounting for \ninflation, than we spent the year before. Although I wrote the plan \nwith my two Republican colleagues, we received very little support from \neither side of the aisle. I think our high-water mark 3 years later was \n38 votes.\n  I also supported the Gramm-Rudman process that has been much maligned \nhere in the Congress. It has not worked, but I argue that absent that \nthings would even be worse than they are today. Gramm-Rudman put caps \non the amount of deficits allowed and required a balanced budget. But \nthe requirements changed every year, and the only constant in the \nprocess was the annual increase in the national debt and the guarantee \nof annual deficits.\n  Those are not the only things that we have tried. Over 10 years ago, \nI offered my own constitutional amendment to balance the Federal \nbudget--and you might expect me to say, parenthetically, I think it was \na superior document to the one we are about to vote on this year. Up \nthrough my vote for Senator Reid's balanced budget amendment last year, \nI have held that this is an issue worthy of constitutional \nconsideration. Many suggest that this is not an issue worthy of \nconstitutional consideration.\n  Well, the fact of the matter is, I think my friend from Illinois is \ncorrect when he keeps quoting and referencing Jefferson. If this is not \nworthy of constitutional consideration--how we are able to bind or not \nbind future generations--I am not sure what is worthy of constitutional \nconsideration.\n  That in no way undercuts the opposing argument that writing fiscal \npolicy into a constitution or into a document of governance is a \ndifficult and maybe impossible thing. But the notion that this is not \nworthy of constitutional consideration, I think, is not accurate. The \ndecision to encumber future generations with financial obligations is \none that can rightly be considered among the fundamental choices \naddressed in the Constitution.\n  But from the first time the resolution before us here today was \nproposed, I have been concerned that it could bring with it problems \nthat, taken together, could be almost as bad as the deficit problem \nthat we are all worried about. In the Judiciary Committee, I have \ndescribed some of those concerns. This year, in committee a number of \namendments were offered to fix what I, at least, perceive to be \nproblems in this constitutional amendment. Some of us tried to make \nthis a better proposal. We tried to avoid tying up the courts with \nconstitutional questions about such important details as the \nPresident's role in enforcing the balanced budget. We tried to keep the \nSocial Security trust fund off budget, where it is now and where it \nshould stay. We tried to assure that the real cost of the balanced \nbudget amendment, and not just its surface lure, is known to the \ncitizens who will be asked to ratify this amendment in the coming \nmonths. We tried to provide a capital budget to treat public \ninvestments the way families, businesses, and States treat their own \ninvestments.\n  These and other amendments were not accepted. The reason they were \nnot accepted--and you will hear it repeatedly; my friend from Utah \nreferenced it. It is the one thing that worries me most, as I am one of \nthose undecided votes. I am told that there are five, six, seven, or \neight of us in this place who do not oppose the notion that we have a \nmechanism in the Constitution to deal with deficits. But we are very \nunsure of this mechanism. The camps generally divide into two areas. \nOne suggests that it is bad policy, period, to put anything in the \nConstitution. And there are those who suggest that this is the only \nanswer. I am with that handful or maybe a couple of hands full of \npeople here who find myself believing that it is not inappropriate but \nbelieving that what we have before us may not do the job. I have been \nhere long enough to realize that there are often unintended \nconsequences of our actions which are sometimes worse than the problem \nwe have attempted to cure.\n  Where do we stand now? We have before us the balanced budget \namendment, about which many of us have expressed serious reservations, \nthe effects of which in both the short and the long term cannot be \npredicted with any degree of certainty, although we will find plenty of \npeople on the floor who will predict with certainty how they think this \nwill work. I think any reasonable person, though, will acknowledge that \nit is almost impossible to predict with a degree of certainty what will \nhappen if this passes.\n  I hope we can improve the proposal by passing amendments. But there \nis a second refrain you will hear on the floor, I expect, time and time \nagain: This is the best we could do. This is the best we could do. We \nhave to pass exactly what the House sent to us, because we have never \nbeen so close before. We have to take what is before us. For example, I \nwill, in my opening statement here, make reference to some Governors \nand others who have suggested that a capital budget is a good idea. \nWhen I ask people why it is a bad idea, the Senator from Illinois gives \nme his well-thought-out rationale why it is not necessary or why it is \ncounterproductive. Most others look at me and say: ``We cannot fool \nwith this or tamper with this because it is the only game in town now. \nWe are getting perilously close, and we cannot change anything at \nall.''\n  I respectfully suggest that that is not a very enlightened way to \ndeal with amending the Constitution. I cannot say that I am optimistic \nthat the improvements, from my perspective, that I and others will \nsuggest will be accepted. I fear that there are those who will believe \nthat the mere fact that we will suggest improvements is really designed \nto kill the amendment. The truth of the matter is that these amendments \nare designed to make it better. I will speak to the specific changes I \nwould like to see. But the changes I suggest will not in any way \nundermine the principle of this amendment and would make it more \nworkable, not less workable.\n  Whether or not we amend this amendment, Mr. President, this balanced \nbudget amendment, may in fact \n[[Page S1818]] change our ways. Perhaps we will use the opportunity of \na constitutional constraint and make the tough choices to restore \nsobriety to our budget process. I devoutly hope so.\n  Of course, it may be that we will decide that the economic and \npolitical cost of an annual budget balance are not worth the benefits. \nIt may be that we will make use of both the legitimate escape clauses \nin this amendment, and other, unforeseen devices to evade the intent of \nthe amendment. Mr. President, I hope we do not, if this passes.\n  We, quite frankly, cannot be sure that a vote for this amendment will \nhave the effect the authors promise. But we can be sure that if we try \nnothing, we will remain on the path that we have been on for too many \nyears now, with the notable exception of the last 3 years under the \nleadership of this President. I know the stereotype is that all \nDemocrats are big spenders and that all Republicans are conscientious \nwith the taxpayers' dollars. Obviously, history does not support that \nconclusion. If we had not had the Reagan budgets that we all voted on--\nand we could have stopped them--but had we not had the Reagan budgets \nand that unusual theory of the Laffer curve, we would have a budget in \nbalance right now. It's out of balance just because of the interest \naccumulated on and the debt that has occurred as a consequence of the \nReagan additional deficits--I should not say Reagan--the deficits \nproduced by Reagan and the Democratic Congress both.\n  But we will hear a good deal of hyperbole on this amendment. Its \nsupporters promise that it is a cure-all, and its opponents promise \nthat, if it passes, we are going to go to hell in a hand basket rapidly \nand all our liberties will be taken from us. I hope we keep our eye on \nthe ball here and at least have an open mind to the prospect that we \ncan make this amendment better and still have an amendment.\n  We will continue to add every year to the debt burden of future \ngenerations. We will steal today from the future, squeezing out the \nsavings and investments that could increase our future wealth if we do \nnot do something about stopping the size of these deficits, even if we \ndo not actually balance the budget, if we do not make a change.\n  The Senator from Iowa pointed out--I think I heard him say, and I \nstand to be corrected--that in 1969, the last time we balanced the \nbudget, for every tax dollar collected, six cents, or thereabouts, went \nto pay interest on the debt,\n and every tax dollar collected in 1993 or 1994--I forget which year he \nused, maybe it was 1991--but anyway, every tax dollar collected in the \nlast year or so, 29 cents, I believe was the number he gave, or 26 \ncents, goes to pay interest on the debt.\n\n  I am sure someone has looked out over the next 15 years and concluded \nthat if we stay on the track, even the one predicted by the President \nof the United States, that we will be requiring an increasingly larger \nshare of every tax dollar just to pay the interest on the debt.\n  And to me that is the driving force behind this amendment. To me, the \nbeginning, middle, and end is not whether there is a mechanism that \nguarantees a balanced budget amendment. It is not whether or not there \nis any magic about it being actually in balance. It is not whether or \nnot we come close. It is about that increasingly larger proportion of \nthe tax dollars collected going for the most useless investment of \npaying interest on the debt.\n  When I introduced my budget freeze proposal years ago, the liberals \nof my party said, ``It's an awful thing you are doing, Joe. All the \nprograms we care about, you are freezing them--money for the blind, the \ndisabled, education and so on.''\n  My argument then is one I make now, which is the strongest, most \ncompelling reason to be for this amendment--or an amendment--that if we \ndo not do that, all the things I care most about are going to be gone--\ngone. So what do we have? We end up with essentially a net reduction in \nthe programs that I cared about over the last 10 years, a net increase \nin other programs, and a net increase in the portion of the budget that \ngoes to pay interest on the debt.\n  So the people I care most about--the reason I ran for public office \nin the first place--are the people that got hurt the most in this \nprocess and are likely to get hurt the most because they are the \nweakest in our society. When an interest group like the PTA comes down \nhere to support money for education, and other interest groups support \nmoney for tax expenditures for major businesses, I have no doubt who is \ngoing to win that fight. I have no doubt how that is going to turn out.\n  So if this debt continues to increase, we will continue to tie our \nhands and our ability--indeed, our responsibility--to set national \npriorities in our annual budget process because of the interest on the \ndebt required to be paid every year.\n  This year, the interest on the national debt will cost us $235 \nbillion. The entire domestic discretionary budget will be $253 billion.\n  Now we use phrases like that ``discretionary budget,'' and my staff \nwrites that stuff in. And I keep telling them nobody in the world but \npeople in this Chamber and inside the beltway know what ``discretionary \nbudget'' means.\n  Let me translate. The discretionary budget includes everything from \nthe FBI to education, from help for the mentally retarded to the \nLibrary of Congress. That is everything. Everything out there that \npeople think is the place where we are wasting money, that people think \nis the place we can cut to cut the deficit, does not include Social \nSecurity, does not include entitlement programs, does not include \ninterest on the debt. The point is, it is all those things that \neverybody when I go home who says, ``Joe, if you just cut the waste in \nGovernment''--if we shut down every department in the Government, we \nwould in effect have an inability to balance the budget in the outyears \nbecause we are already talking about interest on the debt equaling \nalmost the same amount of money of all the money we spend on the \nGovernment for what the average person thinks are Government \nexpenditures. They do not usually think of Social Security as a \nGovernment expenditure. They do not think of the things we generally \ntalk about as the big-ticket items here as expenditures.\n  By the time this amendment is intended to become law, in the year \n2002, the interest on our debt will be $344 billion, larger than every \nother category in the budget except Social Security. That is just \ninterest on the debt.\n  If we do nothing, our inability to control the growth of debt, and \nthe cost of carrying that debt, will tie our hands, preventing us from \nshifting resources to meet changing needs, which is the essence, in my \nview, of responsible budgeting, responsible Government.\n  So, Mr. President, the question before us today and in the coming \nweeks is not the simple one: ``Are you for balancing the budget or \nnot?'' Under most circumstances, everyone would agree we should balance \nour books.\n  No, it seems to me Mr. President the question is: ``Does our repeated \nfailure to balance the budget necessitate a response that all of us \nagree is extraordinary?'' And that is amending the Constitution.\n  It is by no means that clear that the amendment before us will \neliminate deficits. It certainly will make deficits more difficult--\nwhich in and of itself is a worthy undertaking--but with a three-fifths \nvote, we can in fact continue to borrow.\n  And I hope no one is under the delusion that by hook or by crook some \nfuture Congress, less virtuous than we, will not be able to find ways \naround the restrictions in this amendment.\n  With little faith in human nature, but a healthy respect for human \ningenuity, we should have no delusions on that count.\n  I think both the supporters and the opponents of this amendment quite \nfrankly overstate the case, though.\n  I expect the supporters of this balanced budget amendment will, as \nthey already have, proclaim it as a panacea that will cure a structural \ndefect in the way that a democratically elected legislature weighs \nfiscal responsibility against the demands of constituents. The \nsupporters will proclaim its passage as the end of deficit spending.\n  The opponents of this amendment may agree that it will drastically \nchange our Government, but, they will argue, for the worse. I expect \nthey will describe the pain that the deep cuts will cause to the \nAmerican people--the elderly, the poor, the military, the \n[[Page S1819]] farmers, and the rest who depend on Government--and \npaint a bleak picture of life under a balanced budget regime.\n  I say to my colleagues on both sides of this debate that all these \nclaims overstate the case.\n  This amendment will not magically cause deficits to disappear. The \nhard work of cutting must still be done--and it should be done by us.\n  This is hard work. Evidence the fact that everybody acknowledges that \nthe President's budget package reduced the deficit, yet everyone went \nout last year and ran on this gigantic tax increase. It increased it \nonly for the very wealthy. The middle-class taxpayers paid no more. In \nfact, they got reductions in some cases. And those who were low- or \nmiddle-class income taxpayers with children, they got an actual \nreduction in their taxes.\n  But yet this thing, this horrible thing we did, which touched the top \n1 percent of all the taxpayers in America in any meaningful way, was so \nhorrible and so bad--even though, by the way, in that same document the \nPresident said and we voted that we would freeze spending; we would \nfreeze spending in all these other categories--it was so bad the other \nside could not even muster up the courage to give one single, solitary \nvote for reducing the budget deficit by a half-trillion dollars over \nthe outyears. And the deficit went down. It actually went down.\n  Yet, if they could not muster the courage for that vote--which \nobviously cost a lot politically because if you notice there are fewer \ndesks on this side of the aisle than there are on that side of the \naisle; obviously they were right, politically anyway. If they could not \nmuster the courage for that vote, how are we going to find over $1 \ntrillion to cut?\n  I mean, this is incredible. It is incredible the degree of self-\ndelusion you will see us all engage in over the next couple days, the \nnext couple weeks. But this amendment will not magically cause deficits \nto disappear.\n  Nor will this amendment turn democratically elected officials in \nCongress, as the opponents say, into hardhearted authoritarians who \nwill ignore the cries of their constituents. That is what my friends \nopposed to this amendment basically will say.\n  Even under this amendment, the economy will falter and need shoring \nup. That is going to happen no matter what we pass. I do not think \nanyone can tell me that this amendment is going to take us out of the \ncycles we have been in for the of the past 200 years, particularly the \npast 60 years. The economy will falter at some point and it will need \nshoring up.\n  Foreign dictators will rattle their swords and we will be called upon \nto respond by spending billions of dollars to send armies somewhere.\n  Rains will fall and plains will flood, and Federal disaster relief \nwill be called for, to the tune of billions of dollars. I remember \nwhen, in the section of the country of my friend from Illinois, he and \nothers were in here pleading that we should continue to reroute the \nMississippi and every other river in America and we should reimburse \npeople for that disaster.\n And most Members stepped up to the ball and helped. Now our friends on \nthe west coast are accurately pointing out that there is billions of \ndollars worth of damage because of earthquakes and fires and floods and \nrains. Are such natural disasters going to stop? Is anyone going to \nsuggest that this balanced budget amendment will send a message to God, \nas well, and say, ``OK, God, we balance our budget, now you hold off \nfrom here on.''\n\n  Our population will age, and the need to support the medical and \nsocial needs of those who supported us when we needed it will not \ndiminish. It will grow. Costs will grow. And on and on and on and on.\n  I predict that from time to time--perhaps more frequently--three-\nfifths of Members in Congress will agree that some need of our people \nis so great that we will agree that this year we will not balance the \nbudget, or this year we will screw up the courage to have people pay \nfor what they say they want through the Tax Code.\n  I realize, incidentally, that is a horrible thing to suggest. I \nalways find interesting, everything that we hear about the balanced \nbudget--with the notable exception of my friend from Illinois and a few \nothers that are the chief sponsors of this--is always in terms of ``cut \nspending.''\n  Whatever happened to the old conservative discipline about paying for \nwhat you spend? Paying for what you spend. I thought that meant that if \nwe spend, then we ought to tell people how much it will cost to spend. \nIf they do not want Members to spend, then we should not spend. But if \nthey want to spend, we should be honest, must tell them what it will \ncost.\n  Which brings me to the argument raised by some that before passing \nthis amendment we should tell the American people how we intend to \nbalance the budget. There are those who claim that this is just a sham \non the part of the opponents of the balanced budget amendment. Well, I \nam not an opponent of that amendment, but I want to tell Members it \ndoes not seem to be unrealistic for someone to lay out in broad details \nat least how it will work. Those people say, ``Wait a minute; if you \nare for the balanced budget amendment, you ought to say how to balance \nit.'' Most people who are against the balanced budget amendment are not \nsaying that we have to balance the budget; they are saying that our \nbudget should be somewhere around 19 percent of GNP, that we should not \nput ourselves in the position where we are out of whack. They argue, \nlike many economists, that balancing the budget in and of itself is not \na sacred undertaking and could be counterproductive.\n  It seems to me that we should tell the American people. I look at the \npolls out there. For example, I want to go on record, and I am up for \nreelection this year, and I will remind everybody what I did at home, \nwhich will cost me politically. When I argued that we should freeze \nFederal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and \nMedicaid. I meant veterans benefits. I meant every single solitary \nthing in the Government. And I not only tried it once, I tried it \ntwice, I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time.\n  Somebody has to tell me in here how we are going to do this hard work \nwithout dealing with any of those sacred cows, some deserving more \nprotection than others. I am not quite sure how you get from here to \nthere. I am sure that we should tell the American people straight up \nthat such an amendment is going to require some big changes.\n  The balanced budget amendment will not end our deficit in one fell \nswoop, nor will it cause our Nation to turn its back overnight on those \nwho depend on us. All it means, as the Senator from Utah said, is that \nwe will have to stand up more often and be counted on these things. I \nfind that a good thing, not a bad thing.\n  As we begin this debate, let Members keep a decent perspective on the \ntrue consequences of this amendment. It is important that we not \noverstate nor overpromise what the amendment will do. Let Members \ndebate this amendment with all the seriousness that a constitutional \namendment requires, to ensure that the amendment we propose to the \nStates and the American people merits the honor of being included in \nour most fundamental covenant of self-rule.\n  So what, then, are the concerns that many Members, those so-called \nundecided voters, bring to this debate?\n  First and perhaps foremost, it seems to me we must examine whether \nthe amendment is likely to shift the balance of power between the \nbranches of Government to an extent never experienced or expected by \nour forefathers. It was the wise position of the drafters of the \nConstitution in 1787 that the Congress, being the most representative \nbranch, the most democratic, and the most sensitive to--and ironically \nthat is why we are needing this amendment. Everybody should not lose \nsight of that. We say that Congress is not responsive, and that we \nshould be more responsive to people; and then we are told the reason we \nneed this amendment is we are too responsive to the people. Whatever \nthey come and ask for we give to them in a painless way. Kind of \nfascinating how we sort of turn these arguments to whatever benefit the \nmoment allows.\n  The fact is we are the most representative branch. We do respond to \nthe people, and that is how we were supposed to respond based on what \nour Founders intended. And we are the \n[[Page S1820]] most democratic and most sensitive to the public needs.\n  Because of all that, the drafters of the Constitution spent a lot of \ntime debating this little point on the second floor in Philadelphia, \nbecause they did not want the debate to take place on the first floor. \nThey were afraid people would eavesdrop and hear what is going on. This \nwas before ``Government in the sunshine.'' The delegates to the \nConstitutional Convention sat in the second floor so people could not \nwalk by and eavesdrop. What they were saying on the second floor is, \n``Look, if we are going to give the power to tax and spend, we better \ngive it to the outfit that will most directly respond to the people. \nTaxes, we will give that to those guys in the House that get elected \nevery 2 years. We do not want the Senators--who were not popularly \nelected in those days--to do that. They can only respond to a tax bill \nproposed by the House.''\n  So there was a real solid reason why, in setting out the balance of \npower, taxing and spending was put in the Congress. James Madison, who \nis recognized as the father of the Constitution, called this power of \nthe purse ``the most complete and effectual weapon with which any \nConstitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people for \nobtaining a redress of every grievance and for carrying into effect \nevery just and salutary measure.''\n  That power of the purse has remained with the Congress for over 200 \nyears. This amendment threatens to take away a good deal of that power \nand to share it with the President, a fundamental shift of authority \nthat will irretrievably alter the balance of power established in the \nConstitution.\n  Senators might say, well, how, in fact, does this amendment threaten \nto shift the power to the President? Because, I am convinced, \nPresidents will seize on the language of this amendment to claim a \nconstitutional power to impound; that is, to refuse to spend money that \nCongress has duly appropriated. This power to impound would give the \nPresident wide-ranging authority to undo or redo Congress' spending \npriorities without limits, or at least so a President would claim.\n  Now, you may say no President will do that, Joe, and as a Democrat I \nam happy that this guy downtown is of my party. I am sure he would not \ndo that. But let me ask you, what do you think Nixon did? What do you \nthink old Lyndon Johnson would have done? What do you think Franklin \nRoosevelt would have done with his power? Now, maybe we are not going \nto have any more Roosevelts--I hope that is not true--or Johnsons or \nNixons, but we just may very well.\n  What does it mean for a President to wield this power? It means the \nPresident could decide to change the way the Congress had allocated \nfunding in spending bills; for example, taking away money that ensures \nthat small States get their fair share. Let me be parochial for a \nmoment. I am a Senator from Delaware, one of the smallest States in the \nUnion, the fifth smallest population in the Union.\n  When we pass bills here to make sure that all persons benefit, \nwhether they live in New Hampshire or Delaware or Utah or Wyoming or \nAlaska or other small States, we sit and we make sure the formulas we \nwrite into the bills do not let all of the money go just on a per \ncapita basis. We usually get together--and there are probably somewhere \nbetween 18 and 20 of us, that is, States who find themselves in that \nposition. Well, if the President gets to the end of the line here, the \nbudget is not in balance, we have not passed a balanced budget--I might \nadd we will not know whether or not this will be in balance as we go \nalong because it is based upon predicted revenues. So we spend based on \npredicted revenues. That does not account for emergencies. That does \nnot count significant downturns in the economy, or a lot of other \nthings that come into play.\n  But if, at the end of the line, we pass a budget that we thought was \nin balance but, in fact, was out of balance, that means the President, \nunder this amendment, arguably, could say, ``That is my job. I will \nredo this.'' I know what I would do if I were President and I wanted to \nbalance the budget. I would pick off the smallest States and cut the \nmoneys that were allocated for them. They are the least powerful in \nCongress. They cannot do much. They do not have that many \nRepresentatives. Over here, because we make up a minority, we might \nfind ourselves in difficulty.\n  Now maybe a President would not do that. But he would have that \npower, under the amendment. The President could change detailed policy \nset by Congress; he could conclude on his own that Congress put, for \nexample, too many military bases in South Carolina or Kansas or was \nspending too much on medical treatment in Utah or Mississippi.\n  Do we really want to give the President that kind of power?\n   I think not.\n\n  Along with this power to spend, according to Walter Dellinger, a \nnoted constitutional scholar and now the President's top constitutional \nadviser, this amendment could even be construed to give the President \nthe power to levy taxes, to raise needed revenues. I think that is much \nmore unlikely, quite frankly, although it is arguably possible.\n  Do we want to give the President that kind of power? I do not think \nwe do.\n  In committee, I supported Senator Kennedy in offering an amendment to \nmake it absolutely clear that the balanced budget amendment is not \nintended to shift to the President a major piece of Congress' \nhistorical power to tax and spend.\n  Not a single one of my colleagues that I am aware of disagreed with \nthe point of the amendment. Nobody disagreed with the point of the \namendment. Some said not to worry, it cannot happen, or it probably \nwill not happen, or it is unlikely to happen. But everyone acknowledged \nthat if it happened, it would be a bad thing. And yet a majority, all \nthe Republicans and a couple of Democrats, voted en bloc to defeat this \namendment claiming it was not necessary, that after-the-fact \nlegislation could take care of the problem, the so-called enabling \nlegislation.\n  I sure would like to know that before we pass this. I would like to \nknow whether or not a President can do that. Why do we not just make it \nclear that Congress has the power to resolve any discrepancy between \nspending and revenues that is left at the end of the year--the \nCongress, not the President.\n  Now, maybe that is what the Congress will do. Maybe the President \nwill not over-reach. But I have never seen, as a student of history, \nany time where there has been a vacuum in power created that the \nadministration, Democrat or Republican, has not stepped in to fill. And \nI have seen very few times when the Congress on its own volition has \nstepped up to the ball to fill a vacuum when filling the vacuum would \nrequire them to make hard decisions. And so I do not think it is \nunreasonable to suggest that future Presidents may seek this authority \nto impound.\n  It's not necessary to spell out in the amendment that the President \nshould not have this power? Well, I say that a principle as important \nas preserving the balance of power should be stated as plainly and \nboldly as possible in the balanced budget amendment itself.\n  Now, as we debate this, I will be happy to hear anyone say that the \nPresident should have that power. I suspect everyone is going to say he \nshould not and this amendment does not give it to him.\n  Well, if that is true, what is the big deal of including it in the \namendment? It is not inartful. It can be artfully done. It does not \nruin the symmetry of the amendment. It does not go to the heart of \nwhether we have to balance the amendment. It merely says we are not \ngoing to shift the balance of power, no doubt about it.\n  Our Constitution, that durable and flexible document, has endured for \nover 200 years. The chief reason it has endured is because the self-\ncorrecting checks and balances that have kept one branch from \ndominating the other have been maintained. In the days to come, I will \nsupport, if not offer, efforts to modify this amendment to ensure that \nin addressing this important issue we do not risk undoing 200 years of \nhistory.\n  The second concern that I have is not a constitutional one. It is a \nvery practical one but no less important for that fact. The balanced \nbudget amendment makes no provision for a capital budget to pay for \nlong-term capital improvements. This amendment will require \n[[Page S1821]] the Federal Government to pay for capital improvements--\nroads, bridges, schools, aircraft carriers, all of which are designed \nto last for decades--on a pay-as-you-go basis.\n  Now, this is not the way States or local governments or our families \nor businesses, for that matter, treat these sorts of long-term items. \nNo. All of these recognize that it is permissible, even prudent, to go \ninto debt to pay for long-term items such as a house, a factory, or a \nroad or an aircraft carrier. State and local governments that are \nrequired to balance their budgets every year are permitted by their \nbalanced budget rules to set up capital budgets. They are permitted to \nborrow money to pay for long-term capital items even though they must \nbalance the rest of their budget.\n  Now, we hear the phrase used all the time: ``States do this; why \ncan't we do it?'' States do not do this. If you look at the numbers, \nthe total accumulated debt of the States over a comparable period for \nthe Federal Government over the last two decades, the States have \nincreased debt more rapidly than the Federal Government--almost a 2-to-\n1 margin.\n  So before you get on the floor and pound your chest about how your \nState balances its budget, say how would your State balance this budget \nif it had the same exact amendment as this.\n  Now, some States may. Mine does not. Mine is a little tighter, quite \nfrankly, but we are smaller and we are more manageable. Most States \nthat have balanced budget amendments do not, do not, in fact, balance \ntheir budgets. They have a capital budget which allows them to go in \ndebt. I believe the Federal Government should have the same ability to \nborrow to pay for capital items as State and local governments do and \nthat we should amend the balanced budget amendment to assure that we \ngive proper weight to our long-term needs.\n  I am not alone in this view. The Wall Street Journal editorial page, \nthat bastion of conservative thought, has criticized the balanced \nbudget amendment because it lacks such a capital budget. Here is what \nthe Wall Street Journal had to say.\n\n       To understand the economics, start here:\n\n  Referring to the balanced budget amendment.\n\n       Start here. If all American households were required to \n     balance their budgets every year, no one would ever buy a \n     house.\n       Of course, households don't think about their budgets that \n     way; they figure `balance' means meeting their mortgage \n     payments. Similarly, State and local governments with a \n     ``balanced budget'' requirement can still borrow money for \n     capital improvements.\n\n  So I say to everyone here in the gallery as they walk out and say, \n``We balance our budget; why doesn't the Federal Government do it the \nway we do,'' well, unless you are a very wealthy person--even then it \nwould not be good economics to do it this way--unless you are a very \nwealthy person and paid cash for your house and paid cash for your car, \nyou do not balance your budget. You do not balance your budget like \nthis amendment requires it to be balanced.\n  I want the Federal Government to have to balance their budget the way \nhouseholds have to balance their budgets, the way States have to \nbalance their budgets. And that is with a capital budget. I have a \ncapital budget--I have a mortgage on my house. I have a capital \nbudget--well, I do not have a capital budget on my car, but most \npeople, when they buy a new car, have a capital budget. I meet that by \npaying as everyone does and the States do, paying on it monthly, in my \ncase, and the States yearly, the cost of that borrowing and the \nprincipal. We pay it down. We pay it off. But the Federal budget, under \nthis amendment, would not allow that.\n  Now, Gov. Mike Leavitt of Utah, a prime supporter of enacting the \nbalanced budget amendment, testified before the Judiciary Committee \nthat his State has a capital budget provision and recommended that we \nlook further into the question before enacting House Joint Resolution \n1.\n  My own Governor, Gov. Tom Carper, former Congressman of 10 years here \nin Washington, the strongest supporter from my delegation for a \nbalanced budget amendment, a Democrat, told our Constitutional \nSubcommittee the same thing last year.\n  But despite that good advice, this balanced budget amendment does not \nfollow that almost universal practice of capital budgets because it \nfails to set up a separate capital budget for major physical \nimprovements. It will surely mean less of those improvements, or we \nwill make those improvements and we will further cut in other areas of \nthe budget or raise taxes in other areas of the budget which will cause \nmore great pain, when the more reasonable way to do it would be to do \nit the way the States and households do it. After all, if families \ncould not borrow to pay for their houses, there would be many fewer \nhomeowners. And if States could not borrow to build their roads, there \nwould be many fewer roads.\n  Why enact a balanced budget amendment and fail to distinguish between \nprojects that merit long-term financing and those that should be funded \nfrom year to year? Under this balanced budget amendment, the incentive \nwill be to focus only on those spending priorities that have short-term \npayoffs, economically and politically. That is not good for rebuilding \nthe infrastructure of this country, which we all say we have to do to \ncompete internationally. Because that is where the political pressure \nwill come.\n  If, in my State, they come to me and say why do you not vote to spend \nmore money for the Corps of Engineers that will allow them to dredge \nthe Delaware River and the Port of Wilmington, why do you not do that \nversus spending more money for drug treatment programs.\n  I know when I hear a mallet going down; I can tell it.\n  I yield to the President, obviously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the hour of 12:30 \nhaving arrived, the Senate will stand in recess until the hour of 2:15.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, unless it is \ncontrary to a standing rule, that I be able to take 10 more minutes to \nfinish my statement, unless someone objects to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. We used to do that in the bad old days when the Democrats \ncontrolled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Without a capital budget provision, I fear, this amendment \ncould skew the way we spend money, and in a way that could hurt the \nlong-term future investments this country needs. It does not have to be \nthis way.\n  In committee I offered an amendment to provide for a capital budget. \nIt was modeled on the capital budget provisions in the States, \nincluding my own State of Delaware.\n  My amendment established a capital budget for major public physical \ncapital investments. It limited that budget to 10 percent of total \noutlays--about what the Federal Government has spent on such items in \nrecent years. It required a three-fifths vote of both Houses to place \nany item within that capital budget.\n  My amendment was not designed to build a loophole into a balanced \nbudget amendment. Under my amendment, it would not be easier to treat \nan item as a capital budget item as opposed to a current item. It would \nbe harder. It would require a three-fifths vote. But it would be right.\n  My amendment failed in committee. Without a capital budget provision, \nI fear that, not right away but as the years go by, this amendment may \nskew the way the country invests for the future and we may be able to \nbalance our budget in the end, but we will not spend our money as \nwisely as we should.\n  A third concern about this balanced budget amendment relates to the \nway this amendment treats a program that is arguably the most important \nand most depended-upon program in the Federal Government.\n  I am talking about Social Security. As we all know, the Social \nSecurity trust fund is designed to spread costs over many years of \ncaring for working people after they retire. We pay in today, so 10 or \n20 or 40 or 50 years from now we can live out our lives, knowing that \nwe have that minimum Social Security payment.\n  The Social Security fund is not supposed to be in balance every year \nor even every 10 years. It is meant to be \n[[Page S1822]] balanced over the decades. As this generation of working \npeople pays its Social Security taxes the Social Security trust fund is \ngathering in a surplus of tens of billions of dollars. Because the \nPresiding Officer and myself and others are of a generation that is the \nbaby boom generation, or just before that generation, we pay in tens of \nbillions of dollars in excess of what is drawn down by present Social \nSecurity recipients--my mom and dad and my uncles and aunts. So there \nis a surplus. A surplus of $100 billion will be paid in each year, more \nthan is taken out, around the year 2000--$100 billion surplus.\n  Right now $60 billion more is paid in this year by those of us paying \nour FICA tax than is paid out to Social Security recipients--$60 \nbillion. My mom and dad think that money goes into an account. They \nthink that is over there for Social Security. A lot of people in my \ngeneration who in 15 years will be eligible for Social Security think \nthat money is being put in an account. Guess what, folks? We are \nspending it. We are spending it now.\n  But before the year 2014, that Social Security trust fund will have \ngenerated a great surplus. But after 2014, we will have substantial \ndeficits. The reason for that is that the baby boom generation will be \ncollecting Social Security and my sons and daughter will be paying into \nit. There are fewer of them than there are of us. So fewer people will \nbe paying in and more people will be taking out. It sounds like I am \nstating what is obvious to everyone but it is not obvious to everyone, \nobviously. The fact of the matter is, after the year 2014 we will be in \ndeficit in the Social Security System.\n  The balanced budget amendment makes no provision whatsoever for the \nunique characteristics of the Social Security trust fund. Instead, it \ntreats Social Security revenues and outlays as ordinary Federal budget.\n  This means in the years that Social Security is generating hundreds \nof billions of dollars in surplus revenues it will be used to cover \nhundreds of billions of dollars worth of deficits that the rest of the \nFederal budget is creating.\n  After 2014, when the trust fund goes into deficit to the tune of tens \nor hundreds of billions of dollars a year, we in Congress will have to \ncut that much from the rest of the budget to make up for the deficit.\n  What does it mean? It means that for the next 20 years or so, \nrevenues from the Social Security trust fund will make it look like we \nhave balanced the budget when in fact we have not, and after that the \nhuge outlays from the trust fund will force drastic reductions in the \nrest of Federal spending, or drastic reductions in Social Security. And \nthat means the pain of cutting will be delayed by years from the \neffective date of this amendment, but it will be that much sharper when \nit comes.\n  So we should get Social Security out of this mix, make it clear that \nthe balanced budget amendment does not deal with Social Security, it is \nnot able to use the surpluses and not deal with the deficits. We should \nbe more honest about it with people because Social Security is at \nstake, in my view.\n  For all the reasons I have stated I supported Senator Feinstein's \namendment in the Judiciary Committee to keep Social Security right \nwhere it is now: off budget. The Feinstein amendment recognizes Social \nSecurity is not designed to balance its budget every year but over the \nyears, and it recognizes we cannot honestly balance the rest of our \nFederal budget if Social Security and its huge swings are included. It \nrecognizes that Social Security is a unique institution that deserves \nunique protection.\n  The fourth concern I have is this amendment will shift power to the \nlarge States at the expense of small States. By imposing supermajority \nrequirements of three-fifths on both Houses it permits a minority of \ntwo-fifths plus one to block an unbalanced budget, no matter how \nnecessary for our fiscal and economic health it may be. This minority \nveto could be marshaled by representatives of just the five or six \nlargest States in America. If the five or six largest States in America \nget together and agree on something that they need that the rest of the \nStates do not want, they can prevent us from acting on a national \nemergency by all of them voting as a block--just six or even five of \nour 50 States.\n  The fifth and final concern is that nothing in this amendment forces \nCongress to begin the work of cutting the budget before the year 2002, \nthe first year we require. What will happen when Congress tries to \nbalance the budget all of a sudden in fiscal year 2002? I fear it will \nbe cause an economic disaster. This amendment ought to have some \nmechanism to guarantee our Government and our economy moves toward a \nbalanced budget on a ``glide path,'' a gradual descent in the deficit \nthat will get us to a balanced budget without forcing a crash landing \nin the final year. But this amendment does not do that. It is possible \nit could be done by enabling legislation but I would sure like to see \nit.\n  In the days ahead I and my colleagues will be offering amendments to \naddress these and other legitimate concerns. I hope these amendments \nreceive the full debate they deserve. There are none in this body, I \nhope, who will argue that an amendment to the Constitution is not \nworthy to receive that full and open debate.\n  Under the watchful eyes of our forefathers and with the humility that \nthis awesome task engenders, as the debate unfolds in the days to come \nI will listen to my colleagues, I will support amendments designed to \nimprove this amendment, and I will urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I hope at the end of the process I will be able to do what I intend \non doing now, and that is to vote for a balanced budget amendment.\n  I thank the Chair for its indulgence and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the comments of \nSenator Biden. Although Senator Biden has enunciated many reasons for \nand against the balanced budget amendment, I want to respond to an \namendment he intends to proffer, one he made at the Judiciary Committee \nmarkup on Senate Joint Resolution 1.\n  This proposed exemption for so-called capital investments could help \nevade the purpose of the balanced budget amendment or make it \nsubstantially more difficult for future Congresses to make capital \ninvestments. I confess that I am not certain of the purpose of the \namendment as it is drafted. It appears to be a provision at war with \nitself. The first sentence seems to encourage capital investments by \ntaking it out of the balanced budget rule. But the last two sentences, \nseem to be designed to discourage capital investments.\n  I believe such an exemption raises real problems for five reasons.\n  First, this provision opens up a loophole in the balanced budget rule \nand unduly limits Congress' ability to make capital investments. There \nwould be a powerful incentive for Congress and the President to help \nbalance the budget by redefining more programs as capital investments. \nA gimmick capital budget exemption could actually endanger capital \ninvestments as fake investments crowd out real capital investment.\n  Furthermore, the 10-percent limit ties the hands of future Congresses \nwhich may choose among the competing programs to fund more capital \ninvestments than this limit would allow. With all the talk about the \nneed for infrastructure investment from my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle, I am surprised they would want to tie Congress' hands this \nway. A future Congress may justifiably decide to make greater \ninvestments in this area.\n  Moreover, I do not understand what the three-fifths vote requirement \nadds to the amendment other than to make it procedurally harder for \nCongress to make any capital investments, regardless of their effect on \nthe deficit. If a given capital investment were to create a deficit and \nhad support of three-fifths of the Members of each House, it could be \npassed under the balanced budget amendment as it stands without this \namendment. If a capital investment was paid for and did not increase \nthe deficit, I do not know why the proponents of this amendment would \nwant to require a three-fifths vote to make that investment. For what \npossible purpose would we want to discourage future Congresses from \nenacting such investments?\n  The proponents must think that a large part of our problem is that we \nspend too much on ``major public physical capital investments'' as \nopposed to \n[[Page S1823]] simple transfer payments or social programs. Apparently, \nwhatever three-fifths of the membership of future Congresses think, the \nproponents of this amendment believe that in no case should the United \nStates invest more than 10 percent of its budget in ``major public \nphysical capital investments.'' Otherwise, I see no reason for this \namendment. It is surely a mistake to put such limits on future \nCongresses.\n  Second, the loophole problem is aggravated by the fact that there is \nno standard definition of a capital budget. For example, in President \nClinton's proposed fiscal year 1995 budget, OMB lists four broad \ncategories of programs that may or may not be considered capital \nexpenditures--OMB, Analytical Perspectives, Proposed fiscal year 1995 \nBudget, p. 114. Even within those four broad categories there are \nquestions about what programs should be included. The amendment's \nattempt to cure the definitional problem only raises new definitional \nproblems. The definition given is circular. And just what does ``major \npublic physical capital investment'' mean? Each term is subject to \nsubstantial debate. It is particularly inappropriate to place capital \nbudgeting in the Constitution when there is no agreement on what \nconstitutes a capital budget.\n  Third, the Constitution is not the place to set budget priorities. \nThe balanced budget amendment seeks to create a process in which \nprograms compete for a limited pool of resources. A constitutional \namendment should be timeless and reflect a broad consensus, not make \nnarrow policy decisions. This exemption creates in the founding \ndocument a new constitutional budget subdivision with a percentage cap \nand a procedural limitation on using it. We should not place technical \nlanguage or insert statutory programs into the Constitution and \nundercut the simplicity and universality of the amendment.\n  Fourth, a capital budget exemption is unnecessary. Total Federal \nspending has generally been above 20 percent of GDP, and less than 4 \npercent of Federal outlays are for nondefense physical investment, one \nof the possible definitions of ``capital investment''. Given the \nrelatively small and constant share that such capital expenditures have \nin a very large Federal budget, there is no need to remove capital \nexpenditures from the general budget.\n  One example illustrates the lack of need for a capital budget. \nAlthough President Eisenhower initially proposed that the Federal \nInterstate Highway System be financed through borrowing, Congress \ndecided to keep it on budget and finance it through a gas tax at the \nsuggestion of Senator Albert Gore, Sr. We are unlikely to have a \ncapital expenditure of this magnitude again. But if we do there is no \nreason to create an exemption for such investment or to limit the \npercent of the budget that goes for such investment.\n  Fifth, capital spending should compete in the budget like all other \nspending. The balanced budget amendment seeks to foster an atmosphere \nin which Congress prioritizes spending options. Senate Joint Resolution \n1 does not prevent the creation of a separate operating and capital \naccounts, but any implementing legislation which creates such separate \naccounts must leave the total budget in balance, since implementing \nlegislation cannot subvert the clear mandate of the amendment. And such \naccounting techniques should not subvert prioritizing function of the \namendment. The proposed exemption allows the entire budget to be used \nfor noncapital investment, like simple transfer payments, and then \nallows a 10-percent increase in Federal spending--and debt to fund it--\nfor capital investments. The General Accounting Office saw the fallacy \nimplicit in this exemption when it said, ``The choice between spending \nfor investment and spending for consumption should be seen as setting \nof priorities within an overall fiscal constraint, not as a reason for \nrelaxing that constraint and permitting a larger deficit.''\n  To the extent that the three-fifths vote requirement for capital \ninvestments replicates the general provisions of the balanced budget \namendment, this amendment is simply pointless. To the extent it goes \nfurther, it is a meritless straitjacket on the competition between \nlegitimate spending options in the overall budget process.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/31/senate-section/article/S1806-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The pending business is House Joint Resolution \n1, the balanced budget amendment.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, in 1992, I campaigned for the Senate as a supporter of \nthe balanced budget amendment. I was an original cosponsor of the \namendment voted on in the last Congress, Senate Joint Resolution 41, \nand I am an original cosponsor of the amendment being considered today. \nYet, despite my consistent, outspoken record on this issue, my backing \nof the balanced budget amendment surprises some people.\n  In fact, Mr. President, I would add that I went to mass on Sunday, \nand the social justice committee had:\n\n       Senator Moseley-Braun is a possible ``no.'' Please contact \n     her to be against this amendment.\n\n  So I want to clarify the record, and I want early on to take this \nopportunity to tell those of you in this body and my constituents \nlistening at home on C-SPAN why I so strongly believe it is imperative \nthat Congress pass the balanced budget amendment and without delay.\n  I come from a working class family. My father was a Chicago police \nofficer. My mother was a laboratory technician. We were not what you \nwould call wealthy, or upper-middle class. We did not have a lot of \nmaterial goods, and my parents couldn't afford to send us to fancy \nprivate schools. My parents had to keep track of every dollar to keep \nus fed, clothed, and housed. Yet, like hundreds of thousands of other \nchildren of working class families in this Nation, I was able to get \nahead in life, to succeed, because the sacrifices my parents made \nprovided me with the opportunity to do better.\n  I was able to get a first-rate education by attending quality public \nschools on the south side of Chicago. I got my first job when I was \njust 15 years old. To earn extra money for college, I worked as a clerk \nat the Chicago Post Office. I attended the University of Illinois at \nChicago, and then the University of Chicago Law School, because student \nloans were available to help me pay the tuition. All of these \nopportunities--opportunities that would not have been available without \nlocal, State, and Federal Government assistance--gave me the tools I \nneeded to achieve in life.\n  The fact that the public--through Government--helped broaden my \nopportunities is part of what led me to choose a career in public \nservice. I ran for the Senate in 1992 for the same reason I ran for the \nState legislature in 1978--because I am fundamentally committed to \nensuring that future generations have the same opportunities I enjoyed. \nEvery child born in this country--whether black or white, whether rich \nor poor--should have the chance to achieve his or her dreams. Every \nperson should have a chance to contribute to society, to the maximum \nextent their talent or ability will allow.\n  Government should play an active role in expanding people's \nopportunities. The Government should be able to invest in technology \nand infrastructure, in job creation and training, and in education, in \norder to raise the people's living standards. The Government should \nhelp unemployed Americans get back on their feet, it should help those \nwho\n want to work to find jobs, it should ensure that high-quality, \naffordable health care is available to all Americans, and it should \nprotect our environment. Government is not the enemy of society; it \nshould be a partner, an instrument of the people's will, and a \nfacilitator of our public interests. But if the Government does not get \nits fiscal house in order--if we \n[[Page S1824]] don't act now to stop our runaway deficit spending--the \nGovernment will have little money left to provide for the public \ninterest. Only the holders of the Treasury bonds will be assured of any \nGovernment assistance.\n  I am going to tell a story today that some in this body may have \nheard before. Back in 1991, when I was being urged by a number of \npeople to run for the Senate, I sat down with my son, Matt, to discuss \nthe issue. Matt is now 17. He was 15 at the time. As you know, Mr. \nPresident, running for office is a tremendous strain on a family; I did \nnot want to make a decision that big without discussing it with Matt \nfirst. And, during the course of that conversation, he said something I \nwill never forget. He said, ``You know Mom, your generation is the \nfirst one that has left this world worse than you found it.''\n  Now, as you can imagine, those words were like a knife to my heart. \nThe thought that Matt might be right sent a chill down my spine and the \nnotion that my generation would leave the world worse off than we found \nit gave me the push I needed to get involved in running for the Senate. \nAnd I am bound and determined to use my tenure in the Senate to prove \nMatthew wrong, to show him that his generation will have more \nopportunities and a better life than my generation. I want him to know \nthat the American dream is alive and well--and that his future is a \nbright one. That is why I am fighting to see that the balanced budget \namendment becomes part of the U.S. Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I was privileged to have served as a member of the \nPresident's Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform--the \nso-called Kerrey-Danforth Commission. Some might say that serving on \nthe Entitlements Commission was more of a curse, but I welcomed the \nchallenge. Serving on the Commission allowed me to take a close look at \nour current budget trends, and at how those numbers will affect our \nability to meet important priorities, like retirement security, and \nhealth care security, not just for current recipients, but for Matt's \ngeneration and beyond.\n  The final report of the Commission, issued last December, confirmed \nwhat most of us already know: Unless we get the deficit under control, \nwe will be leaving our children--and our children's children--a legacy \nof debt that will make it impossible for them to achieve the American \ndream of living a better life than their parents.\n  I would like to take a moment to discuss those numbers. There have \nbeen and there will be a great many facts and figures talked about here \nin the debate on the balanced budget amendment. I know, frankly, that \nnumbers have a tendency to make people's eyes glaze over. I want to \ndiscuss some of the numbers because they are so profoundly important to \nour future as a country and to the kinds of opportunities that will be \navailable to future generations.\n  Most Americans, or I hope most, know that, thanks to the 1993 budget \napproved by this Congress, the budget submitted by President Clinton, \nFederal budget deficits are declining in the short term. The deficit is \nprojected to remain under $200 billion through 1998. That would place \nit at about 2.5 percent of the economy--its lowest level since the \n1970's. We can and should be proud of that, Mr. President. The 1993 \nbudget deal represented a serious attempt to attack the deficit, and \nour economy has benefited as a result of it.\n  What Americans do not know is that after 1998, unless we change \ncourse, the deficit will begin rising again rapidly, reaching $400 \nbillion by 2004. As early as 2012--and again when you say 2000, it \nsounds like a long way off, but we are only talking 5 years from now, \nto the turn of the century. In 2012, entitlement spending and interest \non the national debt alone will consume all tax revenues collected by \nthe Federal Government, leaving nothing at all--nothing--for defense \nspending, housing, Head Start, education, protection to the \nenvironment, transportation, and science research. Nothing.\n  What is driving this trend, Mr. President? Despite what people would \nlike to believe, frankly, the catalyst behind our growing budget \ndeficit is not $600 toilet seats or Air Force generals taking $200,000 \nplane rides. There is no line item in this budget labeled ``fraud, \nwaste, and abuse'' that we can line out and get rid of; nor is the \ndeficit growing due to the amount the Congress spends for the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting or for food stamps or anything else \nthat seems to consume the conversation on talk radio.\n  What we spend at home is actually lower now as a percentage of our \neconomy than it was 25 years ago. If you examine a brief snapshot of \nthe 1994 budget, this becomes clear. In 1994, the Federal budget \nallocated approximately $270 billion for defense spending, $335 billion \nfor Social Security spending, $155 billion for Medicare, and $95 \nbillion for Medicaid. All other entitlement programs combined total \n$185 billion, while interest on the national debt consumed $210 \nbillion.\n  Discretionary domestic spending, which is often blamed again in \npopular conversation with leading the country to the brink of financial \nruin, accounted for approximately $250 billion.\n  Mr. President, I do not mean to imply that the $250 billion we spent \non discretionary items in 1994 is not a lot of money or that there is \nnot room in that figure for further discipline and cutting. But we have \nto be honest with ourselves and with the American people. In light of \nthe amount of money and percentage of the Federal budget we are \nspending on all of the programs I listed above, discretionary spending \nalone cannot bear the sole blame for our budget deficits. If we want to \nget ourselves out of the hole we have dug ourselves into, we cannot \nfocus exclusively, or even primarily, on discretionary spending.\n  So where are the problems? What drives this budget deficit? Why is it \nso persistent? In a nutshell, there are two major problems: The rapidly \nrising costs of medical care, and the changing demographics of the \nAmerican population are the most important forces driving the Federal \nbudget.\n  Based on current trends, Federal health care expenses will triple as \na percentage of the economy by 2030. Federal health care costs, which \nconsist primarily of Medicare and Medicaid, grew at rates exceeding 10 \npercent for 5 years in a row. While they are currently growing at \nslightly lower rates due to changes in the private sector, those rates, \nfrankly, are still unaffordable. Due to the rapid growth, the Medicare \nhospital insurance trust fund will go broke by 2001.\n  Clearly, this is a far more serious problem than just welfare reform, \nwhich makes up 1 percent of the Federal budget. AFDC and food stamps \nare not growing anywhere near the rate Medicare and Medicaid are. In \nfact, AFDC benefits, again, have declined by more than 40 percent in \nreal terms since 1970. That is not to suggest that we do not need to \nreform our welfare system; we do and we will. But anybody who suggests \nthat the budget can be balanced by reforming welfare is being less than \nhonest with the American people.\n  The Chicago Tribune recently ran an editorial on the subject of \nhealth care, underscoring the need to control health care costs if we \nare to get serious about the balanced budget. I would like to quote \nbriefly from that piece.\n  It stated:\n\n       But if this Congress is serious about bringing the Federal \n     budget into balance, something must be done to stem the \n     still-rising cost of health care. Health reform isn't \n     mentioned in the Contract With America, but unless some \n     changes are made, several of the GOP's other goals will prove \n     beyond reach.\n\n  Mr. President, I think the first goal will prove to be out of reach. \nIf we do not control health care costs, we will not be able to achieve \na balanced budget.\n  Rising health care costs are not the only problem we have to contend \nwith. We must also confront the second leg of this dilemma, which is \nthe ``graying'' of America, due both to longer life expectancy and the \naging of the baby boomers.\n  When the Social Security system was established, the average life \nexpectancy was 61 years old; now it is 76 years old. We cannot ignore \nthis because the Social Security benefits are funded primarily by \npayroll taxes on current workers. As our population ages and as the \nbaby boom generation retires, there will be fewer workers to support \nmore retirees. While in 1990 there were almost five workers for each \nretiree, in 2030 there will be less than three. What \n[[Page S1825]] this means is that if current trends remain unchanged, \nthe Social Security trust fund will begin to pay out more than it takes \nin by the year 2012. By 2029, the fund will have exhausted all of its \npreviously accumulated surpluses.\n  Mr. President, there is simply no way to get around the fact that our \npresent spending trends are not sustainable in the long run. In 1963, \nmandatory spending, which is the combination of entitlement programs \nand interest on the national debt, comprised 29.6 percent of the \nFederal budget. By 1983, that number had almost doubled, to 56.3 \npercent.\n  Ten years later, in 1993, mandatory spending was 61.4 percent of the \nannual budget. Let me underscore that. Today, mandatory spending--\nentitlements plus interest on the national debt--comprise almost two-\nthirds of the entire Federal budget.\n  What about the future? If we do not act now, by the year 2003, which \nis only 8 years from now--and again, these numbers sound further out \nthan they are--mandatory spending will comprise 72 percent of the \nFederal budget, 58.2 percent for entitlement programs and 13.8 percent \nfor net interest on the debt. Obviously, if we are spending 72 percent \nof the budget on mandatory spending, there will not be much left over \nfor defense, education, and infrastructure.\n  The budget deficit also has disastrous implications for our private \nsavings. Countries that save at higher rates grow faster and have a \nmore rapid increase in the standard of living than countries that save \nat lower rates. In the United States, as our budget deficits and \nnational debt grow, our private savings decline, we limit our \ninvestments, our productivity, and our economic growth and, therefore, \nour job production.\n  Since the 1960's, private savings have dropped from more than 8 \npercent of the economy to around 5 percent of the economy. At the same \ntime, Government deficits have risen from less than 1 percent of the \neconomy to more than 3 percent of the economy. As a result, the supply \nof savings available for private investment--our net national savings--\nhas dropped from more than 8 percent of the economy in the 1960's to \nless than 2 percent today. This is particularly harmful for us with \nregard to our international competitiveness in this new global economy.\n  In today's increasingly global economy, our major industrial \ncompetitors are saving and investing at a much greater rate than we \nare. Japan's national savings from 1983 to 1992 totaled approximately \n18 percent of its gross domestic product, while the European \nCommunity's savings totaled around 8 percent. If we want to stay \ncompetitive in the global marketplace, we can and we must do better; \nagain, another reason to support the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, earlier, I mentioned that AFDC benefits have declined \nsince 1970. The significance of that fact should not be lost. We are \nspending ourselves into a deeper and deeper hole, and yet people who \nneed help from Government are not better off as a result.\n  I live less than 2 miles from the Robert Taylor homes in Chicago, a \npublic housing development on the south side of the city. I grew up in \nthe shadow of that development.\n  Just last week, a study was released that showed that 9 of the top 10 \npoorest neighborhoods in the country were located in public housing in \nChicago. And I know my senior Senator saw the study. It was shocking. \nIncluded in that number were three neighborhoods in the Robert Taylor \nHomes. That is not something to be proud of. In fact, it is \ndisgraceful, and it is especially distressing to me, because I am third \ngeneration Chicagoan. I love the city. I know the people who live and \nwork in those developments. I know they want the opportunity to get \nahead and to have a chance to lead productive lives.\n  The study that I mentioned, which was based on per capita income \ninformation taken from the 1990 census, underscores why I so firmly \nbelieve that Congress must adopt this balanced budget amendment.\n  The people living in the Robert Taylor Homes and in the developments \nmentioned in that study are not better off than they were in 1969, \nwhich was the last time that this country had a balanced budget. In \nfact, they are worse off. They have become more isolated, and less \nconnected to jobs and the American dream, less able to access and \nafford an education. They have fewer opportunities.\n  Perhaps if we had been able to take the $800 million we spend each \nday on interest, and directed it instead to improve the lives of those \nresidents, this situation would not seem so hopeless. But, in order to \nhalt this downward spiral, we have to get our budget problems under \ncontrol. And that is another reason I support this balanced budget \namendment.\n  Consider another set of facts. Just yesterday, the National Center \nfor Children in Poverty released a study showing that a quarter, fully \na quarter, of American children under the age of 6 were living in \npoverty in 1992. Even more shocking, nearly three out of five of those \nchildren had working parents. Despite the stereotypes you hear about on \nthe nightly news, less than one-third of the children living in poverty \nhave families that rely entirely on public assistance. The bulk of \nthese children have parents who work. All of our spending has not done \nthose children, or their parents--most of whom are working, scrimping \nand saving and trying to get ahead--has not done them much good. \nWithout our massive deficits, if we did not have to devote such a \nsubstantial amount of our budget to interest on the national debt, the \nGovernment could help these people find better jobs. These are people \nwho want to work; but, because we have gotten ourselves into such a \nhole with our lack of fiscal discipline, the Government cannot give \nthem the hand that they deserve.\n  I have heard many opponents of the balanced budget amendment question \nthe need to tackle the deficit immediately. America is not, they \nmaintain, in the midst of a budgetary crisis. In the short term--the \nnext 7 years--that is perhaps true. The country can probably continue \non its current irresponsible path for a few years into the next \ncentury. But, after that, it will no longer be possible to ignore the \nbasic demographic and health care cost trends driving the increases in \nFederal spending. We simply will not be able to continue on our current \npath, and expect the Federal Government to function as a partner of the \npeople well into the next century. And, if we wait to act until crisis \ncomes, any action we take will be that much more painful, and that much \nless effective.\n  Again, a quick glance at our current budget provides ample reason why \nwe must act now, instead of waiting for the crisis to hit full blown. \nThe entire Federal deficit for the current fiscal year--estimated at \n$176 billion--represents the interest owed on the huge national debt \nrun up during the 1980's. This year, and next year, the budget would be \nbalanced if not for the reckless supply-side economics that caused the \ndeficit to balloon from its 1980 level of about $1 trillion to its \ncurrent level of more than $4.7 trillion. If we had acted in 1980 to \ntackle the deficit, rather than adopting approaches that merely fed its \nrapid growth, the problems we face today--in terms of demographics, and \nthe aging of the baby boomers--would seem much more manageable. In \n1980, interest on the debt was $75 billion--that is a lot of money, Mr. \nPresident, but it is nowhere near the $950 billion we currently pay. \nHow much better off we would be if, in 1980, Congress had possessed the \ncourage to make the difficult choices, and balance the budget. Not \npassing the balanced budget amendment will not make our problems go \naway. Our ability to meet our priorities will be much greater if we \nenact the balanced budget amendment now, if we tackle the tough \nproblems now, instead of waiting until the country is on the brink of \nfinancial ruin. If we need any convincing about the need to address the \ndeficit now, in 1995, we should just look at the consequences of our \nfailure to address it then, in 1980.\n  The Entitlements Commission concluded last December without issuing \nany specific recommendations to Congress, to the dismay of some.\n Nonetheless, I believe the Commission was a real success, for \noutlining in painstaking detail the truth about our budget future, and \nthe consequences of not facing it honestly. I would also add that this \nreport was adopted by a strong bipartisan vote of 30 to 1, which is \nquite remarkable, when you think of the wide variety of personalities \nand \n[[Page S1826]] viewpoints that served on the Commission. What that \nbipartisan vote told me was that all of us, Democrat and Republican \nalike, know what the problems are, and know we need to act now to get \nthem under control. If nothing else, the balanced budget amendment will \nhelp end the conspiracy of silence surrounding our Nation's fiscal \nproblems, and ensure that we no longer have the ability to ignore the \nfacts that are staring us in the face. Instead, it will guarantee that \nwe face those facts, sooner rather than later.\n  Mr. President, given the level of public concern about our growing \nbudget deficits, I was surprised that the Commission's final report did \nnot receive more media attention than it did. I attribute that lack of \ninterest to the difficulty of putting cold, hard, incomprehensive \nnumbers into real, human terms. People hear what we are saying when we \ntalk about the deficit being a certain percentage of the economy; that \ndoes not necessarily mean they know what the numbers actually mean.\n  To paraphrase Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve System, \nit is hard to get people--or the media--interested in a problem whose \nsymptoms are hard to detect and whose full-blown effects seem to be \nyears or decades away.\n  But the final report of the Kerrey-Danforth Commission should not be \nof interest solely to economists and policy wonks. These numbers have a \nreal effect on us all. We need to communicate to ordinary Americans how \nthe fiscal bottom line affects them; we have to put the sometimes \nincomprehensible into real, human terms.\n  The senior Senator from Illinois, my Senator, Paul Simon--to whom the \ncountry owes a great debt of gratitude for championing this issue--\noften refers to a study by the New York Federal Reserve Board, that \nlooked at what the budget deficit cost America during a 10-year period \nfrom 1978 to 1988.\n  According to the study, during that 10-year period, our country lost \n5 percentage points of growth due to the deficit. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, each percentage point of growth translates \ninto approximately 650,000 jobs. Let me repeat that--650,000 jobs. In \nother words, our country would have created an additional 3.75\n million jobs during that period, if not for the Federal budget \ndeficit.\n\n  Another way to make these numbers more real to ordinary Americans \ninvolves looking at what we spend in interest. Every dollar that the \nFederal Government spends on interest payments on the Federal debt \nsqueezes out funds that could otherwise be used to increase the \nproductivity of society. Currently, the Federal Government is spending \n$800 million every day for interest payments on the national debt.\n  Think about that--$800 million that could otherwise be used for Head \nStart, for housing programs, for our battle against crime and drugs, to \ncreate jobs, or to repair our crumbling infrastructure--every day.\n  In total, in 1994, we spent $203 billion to service the national \ndebt--an amount equal to 14 percent of total Government outlays. We can \nnot afford to waste this precious capital on financing the Government \ndebt. We are, essentially, paying bond holders with money that could \notherwise be used to help working people get ahead.\n  Many opponents of the balanced budget amendment argue that Government \nshould be allowed to deficit-spend in order to continue investing in \ninfrastructure, jobs, education, and the like. I agree that public \ninvestment is a necessary and proper Government function. But I \ndisagree that deficit spending is the most effective way to accomplish \nthat.\n  In 1966, when our deficit totaled $3.7 billion, 2.6 percent of our \nbudget went toward funding long-term investment. Now, with our budget \ndeficit about to hit $268 billion, our long-term investment has shrunk \nto 1.8 percent of the budget. The reason, I think, is obvious--more and \nmore of our funds must be devoted to paying interest on the debt, \nleaving less and less for investment.\n  There are many other negative consequences, of course, of chronic \nGovernment borrowing. When households and businesses have to compete \nwith the Federal Government to obtain loans, the increase in demand \npushes interest rates up.\n Government takes scarce capital that would otherwise be available to \nthe private sector for job creation, investment in infrastructure, or \neven savings. Deficits have a chilling effect on private initiative. To \nquote one of our Founding Fathers, Andrew Jackson:\n\n       Once the budget is balanced and the debts paid off, our \n     population will be relieved from a considerable portion of \n     its present burdens, and will find * * * additional means for \n     the display of individual enterprise.\n\n  We would all do well to heed his words today.\n  Mr. President, the opponents of H.J. Resolution 1 have a great many \narguments to support their view that a balanced budget amendment is \nunwise. I do not doubt the sincerity of their opposition, for their \nranks include a number of Senators with whom I usually find myself in \nagreement. I greatly respect their view; however, I simply cannot agree \nwith them. I would like to take a minute to discuss why.\n  I know I have taken a couple of minutes already. I would like to \nfinish. This is such an important issue. I know the Senator from \nLouisiana is waiting, but I would like to make a complete statement \ntoday.\n  First and foremost, opponents of House Joint Resolution 1 state that \nwe should not be tinkering around with the Constitution. Well, I could \nnot agree with them more. The years I spent studying law at the \nUniversity of Chicago gave me a deep appreciation for the Constitution. \nI believe the U.S. Constitution to be the finest exposition of \ndemocratic principles ever written. I make that statement fully aware \nthat, in its original form, the Constitution included neither African-\nAmericans nor women in its vision of a democratic society. But it \nchanged to better realize the promise of America. The beauty of the \nConstitution is that it can, through a deliberate, cumbersome, and \nsometimes painful process, be amended to reflect the changing \nrealities, and meet new challenges faced by our Nation. This current \nproblem--the problem of our growing fiscal disorder--is too important \nnot to act on today. Who could be opposed to affirmatively stating in \nthe Constitution that current generations must act responsibly, so that \nfuture generations will not be forced to bear the burden of their \nirresponsibility? What could be more important than the fiscal \nintegrity of our Nation? As another of our Founding Fathers, Thomas \nJefferson once said:\n\n       We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle \n     posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay them \n     ourselves.\n\n  Why is that proposition not important enough to be included in the \nConstitution?\n  Mr. President, it is argued that matters of fiscal policy should not \nbe included in the\n Constitution. I believe that proposition frankly ignores the fact that \nthe Constitution deals with fiscal policy in a variety of ways. I will \nmention just a few of them here: Article 1, section 7, provides that \nall bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of \nRepresentatives; article 1, section 8 provides that Congress shall have \nthe power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, and \nto pay the debts of the United States; it further provides that \nCongress has the power to borrow money on credit, to coin money, and to \nfix the standard of weights and measures. Section 8 includes the power \nto punish those who produce counterfeit money, to appropriate funds for \nthe support of the Armed Forces, and to enact uniform laws on the \nsubject of bankruptcy.\n\n  Article 1, section 9 of the Constitution provides that no money shall \nbe drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by \nlaw, and mandates that a regular statement and account of receipts and \nexpenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time. \nArticle 1, section 10, forbids the individual States from coining \nmoney. Article 6 provided that all debts contracted before the \nConstitution was adopted would be valid against the United States. \nClearly, fiscal measures are part of the Constitutions's main text.\n  Fiscal issues are also mentioned in various amendments. The 16th \namendment, of course, grants Congress the power to collect income \ntaxes. The 14th amendment, in section 4, states that neither the United \nStates nor the States may assume or pay any debt incurred in aid of \ninsurrection or rebellion against the United States. There \n[[Page S1827]] are other provisions I could mention, but these are \nsufficient to refute the contention of opponents of the balanced budget \namendment, that monetary issues should not be dealt with in the \nConstitution.\n  Nor do I accept the argument that budget deficits are a temporary \nproblem, and will not always need to be dealt with; we should not, \nopponents argue, write into the Constitution an amendment that will \nbecome irrelevant and outdated once we get our current situation under \ncontrol. Nothing would make me happier than to believe that our current \nbudgetary deficits are only temporary, and are not something that \nfuture generations will have to contend with. That, however, Mr. \nPresident, is not the case. We are here today precisely because we have \nnot previously had the discipline to voluntarily achieve the goals of \nHouse Joint Resolution 1.\n  Opponents of House Joint Resolution 1 also argue that there are times \nwhen the Federal Government needs to run a\n budget deficit. This, of course, reflects a Keynesian notion of \neconomic policy; that in times of economic downturn, the Federal \nGovernment must act to stimulate economic activity through deficit \nspending. To that argument, I would simply respond that House Joint \nResolution 1 does not prevent the Government from spending its way out \nof a recession if it chooses to do so; it merely provides that three-\nfifths of the Congress must affirmatively vote to do so.\n\n  But more importantly, I would say to my colleagues that there is a \ngreat deal of difference between the Federal Government stimulating \neconomic activity by spending during a recession, and our current \nsituation. The Federal budget has not been balanced since 1969. During \nthe past 25 years, we have enjoyed substantial periods of economic \ngrowth--our economy has not been in a recession, it has been growing, \nover most of the past 25 years. But we did not balance the budget in \nthe good years either. Our current fiscal policy reflects more than \nrecessionary spending; it is regular, habitual, undisciplined, deficit \nspending--and it must stop.\n  Last year I had the honor of reading George Washington's ``farewell \naddress to the nation'' on the floor of the Senate. This is something \nthat one freshman Member a year gets a chance to do. Really, a singular \nhonor. In that address, Mr. Washington left us with some words of \nwisdom that, I believe, support the notion of a balanced budget \namendment. I would like to quote those here today:\n\n       As a very important source of strength and security, \n     cherish public credit. One method of preserving it is to use \n     it as sparingly as possible, avoiding occasions of expense by \n     cultivating peace, but remembering, also, that timely \n     disbursements, to prepare for danger, frequently prevent much \n     greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding likewise the \n     accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasion of \n     expense, by my vigorous exertions, in times of peace, to \n     discharge the debts which unavoidable wars may have \n     occasioned, not ungenerously throwing upon posterity the \n     burden which we ourselves ought to bear.\n\n  These words, which are ceremoniously repeated each year in the \nSenate, underscore what the balanced budget amendment stands for: that \nborrowing money to pay the Government's debts, and running a budget \ndeficit, should not be impossible, but should be an extraordinary \nevent, done only when an overwhelming percentage of the Congress thinks \nit wise. While running a budget deficit may be necessary at times, it \nis not good fiscal policy to do so on a consistent basis. The\n Congressional Budget Office, the General Accounting Office, and a \nmultitude of distinguished economists have all warned that our \ncontinued deficit spending will result in lower productivity and \ndeteriorating living standards. It should require more than a simple 51 \nvotes to deficit spend. The three-fifth requirement reflects that \nreality.\n\n  This is not, I might add, a subversion of the principle of majority \nrule. I do not believe in unduly restricting the ability of Congress to \nfunction. I would not have supported this amendment if it had, for \ninstance, provided that taxes could be raised only upon a three-fifth \nvote of both Houses. But the three-fifth requirement to run a budget \ndeficit really preserves the constitutional principle of no taxation \nwithout representation. By running budget deficits, we are saddling \nfuture generations, people who have no vote today, with the burden of \npaying for our inability to get our fiscal house in order. As it now \nstands, every man, woman and child now owes at least $18,000 to pay off \nthe Federal debt. Without action, that number will only grow. We are \nliterally borrowing from our grandchildren to pay today's expenses. \nPermission to do so ought to, in my opinion, require consensus and a \nsupermajority vote.\n  And it is not unprecedented. Again, there are a number of places in \nthe Constitution that specifically provide for supermajority votes: \narticle 1, section 3 provides for a two-third vote of Senators to \nconvict in an impeachment proceeding; section 7 provides that a two-\nthird vote of both Houses may override a Presidential veto; article 2, \nsection 2, requires the Senate to approve treaties by a two-third vote; \nand, of course, two-third of both Houses of Congress must vote to \napprove a constitutional amendment--to name just a few.\n  Another argument against the balanced budget amendment is that \nCongress doesn't have to amend the Constitution to balance the budget; \nit merely needs to make the difficult choices needed to reach that \ngoal. I agree. The opponents are correct on that score. But the simple \nfact of the matter is that, absent a constitutional amendment, Congress \nhas not proved itself capable of making the tough choices necessary to \nget the Federal budget under control. In 1986, before I came to \nCongress, the Senate came within one vote of passing the balanced \nbudget amendment. At the time, the Nation was $2 trillion in debt. Now, \nin 1995, that number is over $4.7 trillion. We had, and blew, our \nchance to resolve the issue when it was easier to resolve. We need to \nact now, before the crisis hits.\n  Likewise, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings provision, in theory, was \nsupposed to balance the budget by 1991, before I even reached the \nSenate. Obviously, that never quite happened. So I would assert that \nhistory adequately demonstrates the fallacy of the argument that \nCongress will balance the budget absent a constitutional amendment.\n  Yet another argument offered by balanced budget amendment opponents \nis that the amendment will be unenforceable. I believe that elevating \nthe balanced budget requirement to constitutional status will, in and \nof itself, be enough to guarantee that the provision is upheld. Every \nsingle one of us in this body has taken an oath to uphold and defend \nthe Constitution of the United States. The American people expect, as \nthey have every right to, that the officials to whom they entrust the \nConstitution will not betray that public trust.\n  Nor do I believe that the amendment will unduly involve the Federal \njudiciary in matters of fiscal policy. House Joint Resolution 1 \nprovides that ``the Congress shall enforce and implement this article \nby appropriate legislation * * *.'' In other words, Congress is \ndirected to enact legislation to make the amendment work. That can \ninclude, if necessary, action to limit the remedies a court could grant \nin a case brought under the balanced budget amendment.\n  In addition, courts have already developed a number of doctrines \nwhich will limit the type and number of lawsuits that may be brought \nunder the act. First and foremost, all litigants must have standing in \norder to bring a claim. This generally requires potential plaintiffs to \nshow they have suffered an injury in fact, that was caused by the \nalleged unlawful conduct, and that is redressable by the court. Courts \nhave been extremely reluctant, with one or two notable exceptions, to \nconfer standing to litigants based on their general status as \ntaxpayers.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield at that point?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Is not that language about the Congress acting to \nenforce the amendment by appropriate legislation identical to the \nlanguage found in section 5 of the 14th amendment, and that has not \nprohibited the courts from issuing literally thousands upon thousands \nof orders under the 14th amendment, so why would it under this \namendment?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator from Louisiana. He is \ncorrect. \n[[Page S1828]] The 14th amendment does have similar language, but I \nwould point out also that in the first instance the distinction and the \ndifference--I mean legislating or litigating now, but I would think, \nfirst, the issue of standing would matter. You have to show individual \nand direct harm to have standing in a court case brought under this \namendment and certainly under the 14th amendment.\n  The case law has evolved differently with regard to Federal \ntaxpayers' rights rather than someone complaining of a violation of \ntheir civil rights, for example.\n  In addition, the Federal courts have a longstanding practice of \navoiding controversies that involve a political question. In \ndetermining what constitutes a political question, the courts will \ngenerally examine three factors: First, whether the issue in the case \nis one that is generally committed to other branches of government; \nsecond, the lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards \nfor evaluating the controversy; and third, the need for a single \npronouncement on the issue. The fact that any plaintiff which brought \nsuit under the balanced budget amendment would have to overcome these \ntwo hurdles--the doctrine of standing, which we discussed already with \nregard to the 14th amendment, and the political question doctrine--\nshould be more than sufficient to limit the Federal court's involvement \nin matters of budgetary policy.\n  As a matter of legislative history perhaps, we should take up at some \nother time that it is very clear it is not our intention that the \nFederal courts be involved in budgetary policy matters upon the passing \nof this amendment.\n  I want to take one moment to discuss the right-to-know amendment, \nwhich will be offered by the distinguished minority leader, Senator \nDaschle. The Right to Know Act simply provides that Congress must give \nthe States a list of how we propose to balance the budget before the \nStates vote on ratification. Along with 41 of my Senate colleagues, I \nsigned a letter to the majority leader, Senator Dole, urging he act to \nensure that the American people know what is in the Federal budget, and \nwhat it will take to bring the budget into balance--and even more \nimportantly, to keep it in balance. It seems to me that this is nothing \nmore than full disclosure. The Right to Know Act provides for the same \nthing that the entitlement commission accomplished with its interim \nreport--a full accounting to the American people of where we are, where \nwe need to go, and how we can get there.\n  There have been suggestions that adopting the Right to Know Act will \nkill the balanced budget amendment because the American public does not \nhave the stomach for the tough choices we face. Frankly, I believe that \nargument does a real disservice to the American public. People want \nCongress to level with them; they are tired of the cynical \nmanipulations, the smoke and mirrors, that have been used to obscure \nour fiscal disorder in the past. The people know that getting our \nfiscal house in order will not be easy, and certainly will not be \npainless, but the long term consequences of not acting are far worse \nthan any short-term pain. So I support that initiative, and I will vote \nfor its adoption when it is offered on the Senate floor.\n  However--and I would like to make it very clear--if the Right to Know \nAct fails to be adopted, that will not mitigate my support for the \nbalanced budget amendment. Opponents of the balanced budget amendment \nhave had plenty of time to propose their version of what should be cut, \nand by how much, in order to balance our books. The fact is, they have \nnot. I do not fault them for that, Mr. President, and I agree with them \nthat the States should have as much information as possible before they \ndecide to ratify this amendment; but Congress cannot accept any excuse \nfor further delay on this front. The time to act is now.\n  Mr. President, I have every confidence that the balanced budget \namendment will soon be passed by the Senate. I hope that this debate, \ntherefore, will serve as a ``call to arms'' for everyone who truly \ncares about the future of our country to come together and begin a \ndialog on the tough choices ahead.\n  As we begin this dialog, however, it is critically important that we \nleave all choices on the table--nothing can be off limits if we truly \nwant to succeed. That includes examining our tax laws; we cannot \nsucceed unless tax reform is part of the agenda. We need to simplify \nthe Tax Code. We need to eliminate unfair and inefficient tax breaks \nthat are known as tax expenditures. After all, tax expenditures result \nin treating taxpayers with the same income differently, depending on \nwhether or not they qualify for the expenditure. They are every bit as \nmuch a spending program as those whose funds are directly distributed \nby the U.S. Treasury. Again to quote from George Washington's farewell \naddress:\n\n       * * * It is essential that you should practically bear in \n     mind, that towards the payment of debts there must be \n     revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no \n     taxes can be devised which are not more or less inconvenient \n     and unpleasant * * *\n\n  Fiscal honesty means we have a duty to make sure the American people \ncan take a look at both sides of the Federal balance sheet, both the \nspending side and the revenue side. Building a consensus for the \ndecisions necessary to balance the budget--and keep it balanced--means \nmaking sure the American people know what businesses and investors pays \ntaxes and what does not, and why, just as much as it means knowing \nwhere their tax money is spent.\n  We cannot expect to succeed in our task if we begin by declaring \nindividual programs or tax expenditures off limits. As we move forward, \nwe have to keep our eyes on the prize. The issue is not saving each and \nevery individual program, but instead defining what objectives are \nimportant to us as a nation--and how we can most effectively accomplish \nthose objectives. What is important is not which programs job training \nfunds come from. What is important is that people who need job training \nassistance are able to get it, and are therefore able to get or hold \nthe kinds of jobs that can help turn the American dream into an \nAmerican reality. Likewise, we should not be concerned with who will \nadminister housing grants. What is important is the goal--ensuring that \nevery American has access to decent, affordable housing--and seeing \nthat the goal can be achieved in the most efficient, productive manner. \nWe all know that not every program administered by the Federal \nGovernment actually works it is no secret. By keeping everything on the \ntable, we can keep our promisses and keep what works, get rid of what \ndoes not, and therefore devote our scarce financial resources in a more \neffective, productive manner.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to take head on the political \nimplications of this debate, because it is an important political \nquestion for the Congress. I am not a signatory of the Contract With \nAmerica. Indeed, I agree with Senator Byrd; the only contract with \nAmerican that matters to me is the U.S. Constitution.\n  But I want to be clear that this issue is not a partisan one. It \nreflects philosophical differences that have little to do with party \nlines. The senior Senator from my State of Illinois, Senator Simon, has \nbeen one of the chief advocates of the balanced budget amendment for \nyears. Senator Simon's liberal credentials are without question. He is, \nand has always been, a Democrat--he was at one time even a candidate \nfor our Presidential nomination. So this is not a Republican versus \nDemocrat debate.\n  Nor is this a battle of the conservatives against the liberals. I am \nproud to call myself a liberal, for the simple reason that I believe \ngovernment has a positive and constructive role to play in promoting \nthe public good. I do not believe government is the enemy of progress. \nI believe it can promote progress. In my lifetime, I have seen first \nhand the positive contributions a commitment to the American dream of \nequality and opportunity can make. I would not be here today but for \nthe struggles of people of good will to make the American dream a \nreality. And it is precisely because I so value their struggles that I \nbelieve we must take the steps that a commitment to\n providing opportunity requires. We have a duty to use our \ndecisionmaking power in a manner that preserves freedom and opportunity \nfor all Americans, not only in this generation, but in generations to \ncome.\n  [[Page S1829]] Poor people and working people and those most in need \nof Government assistance are not helped by the deficits and out-of-\ncontrol spending habits we cannot seem to shake. It is interesting as I \nlisten to the debate that swirls around the issue of the balanced \nbudget amendment and Social Security, the reason that debate is so \nintense is that current recipients of Social Security--and even those \nof us in the baby boom generation who will be in that system soon--too \nsoon, in the not so distant future--have an absolute expectation that \nSocial Security will provide for us in our retirement. The same can not \nbe said for those in our younger generations. When you speak to people \nwho are my son Matthew's age, they have absolutely no faith that \nGovernment will be there for them when they need it, that it will help \nthem enjoy retirement security or affordable health care or a high \nstandard of living.\n  And why should they, Mr. President? Since my son was born in 1977, we \nhave never seen a balanced budget. Mat has no idea what it means to \nlive under a Federal Government that spends within its means. His \ngeneration has heard politician after politician promise to balance the \nbudget, yet has only seen the deficit skyrocket.\n  That cynicism grows deeper and deeper every day, despite \npronouncements that a brighter day is just around the corner. The fact \nis, with current budget trends, a brighter day is not around the \ncorner. What lies ahead, if we fail to act, is slower economic growth, \ngreater debt, fewer options and higher taxes. Generation X's pessism \nwill be affirmed if we do nothing.\n  The time has passed for us to realize that by failing to act, we are \nindeed making a choice--a choice that involves throwing away most of \nour options for dealing with our fiscal problems. The only way we will \nbe able to turn current budget trends around is to face reality with \nthe help of the balanced budget amendment.\n  Every generation of Americans has been able to address and resolve \nthe challenges unique to their time. That is what makes this country \ngreat. Our current fiscal challenges are daunting, but I am convinced \nthat--with passage of the balanced budget amendment--we can save our \nability to invest in people, and we can protect our capacity for humane \ngovernment. Getting our fiscal house in order will give us the freedom \nto invest in people. That is what this country is all about. That is \nwhat this debate is all about, and I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for just one moment?\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I believe my colleague has not yielded the \nfloor. I think my colleague from Illinois still has the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana was recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I did not want to cut off the Senator \nfrom Illinois. I thought she had finished her speech. Did she?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Senator Simon wanted to ask me a question and he \nhad risen to ask me a question.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I will yield for the purpose of Senator \nSimon asking a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank my colleague. First, her eloquent statement \nillustrates why I am proud to have her as a colleague in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I do not know if she is aware that Data Resources, Inc., one of the \nmajor econometric think tanks just a few days ago came out with a \nstatement saying, and this is in line with her talking about jobs, that \nif we balance the budget by the year 2002, we will create 2.5 million \nmore jobs in our country. And they also say here, by 2002, half the \nsavings in our budget simulation come from lower interest costs. They \nproject a 2.5-percent drop in interest rates. What that would do for \nour economy.\n  Then if I may also, just while I have the floor, because she \nmentioned this, and knowing the concern that my colleague has for \npeople in the Robert Taylor Homes--it is some massive housing project, \nI thought she might be interested.\n  Congressman Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts, one of the cosponsors in \nthe House, said in a statement a few days ago on the floor of the \nHouse: People come up to him and say listen, Joe, you are a liberal \nDemocrat. How can you possibly be for a balanced budget amendment? Is \nit not going to cut the very programs that much of your family and \nothers have stood for for generations?\n  And then Joe Kennedy replies:\n\n       I say to them that those very programs that stand up for \n     the working people, the poor and the senior citizens of this \n     country, have suffered the worst cuts over the course of the \n     last 15 or 20 years in this country as a result of budget \n     deficits. Look at the housing budget, cut by 77 percent over \n     the course of the last 15 years; look at those who have press \n     conferences who say they want to protect fuel assistance for \n     the poor. Look at what happened to the fuel assistance \n     program--cut by 30 percent.\n\n  Then he goes on to a number of others and then this final line that \nCongressman Joe Kennedy says:\n\n       Do we see the bellies of our poorest children filled as a \n     result of interest payments on the national debt?\n\n  I think that is a powerful way to respond there. I really appreciate \nit.\n  If my colleagues--I am not sure who I am getting yielded from----\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I have no further comment except to say I very \nmuch appreciate the Senator's leadership in this, and the patience of \nmy colleagues. The statement took a little longer than I expected. I \ndid want to make it because this is the beginning part of what is \nprobably one of the most historic debates this Congress has seen in a \nvery long time.\n  I feel honored to be a part of it. Again I thank the Senator for his \nleadership and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON. It was an excellent statement and if I could respond to \nthe question my colleague from Louisiana asked earlier about \nimplementation language, he mentioned the 14th amendment.\n  This amendment has two other things I think are of interest. No. 1, \nsection 6 says, ``Congress shall enforce--'' and, No. 2, ``The history \nof State governments.''\n  Mr. President, 48 of the 50 States have some similar provision--not \nidentical but somewhat similar.\n  There simply has not been a history of litigation in State courts. I \nwas just looking at Colorado the other day. In the history of Colorado, \nthere has not been a single court case on this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield for a unanimous-consent request \nto the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Can I modify that for just a bit so I can compliment the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois as well. I certainly want to \ncompliment her for her strong, persuasive statement. We appreciate the \nleadership she has provided on this issue as well as others.\n  I miss her on the Judiciary Committee. I want everybody to know she \nplayed a tremendous role there. But I thank her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, 3 weeks ago I rose on the floor of this \nSenate to announce I would not be running for reelection. Today I rise, \nwith the luxury of not having to face another election to the U.S. \nSenate, to oppose this amendment in its present form.\n  I do so, first of all, because I believe this amendment violates the \nsocial contract. The social contract was a concept formed in the 18th \ncentury by French philosophers, principally Jean Jacques Rousseau, who \ncame up with this concept which in turn inspired Thomas Jefferson and \nthe people who wrote the Declaration of Independence and the \nConstitution. It was founded on the thought that there should be \ngovernment by consent of the governed. A social contract where the \npeople, understanding the issues, gave to their elected officials the \nright to make decisions on their behalf.\n  Why does this violate the social contract? Because we have here a pig \nin a poke in which the American public are asked, in effect, to trust \nus and we or the courts will later tell you what the program is. A \nbalanced budget is not self-defining. A balanced budget can be balanced \nin many, many ways, some of \n[[Page S1830]] which are good and some of which are not so good.\n  Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, was before the Budget \nCommittee just last week. I asked him about various ways that the \nbudget could be balanced. Some, he said, would be bad for the economy. \nSome would be good for the economy. And the fact of the matter is, we \ndo not know how this budget would be balanced. It could be balanced \nthrough taxes, and I wonder how many of my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle would sit still for a budget balanced solely through \ntaxes? I would guess they would all oppose it. The American people \nwould oppose it.\n  I wonder how many on my side of the aisle would like a budget \nbalanced by cuts in Social Security and Medicare; in other words, \nsenior citizens programs. I suspect not that many. One reason it \nviolates the social contract is that people in our country do not \nunderstand the budget and how it is made up.\n  On Wednesday, November 16, the New York Times printed an article \nwhich in turn reported the results of an exit poll done by Harvard \nUniversity and the Kaiser Family Foundation. In this poll, people were \nasked, ``What is the biggest program in the Federal budget?'' Twenty-\nseven percent of the respondents said foreign aid; 19 percent said \nwelfare. In other words, almost half of the people said that two of the \nreally smaller programs make up the biggest part of the Federal budget. \nThe fact of the matter is foreign aid is less than 1 percent of the \nbudget. AFDC--otherwise called welfare--is also only little more than 1 \npercent of the budget.\n  As this article goes on to say, quoting from the article, it says:\n\n       * * * the Harvard polling expert who helped conduct the \n     survey said that unless policymakers tried to educate people \n     on the budget we are going to have a heck of a time having a \n     national debate on the deficit.\n\n  Here we are. There has been very little done to educate the public on \nwhat we are really talking about. The public thinks, I believe--and \nthis poll indicates--that all you have to do is cut welfare and foreign \naid and maybe waste, fraud, and abuse, and you have the problem solved. \nYou do not have to deal with taxes, you do not have to deal with \nMedicare, you do not have to deal with Medicaid--all of those things.\n  What would the American people do when faced with the facts? Many of \nus are trying very hard to get those facts out to the American people. \nI do not believe they are going to be as enthusiastic about this \namendment once those facts are trotted out. Indeed, Representative \nArmey, the majority leader in the House, said, ``We cannot tell the \nAmerican people about how we are going to balance this budget. Their \nknees would buckle.'' Can you imagine, Mr. President, the cynicism of \nsaying that if we have a social contract, if we have the facts known by \nthe American people, they would be against this matter, and therefore \nwe cannot tell them? It is like a candidate running for office who \nsays, ``Vote for me now, and I will tell you what my platform is \nlater.''\n  Is there anything more fundamental to the choices of America, to the \nfuture of America, than who pays for the balanced budget? Who pays? Mr. \nPresident, there are vast differences in who pays. Just in the last \nCongress this Senate went a long way toward reducing that deficit. In \nfact, both under the Bush and under the Clinton programs the budget \ndeficit as a percent of the gross national product is coming down from \n5 to 2.3 percent, almost half of the deficit as a percent of gross \nnational product, which is the appropriate measure to use. The deficit \nhas come down by that much. But what a controversial matter that was in \nthe last Congress. In fact, not one single Republican voted for the \nClinton program because it involved taxes. It is, in fact, Mr. \nPresident, a fundamental choice. And the American people ought to be \ninvolved in that fundamental choice.\n  How is it going to be done? How is it going to be balanced? Well, the \nTreasury Department was asked by the chairman of the National Governors \nAssociation to do a State-by-State breakdown making assumptions that \nthe Contract With America would be passed and asked what the effect on \neach State would be.\n  I can tell you, Mr. President, for my State of Louisiana, it showed \nthat we were more heavily impacted than any other State. They concluded \nthat we would have $2.1 billion per year in lost funding for Medicaid, \n$129 million per year in lost highway trust funds, $66 million per year \nin lost welfare--AFDC, that is--$444 million per year in lost funding \nfor education, job training, the environment, and housing and other \nareas, and that, ``Louisiana would have to increase State taxes by 38.2 \npercent across the board to make up for the loss in grants.''\n  That is what the Treasury Department concluded. They were not asked \nto make that judgment for my State of Louisiana but for all States. I \ninvite all Senators to look at the State-by-State breakdown and the \nassumptions that were made. Some of my colleagues in the House from my \nState when faced with these figures said, ``Oh, that is scare talk. \nThat is scare talk. It is not to be.'' Mr. President, it involves \nassumptions, no doubt, and they may not be exactly accurate. I do not \nclaim that they are exactly accurate. I do say that they are \nmathematically correct, that they assume that you are going to get to a \nbalanced budget, and that you use today's figures about the economy.\n  I can tell you this, Mr. President. No one else has put out any other \nalternative. So if this is not correct, I say to my colleagues who \ncriticize the Treasury study, tell us what your program is. That is why \nwe are so anxious to find out what that program is.\n  I confidently predict when the word gets out there across America as \nto what this is going to mean, it is not only going to not be popular, \nbut it is going to be wildly unpopular.\n  I well remember the catastrophic health care debate around here \nwhere, to solve a problem, the American Association of Retired Persons, \nAARP, proposed a program and we adopted it in this Senate, a highly \nsubsidized program for senior citizens and catastrophic health care \nunder which the richest American would have to pay a maximum of $600 a \nyear. We passed it, I think, unanimously, or maybe there were one or \ntwo votes against it; not many. And within a year, because of the \noutcry across America, both Houses repealed it in record time. That was \n$600. Mr. President, when senior citizens see the size of Medicare cuts \nthat are going to be required under this, they are going to rise up as \none.\n  Social Security is not off the table here. Social Security is right \nthere on the table. It is right there in the cross hairs. What everyone \nis asking by voting for the balanced budget amendment is to say, make \nus do it. We really want to cut Social Security and we want to cut \nMedicare. Make us do it so we can blame it on somebody else, the courts \nor whoever.\n  Mr. President, we are told here today that there is some language in \nthis amendment that prevents the courts from enforcing this amendment.\n  I can not find that language. Mr. President, it permits the Congress \nto implement this amendment by appropriate legislation, which is the \nsame language you have in the 14th amendment. I believe that same \nlanguage is in the 15th amendment as well.\n  Congress, as far as I can recall, never used that under the 14th \namendment. It is permissive and it does not make any requirement. But \nwe are told that there are two bases on which the Court would not get \ninto this. First is that it was a political question. Mr. President, I \nthink the Court has long since abandoned that political question. You \nremember the one-man-one-vote decision. That was, for many, many years \na political question in this country. The Supreme Court refused to take \njurisdiction, and they finally did take jurisdiction and ruled for one-\nman-one-vote. I think the proclivity of the Supreme Court to avoid \npolitical questions has long since left, and I think properly so.\n  Second, we are told there would be no standing to sue under this. If \nthat is the intent of Congress, it is very easy to deprive anyone from \naccess to the Court. But that is not the intent here, Mr. President. It \nis very plain. It is a constitutional amendment. There is a Federal \nstatute giving jurisdiction to courts to raise constitutional \nquestions. And surely somebody has a right to raise a constitutional \nquestion. We have that under the 14th amendment. Why would you not have \nit under this? And if there is no access to the Court, who is to \nenforce? If what we are after is some requirement from some outside \nforce to make us do what we would \n[[Page S1831]] otherwise not do, if the Court cannot do it, then who \ncan? Then where is the compulsion? Then what is the point?\n  We can do this right now, Mr. President. If this amendment does not \nmean that the courts have jurisdiction to enforce it, it does not mean \nanything more than the present law says, because the law now says you \nmust have a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this also violates the principle of \nmajority rule. By requiring 60 votes to have an unbalanced budget, you \ngive enormous power to the minority. This is an old ploy, Mr. \nPresident. We have it in our State, where in order to raise taxes you \nmust have, I believe, a two-thirds vote. And what happens when you have \nto have taxes? That one-third of holdouts have a shopping list which is \nalways long, usually very expensive and, in the end, they finally get \nthe votes because they have to have the revenues. But in the end, it \namounts to bad policy. Not only does it violate the principle of \nmajority rule, but it calls for making deals with the holdouts.\n  Mr. President, if we get into the shape where you have to do it, \nwhere you have to have the 60 votes and everybody recognizes it, you \nwill be able to get it done, but probably at great cost to the \ntaxpayer, both in money and in bad policy.\n  Mr. President, if, as I contend, the courts very plainly have \njurisdiction here to order up a balanced budget, then how are they \ngoing to do it? The occupant of the chair is a lawyer of some \ndistinction, and I know he has dealt with constitutional questions \nbefore. I believe what the Court would do is to order an income tax \nsurcharge and say the Congress has X amount of time within which to \ncome up with an alternative to balance the budget; otherwise, the \nsurcharge will go into effect. Why do I believe that? Because the Court \ndoes not have access to the huge amount of staff it would take to \ndetermine the effect of budget cuts. It takes tremendous \nsophistication, computer models, and knowledge, to know what the spend-\nout rates of various cuts would be, how they impact upon the public in \ngeneral, and how they impact upon the budget.\n  I do not believe the Court is going to get in there and say, well, we \nneed to cut the National Park Service by 5 percent; we are going to \nexempt the IRS because we need those people; we are going to cut \nMedicare by X percent. One thing we found out about health care, this \nhuge, growing part of the budget, is how complicated it is. The Court \nis not going to deal with those kinds of cuts. Do you think the Court \nis going to get in and say we need to cancel the remaining part of the \nB-2 bomber program, and we are going to allow the F-l6 to go forward, \nand we are going to have one less division, and we are going to close \nthis many bases? They are not going to do that, Mr. President. They do \nnot know how to do that. If they took 2 years within which to make a \ndecision, they could never come up with that judgment.\n  So what are they really going to do? If they conclude, as I believe \nthey would, that you cannot get the 60 votes and that you have violated \nthe balanced budget, the simple thing is an income tax surcharge. You \ndo not have to know about the income tax program. You do not have to be \nan expert on that. You simply say a surcharge. All of the rules that \nare in effect right now, you let them go on, and you put a surcharge \nequal to the amount of that deficit. It may be a huge one; it may be a \npunishing kind of thing. But they would then lob the ball right back \ninto the Congress.\n  I sincerely believe, Mr. President, that is what the Court would do. \nI have thought about this thing a lot. That is what I would do if I \nwere on the Court, because there is no other alternative. If you say \nthe Court is not going to get involved in it, again, Mr. President, \nwhat is the point? If the Court is not going to enforce it, then it is \nup to the Congress--well, it is up to the Congress right now. So what \ndoes this add? I say to those who would argue with me that the Court \nhas no jurisdiction; why do you not put that in the amendment? I can \ngive you the language for it off the top of my head within about 10 \nwords: No court shall have jurisdiction to order the budget to be \nbalanced.\n  That is all we have to say if that is what we mean. And if it is so \nfundamental, why do we not say it? Because that is not what it means? \nOf course, it means that the Court can enforce it. If we do not know \nthe answer to that fundamental question, then I say this is the most \nambiguous constitutional amendment, perhaps, we have ever had, and \nthere has been a lot of ambiguity. This particular ambiguity would be \nvery easy to clear up if in fact it is ambiguous, and I believe it is.\n  Mr. President, virtually everyone is for the balanced budget, but \nthere are vast differences in how to do it, and there are also vast \ndifferences in the timing of when it is done.\n  All economists--a conservative economist, a liberal economist, and \nall the rest--will agree on one thing, and that is that you ought to \ntake bigger bites out of the deficit when times are good and lesser \nbites out of the deficit when times are bad. In other words, as the \nFederal Reserve Board is meeting today and tomorrow, talking about \nraising interest rates, why are they talking about raising interest \nrates and why have they raised them over these last few months? Very \nsimple. Because they believe the economy is overheating. They point out \nthat unemployment rates are at not historic lows, but very low rates. \nThey are worried that that low unemployment will spur inflation in \nwages and in commodity prices. So the rumor is that they are going to \nraise interest rates another half, maybe three-quarters of a point.\n  This would be a good time to take some big bites, therefore, out of \nthe deficit. When you get into a recession, Mr. President, it is not \nthe time to take big bites out of the deficit. And everybody, virtually \nall economists, agree on that. But this amendment puts you irrevocably, \nindelibly, inexorably on this glidepath--some would call it a crash \npath--to a balanced budget, without knowing how in the world we are \ngoing to do it.\n  And it may be, Mr. President, that you will have maybe 50 Senators \nwho want to raise taxes, maybe 50 Senators who want to cut Medicare, \nmaybe 40 Senators who want to cut Social Security. You may not be able \nto agree, and you lateral that ball right over to the Supreme Court, \nwho will decide it for us in the way that I believe they would, which \nis with an income tax surcharge.\n  Mr. President, the Congress can, in fact, balance the budget right \nnow or put us on the glidepath. We can do it under Gramm-Rudman and set \nforth a spending glidepath that is enforceable, that calls for \nsequestration if we violate it, that calls for 60-vote points of order \nif we violate that. That is really all we have to do. I mean, that is \nan elaborate procedure which, once agreed upon, is much more clear, \nmuch less ambiguous than a constitutional amendment would be, because \nyou know exactly how it is to be enforced; to be enforced by \nsequestration, which exempts certain programs, and does not exempt \nother programs. And it is self-enforcing. The whole mechanism is \nenforcing.\n  Now, why would we not do that? Well, it may be, Mr. President, \nbecause, as Mr. Armey says, the public's knees would buckle if they \nknew the truth--the public's knees would buckle if they knew the truth. \nWhat an incredible statement for this Congress to make; that if the \npublic knew how we were going to do this thing, they would not like it \nand they would not be for it.\n  What happened to that old axiom of government with the consent of the \ngoverned? Oh, we are told that the Congress has not done anything. Mr. \nPresident, where have my colleagues been these last 2 or 3 years, when \nwe brought the deficit down from 5 percent to 2.3 percent of gross \nnational product? Did we think we achieved that without any pain or any \ndisagreement here?\n  Mr. President, we achieved a lot in terms of reducing that deficit. \nIt can be done. It is hard to do, of course. But it can be done. And \nthe American people were involved in that. Maybe they did not like the \nway it was done. I did not like the way it was done. I had a different \nidea about how it should be done. But the majority ruled and it was \ndone, and it can be done now without this constitutional amendment.\n  [[Page S1832]] Mr. President, we all know that the deficit is coming \ndown but that forecasts show that, in the future, the deficit is due to \ngo up rapidly again because of the projected increases in medical \nprograms, particularly Medicare and Medicaid.\n  That means that we in the Congress are going to have to take rather \nheroic steps in order just to stay even with the board; in other words, \nto keep the deficit from going up, much less balancing the budget, we \nare going to have to take rather heroic steps.\n  Now, how difficult will those steps be? I do not know, Mr. President. \nI suspect they will be rather difficult.\n  But I can tell you this: that those steps, combined with an automatic \ndeficit reduction down to a zero constitutional amendment, which cannot \nbe avoided except by supermajorities, at least if we go into a \nrecession or slowdown, might make it virtually impossible for us to \nact. In other words, we do not know what we are in for in terms of the \ncoping with this Medicare problem. We just do not know.\n  The difficulties we had in the last Congress in trying to figure out \nhow to deal with the medical crisis in this country and how to project \ncosts and how to project savings from certain steps and certain \nlegislation were terribly difficult. No one could ever agree. Some said \nit was going to cost more; some said it was going to cost less.\n  But we are going to have to not only do that to conquer that question \nof turning around the increase in Medicare spending, but we are going \nto have to balance the budget at the same time, no matter what.\n  That is why, Mr. President, taking out the flexibility that this \nCongress ordinarily has to act by majority vote is a very, very bad \nidea. The timing is simply bad. The political timing is good.\n  You know, the American people have finally woke up to the balanced \nbudget issue. They seemed to be unaware of it during the 1980's when \nthe debt was going from a little over $900 billion to almost $4 \ntrillion at the start of this administration. They seemed to be \nrelatively unaware of it at that time. Now they have become aware, \nsince it has come down from 5 percent of GNP down to 3.2 percent of GNP \nby the end of this year; now they are aware of it.\n  It does not mean that it is not still a problem. But it does mean to \nsay that political polls, as to who is for and who is against a \nbalanced budget, are ephemeral gauges that go up and down and do not \ntake into account that the American people do not yet know how it is \ngoing to be done.\n  Mr. President, we ought to involve the American people in this \nbiggest of all social contracts. We have heard this term ``Contract \nWith America.'' It was an ingenious political device. I stand in \nadmiration of it. Some parts of it I support. But it was an ingenious \npolitical device which conjured up the idea that the Congress and the \nAmerican public ought to have an agenda, that they ought to vote on \nthat agenda by electing their representatives, vote for what they get \nand get what they vote for. And that was brilliant.\n  Mr. President, this is a bigger contract with America than that which \nis contained in the so-called Contract With America, because it \ninvolves the future of everyone. It is a question of who pays. It can \nbe done by means testing and maybe that ought to be the way we ought to \ndo it.\n  Maybe we ought to say that everybody who makes over X dollars has to \npay twice as much for their Medicare. Maybe we ought to say if you make \nover $50,000 a year, you do not get Social Security, whatever the \nformula is. Means testing is clearly one of those ways to do it. It has \nbeen discussed a lot.\n  I wonder how many people out there in America, how many senior \ncitizens, have thought about how much means testing has to be done. And \nremember catastrophic health care and the reaction to that. Or it could \nmean taxes. And we know how the American public feels about taxes. Or \ndefense. You know, the American public says, ``Gosh, we need a strong \nnational defense.'' Or we could eliminate some of these programs.\n  But I suspect, Mr. President, that the American public is in for a \nrude awakening when they find out how little money you can get out of \nthe welfare program. I think we ought to have welfare reform. But \nvirtually everything that is talked about with welfare reform costs \nmore money.\n  Orphanages? Mr. President, what do you think orphanages would cost? \nRight now, you know, the babies stay at home with mama and you give \nmama a check. But if you had to build the orphanage, acquire the \nproperty and build the orphanage, get the staff to operate the \norphanage, and not only do that but take care 24 hours a day of these \nkids in loco parentis, as we say, the cost of that, Mr. President, \nwould be--maybe it would not be as expensive as Boys Town; I understand \nBoys Town costs $70,000 or $80,000 a year. They have a lot of special \ncounseling there.\n But if we have just the garden variety orphanage, it will cost a lot \nmore than welfare does. Job training, I am for it. But anybody who \nthinks we can have job training and then have day care for the \nmothers--and we are going to be a lot cheaper on that than the present \nwelfare program--has not taken out the calculator to figure this thing \nout. There is not a lot to be saved in welfare. We need to reform it, \nbut there is not a lot to be saved. There is certainly not a lot to be \nsaved in foreign aid.\n\n  I want to see my colleagues who are for cutting aid to some of our \ngreat friends out there--I am not--countries like Israel, which are so \nstrong in promoting the American interests all throughout the Middle \nEast. I am not for cutting that program. It is less than 1 percent of \nthe budget.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, and I apologize for speaking so long, \nbut it is an important issue. This is an issue where we need a Contract \nWith America. This is an issue where we need a social contract. We need \na major debate where the American public is told about how this will be \ndone, at least what is the approach; maybe not how every dollar over a \nperiod of 7 years is going to be cut in every single program, but how \nis it going to be done in approach. Is it going to be a means testing \napproach? If so, what is that going to mean to those senior citizens \nout there?\n  Is it going to be cuts in Medicare? For example, copayments? And how \nbig would those copayments have to be? How much do we pay each time we \ngo to a doctor? Should senior citizens not know that? Should they not \nknow that, Mr. President? What will happen if they wake up--all the \nSenators have voted for the balanced budget amendment, and then I can \nsee them. It will be just like in catastrophic health care. They will \ncall up and say, ``We did not know that that is what was meant. We did \nnot know, Senator, that is what you had it mind.'' I remember those \ncalls on catastrophic health care.\n  Now, I think the American public ought to be entitled to know what we \nare going to do, to know what the plan is and involve them in the \ndebate. We do not have to rush into this thing. It is one of the most \nimportant debates we have ever had. Involve them in that debate. Tell \nthem at least the broad outlines of what we will do, what will it cost \nMr. or Mrs. or Ms. Senior Citizen. Do you know what I really believe? I \nreally believe the senior citizens are right in the cross hairs. They \nare in the scope. They are in the sights. And get ready, senior, \nbecause you will have to pay for this thing. To a very large extent, it \nis our senior citizens who will pay for the balanced budget amendment.\n  Medicare is going to be No. 1. Mr. President, we made cuts in \nMedicare in the past. They have not really hurt. Right now the \nGovernment pays about 70 percent of the doctor's bill or the hospital \nbill on the average on Medicare. But those doctors and the hospitals \nhad accepted that 70 percent. What do they do? They pass it on to the \nother people. ``Cost-shifting'' it is called. Passed on. Passed on to \nthose who have insurance and to those who can pay. Everybody knows that \nthat is so.\n  There are, however, limits to that cost shifting, I suspect, and I am \ntold by experts that we are right at the limit on cost shifting. In \nother words, we start cutting Medicare just on these block cuts more \nthan we have now, and we will have doctors who will refuse to treat, \nhospitals who will refuse to accept patients, and we are going to have \nto make the changes in Medicare. Copayments, increases in premiums, or \nrationing of medical care, or other means.\n   [[Page S1833]] In fact, the Speaker of the House just yesterday said \nwe need a fundamental reexamination of Medicare. What did he mean? What \ndid he mean, Mr. President? We do not know. But I think Medicare is \nimportant enough to the American people that we should be told that \nfundamental thing before we go in and adopt a balanced budget amendment \nwhich may require that fundamental restructuring of Medicare in such a \nway that the seniors are going to have to pay for this balanced budget \namendment.\n  We are not talking about small decreases in expenditures. We are \ntalking about $1.5 trillion between now and the year 2002. We are \ntalking about cuts so huge that it would require a fundamental \nrestructuring in Medicare, probably a fundamental restructuring in \nSocial Security if those things are on the table. What else is there? \nWhat else is there?\n  Mr. President, I oppose this balanced budget amendment, certainly in \nthe form that it is now. It is a ticket to the Supreme Court with an \norder for an income tax surcharge. It is an invitation for the senior \ncitizens of this country to pay for it with huge, massive cuts in \nMedicare, probably Social Security. My State of Louisiana--according to \nthe Treasury Department, is going to be impacted more than anybody. \nThey say it would require a tax increase of 38.2 percent across the \nboard. How many people in my State, if this is true, would be for this \n38.2-percent tax increase?\n  Maybe that is not so. Well, if they did not make the right \nassumptions, tell Members what the assumptions are. Tell Members what \nthose assumptions are. Then, if I know how it will be done and we sort \nof have that debate out there with our people, I could well be for it, \nbecause everyone, including me, is certainly for the balanced budget in \nconcept. But not this way. Not ``vote for me now'' and I will tell you \nwhat the platform is later. Not putting at risk the fundamental future \nof senior citizens in these fundamental programs that we have in this \ncountry. It is the wrong way to do it, Mr. President.\n  I hope as this debate proceeds we will get some of these answers. How \nare we going to do it? Does the court have jurisdiction? Does anybody \nhave standing? Just what is the plan? That is what we need in order to \nhave a contract with America and to have a social contract with the \npeople of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I just want to take 5 minutes to respond \nbriefly to my colleague from Louisiana, for whom I have great respect. \nAs a matter of fact, I have cited Senator Johnston as an example of why \nterm limits are a mistake, even though he has decided that he is going \nto leave this body.\n  Just very briefly. On the question of the courts imposing taxes, \nthere has only been one example of that in our history and that is the \nJenkins case in Kansas City. That was because Congress was silent. On \nthis, we say Congress shall implement, and we will spell that out. We \nwill make clear this is not the jurisdiction of the courts.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Would the Senator yield at that point?\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Under the 14th amendment, courts run prisons, courts \nrun schools, courts have even required taxes. What was the name of the \ncase where the courts required taxes to equalize taxes between school \ndistricts in a State? They do that all the time. Section 5 of the 14th \namendment says that the Congress may implement this amendment by \nappropriate legislation. Same language as we have here. What is the \ndifference?\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I think there are two differences. No 1, \nsection 6, first of all, spells out ``Congress shall enforce.'' \nCongress shall enforce, not the courts shall enforce.\n  Second, when we talk about equity----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Does it say the courts may not enforce?\n  Mr. SIMON. No. We say Congress shall enforce and Congress shall \nimplement. But we have not in terms of equity. In terms of taxation, \nthe courts may get into a school case.\n  There is only one case where the courts have imposed taxes on people, \nas far as I know, in the history of our country and that is the Jenkins \ncase. In the Jenkins case the law is silent. They moved into an area \nwhere there was no law. Here we are going to, I assume--and Senator \nHatch and I certainly are in agreement on this, and I am sure Senator \nJohnston would be--make clear, very explicitly, this is our \njurisdiction. And in terms of enforcement, because that is the problem, \nthen, when we say we cannot increase the debt limit without a 60-\npercent vote, that is very tough enforcement, as Attorney General Barr \ntestified.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. May I ask my dear friend. Section 6 says, Congress \nshall enforce and implement this by appropriate legislation. It does \nnot say the courts lack jurisdiction to enforce the amendment. Every \nother amendment of the Constitution, my friend would agree, can be \nenforced by the courts, can they not?\n  Mr. SIMON. Yes. And we do not prohibit any kind of court involvement. \nBut, the history of this in States that have these kind of provisions \nis that there have rarely been any court cases. That is the history of \nit.\n  That is the history of it. The Senator and I took one oath when we \nstood down there, as the Presiding Officer did just a few weeks ago, to \nuphold and defend the Constitution. I do not think we are going to take \nthat lightly.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. My friend would agree that the courts are not \nprohibited from enforcing this amendment, and that in every other \namendment the Court has jurisdiction to enforce, and they do get \ninvolved in every other amendment, do they not?\n  Mr. SIMON. If the Senate should say the heck with the Constitution, \nwe are not going to pay any attention to this--and I cannot conceive of \nour doing that--then it is possible in some way the courts will get \ninvolved. But it is interesting in that last time, if I may just finish \nhere, we had one of our colleagues who attacked us on the same basis, \nand then very reluctantly--and I think I speak for Senator Hatch on \nthis, too--we accepted the Danforth amendment which was more precise on \nthis about the courts not being involved, and then the same Senator got \nup and said I have a constitutional amendment that is meaningless. If \nmy colleague from Louisiana will assure me that he will vote for the \namendment if he gets those words in there that he would like, I am \nwilling to take a look at it.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Let me ask, because it is at least as fundamental a \nquestion as there is here, do we agree, if I may get involved with the \ndistinguished floor manager--\n  Mr. SIMON. Sure. I yield time to my colleague from Utah also.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The courts would have jurisdiction to enforce the \namendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not think they do. As a matter of fact, I cannot see \nany way that the courts would find standing or justiciability, and I \nthink they will invoke the political question doctrine, especially \nsince we say Congress has the obligation and the right and power to \nenforce it.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Is that the clear intent of the authors, that the \ncourts may not enforce it?\n  Mr. HATCH. Clear intent.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Why do you not say so? It is very easy, very sparing \nwords.\n  Mr. HATCH. We do not because it is a true constitutional amendment \nand, frankly, there are those on the other side who I think will argue \nthat the courts ought to have some control. We just want to avoid that \nparticular argument.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Would not my friend agree----\n  Mr. HATCH. Some say no matter what you do the courts do not have \ncontrol but they ought to. The majority say, well, we do not want the \ncourts to have any control or have any interest in this and then we \nwind up, we wind up on both sides of the issue. Frankly, what we did \nis----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Would not my friend agree with me that this is at least \nambiguous----\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not think it is. I do not think it is when you--\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Political doctrine? The Senator remembers the one-man-\none-vote case, Baker versus Carr?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. For many, many years one-man-one vote was considered by \nthe Court to be a political question. \n[[Page S1834]] And the Supreme Court in Baker versus Carr changed that \njudgment and said it is no longer political; we are going to order one-\nman-one-vote.\n  Now, what is there inherent in this that makes it a political \nquestion?\n  Mr. SIMON. If I may respond, on the one man-one-vote case, which grew \nout of the State of Tennessee, there was no explicit jurisdiction \nclaimed solely by the legislative bodies. And here we are going to \nclaim that we have the jurisdiction.\n  If I may respond just to a few other points that my friend from \nLouisiana made, he said--and a lot of my colleagues will disagree with \nwhat I have to say here, probably including my good friend from Utah. \nThe Senator said, ``This is a good time to take good bites out of the \ndeficit''--I wrote down the Senator's words--talking about the Federal \nReserve Board. But the reality is we are competing with each other \ntrying to get a tax cut right now.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The Senator is not competing with me. I think that is \nterrible policy, and I know my President is for it and I know Contract \nWith America is for it. But it is absolutely the wrong time to be doing \nthat.\n  Mr. SIMON. I could not agree more with my friend from Louisiana, and \nif we had a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, we \nwould not be talking about it here. That is one of the realities.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. In the Contract With America, it has both a tax cut and \na constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  Mr. SIMON. If the Senator is expecting me to defend the Contract With \nAmerica, I am not about to do that.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No, but the Senator said we would not be talking about \nit, and they are talking about it and they are in control.\n  Mr. SIMON. But my friend from Louisiana has just illustrated why we \nneed the balanced budget amendment. It is absolutely ridiculous to be \ntalking about a tax cut when we have these huge deficits. But we can do \nthat because it is popular, and so we are going to go out and we will \ngo back home and make speeches how we cut taxes--absolutely nutty to be \ndoing that right now. And so I think the Senator has made the point.\n  When the Senator said we can do it on our own, that is the same \nspeech we heard here in 1986 when it lost by one vote in the Senate. \nThe total Federal debt then was $2 trillion. Now it is $4.7 trillion. \nAnd if we make the mistake of turning it down again, if we have a \nchance before we have economic chaos, it will be $9 trillion and we \nwill have hurt the economy much, much more.\n  In terms of the Social Security trust fund, the Senator said the \nseniors are in the cross hairs--every group is being told. And those \nfigures the Senator got from Treasury, they are about as inaccurate as \nany figures that I can imagine.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Where are they wrong? I hope they are wrong. Where are \nthey wrong?\n  Mr. SIMON. They are wrong. And I think, I might add, in the course of \nthis debate the Senator will have plenty of examples of why they are \nwrong, and I am going to be one who will spell it out.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Is it the mathematics or is it the assumptions?\n  Mr. SIMON. Yes. And I will spell that out. But let me just say the \nSenator mentioned seniors are in the cross hairs on Social Security. \nBob Myers, the chief actuary for the Social Security system for 21 \nyears, said it is absolutely essential for the Social Security trust \nfund to pass this. Without this, we are headed toward monetizing the \ndebt. And as you look at the history of nations, I think that is very, \nvery clear.\n  Then, finally, the Senator mentioned about responding on recessions. \nI would say there are two arguments here. One is used by Fred Bergsten, \nyou probably remember, former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, who \nsays we are really strapped; we cannot respond to recessions as we \nshould now. What we ought to do is have a 1- or 2-percent surplus and \nthen give the President the authority to initiate programs immediately \nin areas where you have unemployment above X percent.\n  I think that is a very valid argument. But the National Bureau of \nEconomic Research at Cambridge has issued a study by two University of \nCalifornia economists who come to this conclusion.\n\n       Discretionary fiscal policy does not appear to have had an \n     important role in generating recoveries. Fiscal responses to \n     economic downturns have generally not occurred until real \n     activity was approximately at its trough.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Is he one of those who disagreed that the New Deal \nhelped bring us out of the Depression?\n  Mr. SIMON. All I know is the economists are from the University of \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. There are some people who believe in the flat Earth, \ntoo.\n  Mr. SIMON. I would add one other point, and I think most economists \nare in agreement on this point here that they make. At least I have had \na lot of reading on that. But the other point is where we have extended \nunemployment compensation--and I have been looking at this--when we \nhave had recessions, in every case but one, in 1982, we have had way \nmore than the 60 votes that this constitutional amendment would \nrequire.\n  Anyway, I thank my colleague from Louisiana for his discussion. \nObviously, we do slightly disagree on this constitutional amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. We in our report make it very clear. We say:\n\n       The committee believes that S. J. Res. 1 strikes the right \n     balance in terms of judicial review. By remaining silent \n     about judicial review in the amendment itself, its authors \n     have refused to establish congressional sanction for the \n     Federal courts to involve themselves in fundamental \n     macroeconomic and budgetary questions, while not undermining \n     their equally fundamental obligation to ``say what the law is \n     . . .'' The committee agrees with former Attorney General \n     William P. Barr who stated that there is. . . .\n\n  And then he went on to make it clear the courts will not.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If I may ask, is the Senator saying the Supreme Court \nis going to follow this judicial history?\n  Mr. HATCH. Maybe Justice Scalia will not but the other Justices will. \nAnd I think even Justice Scalia will because he will consider the law \nas it exists. Because, you know, the courts can only enforce \nconstitutional amendments--really only where there is ``standing.'' \nThat is----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Who decides whether there is standing?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me define it. I believe my colleague has the floor but \nI am trying to respond to him. That is the ``case in controversy'' \nrequirement of Article 3, which requires litigants to show harm. No one \ncan show harm under Section 6 of this amendment. Since Frothingham \nversus Mellon, that was in the 1920's, the Court held that in order to \nhave standing, a litigant must show particularized harm in budget and \ntax structures.\n  The case that the Senator is referring to, the one man one vote case, \nis Reynolds versus Sims. In that case, in the one man one vote case, \nthe Court believed that in that case, in that particular case, the \nlitigant could show particularized harm so the Court did finally decide \nit on that basis.\n  Now, the difference between that and here, is that there the Court \nwas working on a fundamental right to vote, a fundamental right to have \nyour vote weighed, a fundamental right to have your vote count. And you \ngo right down the line on the fundamental right to vote.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If the Senator will yield now----\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could just add one more sentence. I just want to get \nthis all out in one or two or three paragraphs.\n  As an example of a consitutional situation where standing will not \nlie, litigants literally cannot sue or complain about the President's \ncontrol over foreign policy. They just cannot. So I wanted to get that \none point out.\n  But, yes, the Court will pay attention to this. Yes, the Court will \npay attention to section 6 of this amendment. And, yes, it is almost--I \ndo not see any way that you could show standing and show that kind of \nparticularized harm that you could show in Reynolds versus Sims. It was \nnot hard for the Court to \n[[Page S1835]] make that transition and decide Reynolds versus Sims the \nway it did. Some may disagree with the decision. Some may say that, \nyes--as the Senator did--for a fairly long period of time they treated \nthe whole issue as a political question. But there is a far greater \ndifference between deciding a fundamental right like the right to vote \nand enforcing a constitutional amendment that makes it very clear that \nCongress has the power to enforce and to take care of the details of \nthe amendment itself.\n  Now, what is important here, in my opinion, is that--I value my \nfriend from Louisiana. He knows it. We have been friends for the whole \ntime I have been here. I have respected the work that he has done in \nthe Senate. I hate to see him leave. And I think the Senate will be not \nas good a place once he does leave.\n  But I hope the Senator will continue to discuss this with us, if not \non the floor at least off the floor. Because I am interested in \nsatisfying people around here. Our problem is, as everybody knows, that \nwe have 535 Members here. If he and I could sit down and write this \namendment it might be a little bit different. In fact, he did \nparticipate in helping to get us to this point on the amendment. If the \nSenator from Idaho and I sat down and wrote it, it might be a little \nbit different. The fact of the matter is, a bunch of us have sat down \nover a 12-year period and have written this and it is the best \nconsensus amendment, best bipartisan amendment we can do that might \npossibly cause us to start being serious about some of the deficiencies \nof Government, which I think the distinguished Senator from Louisiana \nhas outlined quite well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, my friend has outlined the emerging \nstate of the law on the question of standing to sue. The issue of \nstanding to sue goes all across the law and provokes about as many \ndecisions as any area of the law that I know about.\n  Suffice it to say it is emerging, dynamic, and changeable. And--as is \nthe question of a political question.\n  In Reynolds versus Sims, and Baker versus Carr, formerly political \nquestions, they changed on that issue. There they were enforcing the \n14th amendment, which said nothing about voting rights and which \ntraditionally had been left to the States. So this was a change.\n  This amendment specifically deals with a question of unbalanced \nbudgets. My friend says no taxpayer is particularly harmed by this. You \nshould have heard the eloquent speech--as maybe he did--of my colleague \nfrom Illinois, who talked about her child and future deficits. You \nwould think, to hear that, it is the most fundamental issue for our \nprogeny and our families that there is. And I believe the Court would \nfind that standing to sue.\n  What I find to be objectionable, among other things, I say to my \nfriend, is this is deliberately ambiguous. It is deliberately ambiguous \nbecause there are those Senators who say the Court has to have the \nfinal club in the closet otherwise this does not mean anything. And \nthere are others who say we do not want to get the Court mixed up in \nthis because we do not want the Court to order taxes. So we leave it \ndeliberately vague, ambiguous, to be decided by some future Supreme \nCourt.\n  I believe that is the height of irresponsibility. It is not a \ndifficult task from the standpoint of statutory draftsmanship. We could \nliterally draft it here within 5 minutes on the floor of the Senate. I \nwould say ``No court shall have jurisdiction to enforce this \namendment.''\n  That is simple, straightforward and unambiguous. If that is what we \nmean it ought to be said. It is not one of those difficult things to \ndefine like ``outlays and expenditures and receipts.'' That is what I \nread from section 6 here, is that the Congress shall enforce and may--\nwhat does it say--may define outlays and receipts? What does it say? \n``Estimates of outlays and receipts,'' define those. That is because \nthey are not self-defining.\n  But a jurisdiction of a court is fundamental and it is the Congress \nwho needs to make that choice. Is it an enforceable amendment or not an \nenforceable amendment?\n  How can we be debating something as fundamental as a balanced budget \namendment and not know whether the Court can enforce it or not? How \ncould we do that? That boggles the mind. That is the question. Can they \nenforce and how can they enforce? That is the question. We do not \nanswer it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I believe, if my colleague looks at facts, he looks at the \nlaw, he looks at the Court, there is really no question that the courts \ncannot enforce this.\n  Will there be----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just finish, if I can. The Senator seems to be \nmaking an argument that there is a mere possibility. I suspect we have \nto agree, there may be a mere possibility argument here.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I think it is probable. I think it is clear.\n  Mr. HATCH. The standing and political question doctrines are \nlongstanding doctrines----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Every other amendment is enforceable.\n  Mr. HATCH. Not really. They are unlikely to change. In the case of \nReynolds versus Sims, most people believe the Court made the right \ndecision there. I do not know of any constitutional scholar--there may \nbe some--but I do not know of any major constitutional scholar who \nwould think the Court made the right decision if it interferes with \nthis, nor do I know anybody on the Court who feels that way.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Why do you not say it? I do not believe----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I do not believe that judgment is clear at all. I think \nit is probable that the Court can enforce this--probable.\n  Reasonable minds can disagree. But why leave it deliberately vague, \ndeliberately ambiguous?\n  Mr. HATCH. We do not think it is ambiguous.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I will tell you why it is left deliberately vague. \nBecause there are some who are for it and some who are not for it and \nthey want to leave it up in limbo.\n  Mr. President, this is a Constitution we are amending. Why can we not \nsay what it means?\n  Mr. HATCH. Did the Senator address a question to me?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I will close with this because I have taken too long.\n  My point is that it is a Constitution we are amending. It can be \nclarified simply and clearly as to whether the Court can enforce. It is \nthe most fundamental question, and we ought to decide here on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am concerned about the Senator's \nfeelings. I do not see a way in the world that the Court is going to \nfind standing here, or even justiciability, let alone interpret the \npolitical question doctrine any other way than it has through all of \nthe century, two centuries, of existence. To be honest, I just do not \nsee how that is going to be.\n  So we are interested in continuing dialog, and I will be interested \nin chatting with my friend and seeing just what he feels on this even \nfurther. But to make a long story short, again this is a bipartisan \nconsensus amendment.\n  Is it perfect? No. But it is as close to perfect as we can make it, \nand have a two-thirds majority in each body willing to vote for it.\n  The Bill of Rights does not. None of them provide for judicial \nreview. They certainly do not do it explicitly. We will put it this \nway. Only where one shows standing can one litigate. In the first \namendment cases, for instance, one cannot sue to protect the right of \nthird parties. These are tough areas of the law. I think the Senator \ndid well to raise this issue. It has been raised in every debate I have \never had on this. But I just do not see constitutional experts on his \nside of the question.\n  We will certainly discuss it with him and continue this dialog \nbecause we do want to get a balanced budget constitutional amendment \npassed, if we can.\n  Let me put into the Record at this point some answers to the \narguments of the distinguished Senator from Louisiana on the standing, \non the justiciability, and on the political question doctrine.\n   [[Page S1836]] There being no objection, the material was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n         Balanced Budget Amendment Judicial Enforcement Issues\n\n       Opponents argue that enforcement of the BBA will result in \n     undue interference by the Federal Judiciary in the budget \n     process.\n       Response. Opponents are incorrect. Certainly the better \n     view is that enforcement suits would be dismissed on (1) \n     standing, (2) justiciability, and (3) political question \n     grounds.\n       1. Standing: The latest Supreme Court pronouncement on the \n     standing doctrine is contained in Lujan v. Defenders of \n     Wildlife, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (1992). There, the Court made clear \n     that standing is a constitutionally mandated Article III \n     prerequisite for commencing a federal action and has three \n     elements: (1) the plaintiff must have suffered an ``injury in \n     fact'' which is concrete, particularized, actual and imminent \n     and not hypethetical, (2) there must be a casual connection \n     between the injury and conduct complained of--e.g., the \n     injury must result from the actions of the complained of \n     party and not a third party, and (3) it must be likely, as \n     opposed to speculative, that the injury is ``redressable'' by \n     a favorable court decision.\n       Turning to the three-part test, it is doubtful that a \n     plaintiff could demonstrate the ``injury in fact'' prong \n     because it is well settled that a mere interest in the \n     constitutionality of a law or executive action is \n     noncognizable.\n       Moreover, it is doubtful that a litigant could prove that \n     the challenged law is the provision that ``unbalanced the \n     budget.'' In fact, such an allegation would be a \n     ``generalized grievance'' which the Court has found \n     noncognizable. E.g., Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447 \n     (1923).\n       As, to the third prong, ``redressability'', this prong \n     subsumes justiciability and the political question doctrine, \n     which I will discuss in a moment. Suffice it to say that as \n     to this prong it is doubtful that a judicial remedy exists \n     which would not violate the separation of powers doctrine.\n       The question of standing, of course, involves both \n     taxpayers and members of Congress. With regard to Taxpayer \n     Standing specifically, the Court, in Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. \n     83 (1968), announced a liberalized standing test for \n     taxpayers. Under this ``double nexus'' test, taxpayer \n     standing requires that the taxpayer-plaintiff (1) challenge \n     the unconstitutionality of the law under the Taxing and \n     Spending Clause of the Constitution, and (2) demonstrate that \n     the challenged enactment exceeds specific limitations \n     contained in the Constitution. Professor Tribe had testified \n     that some taxpayers' suits to enforce the BBA would satisfy \n     this test because the proposed Amendment would be a specific \n     constitutional limitation on congressional taxing and \n     spending power. There are two counters to this argument: (1) \n     the Supreme Court has in application severely restricted the \n     Flast doctrine; indeed, the Court seems to limit Flast to \n     Establishment Clause situations. See Valley Forge Christian \n     College v. Americans United for Separation of Church & State, \n     454 U.S. 464 (1982), and (2) the Flast test is not a \n     substitute for the Lujan test; meeting the Flast test only \n     establishes the ``harmed in fact'' first prong of Lujan and \n     that the ``redessability'' prong cannot be met by taxpayer-\n     plaintiffs. This conclusion is supported by the Lujan \n     decision itself, whereby taxpayer standing cases are \n     discussed in content of concrete harm.\n       The final possible route to standing in cases challenging \n     the BBA, congressional standing, also seems to have little \n     chance of success. It must be pointed out that the Supreme \n     Court has never addressed the\n      question of congressional standing and that the Circuit \n     courts are divided on this issue. However, the D.C. \n     Circuit recognizes congressional standing in the following \n     limited circumstances: (1) the traditional standing tests \n     of the Supreme Court are met, (2) there must be a \n     deprivation within the ``zone of interest'' protected by \n     the Constitution or a statute (generally, the right to \n     vote on a given issue or the protection of the efficacy of \n     a vote), and (3) substantial relief cannot be obtained \n     from fellow legislators through the enactment, repeal or \n     amendment of a statute (``equitable discretion'' \n     doctrine). Reigle v. Federal Open Market Committee, 656 \n     F.2d 873 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1082 (1981). \n     Although there is an argument to be made that in certain \n     limited circumstances (e.g., where Congress ignores the \n     three fifths vote requirement to raise the debt \n     limitations) the voting rights of legislators are \n     nullified and therefore there would be standing, the court \n     would probably invoke the equitable discretion doctrine to \n     dismiss the action. This ``legislative exhaustion'' \n     requirement apparently does not take into account \n     considerations of futility. In other circumstances \n     challenging the enforcement of spending measures, Members \n     of Congress would be subject to the same exacting \n     standards as citizens.\n       Even if litigants could satisfy this standing requirement, \n     courts would very likely dismiss their actions on the grounds \n     that their claims were nonjusticiable political questions. \n     The Court is Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962), set out a \n     lengthy test to determine when courts should dismiss an \n     action on political question grounds. Since Baker, the Court \n     has narrowed the political question doctrine to two elements: \n     (1) whether there is a demonstrable commitment of the issue \n     to a coordinate political department, and (2) whether there \n     is a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards \n     for resolving the issue (``justiciability''). See, e.g., \n     Nixon v. United States, 113 S.Ct. 732 (1993).\n       Identical to the ``redressability'' issue discussed above, \n     analysis of the first prong reveals significant separation of \n     powers concerns. Any significant relief (outside of a \n     congressional standing suit for declaratory judgment) would \n     require placing the budget process under judicial \n     receivership (e.g., injunctive relief setting a pro-rata \n     budget cut or the nullification of any measure after outlays \n     exceed receipts). This relief would, of course, interfere \n     with congressional Article 1 powers. In other words, federal \n     courts may not exercise Congress' spending and taxing \n     authority, such authority being exclusively delegated to \n     Congress by the Constitution.\n       Concerning the justiciabilty prong, the BBA does indeed \n     contain ``process'' standards; however, it is doubtful that \n     standing could be found to enforce such standards.\n       (Judicial Taxation) Some have also raised concern that the \n     BBA would give the courts the power or authority to raise \n     taxes. This concern, I believe, relies on a recent Supreme \n     Court decision, Missouri v. Jenkins.\n       In Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U.S. 33 (1990), the Court in \n     essence approved of a lower court remedial remedy of ordering \n     local, state or county political subdivisions to raise taxes \n     to support a court ordered school desegregation order. \n     Intentional segregation, in violation of the Fourteenth \n     Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, had been found by the \n     lower court in a prior case against the school district.\n       Would the balanced budget amendment allow a federal court \n     to order Congress to raise taxes to reduce the budget? The \n     answer is no. First, Jenkins is a Fourteenth Amendment case. \n     Under fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence, federal courts may \n     issue remedial relief against the States. The Fourteenth \n     Amendment does not apply to the federal government.\n       Second, Congress cannot be a party-defendant. To order \n     taxes to be raised, Congress must be a named defendant.\n       Presumably, suits to enforce the BBA would arise when an \n     official or agency of the Executive Branch seeks to enforce \n     or administer a statute whose funding is in question in light \n     of the BBA. See Reigle v. Federal Open Market Committee, 656 \n     F.2d at 879 n.6 (``When a plaintiff alleges injury by \n     unconstitutional action taken pursuant to a statute, his \n     proper defendants are those acting under the law * * * and \n     not the legislators which enacted the statute'', citing \n     Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 175-80 (1803)). \n     That official, however, cannot be ordered to raise taxes, \n     because he or she does not have the authority to do so.\n       Finally, under Section 6 of the BBA, the enforcement \n     mechanism, Congress could limit the type of relief granted by \n     federal courts to declaratory judgments and thereby limit \n     court intrusiveness into the budget process. This authority \n     arises out of Article III's delegation to Congress to define \n     and limit the jurisdiction of lower federal courts.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me also just take a few minutes on \nsomething that I think deserves more of a response.\n  I would like to speak on an important issue in this debate. This is \nan issue which was already debated last week, and on which the Senate \nhas already voted.\n  Last week, amendments were offered on an unrelated bill regarding \nexemption for Social Security on the balanced budget amendment. Last \nweek, the Senate voted twice on two approaches to protecting Social \nSecurity, and the votes were clear. It is the considered judgment of \nthe Senate that we will protect Social Security from benefit cuts and \ntax increases enacted to balance the budget in any legislation \nimplementing the balanced budget amendment. This body has already voted \non that. We have ruled on that.\n  This proposal, which was introduced by Senator Kempthorne, was \nsupported by an overwhelming vote of 83 to 16. An amendment introduced \nby Senator Harkin, which suggested that we exempt Social Security from \ncalculations for meeting the balanced budget requirement in the \ndiscussion itself, failed by a vote of 62 to 38. The Kempthorne \napproach, which suggested we protect Social Security from benefit cuts \nand/or tax increases in legislation implementing the balanced budget, \nis clearly the most appropriate way to protect Social Security and is \noverwhelmingly supported by this body. However, an amendment has once \nagain been introduced, and probably another one of many more which \nseeks to exempt Social Security from the balanced budget amendment in \nthe Constitution itself.\n  Many of those who wish to exempt Social Security make the rhetorical \npoint: ``We should not balance the budget on the backs of the \nelderly.'' Aside from the fact that this amendment takes the \nunprecedented step of \n[[Page S1837]] referring to a statute in the Constitution itself or \nbringing a statute into the Constitution itself, the irony is that \nexempting Social Security from the balanced budget amendment would \ncreate an overwhelming incentive to do just exactly that. Let me be \nclear.\n  The effect of this exemption will be exactly the opposite of its \nintended objective. If that exemption is granted by this body, it would \nfocus budget pressures on the Social Security trust fund that could \ndestroy the viability of the Social Security Program. If balancing the \nbudget will create tremendous pressure--and it will--all that pressure \nwill flow through whatever escape hatch is opened in the balanced \nbudget amendment. Whatever is exempted from the balanced budget rule \nwill be that escape hatch. If Social Security is made the escape hatch \nby this exemption, the total force of pressure of balancing the budget \nwill fall on Social Security.\n  For the life of me, I cannot imagine anyone trying to protect Social \nSecurity trying to do it this way. There will be overwhelming pressure \nto either redefine as many Government spending programs as possible as \n``Social Security,'' endangering its original entitlement benefit \npurpose, or to literally pull the funds out of the Social Security \ntrust funds to balance the budget. In fact, there would be nothing to \nstop Congress from borrowing as much money as it wanted from the Social \nSecurity trust fund to finance any other Government programs Congress \nwants to finance.\n  How can anybody argue that we should exempt it out of the balanced \nbudget amendment when 83 of us in this body voted to make sure that \nSocial Security is protected in the implementing legislation? After \nall, that is why you have implementing legislation. That is why we have \nthis section 6 in this amendment.\n\n       Congress shall enforce and implement this article by \n     appropriate legislation which may rely on estimates of \n     outlays and receipts.\n\n  To deny that would be a denigration of the whole Senate, or at least \nthose 83 who voted that we will take care of it in the implementing \nlegislation.\n  It is a slap in the face to all of us, as though we did not mean it. \nAn exemption from the balanced budget amendment says to Americans: Give \nus in Congress a loophole in the balanced budget requirement and we \nwill figure out later how big that loophole will be. It says to Social \nSecurity recipients: Trust us in Congress not to use your Social \nSecurity through this loophole to fund other programs.\n  I do not know about you, but I do not trust Congress if there is a \nloophole through which they can drive any kind of social spending under \nthe guise that they change the definition of Social Security.\n  I do not think our seniors would like it either, when they find out \nhow bad it is. Does anyone believe that Congress can resist a chance to \nspend other people's money when it is given a blank check like this? \nThat is why we have the debt problem we do now. If those amendments on \nSocial Security, exempting Social Security, become attached in this \namendment, that exemption would be a loophole you could drive any kind \nof spending truck you want to through. And it will not be long until \nthe whole convoy of spending trucks and approaches will go right \nthrough that loophole. In other words, the balanced budget amendment \nwould not be worth the paper it is written on. As politically \nattractive as that amendment may appear on the surface, it is \nmisconceived and will serve to harm rather than help senior citizens.\n  The motivation for exemptions like this is to ensure that Social \nSecurity benefits will not be cut. This concern is misplaced for two \nreasons.\n  First, passage of the balanced budget amendment does not in any way \nmean that Social Security benefits will be reduced. It only requires \nCongress to choose among competing programs, and there are thousands of \nthem in the Federal system right now that we wonderful Members of \nCongress created. And Social Security, everybody here knows, will \ncompete very well.\n  It will be the No. 1 Super Bowl spending victor, and there is no use \nkidding about it; everybody knows that. An approach like the Kempthorne \namendment in the Senate, overwhelmingly approved, is the best way to \nrespond to this concern. It specifically would hold Social Security \nharmless. That is, Social Security would be protected from benefit cuts \nand tax increases, enacted for the purpose of balancing the budget.\n  Ironically, the proposed exemption from the balanced budget amendment \ndoes nothing to respond to this concern. Nothing in that amendment \nwould protect Social Security recipients from either benefit cuts or \ntax increases. Those who say we are raiding the trust funds now to pay \nfor the programs may be right, but exempting Social Security will only \nmake that problem worse by making it the sole source of deficit \nspending. This will create a positive incentive to run a deficit in the \nSocial Security trust fund, simply because you will be able to then, to \noffset revenue increases elsewhere in the budget.\n  Second, the biggest threat to Social Security is our growing debt and \nconcomitant interest payments. Debt-related inflation hits especially \nhard on fixed incomes, and the Government's use of capital to fund debt \nslows productivity and income growth.\n  The way to protect Social Security is to support the balanced budget \namendment and balance the budget so that the economy will grow. Senior \ncitizens know this. They feel it. That is why a recent poll shows that \nan overwhelming 91.8 percent of seniors favor a balanced budget \namendment. They want this country brought under control, too. They know \nthat the viability of their Social Security depends on whether we in \nCongress can get this budget balanced. They know it is the best way to \nprotect their children and grandchildren and the best way to ensure \nthat runaway deficits do not lead to runaway inflation, which hurts \nthose on fixed incomes the most. It is harder on them, and it is \nespecially hard on them.\n  Being a supporter of both the balanced budget amendment and Social \nSecurity, I believe this exemption that is asked for by some of our \ncolleagues on the other side faces major concerns. I believe that the \nSenate has already voted on a better way to protect Social Security \nwhich would protect Social Security from benefit cuts and tax increases \nto balance the budget. This is the best and most appropriate way to \nprotect Social Security for our seniors and our generation.\n  One last thought and then I will yield the floor to my colleague from \nNebraska. If you do not think we raid trust funds around here, just \nlook at last year's so-called anticrime trust fund. I know a little bit \nabout that. I was on this floor for days and weeks on that issue. I \nwent over to the House to help them with their problems and help to cut \n$3 billion of pork barrel spending out of the trust fund that the House \nand conference committee had put in. We were successful.\n  When it went out of the Senate, our trust fund was $22 billion. It \nwas a trust fund set up to be paid for out of the reduction of 250,000 \nFederal workers. The purpose of it was to fight crime. By the time it \ngot to the House and by the time it got through the conference \ncommittee--and I was on that conference committee--it was ignored on 30 \namendments, and they had loaded up that trust fund with all kinds of \npork barrel spending to make themselves look good. A trust fund to \nfight crime became a trust fund to spend and buy pork. If you do not \nthink that will happen to Social Security, just exempt it in this \namendment from being part of the total budget. And if anybody in this \ncountry believes that these two bodies here are not going to protect \nSocial Security in the implementing legislation, then they have to be \nnuts. They have got to not understand basic reality in politics.\n  Constitutional amendments ought to read like constitutional \namendments. They should not be legislative vehicles to protect anybody, \nexcept the American taxpayers and people, which is what this amendment \nwill do. It is one of the few chances we have in the history of the \nlast 60 years of profligate spending to do something about it.\n  This is it, folks. If we do not pass this balanced budget amendment, \nbecause of gimmicks like trying to exempt Social Security which, in \nturn, means the trust fund will be attacked by everybody who wants to \nspend all the time, and you cannot stop it around here, there will be a \nloophole that will make \n[[Page S1838]] the constitutional amendment worthless and meaningless, \nthen we have to have rocks in our head.\n  So do not let anybody be deceived by these so-called valiant attempts \nto save Social Security. I guarantee you if we do not put a balanced \nbudget amendment in place, Social Security is going to be in trouble \njust like everything else in the budget, because we will not be able to \npay for it, because these people are not going to do the things that \nhave to be done to make priority choices among competing programs until \nwe have this balanced budget amendment, and this is it, folks.\n  This is 12 years of work; this is a bipartisan amendment. No \nRepublican and no Democrat can claim total control or credit for this. \nAll of us can. This is the chance to get there. If we miss this chance \nand miss this opportunity--and by no means do I think we are going to, \nbecause I think we will make it before the end--I shudder for the \ncountry and I shudder for our seniors, because they are going to be the \npeople that are going to be hurt the most.\n  I yield to my dear colleague from Nebraska, and I appreciate his \npatience in letting me make these points.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, my colleagues know that I am a long-time \nsupporter of the balanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  We have tried numerous other remedies, but they have failed to \nrestrain our buy-now-and-pay-later habits. We have only proved how \nclever we are in creating loopholes and dodging the spending limits. I \nbelieve that the balanced budget amendment is our only hope; it is our \nlast hope to break the cycle of runaway Federal spending.\n  However, too many people deal with the balanced budget amendment in \nthe abstract. They will not face up to the harsh reality that goes \nalong with it. They are queasy about telling the American people about \nthe sacrifices that will be involved. The real work begins after we \npass the balanced budget amendment. Passage of the legislation is \nmerely a prologue to the really tough decisions that we have to make. \nWe will have to roll up our sleeves and begin in earnest to cut \nspending.\n  The problem, Mr. President, is this: We have a distorted picture of \nhow much is available for us to cut. I will try in these remarks to let \nthe sunlight of straight talk shine in, revealing fully and honestly \nour task. It was swept under the rug in the House. We must not allow \nthat to happen in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, the spending pool looks much bigger and deeper than it \nreally is. It would be prudent to test the waters before we dive in. It \nwould be prudent for the people, their Governors, and their \nlegislators, to know what is in the constitutional amendment. It is a \nfar-reaching measure, and it is time we take off the blindfolds, open \nour eyes and take a look at it. We find ourselves in such difficult \nstraits because so much spending is placed off-limits. The pool becomes \nsmaller and smaller and shrinks and shrinks. And one program after \nanother is drained into a protected reservoir, not to be cut.\n  I want to take a few minutes to walk my colleagues through this \ndaunting task of balancing the budget by the year 2002, the first year \nwhen the balanced budget amendment could take effect.\n  Let us start with some reference points. The Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates that the projected deficit for the year 2002 will be \n$322 billion. Under the CBO sample deficit reduction path, we would \nhave to make $1.2 trillion in savings over 7 years. Setting aside \npossible debt savings, we would need to cut $259 billion in the last, \nthe seventh, year.\n  Total spending for the year 2002 is estimated to be $2.3 trillion. At \nfirst look, you might say we can certainly find $259 billion in savings \nout of that.\n  The problem is that the size of the $2.3 trillion spending pool is \nvery misleading. Much of it has already been spoken for.\n  For example, $344 billion is reserved for interest on the debt. We \ncannot do anything about that. We certainly cannot touch that money. It \nwould cause financial chaos throughout the world. So after we take that \nout, we are down to $1.9 trillion in spending. To bring us into \nbalance, we would need to make a 13-percent across-the-board cut in \nspending. That does not sound too bad. But what about Social Security?\n  The Social Security bill for the year 2002 runs to $481 billion. The \nRepublican leadership in the House and Senate have stated that Social \nSecurity should not be used to balance the budget. That is a good \nargument, but, if we exclude Social Security and interest on the debt \nthat I have just referenced, our spending pool from which to make cuts \nhas shrunk to $1.4 trillion. To bring the budget into balance now would \nrequire an 18-percent across-the-board cut.\n  Now, we come to a very important matter called defense, a major \ncomponent of discretionary spending. I have expressed my concerns about \nthe defense budget and the cuts that have been made and the hits that \nnational defense has taken over the years. I believe that we are \ncourting serious danger to national security if we cut any deeper into \nthat program.\n  But, for the sake of argument, let us use a ballpark estimate of the \nPresident's 1996 defense budget in the year 2002, about $275 billion. \nNow subtract that from our available spending pool and we are down to \n$1.2 trillion. That translates into a 22-percent across-the-board cut \nin everything else to achieve a balance.\n  I am also hearing a great deal about tax cuts. That has been \ndiscussed on the floor this afternoon. I, too, favor cuts when we can \nafford them. But right now, our priorities should be that deficit \nreduction must come first. How can we mention tax cuts and balanced \nbudget amendment in the same breath? It strikes me as the height of \nirresponsibility.\n  But for a moment, let us assume that the tax cut in the House \nContract With America is passed. In the year 2002, that represents \n$97.7 billion drain on the Treasury, further shrinking that pool that I \nhave been making reference to.\n  The tax cut increases the spending cut required to reach balance from \n$259 to $357 billion. We are headed in the wrong direction, Mr. \nPresident.\n  What about the across-the-board spending cut needed to achieve a \nbalanced budget? If we pass the tax cut, it climbs to an incredible 30 \npercent of all remaining spending.\n  I could carry this exercise even further. If veterans programs were \ntaken off the table, the across-the-board cut would rise to 31 percent. \nRemove military retirement, it is up to 32 percent. Take off civilian \nretirement, it is 34 percent. Subtract Medicare, it is 50 percent. And \nso on, and so on, and so on.\n  Mr. President, these are the facts. These are facts that I daresay \nfew Members, if any, in the House took a look at and probably not too \nmany here in the Senate have taken the time to look at them either.\n  Of course, I do not believe that we will ever reach the point where \nwe will have to cut 50 percent from all other programs. That is absurd. \nBut it does show that if we follow this hands-off approach, a small \nnumber of discretionary programs are going to take a very large and \nperhaps an unfair share of the cuts.\n  And what sort of programs are these that would be left for the up to \n50 percent cuts? Everything from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \nto the Women, Infants and Children feeding program, to Head Start, to \ncancer research, to keeping open the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone \nNational Parks, and all of the other programs in between.\n  Mr. President, the point here is that the American people have a \nright to know what it will take to balance the budget. We should lay \nout the policies and actions that will be necessary to reach that goal \nand not hide behind some curtain and say, ``We'll tell you about it \nlater.'' We should do it before we vote on this legislation.\n  Mr. President, let me emphasize even further how difficult this task \nwhich this Senator supports is going to be.\n  I am going to read a portion now, Mr. President, of a letter that was \nrecently handed to me from the Communication Workers of America that I \nthink is very instructive, not only for Nebraska, but the other States \nthat are mentioned in the Wharton deliberations and reports, on what \nwould happen to Nebraska if the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution would pass. The letter reads:\n\n        [[Page S1839]] Dear Senator Exon: The Communication \n     Workers of America (CWA) urges you to reject the federal \n     balanced budget amendment, S.J. Res. 1, when this legislation \n     comes before the Senate for debate and vote.\n       Enactment of this proposal would wreak havoc on the economy \n     of Nebraska, according to a study conducted by Wharton \n     Econometric Forecasting Associates (WEFA).\n       The WEFA study forecasts that enactment of a balanced \n     budget amendment would cause a drop in personal income of \n     $6,900,000,000 (six billion, nine hundred million dollars) \n     among residents of Nebraska by the year 2003. This is a \n     decrease of 12.9 percent from the 1994 level.\n       Similarly disturbing, a balanced budget amendment would \n     reduce employment in Nebraska by 29,300 jobs by 2003. This \n     would increase Nebraska's unemployment rate by 2.6 percent.\n       The service sector of Nebraska's economy would be \n     especially hard hit, according to the WEFA study.\n       On a national level, a balanced budget would bring about a \n     loss of 6,400,000 jobs by 2003. Real Gross Domestic Product \n     (GDP) would decline by 3.7 percent.\n       In conclusion, the balanced budget amendment would lay \n     waste Nebraska's economy and damage America's well-being.\n       CWA requests that you vote against this misguided proposal. \n     Attached is information documenting the negative effects that \n     this legislation would precipitate.\n\n  Signed, Lou Gerber, Legislative Representative.\n  And attached to that is a copy from the Wharton School, ``How a \nFederal Balanced Budget Would Affect Nebraska's Economy.''\n  Behind that, after Nebraska's economy, there is a table that shows \nits similar effect on every other State in the Union.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this material be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask further that, at the conclusion of my \nremarks, a sheet entitled ``Across the Board Spending Cuts Required to \nAchieve the Balanced Budget in 2002,'' which I referenced in my \nremarks, be printed in the Record, also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, let me comment if I can. How in the world \ncould a Senator from Nebraska, after reading this work by the Wharton \ngroup, support a balanced budget amendment?\n  Well, No. 1, I have not had a chance to study this in great detail. \nObviously, the organization that prepared this is a well-established, \nwell-known, well-respected forecasting firm. I remember using their \nmaterial way back 20 years ago when I was Governor of Nebraska. So they \nare not a fly-by-night outfit. They have evidently done a great deal of \nstudy and work. I know not what assumptions, Mr. President, they made \nin preparing this material because, obviously, they had to make some.\n  It is safe to say that what the Wharton people are pointing out here, \nwhile I do not suspect it is going to have an adverse effect on \nNebraska to the extent that they outline, is that the constitutional \namendment to balance the budget will cause some pain, suffering, and \nhardship in Nebraska and every other State in the Union.\n  Another way of saying that, Mr. President, is we have to swallow some \npretty sour-tasting medicine and hope that it can cure us from the \nspending spree that in the last 14 years has seen a series of \nmultibillion-dollar annual deficits that are transferred at the end of \nthe year over to the national debt.\n  In the last 14 years, the national debt of the United States has \ngrown from under $1 trillion to the present level of $4.7 trillion, and \nit is going higher. Every person in the House and every person in the \nSenate knows that. We will have to raise the debt ceiling and borrow \nmore money before the end of calendar 1995. Even if we balance the \nFederal budget by passage of the constitutional amendment to balance \nthe Federal budget, it is obvious, Mr. President, that from now until \nthe year 2002--when we intend to reach balance--our debt is going to \ncontinue to rise certainly somewhere near the $7 trillion figure, \nbecause every projection that we have indicates that we are going to \nhave multibillions of dollars in deficit for the next several years.\n  I started out by saying, Mr. President, that I was for a balanced \nbudget amendment. I am for a balanced budget amendment even with the \nsour medicine, even with the hurt that it is going to cause my State of \nNebraska. I am for it so long as everyone shares and shares alike as \nreasonably as possible. Then I believe that the people of the State of \nNebraska would say, if we are treated fairly and if we are not picked \non, if we have to swallow this pill to straighten out the fiscal mess \nof the Federal Government, let Congress do it and get it over with. \nLet's quit passing it along each and every year, as we have been doing \nsince Hector was a pup, charging it off to our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  Mr. President, let me say in conclusion that I think we must do this. \nI think we must swallow the medicine. I think we must make the hard \nchoices. But I think we should emphasize the people's right to know. If \nthe Wharton School of Econometric Forecasts are not right, then we \nshould have other people make a study as to what is right for \nNebraska--and Iowa and North Dakota and South Dakota and Kansas and \nColorado and California and Maine and Florida and Washington State, and \neverybody in between.\n  I am rising, Mr. President, to try to set a record straight, to tell \nthe truth, to emphasize once again that passing a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, as was done so bravely in the House of \nRepresentatives last week, is the easy part of the ball game. The \nnitty-gritty, the line play, is what counts. I simply say, Mr. \nPresident, this Senator is going to be pushing for a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, but at the same time I am going to be \nsaying to my colleagues in the Senate on both sides of the aisle, we \nneed to let the sunshine in. We need to take off the blindfolds. We \nneed to tell the truth. Then and only then, do I think we would be able \nto marshal the support of the people of this country to make this work. \nThen and only then, Mr. President, can we expect the legislators of the \n50 States to take a look at this with some knowledge and decide whether \nor not they want to ratify the amendment as three-fourths of them will \nhave to do before this amendment becomes part of the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I think we are on the right track. But I think the \ntrack should be bearing a train toward a balanced budget amendment that \ngoes slow enough so that we can see the pitfalls on the side of the \nroad. Mr. President, I urge support for a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget with its pain and suffering and with its warts, so \nlong as we tell the people the truth and let the sunshine in. I yield \nthe floor.\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n          [From the Coalition for Budget Integrity, Feb. 1994]\n\nHow A Federal Balanced Budget Amendment Would Affect Nebraska's Economy\n\n\n                        BBA'S IMPACT ON NEBRASKA\n\n       10 consecutive years of reduced personal income.\n       7 consecutive years of overall job loss.\n       The Service Industry would be particularly hard hit, \n     suffering job losses for 9 years.\n       The Finance and Banking Industry would also face 9 years of \n     job losses.\n       8 years of higher than necessary unemployment rate.\n\n\n  STUDY SHOWS HOW A FEDERAL BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT WOULD HURT EACH \n                            STATE'S ECONOMY\n\n       The second part of a two-part study done by Wharton \n     Econometrics Forecasting Associates (WEFA) details the impact \n     of a federal balanced budget amendment on individual state \n     economies. The first part of the study, which was released on \n     Monday, February 14th, analyzed the effects of a balanced \n     budget amendment on the national economy over the next ten \n     years (1994-2003). It found that in 2003 the nation's \n     economic output would drop sharply, millions of jobs would be \n     destroyed, the unemployment rate would soar, and taxes would \n     be the highest in postwar U.S. history. In addition, state \n     and local governments would be hit hard, collecting $125.7 \n     billion less in taxes in 2003 than they would without the \n     amendment.\n       The second part of the study delineates even further how a \n     federal balanced budget amendment would wreak havoc on each \n     state's economy. As with the first part, the study assumes \n     the federal budget would be balanced over a six year period \n     ending in 2000 and would remain balanced thereafter. The \n     balancing would be achieved by raising one dollar in taxes \n     for every two dollars in spending cuts.\n       While the exact impact would vary from state to state, all \n     states would suffer severe economic decline in 2003. Personal \n     income would be, on average, 13.5% below what it otherwise is \n     expected to be in 2003. For many states, that means a loss of \n     between $20-$100 billion in personal income in that one year \n     alone.\n       [[Page S1840]] No state would be spared from serious job \n     loss. On average, in 2003 the number of jobs would drop \n     135,000 per state below what WEFA otherwise predicts without \n     a balanced budget amendment in place. For example, New York \n     would lose 140,000 jobs, Tennessee would lose 168,000 jobs, \n     Illinois would lose 190,000 jobs, Ohio would lose 232,000 \n     jobs, Pennsylvania would lose 255,000 jobs, Florida would \n     lose 521,000 jobs, Texas would lose 594,000 jobs, and \n     California would see a loss of over 712,000 jobs in 2003.\n       The unemployment rate would rise in each state. In some \n     states, it would climb by as much as eight percentage points \n     or more above the rate WEFA forecasts without a balanced \n     budget amendment.\n       The construction industry would be hurt badly. Housing \n     starts would decline in all fifty states, in some states by \n     forty thousand units or more in 2003 alone.\n\n                   SUMMARY OF ECONOMIC EFFECTS IN 2003                  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    Drop in personal       Loss of jobs                 \n                         income       ---------------------  Percent of \n      State       --------------------                      unemployment\n                      In        In         In        In      rate would \n                   billions   percent  thousands   percent      rise    \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAL...............    -$15.4     -12.7      -88.3      -4.4        +4.2  \nAK...............      -6.4     -23.6      -93.5     -21.9        +6.4  \nAZ...............     -18.2     -14.6     -130.9      -7.0        +8.8  \nAR...............      -7.3     -10.3      -54.0      -4.6        +2.6  \nCA...............    -148.0     -12.2     -712.5      -4.8        +5.7  \nCO...............     -17.6     -13.6     -104.3      -5.4        +3.3  \nCT...............     -17.9     -11.7      -63.6      -3.7        +3.5  \nDE...............      -3.0     -11.3      -15.6      -3.9        +3.6  \nDC...............     -18.2     -55.1     -241.8     -28.5       +13.3  \nFL...............     -73.6     -14.0     -520.9      -7.1        +5.0  \nGA...............     -35.2     -15.4     -312.0      -8.3        +4.8  \nHI...............      -6.3     -13.9      -52.6      -8.1        +2.2  \nID...............      -4.6     -13.3      -24.8      -4.4        +3.2  \nIL...............     -52.3     -11.4     -190.4      -3.1        +2.2  \nIN...............     -20.0     -10.7     -108.5      -3.6        +2.1  \nIA...............     -12.9     -14.5      -59.0      -4.1        +3.3  \nKS...............      -9.0     -10.4      -42.5      -3.3        +2.2  \nKY...............     -13.7     -11.6     -100.1      -5.4        +4.1  \nLA...............     -17.7     -12.7     -121.3      -5.8        +2.9  \nME...............      -4.5     -10.3      -24.0      -3.9        +3.5  \nMD...............     -30.2     -14.5     -186.4      -7.8        +4.8  \nMA...............     -20.9      -8.6      -24.9      -0.8        +2.2  \nMI...............     -33.2     -10.1     -152.1      -3.3        +3.0  \nMN...............     -16.2      -9.7      -86.1      -3.3        +2.4  \nMS...............     -10.3     -13.7      -82.7      -6.5        +3.5  \nMO...............     -22.5     -12.4      -98.8      -3.6        +1.8  \nMT...............      -1.9      -8.2      -11.0      -2.9        +3.2  \nNE...............      -6.9     -12.9      -29.3      -3.4        +2.6  \nNV...............      -7.1     -13.0      -59.0      -6.4        +7.5  \nNH...............      -5.3     -12.3      -29.0      -5.4        +9.4  \nNJ...............     -43.6     -11.8     -178.3      -4.5        +4.5  \nNM...............      -8.0     -16.7      -80.9     -10.8        +3.0  \nNY...............     -64.2      -8.0     -140.7      -1.6        +2.2  \nNC...............     -32.4     -14.2     -277.0      -6.8        +3.3  \nND...............      -2.2     -11.2       -4.1      -1.3        +1.5  \nOH...............     -43.4     -11.8     -231.8      -4.2        +2.4  \nOK...............     -12.0     -12.0      -46.9      -3.2        +3.3  \nOR...............     -21.2     -21.4     -196.9     -13.0        +7.7  \nPA...............     -56.6     -12.9     -254.6      -4.5        +3.9  \nRI...............      -3.7     -10.1      -15.5      -3.2        +5.8  \nSC...............     -15.3     -14.2     -162.3      -8.4        +4.5  \nSD...............      -2.4     -11.2      -13.5      -3.7        +1.6  \nTN...............     -21.8     -13.0     -168.1      -6.2        +5.5  \nTX...............     -93.6     -14.3     -593.9      -6.2        +3.2  \nUT...............      -7.8     -13.9      -63.0      -6.0        +2.0  \nVT...............      -1.2      -5.4       -3.9      -1.1        +0.5  \nVA...............     -34.5     -13.8     -242.9      -7.0        +3.4  \nWA...............     -28.5     -15.1     -208.8      -7.7        +4.5  \nWV...............      -4.3      -8.0      -22.1      -2.8        +2.6  \nWI...............     -18.8     -10.9     -111.7      -3.9        +2.1  \nWY...............      -2.0     -13.9      -18.4      -7.5        +2.9  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                             Exhibit No. 2\n   Across-the-board spending cuts required to achieve balance in 2002\n\n        [CBO estimates except where noted;

Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague for the lucid \nand encouraging remarks. I appreciate his leadership in working toward \nbalancing the budget and standing up so much on this issue. He is a \nprime cosponsor of this amendment. That means a lot to those Members \nwho have been fighting so hard to get this constitutional amendment \npassed. So I want to just personally express my regard and comments.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend and colleague from the great State of \nUtah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President I would like to respond to some of the \nremarks made earlier by our distinguished ranking member on the \nJudiciary Committee about capital budgets. The proposed exemption for \nso-called capital investments could help evade the purpose of the \nbalanced budget amendment or make it substantially more difficult for \nfuture Congresses to make capital investments.\n  I have to confess that I am not certain of the purpose of the \namendment as it is drafted, or at least as I anticipate it to be \ndrafted. It appears to be a provision at war with itself. The first \nsentence seems to encourage capital investments by taking them out of \nthe balanced budget rule. But the last two sentences seem to be \ndesigned to discourage capital investments.\n  Now, this provision opens up a loophole in the balanced budget rule \nand unduly limits Congress' ability to make capital investments. There \nwould be a powerful incentive for Congress and the President to help \nbalance the budget by redefining more programs as capital investments. \nA gimmick capital budget exemption could actually endanger capital \ninvestments as fake investments crowd out real capital investment.\n  Furthermore, the 10-percent limit ties the hands of future Congresses \nthat may choose among the competing programs to fund more capital \ninvestments than this limits allows. With the talk of a need for \ninfrastructure investment by my friends on our side, I am sure they \nwould want to tie Congress' hands this way. A future Congress may \njustifiably decide to make greater investments in this area.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, yesterday when I spoke on the subject of a \nbalanced budget amendment, a vitally important subject which, without \ndoubt, will occupy the next many days of debate in this U.S. Senate, I \nobserved that Members' views on this subject fell into what seemed to \nbe three categories.\n  One category, it seemed to me, consisted of those Senators on the \nliberal side of the political divide who were essentially uninterested \nin a balanced budget, who were defenders of the status quo, whose \nobservation was that their priorities had, by and large, been met by \nCongress operating the way it does without the constraints of a \nconstitutional amendment inhibiting unbalanced budgets, and that they \nwould forthrightly defend the status quo as being far superior to a \nconstitutional amendment on a balanced budget because such a budget was \nessentially undesirable in the United States.\n  The second category, which was really relatively small given our \nhistory, consisted of those Members who were genuinely interested in \nfiscal responsibility and in a balanced budget, but who felt it was \nwrong to lock constraints against an unbalanced budget into the \nConstitution of the United States. In that case, it was my opinion that \nthe experience of the last 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, 40 years, \nshowed to most the folly of such a pursuit; that neither statutes nor \nan abstract sense of fiscal responsibility ever seemed to motivate a \nsufficient majority in Congress at a sufficiently high degree of \npriority to be successful, and that that group carried a very heavy \nburden of proof as to how we could reach the goal of a balanced budget \nwithout changing the Constitution. And therefore this group of Senators \nwould be relatively small.\n  And the third group, consisting of the majority of the Senate, who \nfeel that a drastic remedy is in order, who feel indeed we are in \nsomething of a revolution, and that in order to satisfy the demands of \nthe American people we should enshrine in the Constitution a provision \nwhich makes it much more \n[[Page S1841]] difficult to act in a fiscally irresponsible manner, \nwould of course put forward that point of view eloquently and well, I \nhope, and ultimately triumph.\n  Only 24 hours have gone by during the course of this debate since I \nmade those observations, and I must confess, at least if I read or hear \nthose who oppose this constitutional amendment correctly, I was wrong \nabout the first two groups. To the best of my knowledge, no single \nperson has come into this body--no Member has come into this body, no \nmatter how liberal, no matter how much in favor of an activist and \nincreasing Federal Government, to state in a forthright fashion that \nthat Member does not believe that a balanced budget is a particularly \ngood idea, or at least a high priority. All of those who object to this \nconstitutional amendment have given lip service to the proposition that \na balanced budget is desirable, whatever their record in the past in \nvoting for or against those measures, those items which would lead us \nto that end.\n  So that first group, that status quo group--while I strongly suspect \nthat it exists--seems, so far in this debate, unwilling to identify \nitself. We who believe a constitutional amendment to be necessary are \nchallenged with the proposition that we cannot make such a request \nwithout coming up with a detailed roadmap as to how we are going to get \nthere. In fact, it is demanded of us that we have binding legislation \ngoverning at least three future Congresses, stating precisely how we \nwill get from this point to that without regard to changes in our \neconomy, changes in our international situation, dangers in the world \nat least, or changes, for that matter, in the majority, in the \ndirection of the Congress of the United States.\n  Personally, I think the demand is an absurd one. It is legally \nimpossible for us to bind future Congresses by a statute. We will in \nfact come up with a budget this year which will include a very fine \ndownpayment toward a balanced budget, but we must recognize that future \nCongresses can take us on a different course of action, even if this \nproposal becomes a part of our Constitution. Many of those who have \nspoken against the constitutional amendment, should they come back to \npower, may very well wish to increase taxes rather than decrease \nspending in reaching that goal.\n  But my point here this afternoon is just this. If in fact I was wrong \nin dividing the Members into three categories in the course of this \ndebate and there are only two--those who believe the constitutional \namendment on a balanced budget to be necessary and those who believe \nfirmly and fervently that we ought to do it but ought to do it without \na constitutional amendment--then is it not every bit the obligation of \nthat second group to tell us exactly how they would reach a balanced \nbudget\n day by day, year by year, item-by-item, as it is for us to favor the \nconstitutional amendment to do so.\n\n  It seems to me self-evident, if those who say the status quo is fine, \nthat we must discipline ourselves to reach a balanced budget, are to \nprevail, and if they demand of those who want a constitutional \namendment a road map, let us see their road map, too. How do opponents \nwho wish to operate under the same system--under which we have operated \nthroughout our entire history, and most particularly during the course \nof the last decade without coming close to balancing the budget--how do \nthey propose that we do so? What reductions in spending over a 7-year \nperiod do they propose? What new taxes during that period of time do \nthey propose? What changes in entitlements do they propose? In spite of \ntheir demand for that kind of detailed blueprint on our side, a map, we \nhave so far received nothing but silence--lip service, statements about \ndiscipline, statements about what we ought to do, but not the remotest \nhint as to how a Congress, which has never been able to reach that goal \nunder the present regime or in the past, can and should do so in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I do not expect this request of mine to be honored. I \nbelieve it to be every bit as valid--in fact, more valid than their \ndemand of us--as if when a constitutional amendment passes everyone \nwill be in the same boat, its proponents, its opponents, the President \nof the United States, as well as the Congress of the United States. We \nwill operate under different rules and under different circumstances.\n  We will be dealing with real issues, with real cuts, with real \nproposals for tax increases. But those who say we do not want to change \nthe regime, we do not want to make that requirement, please vote no on \nthis constitutional amendment. They, it seems to me, have an even more \ncompelling, a greater, a more imperative duty, to say, if we retain the \nstatus quo, here is how we reach the goal we all share. That they have \nnot done, Mr. President. That I will warrant they will not do, and \ntheir failure to do so will show the falsity, the bankruptcy of the \ndemand that those who propose a constitutional amendment come up with--\nthat, besides a few more.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier today President Clinton announced \nthat he was working to develop an alternative package for addressing \nthe Mexican peso crisis. This comes as a welcome response to a \nsituation that was worsening by the day, as financial markets reflected \nincreasing pessimism that Congress would approve the loan guarantee \npackage. It is unfortunate that we were unable to act more \nexpeditiously to help stem the crisis, and I want to commend the \nPresident for recognizing that we would all suffer from further delay.\n  While the details of the new package have not yet been clarified, as \ncurrently proposed it would include a $20 billion share from the United \nStates Exchange Stabilization Fund, $17.5 billion in credits from the \nIMF, and a $10 billion short-term lending facility from the Bank of \nInternational Settlements. These aggressive but prudent measures should \nserve to shore up the Mexican peso as well as investor confidence in \nthe Mexican economy as a whole.\n  Mr. President, without immediate action on the part of the United \nStates and the world community, the short-term debt crisis in Mexico \nthreatens to escalate into a full-scale recession that would negatively \nimpact on all of us. Perhaps lost in the debate over the details of the \nfinancing mechanism was the fact that the United States and Mexican \neconomies are now closely intertwined, and what happens there cannot \nhelp but affect us. Mexico is our third largest trading partner; \nAmerican jobs and exports rely on Mexico's financial stability and \ngrowing prosperity. Politically, neither our immigration problems nor \nour war on drug trafficking can be adequately addressed without \nMexico's active cooperation. We have been fortunate that across our \nlong southern border is a friendly and stable ally. It is in our own \nself-interest to help ensure that a short-term debt problem does not \nbecome a lasting source of economic, political and social turmoil \nacross the hemisphere.\n  I look forward to supporting President Clinton and urge my colleagues \nto do likewise.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, today the President of the United States \nannounced his intention to use his executive authority to intervene in \nthe matters relating to the Mexican financial crisis.\n  Like other Members of the Senate, I have followed this crisis with \ngreat interest over the last few weeks. As a member of the Banking \nCommittee, I participated in this morning's hearings on this issue, \nwhich were interrupted by the announcement of the President's action. \nPerhaps because of my interest in economic matters and my background in \nbusiness, I have paid close attention to this and found that it has \nmanaged to consume some of my time in areas that I might have preferred \nto spend talking about other things. But it has become a very important \npart of my life for the last few weeks, and I thought it appropriate \nthat I make a comment at this time.\n  Mr. President, I have likened the crisis in Mexico to an analogy that \nI hope will help people understand the position that I have taken. \nSuppose, Mr. President, that your neighbor suddenly came pounding on \nyour door with the news that his house was on fire. You go out, look at \nhis house and, sure enough, there are flames and smoke coming out of \nthe attic. And your neighbor says, ``My house is on fire; the fire is \nin the attic; my children are down in the basement. If we do not get \nthe fire put out, my children will die. You must help me. Lend me your \ngarden hose.'' And you say to the neighbor, ``Well, there is no \nquestion that your house is on fire and you need help, but I do not \nthink the garden hose will reach. I do not think it has enough water \npressure to get up to the attic. I think there must be another \nsolution.'' ``No, you do not understand,'' says the neighbor. ``There \nare combustible materials on the top floor. When the fire gets down \nthrough the attic, they will catch fire and my children will die. Let \nme give you more information.'' You say, ``I do not need any more \ninformation about the fire. The information I need has to do with the \nability of the garden hose to reach the problem.''\n  That, in my view, has been part of the difficulty with the debate we \nhave had around here about this issue. People keep coming to us and \ntelling us ``the Mexican house is on fire.'' My response is that I know \nthat, I accept that. I do not argue with you, A, that it is on fire \nand, B, we need to help. My concern is whether or not the proposed \nsolutions will help. And if they will not, I urge us to look someplace \nelse to try to find something that will.\n  So it is in that spirit that I have been carrying on conversations \nwith people from the Federal Reserve and the United States Treasury and \nmet with officials from Mexico on several occasions to try to be sure \nthat we are coming up with some kind of fire extinguisher that will do \nthe job.\n  The more I worked on this, the more concerned I became that maybe we \nwould not be able to do that. Today, the President has taken that \ndecision out of our hands--I think very wisely and competently. The \nPresident has recognized that further delay, which would be an \nautomatic result of leaving the thing before the Congress, would result \nin serious and perhaps irreparable harm. The fire had now gotten down \nfrom the attic, if you will, into the top floor, and it was necessary \nfor the President to act and act quickly. I had suggested to members of \nthe administration that they start thinking of a solution that did not \nrequire congressional action. They were reluctant to do that for \nreasons that I can fully understand, saying a matter as serious as this \nis something that should be brought to the Congress, and we should have \nan opportunity to debate and examine it before it is put into play.\n  But events overtook that process and the President used the authority \nthat was available to him under the exchange stabilization fund to move \nahead. As I say, I urged officials at the Treasury to look at this \npossibility as much as a week or 10 days ago. As I say, they were \nreluctant because of their desire for congressional approval. Now they \nare in a circumstance where, in effect, all Congress can do is \ndisapprove after the fact. I hope we will not do that. I hope we will \nrecognize that the President did about the only thing he could do under \nthe circumstances. I hope the program that he has put in place will \nwork; that we will indeed ``see our neighbor's fire extinguished,'' \nbecause this is a matter of great concern to all Americans, with the \nnumber of jobs that could be lost, the number of exports that could be \naffected. All of those statistics are on the public record.\n  There are a number of things that I think the Mexicans need to do. We \nhave talked about them on this floor from time to time. I believe that \nthis deal, as put in place by the President, is a better deal for the \nAmerican taxpayer than the one that was first proposed, for several \nreasons. The first deal called for $40 billion, all of it charged to \nthe American taxpayer.\n  This deal calls for, up front, $20 billion charged to the American \ntaxpayer with the balance, another $27 billion, spread over a variety \nof agencies and countries. True, some of that which is spread over \nthese other agencies might end up being American taxpayers' money, but \nat least, on the front end, the exposure to the American taxpayer is \nreduced.\n  Second, this deal produces burdensharing; that is, other countries \nare now going to be involved, whereas before it was strictly an \nAmerican deal. Now we have gotten the attention of the other \n``householders'' in the neighborhood, if you will, and they are \nbringing their ``garden hoses'' to the fire along with ours. I think \nthat is a good thing, and that was not present in the first proposal \nthe President made.\n  Third, this proposal involves the Federal Reserve System. The people \nat the Federal Reserve will be involved in enforcing the conditions \nthat the Mexicans agree to. I think that is a good thing. It was not \npresent in the previous deal. In the previous deal, any enforcement \nthat took place would be under the direction of the Treasury and \nwhatever allies they could gather from the IMF. I am not one who has a \ngreat deal of confidence in the ability of the IMF to solve this kind \nof a problem. I think it builds the confidence of the financial \ncommunity to know that the people at the Federal Reserve System, whose \nprincipal activity in life is to defend the American economy and the \nAmerican dollar, will be involved in overseeing the activities of the \nMexicans. So inserting the Federal Reserve into the package improves \nthe package for me considerably.\n  For these reasons then, Mr. President, I offer my congratulations to \nthe President, and to the two leaders, Senator Dole and Senator \nDaschle, for their willingness to give expressions of approval to the \nPresident for this action. He did not need those expressions of \napproval. Under the law, he could have proceeded without them. But it \ndemonstrates the fact that the Congress is not unmindful of the ``fire \nnext door,'' that the two leaders, in a bipartisan fashion, have \nstepped forward to indicate their approval. The same thing is true in \nthe House. Speaker Gingrich and Leader Gephardt have both indicated \ntheir approval, as well.\n  So now all we can do is watch and wait. We have no assurance that \nthis package will solve the Mexican problem. But at least there is now \nsomeone on the ground with a ``fire hose'' that presumably will be able \nto put out the fire. It is a hose that is more suited to the task than \nthe garden hose that was originally asked for, and I add my voice to \nthose that are being raised, saying to the President: You have my best \nwishes that this will work, and I will do whatever I can to cooperate \nwith you and the administration to see that it does work.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/31/senate-section/article/S1842-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1842-S1845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the joint resolution.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we are in the midst of a debate on the \nbalanced budget amendment. At some point in this debate, I will have a \n[[Page S1843]] lengthier and perhaps more comprehensive statement to \nmake but, taking advantage of what the sportscasters call a break in \nthe action, I thought I would make a few observations now about this \nparticular matter.\n  I am a reluctant convert to the balanced budget amendment. As I have \nsaid from time to time around here, my educational background is as a \npolitical scientist. My whole career has been spent in business. But \nwhen I was in college, I studied the works of Jefferson, Madison, \nHamilton, and Jay, and, yes, Karl Marx, Friedrich Hegel, and some of \nthe other political philosophers. That has always been my avocation, \neven in the years that I was in business. I guess it was inevitable, \ngiven that particular bent on my part, that I would end up, when I \ncould afford it, back in politics.\n  From a pure political science point of view, I can make a brilliant \ncase against the balanced budget amendment. I can give you all of the \nreasons why a balanced budget amendment is not sound politics. \nUnfortunately, the real world sometimes intrudes upon the world of the \npolitical scientist and causes us to do things that are perhaps not as \nphilosophically pure as we might like.\n  Let me give you an example. As I understand the Constitution and the \ntheory and philosophy behind the Constitution, election of Senators by \nState legislatures is the ideal way this body should function. The \nSenate was created to represent States. What better way to make sure \nthat the Senate represents States than to give the States full and \ncomplete control over the choice of their Senators. And the States did \nthat in time-honored fashion through their own State legislatures.\n  That is the political science pure way that the Senate should \noperate. There is one problem with it. In the practical world, State \nlegislatures that were divided by party--that is one party controlling \none House and the other the other--would go for an entire Congress \nwithout being able to elect a Senator.\n  The Framers of the Constitution did not foresee the rise of the two-\nparty system and there is nothing in the Constitution to accommodate \nit. There is nothing in the Constitution to deal with the challenges \nthat come from it.\n  Also, people who were unscrupulous, who just decided they wanted to \nbecome Senators, many times could buy an entire State legislature, a \nbargain, if you will. And the corruption that surrounded the election \nof some Senators in the days when State legislatures chose Senators \nbecame so rampant that finally we had to go to another solution to the \nchoice of Senators, which, while not pure to the philosophical doctrine \nof the Constitution, made eminent good sense. And so we passed the 17th \namendment that called for direct election of the Senators.\n  I am not sure the caliber of the Senate got any better when we moved \nfrom the time when State legislatures chose Senators to the time when \nthe voters did, but the various problems that I have described went \naway. And we have lived with the result of this very well since the \ntime the 17th amendment was passed.\n  I think there is a parallel argument here with the balanced budget. I \ncan give you, as I said at the outset, all kinds of reasons why the \nbalanced budget amendment is not a good constitutional doctrine; all \nkinds of reasons why the Founders were wise to leave it out of the \nConstitution.\n  Unfortunately, we have practical pressures that have now overwhelmed \nus that say to us it is time for us to recognize that we need to adopt \na balanced budget amendment. What are those practical pressures?\n  If I can go back to my political science background, I share with you \nthe one thing that philosophers say is wrong with democracy as a form \nof government. Simply put, it is this: Once the people discover that \nthey can vote themselves largess, the democracy will become financially \nunstable and it will fall. That was an article of faith among political \nscientists for centuries.\n  What is the oldest democracy in the history of humankind that has \ndefied this principle? It is this one. We have lasted longer as a \ndemocracy than any other in the history of the planets.\n  And what is threatening our financial survival? It is the discovery \nof the people that they can, through their elected representatives, \nvote themselves largess--that is, get the Government to give them back \nmore money than they give it--that is threatening our survival.\n  Now, we did not do that for over a century, maybe a century and a \nhalf, and then we began to discover that. And, having discovered that \nprinciple and gotten comfortable with it, we have started down the \ndangerous path that has historically undermined democratic governments \nall along.\n  So, in recognition of the fact that we have finally discovered that \nancient truth and are acting on it, I say the time has come for us to \nadopt a balanced budget amendment.\n  I see the Senator from Arizona has arrived. As I say, I have a longer \nand more comprehensive statement on this issue that I will offer at \nsome point. But I felt at this time that I should lay the groundwork \nwith this little philosophical note before I get into the meat and \npotatoes of this real debate. I hope those who spend their time looking \nat history and philosophy will grant me a point or two on this one and \nrecognize that I am addressing it in something other than the practical \npolitical hustings of the last campaign.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, I want to compliment the Senator from Utah. His reference to \nthe famous historian Alexander Tytler, I think, is an apt way to \ncharacterize the dilemma that faces our Nation today, because it is \ntrue that certain segments of our society have determined that they can \nvote themselves largess from the public treasury. And it was at that \npoint that this famous British historian and many others have concluded \na democracy would not thereafter long last.\n  So the point that the Senator from Utah makes, I think, is critical \nto understanding the reasons for our support for a balanced budget \namendment. I compliment him for that reference.\n  Mr. President, by the end of this fiscal year, Congress will have \nadded another $309 billion to the national debt. It will amount to a \ntotal of over $4.9 trillion, nearly $19,000 for every man, woman, and \nchild in this country.\n  Mr. President, $19,000 is more than the average Arizonan makes in a \nyear. The $296.8 billion spent to service the debt last year amounted \nto over $1,100 per capita. That $1,100 is enough to pay the tuition of \na young man or woman at Arizona State University for a year; enough for \na healthy young person in a group plan to buy health insurance for an \nentire year.\n  Mr. President, Congress and the President are debt addicts. The \naddiction is destroying the Nation. Almost 50 cents of every $1 paid in \nindividual income taxes is required just to pay the interest on the \nnational debt. That is 50 cents of lost opportunity for every income \ntax dollar paid by hard-working Americans. The overspending makes us \nfeel good today, but Congress is ruining the economic future of \ngenerations to come.\n  Congress has denied its addiction for too long. Many in this Chamber \nwill continue to deny it, claiming that we can balance the budget \nwithout the discipline of a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. That is just not going to happen. Just as it is difficult \nfor drug and alcohol abusers to overcome their habit, it will not be \neasy for Congress to overcome its addiction. But we can either wait \nuntil the addiction destroys the country or we can take action now, \nsuffer some pain, and get on the road to long-term recovery.\n  The first step to recovery is to admit the problem and seek treatment \nfor it, treatment in the form of a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. House Joint Resolution 1 will establish the framework and \nimpose the discipline that is so urgently needed to force Congress to \nput its fiscal house in order. It is the best and the only chance to \nsend a balanced budget amendment to the States for ratification in the \nimmediate future.\n  Still, it is not the amendment I would have written, not the \ncomprehensive treatment for the problem that I would have prescribed. \nHouse Joint Resolution 1 will force Congress \n[[Page S1844]] to be more responsible in its budgeting practices. But \nthere is more to responsible budgeting that just balancing the Nation's \nbooks. It also matters at what level Congress balances the books \nrelative to the size of the Nation's economy.\n  For example, gross national product now exceeds $6 trillion. But no \none would be happy if Federal outlays were $6 trillion, and Federal tax \nrevenues were $6 trillion, even though the budget would be balanced at \n$6 trillion. It matters how much the Government spends in taxes as much \nas it matters whether we balance the budget. In that regard, House \nJoint Resolution 1 represents the intensive care treatment, the step \nneeded to stop the hemorrhaging, to ensure recovery over the long term. \nHowever, it is a Federal spending limit that is needed.\n  The balanced budget spending limitation amendment, Senate Joint \nResolution 3, which I introduced January 4, including a spending limit, \nrequires a balanced budget and limits spending to 19 percent of the \ngross national product, which is roughly the level of revenue the \nFederal Government has collected over the last 40 years.\n  Mr. President, I will refer to this chart to my right a couple of \ntimes during my presentation. But the first thing that you can see by \nexamining the chart is that revenues which are characterized in blue on \nthe chart at this level here, almost uniformly from 1955, denoted on \nthis chart to 1995 here, are at the 19 percent level of gross national \nproduct or relative to gross domestic product, 19.5 percent. We can see \nif we drew a line at 19.5 percent, that blue line is a very close \napproximation.\n  That is how much Americans are historically willing to pay into the \nTreasury. Through bad times and good economically, through Democrat \nPresidents and Republican Presidents, through times of tax increases \nand times of tax cuts, it does not matter. It stabilizes very quickly \nat about 19 percent of the gross national product. That is how much \nAmericans are willing to pay in revenues.\n  When we say ``willing to pay,'' what do we mean? Just quickly, by way \nof example, when the Federal Government increases tax rates, what do \npeople do? Do they say, OK, we will simply pay more in taxes, or do \nthey begin to adjust their behavior? Of course, we know the answer. \nThey seek tax shelters. They do other things with their incomes so they \ndo not have to pay as much in Federal income taxes. That is why, even \nthough we increase income tax rates, revenue stabilizes at about that \nlevel of 19 percent.\n  What happens when we cut tax rates? Do revenues go down? No. We know \nthat that stimulates the economy. It produces more gross national \nproduct. It produces more income, and even at a lower rate of income \ntax, more revenue is generated by virtue of that growing economy. It is \na lot like the grocery store putting things on sale. They do not do it \nto lose money. They know the volume will make up for the reduction of \nprices; in fact, more than make up for it. That is why you see so many \nsales.\n  The bottom line is Americans are willing to pay 19 percent of the \ngross national product in income taxes. The way to balance the Federal \nbudget is to limit spending to that level of revenues.\n  As we see the other line, the line that is represented in red, \nrepresents the spending as a percent of the gross domestic product on \nthis chart. We can see that 20 or 30 years ago, it was roughly the \nequivalent of the revenues in the country, whereas in more recent \nyears, the lines, two lines have begun to separate. Today, we have \nspending in the neighborhood of 22 percent or 23 percent of the gross \ndomestic product, with revenues at 19 percent. That is the gap that \nneeds to be closed with a balanced budget amendment.\n  Limit spending and there is no need to consider tax increases, \nobviously. Congress would not be allowed to spend the additional \nrevenue it raised, and knowing politicians as I do, they will not raise \ntaxes just for the heck of it. Link Federal spending to economic growth \nas measured by the gross national product and an incentive is created \nfor Congress to promote progrowth economic policies. The more the \neconomy grows, the more Congress is allowed to spend, but always \nproportionate to the size of the economy.\n  A spending limitation has a further advantage. It reflects the fact \nthat the economy has already imposed an effective limit on revenues \nrelative to GNP. As I said before, despite tax increases and tax cuts, \nrecessions and expansions, and fiscal policies pursued by Presidents of \nboth political parties, revenues as a share of GNP have fluctuated only \naround a relatively narrow band, between 18 and 20 percent for the last \ngeneration. As I said, the primary reason for that is because the Tax \nCode changes people's behavior. That is why the debate about raising \ntaxes is less important than the debate about limiting spending.\n  Lower tax rates stimulate the economy, resulting in more taxable \nincome and transactions and more revenue to the Treasury. Higher tax \nrates discourage work production, savings, and investment, so there is \nultimately less economic activity to tax.\n  Revenues amounted to about 19 percent of GNP when the top marginal \nincome tax rate was in the 90 percent range in the 1950's. They \namounted to just under 19 percent of GNP when the top marginal rate was \nin the 28 percent range in the 1980's. Revenues amounted to about 19 \npercent of GNP in the 1970's, during one of the longest postwar \ncontractions and during the peacetime expansion of the 1980's. Since \nrevenues remained relatively constant, 19 percent of GNP, the \nsignificance of our Nation's tax policy is how Congress taxes, not how \nmuch it can tax. The key is whether tax policy fosters economic growth \nand opportunity, measured in terms of GNP, or results in a smaller and \nweaker economy. In other words, 19 percent of a larger GNP represents \nmore revenue to the Treasury than 19 percent of a smaller GNP.\n  The benefit of writing a spending limitation into the balanced budget \namendment is that it would preclude futile attempts by Congress to \nbalance the budget by raising taxes. Raising taxes will merely impede \neconomic growth and harm the Nation's standard of living. A spending \nlimitation provides Congress with the guidance at the outset that there \nis really only one way to balance the budget, and that is by cutting \nGovernment spending. While my preference is that a spending limit be \nincluded in the constitutional balanced budget amendment, I believe the \nissue can only be addressed, if need be, in subsequent implementing or \nenforcement legislation.\n  The quest for the perfect in this case should not be an excuse to \ndefeat the very good. The stakes are too high in terms of the mountain \nof additional debt Congress is passing on to future generations to miss \nyet another opportunity to send a balanced budget amendment to the \nStates for ratification. Of course, what the Senate has concluded to do \nis to take up the resolution which was adopted by the House of \nRepresentatives by 300 votes, rather than to bring forth our own \nversion of a balanced budget amendment.\n The reason: To ensure that we can secure passage by both Houses of the \nsame provision and, thus, pass it on to the States at the earliest \npossible stage.\n\n  So if there is insufficient support for inclusion of a spending limit \nin the amendment itself, I believe Congress should approve House \nJournal Resolution 1, which we took from the House of Representatives \nlast week and then turn to consideration of the Federal spending limit \nas a means of implementing the balanced budget requirement.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has an historic opportunity to ensure that \nwe begin to invest in the future of the country, not just continue to \nborrow from it. That will take courage, the courage to say no to \nspecial interests who benefit from the status quo. We should pass the \nbalanced budget amendment. We should pass it in the form that it passed \nthe House of Representatives. We should then send it on to the States \nfor their ratification, and then we should make a couple of very \nimportant points to the States.\n  Point No. 1, we will not pass on the costs of a high-spending \nCongress to the States as our way of balancing the budget. We have a \nplan for achieving a balanced budget, and that plan, I hope, will be \nadherence to a legislatively adopted implementation guideline of \nspending limits. Those spending limits could be tied to the gross \nnational product, as I proposed.\n   [[Page S1845]] We can agree to come down half a percent per year and \nthat will get us to the 19 percent we need to be at within the 6 or 7 \nyears that it will take to adopt a balanced budget amendment. That is a \nrational, disciplined, proper way to achieve the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Those who say that we should propose our plan before we adopt the \ndiscipline of a constitutional balanced budget amendment overlook the \nfact that we can impose an implementation plan without all of the \nspecifics of every single budget. There is not a one of us here who \nknows how we are going to balance our own household budget 3 years from \nnow, but we sure enough know we are committing ourselves to the fiscal \ndiscipline of doing it.\n  We also understand the way we have to do it is to conform our \nspending to our income, and that is what the Congress would be doing by \nimmediately adopting an implementation plan to achieve a balanced \nbudget through spending limitation.\n  So when our colleague from Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Hatch, proudly proclaims that the balanced budget \namendment has passed the U.S. Senate, I think the very next thing we \nshould do is to say, ``And here is how we are going to do it so that \nyou States who are considering whether to adopt it or not, to ratify \nit, will know we mean business back here in Congress, we don't mean to \npass the costs on to you.'' That is the second part of the two-part \ncommitment we made to the States. The first part we already adopted as \nlegislation prohibiting unfunded mandates.\n  So with those kinds of commitments from the U.S. Congress, we can be \nassured that the States will adopt or ratify a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution and finally put this country on the road \nto fiscal discipline.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and certainly thank the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee for the many years of hard work he has put into \nthis very important endeavor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to compliment the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona. I cannot tell you what it means to me to have him \non the Judiciary Committee and with his broad background in the House \nof Representatives as well as here on this amendment.\n  His suggestions are very valid, and the point that he has made, I \nthink, overwhelms some of the arguments that have been made for tax \nincreases in this body. No matter what we do, that line stays \nrelatively the same, which means tax increases do not always produce \nmore revenues. Sometimes they produce less revenues. We found, as in \nthe case with capital gains, since 1960, every time capital gains rates \nwent up, revenues to the Government went down; every time capital gains \nrates went down, revenues to the Government went up. There are $8 \ntrillion in capital assets locked up out there because people do not \nwant to pay 28-percent capital gains.\n  But his chart is a very important chart. The distinguished Senator \nmakes a very interesting and good case. I wish that we were able to \ntake some of his ideas and incorporate them in an amendment that could \nget the broad support that this amendment does have. But to his credit, \neven though he knows that if we used the 19 percent as a line in order \nto balance the budget, we would probably be better off if we did that. \nBut he also knows that this amendment is the only one that we have that \nwe can get a widespread consensus on. It is bipartisan. It is an \namendment that involves Democrats and Republicans and one that he is \nwilling to help support.\n  So I personally just want to express to him how much I appreciate \nhim, how much I appreciate his knowledge and his explanations to us of \nhow his approach would work if we could put it through.\n  I have to say that I could easily support his approach. I think it is \na very, very good one, and I want to thank the Senator for being such a \nstalwart on this issue.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, may I say, I thank the Senator from Utah for \nhis very kind remarks and look forward to continuing cooperating with \nhim in passing this very important amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/31/senate-section/article/S1842-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1845-S1846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       FEDERAL EDUCATION SPENDING\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned with the rumors and \ntalk about town regarding cuts in Federal education spending. While the \nFederal contribution constitutes only about 6 cents of every $1 spent \nin education in our country, it is a very concentrated and highly \nimportant amount of money. At the postsecondary level, it makes up 75 \npercent of all the grants, loans, and campus-based aid that enable \ndeserving students to pursue a college education. In elementary and \nsecondary education, it comprises over 60 percent of all the funds that \ngo to help disadvantaged students learn on a level with their peers. To \nmy mind, we should not be looking at cuts in education but, instead, \nshould be examining how we might increase and strengthen the Federal \ncontribution.\n  One of the education cutbacks receiving greatest attention is the \npotential elimination of the in-school interest exemption for students \nwho obtain Federal loans to help finance their college education. \nElimination of this exemption would increase student indebtedness by 20 \nto 50 percent. It would only worsen an already unfortunate trend in \nwhich students and their families are having to borrow more and more \nmoney. It would be the wrong step in the wrong direction at the wrong \ntime.\n  Mr. President, as I have stated on many occasions, few things in life \nare more important than the education of our children. They are the \nliving legacy that we leave behind and their education determines the \nfuture of the American Nation.\n  As part of the possible proposed spending cuts, it has been suggested \nthat the in-school interest subsidy feature of the Federal student loan \nprogram be eliminated. This term subsidy is somewhat of a misnomer. \nWhat the phrase actually refers to is the in-school interest exemption \nfeature of the loan program. This is a critically important feature of \nthe loan program that shows the Federal commitment of providing help to \nhard-pressed middle income families. Its elimination, however, is one \nof the possible funding cuts in education that could be made to help \npay for the Contract With America supported by the majority party in \nthe U.S. House of Representatives. Because of this, I thought it very \nimportant not only to let my colleagues know of my strong opposition to \nsuch a proposal but also to let them know the terrible impact it would \nhave on students who must borrow in order to pay for their college \neducation.\n  In a recent letter I received, a director of financial aid at an \ninstitution in California expressed great concern over this proposed \ncut. He noted that eliminating the interest exemption feature will \ncompound the already high debt levels of students.\n  Under the proposed cut, student loan indebtedness will increase from \naround 17 to 30 percent for the average undergraduate and graduate \nstudent. Elimination of the interest exemption feature will also hinder \nthe students' ability to compete and participate in the economic \nmarketplace if they are forced to begin their careers with such \nincreased debt. The end result could well be an economy where college \ngraduates cannot purchase homes or other necessities that are the \neconomic stimulus of our society.\n  These harsh consequences would especially affect students from \nmiddle-class families, those same students for whom the loan program \nwas originally designed. The ability to obtain and repay a loan is a \nmajor issue confronting college students. Increasing the amount they \nwill owe when they finish school will most certainly affect students' \ndecisions whether or not to attend college in the first place or go on \nto graduate school after undergraduate study is completed. Without the \nin- \n[[Page S1846]] school interest exemption, it is estimated that students \nwho are enrolled for bachelors degrees could see their debt burden \nincrease by $20,000 or more.\n  For example a student that attends a 4-year college and borrows the \nmaximum amount would owe $17,125. If interest is charged while the \nstudent is in school, the student would owe an additional $3,407 or \n$20,532 upon entering repayment. This 20-percent increase in the amount \nto be repaid would increase the monthly payment from $205 per month to \n$246 per month. The additional cost over the life of the loan would be \nabout $5,000.\n  This proposal is truly penny-wise and pound-foolish. Students who \ntoday pursue graduate study would have an enormous increase in what \nthey owe. Those same students have the lowest\n default rate in the loan program. Increasing their debt burden, \nhowever, will certainly increase the risk of default.\n\n  The effects on graduate students are even more profound for a student \nwho attends 4 years while earning a bachelor's degree and attends \ngraduate school for an additional 2 years to earn a masters degree. \nUpon graduation, the student would owe $34,125. If the interest \nexemption is eliminated, the student would owe an additional $9,167 for \na total of $43,292. This represents a 27-percent increase in \neducational indebtedness and would increase the monthly repayment \namount from $409 to $520 per month.\n  Every day families are making decisions about sending their children \nto college. Certainly one of, if not the major obstacle they face is \nhow to pay for college. The loan is their last resort. It provides the \nextra but necessary money they must have after exhausting their own \nresources and obtaining any grants for which their children might be \neligible. Increasing the amount their children owe after graduation may \nwell place the dream of a college education beyond their reach. That, \nto my mind, would be a tragedy of truly immense proportions. In fact, \nrecent studies show that the people who are the most uneasy about \nborrowing funds are those with low incomes. But these are the same low \nincome students who will turn away from taking the loan because of the \nmonetary increase. Without the funds, an education becomes an \nunachievable dream.\n  The proposal to eliminate the in-school interest exemption also comes \nat a particularly bad time. The cost of a college education continues \nto escalate at all levels, but particularly in the public sector where \na previously affordable education is in danger. State after State has \ntrimmed support for its public institutions. The result: Students and \ntheir families have had to pay more through higher tuitions and other \nrelated costs.\n  The need to borrow to pay for a college education is already \nincreasing at an alarming rate. According to a recent study by the \nAmerican Council on Education, the volume in the Stafford Loan Program \nincreased by 45 percent last year, and the average loan size grew by \nnearly 20 percent. The study also found that the increase in borrowing \nover the past year was far greater than any previous year's increase.\n  Unfortunately, borrowing is more necessary because we have failed to \nprovide sufficient funding for our grant programs in general and the \nPell Grant Program in particular. When we reauthorized the Higher \nEducation Act 3 years ago, we sought to extend Pell grant aid to middle \nincome families, but the sad fact is that funding has been inadequate \nto accomplish that objective. The consequence has been that more and \nmore American families have been forced to borrow more and more money \nto pay for a college education. Elimination of the in-school interest \nexemption will only exacerbate an already worsening situation.\n  For example, at the University of Rhode Island in my home State, \nborrowing increased from $8.2 million in 1988-89 to over $26.7 million \nin 1994-95. For the current school year alone, cutting the in-school \ninterest exemption would add another $2 million in debt burden. That is \nnot the direction in which we should be moving.\n  Mr. President, I care deeply about the education of our children. If \nthe in-school interest exemption is eliminated, we will be removing an \nessential and very helpful feature of the federal loan program. I urge \nmy colleagues to talk with college officials in their respective States \nand to learn just how devastating elimination of the in-school interest \nprovision would be not only to their schools but particularly to their \nstudents. I also urge my colleagues to join me in expressing early and \nstrong opposition to such a proposal so that it might be removed from \nany and all lists of education cuts under consideration.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that nominations to the offices of inspector general, excepting \nthe Office of Inspector General for the Central Intelligence Agency, be \nreferred during the 104th Congress in each case to the committee having \nsubstantive jurisdiction over the department, agencys or entity, and if \nand when reported in each case, then to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs for not to exceed 20 days.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/31/senate-section/article/S1845-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/31/senate-section/article/S1846-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/31/senate-section/article/S1846-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1846-S1847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-313.

A bill to establish a comprehensive policy with respect to \nthe provision of health care coverage and services to individuals with \nsevere mental illnesses, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources.\n\n\n    THE EQUITABLE HEALTH CARE FOR SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill I have \nintroduced in the past, and which has always attracted the support and \nencouragement of a wide variety of my distinguished colleagues. This \nbill is called the Equitable Health Care for Severe Mental Illness Act \nof 1995. It was written because a situation exists in this country that \nI believe cannot continue, and this situation impacts upon some of the \nmost vulnerable individuals in society. I am speaking of the those \nindividuals who have been diagnosed as having a severe mental illness.\n  For so long, society shunned these individuals out of fear, \nignorance, or misunderstanding, and the afflicted and their families \nsuffered in silence. Because society didn't know what caused these \nillnesses, they could only assume that the strange and perplexing \nbehavior was the result of some action; a punishment for some sin; or a \nweakness or frailty in character. In the past, those suffering from \nmental illness were locked up, tried as witches, or banished from \nsociety for being possessed by demons or evil spirits. As late as 1972 \nin this country, many States singled out the mentally ill, \ninstitutionalized them, and subjected them to systematic sterilization, \noften without their consent or knowledge. Ignorance of these illnesses \nbred contempt, and the sick were seen as criminals. Some just say, \n``why don't they just stop acting that way?''\n  Thankfully, today we know better. With our increasing understanding \nof the human body and the composition of the brain, we have come to \nlearn a truth far different from the superstitions of the past. We have \nlearned that there are physiological, chemical, and biological reasons \nfor this behavior, and that these circumstances are far beyond an \nindividual's control. We have also learned that these illnesses are \ntreatable, and that with the right combinations of medicinal and \nbehavioral therapy, these people can be helped, and can frequently lead \na life as normal as yours or mine.\n  But mental illness continues to exact a heavy toll on many, many \nlives. Even though we know so much more about mental illness, it can \nstill bring devastating consequences to those it touches; their \nfamilies, their friends, and their loved ones bear this as well. These \nindividuals and families not only deal with the societal prejudices and \nsuspicions hanging on from the past, but they must also contend with a \nstructural, systematic discrimination that most often bars them from \ngetting the care they need and deserve. The advancement in our \nknowledge of these illnesses has not been accompanied by a change in \nthe policies of most health care insurers. Consider the following facts \nfor a moment:\n                  mental illness--a widespread disease\n\n  One person out of every five--more than 40 million adults--in this \nNation will be afflicted by some type of mental illness.\n  Schizophrenia alone is 50 times more common than cystic fibrosis, 60 \ntimes more common than muscular dystrophy and will strike between 2 and \n3 million Americans.\n  Among children and adolescents, nearly 7.5 million, or 12 percent, \nsuffer from one or more mental disorders.\n\n\n                   discrimination in health insurance\n\n  Only 2 percent of Americans with private health care coverage have \npolicies that adequately and fairly cover severe mental illnesses.\n  Health care reform plans designed to make health care more accessible \nand affordable would continue the discrimination prevalent in private \nhealth insurance today. Many plans: allow 365 days for inpatient \nphysical care but only 45 days of inpatient psychiatric care; provide \nunlimited coverage of office visits for physical care but only 20 \nvisits for psychiatric care; and provide up to $1 million in lifetime \ncoverage for physical care but only $50,000 lifetime coverage for \nmental health care. These are discriminations that we cannot let \ncontinue, especially if we reform the health care programs, and more \nparticularly if we reform the insurance programs of our Nation.\n  Furthermore, we find that only 10 percent of all insurance policies \nhave coverage for partial hospitalization, despite proven success in \nproducing good outcomes while controlling costs with persons with \nmental illness, and 60 percent of health maintenance organizations and \npreferred provider organizations completely exclude coverage of some \ntreatments for severe mental illness.\n  Some will immediately say we cannot afford it or that inclusion of \nthis treatment will cost too much. But let us take a look at the \nefficacy of treatment for these individuals, especially when compared \nwith the success rates of treatments for other physical ailments. For a \nlong time, many who are in this field--especially on the insurance \nside--have behaved as if you get far better results for angioplasty \nthan you do for treatments for bipolar illness.\n  Let me give you some facts as to efficacy of treatment in the United \nStates today. Treatment for bipolar disorders--that is, those disorders \ncharacterized by extreme lows and extreme highs--has an 80 percent \nsuccess rate if you get treatment, both medicine and care. \nSchizophrenia, the most dread of mental illnesses, has a 60-percent \nsuccess rate in the United States today if treated properly. Major \ndepression has a 65 percent success rate.\n  Let me remind everybody that when we speak of schizophrenia or manic \ndepression, frequently we think these are the dredges of society. I \nwould like to remind everyone that some of the greatest men and women \nin all of history were manic depressives. Let me give you a few: \nWinston Churchill. Unquestionably, he would be diagnosed today as manic \ndepressive because he had those extreme highs, when he said he never \nslept and he sat around and wrote history books, and all of a sudden \nthe black hole, 3, 4 months in a state of depression. He was able to \ncope with it. Most human beings with that kind of illness cannot quite \ncope with it. They are not dredges or imbeciles, they are not the low \nintellectual people. In fact, quite to the contrary.\n  Compare this with commonly reimbursed treatments for cardiovascular \ndiseases. Let us talk about that for a minute.\n  Angioplasty has a 41-percent success rate. Treatment for \nschizophrenia, the dread disease, has a 60-percent success rate. We can \ngo on with many of the other ones. There is a 52-percent effective rate \nfor atherectomy, one of the very important kind of treatments that \neverybody thinks we ought to be doing.\n  Furthermore, the National Institutes of Mental Health estimates that \nprimary preventive care will add $6.5 billion annually to the overall \ncost of mental health care. This will be offset by an overall savings \nof about $8.7 billion to society. That is a $2.2 billion savings. The \nFederal Government alone spends approximately $14 billion each year for \ndisability payments to these individuals--25 percent of all disability \npayments. Clearly, helping these individuals early on with medical \ntreatment not only makes the distribution of health care services fair, \nbut also saves the Government and society money over the long term.\n  So you can see why I feel it is a necessity that we do something to \nresolve this situation. Frankly, without some \n[[Page S1849]] relief, the mentally ill will continue to be denied the \ntreatment they need. The problems associated with nontreatment will \ncontinue to escalate and these individuals will continue to operate on \nthe margins of society.\n  The Equitable Health Care for Severe Mental Illness bill I am \nintroducing, along with Senator Wellstone today, seeks a very simple \ngoal: To provide, in whatever health care reform package is eventually \nenacted, that the Congress and the President coverage for treatment of \nthese individuals that is commensurate with individuals that are \ntreated and cared for with other diseases. Let me repeat that. Equity \njust means you will treat mental illness under insurance policies and \nthe like just like you are treating a heart condition, a kidney \ncondition, or whatever physical condition that we have learned to \ncover. And we will use the same kind of terms of medical necessity \nwhich governs and bounds the kind of treatment that is forthcoming for \nthose illnesses.\n  In 1990, Congress passed and President Bush signed the Americans With \nDisabilities Act, recognizing that there are individuals in society \nwhose physical needs require special protection under the law. We \ndetermined that, because of conditions beyond their control, disabled \nAmericans, many of them, their access to services and facilities had to \nbe made available on an unrestricted, nondiscriminatory manner. We \nrecognize that this constituted an infringement on their civil rights \nwhen treated otherwise. We did the right thing in trying to be helpful. \nI believe it is time we should view severe mental illness in this same \nlight and do the right thing here, as well.\n  We must take steps to protect these citizens from unfair treatment \nand systematic discrimination. As I circulate this bill, which I now \nsend to the desk, and ask that it be appropriately referred, and as I \ncirculate it to fellow Senators, I hope they will seriously consider \nit. It is one of the severe and serious discriminations in this society \nthat remains alive. Why do insurance companies not cover it in broader \nscope? Because one insurance company eliminated it and they were able \nto reduce their premiums. Then another company decided if they want \nlower premiums, they must reduce the mental health care coverage, and \non and on it went until now the situation is as I have described.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n    National Institute of Mental Health Report on Mental Illness in \n                          America--Highlights\n\n       Number of people suffering from mental illness: 2.8 percent \n     of the nation's adult population. Approximately 5 million \n     people.\n       Cost of equitable coverage for severe mental illness:\n       Will add only $6.5 billion in new health care costs.\n       Will be offset by $8.7 billion reduction in health care \n     costs and costs to society.\n       Will yield an aggregate $2.2 billion savings for the \n     nation.\n       How effective are treatments for severe mental disorders?\n       Panic Disorder: 80 percent success rate.\n       Bipolar Disorder: 80 percent success rate.\n       Major Depression: 65 percent success rate.\n       Schizophrenia: 60 percent success rate.\n       Obsessive Compulsive: 60 percent success rate.\n       How effective are treatments for commonly reimbursed \n     cardiovascular disorders?\n       Angioplasty: 41 percent success rate.\n       Atherectomy: 52 percent success rate.\n       Costs to federal government? People with severe mental \n     disorders account for 25 percent (or approximately $14 \n     billion) of all federal disability payments (Social Security \n     Insurance and Social Security Disability Insurance).\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to pay close \nattention to the interventions of the Senator from New Mexico. I think \nfor all of us who care about health care know he has been tireless on \nthe whole issue of mental health which is affecting families in this \ncountry. All of us are in his debt for all of the good work he does in \nthis area. He has been and a tireless proponent of the mentally \nchallenged, and we are grateful for his leadership.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Domenici, to introduce legislation on an issue that I feel so \nstrongly about--equitable health care coverage for mental illnesses.\n  Let me say first that it has been a real honor to work with Senator \nDomenici as cochair of the Senate Working Group on Mental Health and I \nlook forward to building on the tremendous progress we made last year.\n  For far too long, mental health and substance abuse have been put in \nparentheses. We didn't want to talk about it and we didn't want to take \nit seriously. The stigma of mental illness and substance abuse has kept \nmany in need from seeking help, and has prevented policymakers from \nproviding it.\n  While we failed to enact comprehensive health care reform during the \nlast Congress, we did make great strides in terms of increasing \nawareness and understanding of the importance of parity, flexibility, \nand a full range of comprehensive mental health benefits.\n  As cochair of the Senate Working Group on Mental Health I am proud of \nthe work we did last year. But we must act this year on the issues that \nwe were so successful at bringing to the forefront of the debate and at \nreaching bipartisan agreement on.\n  We have a tremendous body of new evidence proving that without a \ndoubt mental health and substance abuse disorders are diagnosable and \ntreatable in a cost-effective manner. In fact, we can now show that \nwithin a very short period of time it costs less to treat these \ndisorders directly and appropriately than not to treat them at all. We \ncan say this is true based on studies of every sector of our \npopulation: Insured and employed, uninsured and unemployed, people who \nnow use the private system and those who now use the public system.\n  Mental illness and substance abuse have touched many of our families \nand friends. And for this reason and many others this is not a partisan \nissue. Americans do not see a distinction between mental and physical \nillnesses, and they do not want them treated differently. I am proud to \ncosponsor this legislation, which would make it the policy of the \nFederal Government to provide coverage for the treatment of severe \nmental illnesses that is commensurate with that provided for other \nmajor physical illnesses in any form of health care reform that is \nenacted by Congress and the President.\n  And, most of all, I look forward to continuing to work with Senator \nDomenici to end discrimination against this very vulnerable population \nand their families. After all, it's only old data and old ideas that \nkeep us from covering mental health and substance abuse the same way we \ncover any other real illness, whether acute or chronic.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Abraham):\n  S. 300. A bill to reform the civil justice system, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     the lawsuit reform act of 1995\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, our civil justice system is unable to \nadequately serve the people who need it. Our legal system, over the \nlast 30 years, has become inefficient, costly and unpredictable. People \nwho need a forum to resolve a dispute find less and less satisfaction \nin our courts; they face interminable delays, contentious proceedings, \nand decisions that too often seem neither fair nor just. We must bring \nneeded change to the courts before Americans lose confidence in one of \nthe crucial pillars of our democracy.\n  Today I am introducing the Lawsuit Reform Act of 1995, designed to \nstart the process for reforming our litigation system. The bill is \nintended to reduce some of the rewards that now exist for bringing a \nlawsuit and to introduce some incentives to resolve cases without \nresort to litigation.\n  Let's face it, Americans are sue happy. The United States has become \na litigation prone society, with far reaching consequences: Too many \nlawsuits and clogged courts hurt the U.S. in the international \nmarketplace. And, the threat of lawsuits impedes innovation and \ninvention.\n  That our Nation has become a society of people too willing to sue \neach other is also a symptom of moral decay. Too often, we try to blame \nsomeone else for our situation, and with a lawsuit, we try get that \nsomeone else to foot the bill. So, we have to get rid of the incentives \nfor suing, and we have to ensure that those who do \n[[Page S1850]] suffer losses get compensated fairly for those losses. \nThe courts need to be available for those who have real disputes, and \nrationality, civility and fairness must be restored to our legal \nsystem.\n  The bill contains a number of provisions, some of which I have \nintroduced in previous Congresses. Other provisions represent bold new \ndirections for our legal system. For example, reform of attorney \ncontingent fee arrangements--that is, limiting contingent fees to that \nportion of an award for which the attorney undertook risk and added \nvalue--will restore the balance to the lawyer-client relationship. It \nwill remove the enormous financial stake trial lawyers now have in \ntheir clients cases, and it will significantly reduce the $13 to $15 \nbillion paid in contingency fees. Incidentally, this provision has the \nendorsement of legal scholars from Judge Robert Bork to Normal Dorsen.\n  Another provision, early offer and recovery, will put more money in \nthe hands of injured parties more quickly and effectively. In return \nfor refraining from a lawsuit, an injured party would get all of his or \nher economic losses paid by the responsible parties. This mechanism has \nthe potential to break the link between the litigation system and the \noveruse and abuse of the health care system. If an injured party gets a \ncommitment to have all of his or her expenses paid, then there is no \nincentive to inflate expenses by making unnecessary trips to the \ndoctor. And the 57 cents of every dollar spent in the litigation system \nas transaction costs associated with lawyers will be significantly \ndecreased. Injured plaintiff will get much more than 43 cents of every \ndollar now spent on litigation.\n  The bill contains a loser-pays provision, restricted only to those \nwho can afford to assume the risk of having to pay their opponent's \nlegal fees. And, the bill includes needed limitations on punitive \ndamages, reforms to the collateral source rule and an end to joint and \nseveral liability.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator \nAbraham. Although he is new to the Senate, he has extensive experience \non this issue. Our bill contains some bold initiatives for reform. \nThese changes will make a real difference in the legal system.\n  I am including in the Record a summary of the bill, and I will return \nto the floor on a regular basis to highlight the problems with our \nlegal system and the reforms needed. I look forward to the Senate \ntackling legal reform in this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                 Summary of Lawsuit Reform Act of 1995\n\n\n                              the problem\n\n       Over the last 30 years, the American civil justice system \n     has become inefficient, unpredictable and costly. Those who \n     need the court system to resolve their disputes face \n     interminable delay, much of which can be blamed on frivolous \n     lawsuits clogging the courts or upon unreasonable litigation \n     when a settlement could be achieved.\n       The threat of lawsuits impedes invention, innovation and \n     the competitive position our nation has enjoyed in the world \n     marketplace. No nation is as litigious as the United States.\n       It is imperative that we restore rationality, certainty, \n     fairness and civility to our legal system. For too long, a \n     group of trial lawyers have prevented efforts to bring \n     reasonable change to the legal system. Many of those who \n     practice in our nation's courts have a vested interest in \n     maintaining the status quo. But just as decisions about war \n     are too important to leave to the generals, legal reform is \n     simply too important to leave to the lawyers.\n       The Lawsuit Reform Act of 1995 contains a variety of \n     options for reforming the civil justice system.\n\n\n                   accountability in attorneys' fees\n\n       The legal system can be arcane and foreign to all but those \n     who make it their occupation. Consequently, clients must rely \n     on lawyers not only to handle their legal needs but even to \n     tell them what their legal needs are. As a result, lawyers, \n     like other experts in similar situations, are by the nature \n     of their work well positioned to take advantage of those who \n     come to them for assistance.\n       Most lawyers do not misuse their position. Unfortunately, \n     however, some do. Moreover, the organized bar, which has been \n     set up to serve as the principal mechanism for regulating \n     such abuses, has frequently--sometimes for good reason--had \n     considerable difficulty in drawing the line between \n     acceptable and unacceptable conduct.\n       One key area where these problems are apparent is in the \n     standard practice of taking tort cases on a contingent fee \n     basis. Contingent fees play an important role in allowing \n     plaintiffs to bring suit if their cases are legitimate, their \n     chances of recovery uncertain, and their resources limited. \n     But they have no place even where a plaintiff has limited \n     resources if the recovery is a virtual certainty. Many tort \n     cases are of the latter type, and the lawyers who take them \n     know it. Nevertheless, the lawyers still take them on a \n     contingent fee basis and collect very large fees because the \n     plaintiff does not know it.\n       This section is designed to put some balance in the lawyer-\n     client relationship. First, it requires that attorneys \n     disclose fee arrangements to the potential client and inform \n     the client that the contingent fee is not mandatory but an \n     option.\n       In addition, it limits the collection of a contingent fee \n     by an attorney to that portion of the award which was \n     achieved by the attorney's work and undertaking of risk. It \n     uses the party's own behavior to determine which portion of \n     the award that should be by setting out limits on the \n     attorney's contingent fee when a settlement is offered: if \n     the attorney is retained to advise the claimant on the \n     settlement offer, the attorney will be precluded from \n     charging a contingent fee; if the attorney's representation \n     results in an increased offer, the attorney may charge an \n     hourly or contingent fee, not to exceed 20% of the increase \n     in the offer; if the attorney obtains the settlement offer, \n     the contingent fee will be limited to 10% of the first \n     $100,000 and 5% of any additional amount. If the case goes to \n     trial, the attorney's contingent fee could only be based upon \n     the amount of the award that exceeds the settlement offer. \n     The effect is to limit the attorney contingent fee to that \n     portion of the case to which the attorney adds value.\n       Another provision requires judges, under Federal Rule of \n     Civil Procedure 11, to impose sanctions on attorneys who file \n     frivolous pleadings. Rule 11 was weakened in 1992 to give \n     judges the discretion to impose sanctions.\n       The final provision of this section introduces loser pays \n     in tort cases where the plaintiff seeks damages for physical \n     or mental injury, property damage or other economic loss.\n       In virtually every western nation except the U.S., the \n     loser pays for the costs of litigation. Within our own legal \n     system, we have dozens of fee shifting laws. But these have \n     become ``one way'' shifting, allowing only prevailing \n     plaintiffs to recover their attorneys' fees from losing \n     defendants.\n       This provision restores some balance in the system by \n     setting up a two way fee shifting that requires either losing \n     party in a tort case to pay the other's attorney's fees.\n       The loser pays rule is limited to the amount of fees owed \n     by the loser to its own attorney. And the loser pay rule will \n     not apply to those individuals and small businesses which can \n     least afford to pay. In addition, courts would retain \n     discretion to refuse to award attorneys' fees or reduce the \n     award if it would be in the interests of justice.\n\n\n                              early offer\n       A lawsuit can be avoided if the injured party gets fully \n     compensated quickly. Moreover, a defendant may be willing to \n     pay compensation but is prevented from doing so by the need \n     to make an offer that will also pay the plaintiff's lawyer \n     handsomely. This section creates sufficient incentives for a \n     prompt compensatory settlement that should overcome this \n     obstacle.\n       First, it sets up a mechanism allowing the potential \n     plaintiff to notify the potential defendants of the injury \n     and the compensation necessary. The potential defendant will \n     then be allowed to make an early offer to pay all economic \n     losses, including future economic losses; if it is accepted, \n     the matter is resolved without a lawsuit. If the plaintiff \n     elects to prove the elements of the case beyond a reasonable \n     doubt, including that the defendant was grossly negligent or \n     intentionally caused the injury, the plaintiff will not be \n     foreclosed from bringing a lawsuit.\n\n\n                    Fair Share Assessment of Damages\n\n       Defendants' liability, in the American legal system, is \n     often based upon the ability to pay and not on the degree of \n     responsibility. The doctrine of ``joint and several \n     liability'' permits a plaintiff to recover the entire damage \n     award from any of the defendants sued. If one defendant is \n     judgment-proof, but was 80% responsible, the plaintiff can \n     still get the entire judgment paid by another defendant, even \n     though that defendant was significantly less responsible.\n       This section reforms the doctrine of joint and several \n     liability and permits recovery from a defendant only for \n     damages attributable to the person's share of responsibility. \n     It applies to tort cases where the plaintiff seeks damages \n     for physical or mental injury, property damage or economic \n     loss.\n\n\n                      Eliminate Double Recoveries\n\n       A plaintiff can recover damages without regard to money the \n     plaintiff may be receiving from other sources, such as \n     disability insurance or a wage continuation program.\n       This section would put an end to these double recoveries by \n     prohibiting the inclusion of these collateral sources from \n     the proof of damages. And it prohibits subrogation \n     [[Page S1851]] claims by the entities providing these \n     collateral source payments. This provision applies to tort \n     cases where the plaintiff seeks damages for physical or \n     mental injury, property damage or economic loss.\n\n\n              Punitive Damages as Punishment, not Windfall\n\n       Those accused of a crime have constitutional protection; \n     they are informed of the charges against them and know the \n     punishment they face.\n       In many cases, civil defendants face punitive damage awards \n     that bear no relationship to the concept of punishment and \n     deterrence and are designed to further compensate the \n     plaintiff and his or her attorney. A reasonable limit on \n     punitive damages will serve the public policy objective of \n     punishment and deterrence. The bill limits punitive damages \n     in tort cases where the plaintiff seeks damages for physical \n     or mental injury, property damage or economic loss, to the \n     greater of $250,000 or three times compensatory damages.\n\n\n                     Alternative Dispute Resolution\n\n       Encouragement of ADR should be a focus of any civil justice \n     reform effort. However, ADR should not become another \n     procedural hurdle for litigants.\n       This section creates voluntary binding ADR. It requires, in \n     all federal question and diversity cases, parties be told by \n     their attorneys of ADR options. If parties agree to ADR, then \n     they are bound by its results.\n\n\n                Ensuring Expert Witnesses have Expertise\n\n       Too often, parties in a lawsuit bring in a witness asserted \n     to be an ``expert'' to offer an opinion which supports a \n     particular theory of the case. The 1975 Federal Rules of \n     Evidence--in allowing any expert testimony that might be \n     ``helpful'' to the jury--depart from the traditional \n     standard: that expert testimony should only be admitted if \n     its basis has ``gained general acceptance in the particular \n     field.'' The result has been a slippery slope to junk science \n     finding its way into courtrooms across the nation.\n       This section is designed to ensure the expert witness \n     actually has some expertise in a recognized field, and it \n     will require the disqualification of any expert witness whose \n     compensation is linked to the outcome of the case.\n\n\n                        Private Rights of Action\n\n       Too many judges have a tendency to imply a private right of \n     action in a law where Congress does not explicitly create it. \n     The result is excessive litigation and a power grab by the \n     courts never intended by Congress.\n       This section creates a rule of construction that federal \n     laws which do not expressly contain a private right of action \n     should not be interpreted to imply one.\n\n\n                       ``Opt Out'' by the States\n\n       States will retain the right to opt out of any one or more \n     of the provisions of this Act by affirmatively enacting \n     legislation to opt out.\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to \ncosponsor the Lawsuit Reform Act of 1995.\n  Last fall's election was about change. And if ever there was an area \nin need of change, it is the current state of our legal system.\n  The current system doesn't work. It is arbitrary and imposes \nexcessive costs and long delays. It must be reoriented to bring about \nthe proper objectives of any legal system: swift justice and fair \nresults.\n  Moreover, our litigation explosion is hurting U.S. competitiveness \nand stifling innovation with the high costs of lawsuits and damage \nawards in our courts. The costs are estimated to reach $300 billion \nannually--about 4.5 percent of the Nation's $6.7 trillion gross \ndomestic product. These costs are passed on to consumers, making legal \nsystem their enemy rather than their ally.\n  It is time for an overhaul of the system. The McConnell-Abraham \nLawsuit Reform Act of 1995 signals the beginning of my efforts to help \nbring about that overhaul.\n  The McConnell-Abraham Lawsuit Reform Act is principally aimed at one \naspect of the litigation problem. Our current system contains \ninsufficient incentives to reward settlements, and insufficient \npenalties for litigating to the hilt disputes that should be able to be \nworked out.\n  One cause of this is that as litigation has been exploding, more and \nmore lawyers have sought to maximize their fees at the expense of their \nclients' best interests. And while the legal profession has made \nattempts at self-regulation, it has been largely unsuccessful in \nstopping this trend.\n  The McConnell-Abraham Lawsuit Reform Act of 1995 takes an extremely \ninnovative approach to this problem. It empowers clients in personal \ninjury cases by creating incentives for potential plaintiffs and \ndefendants to get together and settle meritorious cases. It also \nreduces lawyers' incentives to discourage settlements by barring them \nfrom charging contingent fees in cases where recovery is all but \ncertain. And it creates penalties for frivolous litigation, ranging \nfrom mandatory sanctions for frivolous filings to a ``loser pays'' rule \nin certain classes of cases.\n  In short, the McConnell-Abraham Lawsuit Reform Act of 1995 will bring \nour legal system closer to accomplishing its central purposes: swift \nand certain redress for the meritorious claimant and penalties for \nabusive litigation. Therefore I am proud to join the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky as an original cosponsor of this excellent piece \nof legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KYL:\n  S. 301.

Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Criminal Alien \nTransfer and Border Enforcement Act of 1995, legislation to make it \neasier to return criminal aliens back to their country of citizenship \nto serve out the remainder of their sentences. I was an original \ncosponsor of similar legislation introduced in the House last year by \nRepresentative Steve Horn of California. Representative Horn \nreintroduced this legislation in the 104th Congress on January 18. His \nhard work in this area is very much appreciated.\n  The Criminal Alien Transfer and Border Enforcement Act advises the \nPresident to renegotiate bilateral prison transfer treaties with \ncountries which have large numbers of alien criminals in U.S. prisons. \nThe elimination of any requirement of prisoner consent would be a \nprimary focus of the renegotiation. As an incentive to renegotiate \ntheir treaties, this bill would allow foreign governments that \nrenegotiate and comply with a new treaty to send their law enforcement \npersonnel to the Border Patrol and Customs Service academies where an \nintegrated approach to drug interdiction and border management would be \ndeveloped.\n  The tremendous financial burden that the Federal Government and \nStates incur to imprison criminal aliens continues to grow. The Bureau \nof Prisons, for example, estimates that the incarceration of criminal \naliens in U.S. and State prisons costs U.S. taxpayers approximately \n$1.2 billion a year. Criminal aliens make up about 24 percent of the \ntotal 91,000 Federal prison population. At a cost of $20,803 per \nFederal prisoner, taxpayers from Maine to California to Arizona are \nfooting the bill to incarcerate these criminals. A national approach to \nreturning these criminal aliens home and eliminating these costs must \nbe developed.\n  On a State level, Arizona knows all too well about these costs. \nAccording to the Arizona Department of Corrections, the number of \ncriminal aliens in Arizona State prisons has increased from 596 in 1984 \nto 2,066 as of December 31, 1994, a 250-percent increase. Criminal \naliens comprise 10.4 percent of Arizona's inmate population; that \ncompares to a State criminal alien inmate population of 4 percent \nnationally. Those 2,066 criminals cost Arizona taxpayers $16,020 each, \nor nearly $40 million in total last year.\n  The logical way to reduce these costs would be to work out an \nagreement where a country would except the responsibility for taking \nits own citizens back and ensuring that the prison term is completed \nbefore the individual is released back into his or her own country. \nBut, current bilateral prison transfer treaties allow criminal aliens \nto choose whether they will serve time in the United States or their \ncountry of citizenship. As a result, the criminal can circumvent any \nagreement worked out between two countries or a State and foreign \ngovernment. This must change.\n  Our Nation's citizens are shocked when they hear that this is how our \nNation's prison transfer treaties work. For example, in June of 1994 I \nhad a constituent from Phoenix write me with some good suggestions \nabout immigration reform. In the letter he said, ``Can you enlighten me \nas to whether or not we have a law on the books \n[[Page S1852]] which definitely requires the deportation of aliens who \ncommit and are convicted of felonies? * * * [Someone] told me that once \nthe alien is convicted of a felony, he is immediately deported to the \ncountry of origin with no appeals process and no bail.''\n  My answer to him was that this is how it should work but, because of \nthe way our bilateral prison transfer treaties are written, I \nreemphasize, criminal aliens choose whether or not they are deported to \ntheir own country to serve out their sentences.\n  Arizona has been particularly negatively impacted by this aspect of \nprison transfer treaties, specifically the United States-Mexico Prison \nTransfer Treaty. Gov. Fife Symington and Department of Corrections \nDirector Sam Lewis have been working with Mexican authorities and the \nState Department to return some Mexican inmates to serve their \nsentences in Mexico. But, without the elimination of the prisoner \nconsent provision of the outdated United States-Mexico Prison Transfer \nTreaty, the likelihood of their return is minimal. ``Of those who we \nhave determined to be eligible under the present [voluntary \nrepatriation] criteria, 5 percent or less have demonstrated any \nwillingness to return [to Mexico],'' said DOC Director Lewis in a \nrecent conversation.\n  Something is clearly wrong when States such as Arizona, which have \nideas about how to reduce the burden of incarcerating illegal aliens, \nare kept from doing so because the criminal does not like the idea of \nserving time in the prison system of his or her country.\n  Mr. President, this problem is not going away. The INS estimates that \nas of October 1992, approximately 3.4 million illegal aliens were in \nthis country and, according to INS, that number is growing by about \n300,000 yearly. In the Tucson border sector of Arizona alone, illegal \nimmigrant apprehensions for the month of January are up 80 percent over \nthe same period last year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n Arizona Department of Corrections--Estimates of Alien Inmate Population\n                       and Annual Per Capita Costs                      \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Date          Aliens--estimated number      Annual per capita cost \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n12/31/94.....                  2,066                       16,020       \n6/30/94......                  1,968                       16,020       \n6/30/93......                  1,791                       15,773       \n6/30/92......                  1,602                       15,979       \n6/30/91......                  1,422                       16,457       \n6/30/90......                  1,289                       16,143       \n6/30/89......                  1,153                       16,174       \n6/30/88......                  1,040                       15,717       \n6/30/87......                    957                       16,321       \n6/30/86......                    774                       15,497       \n6/30/85......                    684                       13,882       \n6/30/84......                    596                           NA       \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, nearly 600 illegal immigrants are arrested \nevery day in Nogales, AZ. These statistics will most likely set an all-\ntime illegal immigrant apprehension arrest record for Arizona.\n  Ensuring that adequate resources are allocated to stop these aliens \nat the border is the most important step we can take toward halting \nillegal immigration in this country. Renegotiating prison transfer \ntreaties is another important step and one that will free up Federal \nand State dollars to go toward effective border control.\n  We are a land of legal immigrants and we should be proud to be and \nsay so. But, no American, foreign-born or U.S.-born, believes we should \nbe a land of criminal and illegal immigrants. The Criminal Alien \nTransfer and Border Enforcement Act will provide a necessary step to \nensuring that we do not become a nation of illegal and criminal aliens. \nMr. President, I encourage my colleagues to join me in urging the \nPresident to renegotiate our Nation's bilateral prison transfer \ntreaties and to cosponsor this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 301\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Criminal Alien Transfer and \n     Border Enforcement Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to relieve overcrowding in \n     Federal and State prisons and costs borne by American \n     taxpayers by providing for the transfer of aliens unlawfully \n     in the United States who have been convicted of committing \n     crimes in the United States to their native countries to be \n     incarcerated for the duration of their sentences.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The cost of incarcerating an alien unlawfully in the \n     United States in a Federal or State prison averages $20,803 \n     per year.\n       (2) There are approximately 58,000 aliens convicted of \n     crimes incarcerated in United States prisons, including \n     41,000 aliens in State prisons and 17,000 aliens in Federal \n     prisons.\n       (3) Many of these aliens convicted of crimes are also \n     unlawfully in the United States, but the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service does not have exact data on how many.\n       (4) The combined cost to Federal and State governments for \n     the incarceration of such criminal aliens is approximately \n     $1,200,000,000, including--\n       (A) for State governments, $760,000,000; and\n       (B) for the Federal Government, $440,000,000.\n\n     SEC. 4. PRISONER TRANSFER TREATIES.\n\n       Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the President should begin to negotiate and renegotiate \n     bilateral prisoner transfer treaties. The focus of such \n     negotiations shall be to expedite the transfer of aliens \n     unlawfully in the United States who are incarcerated in \n     United States prisons, to ensure that a transferred prisoner \n     serves the balance of the sentence imposed by the United \n     States courts, and to eliminate any requirement of prisoner \n     consent to such a transfer.\n\n     SEC. 5. CERTIFICATION.\n\n       The President shall certify whether each prisoner transfer \n     treaty is effective in returning aliens unlawfully in the \n     United States who are incarcerated in the United States to \n     their country of citizenship.\n\n     SEC. 6. TRAINING OF BORDER PATROL AND CUSTOMS PERSONNEL FROM \n                   FOREIGN COUNTRIES.\n\n       Subject to a certification under section 5, the President \n     shall direct the Border Patrol Academy and the Customs \n     Service Academy to enroll for training certain foreign law \n     enforcement personnel. The President shall make appointments \n     of foreign law enforcement personnel to such academies to \n     enhance the following United States law enforcement goals:\n       (1) Drug interdiction and other cross-border criminal \n     activity.\n       (2) Preventing illegal immigration.\n       (3) Preventing the illegal entry of goods into the United \n     States (including goods the sale of which is illegal in the \n     United States, the entry of which would cause a quota to be \n     exceeded, or goods which have not paid the appropriate duty \n     or tariff).\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON;\n  S. 302. A bill to make a technical correction to section 11501(h)(2) \nof title 49, United State Code; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n                       nonconsent tow legislation\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, last year, the 103d Congress \npreempted State regulation of intrastate trucking, which was a proper \npolicy that had my full support. However, in its breadth, deregulation \nswept local government regulation of tow trucks into its net, leaving \nlocal governments uncertain about their rules governing the area of \nnonconsent tows.\n  Nonconsent tows occur at the scene of an accident where the owner is \nunable to give consent to towing, and when a car is towed from private \nproperty without the knowledge or consent of the owner. Local \nregulation of emergency nonconsent tows is aimed ostensibly at \nprotecting the motoring public at the scene of an accident to prevent a \nswarm of tow truck operators. Local regulation of private property \nnonconsent tows are consumer protection rules which generally go to how \nmuch a nonconsent tow from private property will cost and where the car \ncan be taken.\n  After the passage of trucking deregulation, Senator Gorton and I \nintroduced legislation to roll back the preemption of deregulation over \ntow trucks and transporters of recyclable materials. The bill passed in \nthe Senate but was changed in the House; the legislative clock ran out \nbefore identical versions could be passed in both houses.\n  Trucking deregulation went into effect on January 1 and local \ngovernments have moved to comply with deregulation of towing price, \nroute and service; however, there is still a great deal of confusion \nthroughout local jurisdictions around the country regarding the degree \nto which cities can regulate nonconsent tows. Some city councils, such \nas the city of Houston's, have chosen to impose a 120-day moratorium on \nchanging their regulations until \n[[Page S1853]] Congress has had a chance to act in this area and \nclarify local authority.\n  The legislation I introduce today provides that clarification. It \nstates that tows made at the request of a law enforcement officer or \nwithout the prior consent of the owner are not subject to the terms of \nthe intrastate trucking deregulation, retroactive to January 1, when \nderegulation took effect. This will permit cities to continue rate \nregulation for nonconsent tows, which protects consumers that have \nlittle or no negotiating power in nonconsent tow situations. It will \nalso permit them to utilize a system of selection for emergency \nnonconsent tows, if they so choose.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Bradley, Mr. \n        Brown, Mr. Coats, Mr. Kyl, and Mr. McConnell):\n  S. 303. A bill to establish rules governing product liability actions \nagainst raw materials and bulk component suppliers to medical device \nmanufacturers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n             The Biomaterials Access Assurance Act of 1995\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am introducing today, together \nwith Senator McCain and others the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act of \n1995. This bill directly addresses a major threat to many of the \nmiracles of modern medicine. By taking this small step now, millions of \nAmericans will no longer have to worry about the supply of life-saving \nmedical devices.\n  Over the next few years, public health may be seriously jeopardized \nif makers of the life-saving medical devices that we take for granted \ntoday are no longer able to buy the raw materials and components \nnecessary to produce their products. The reason is an all too common \none nowadays--an out-of-control product liability system.\n  How could this happen? Last year, as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nRegulation and Government Information, I held a hearing to examine this \nproblem. Witness after witness pointed out that the current legal \nsystem makes it too easy to bring lawsuits against raw materials \nsuppliers and too expensive for those suppliers to defend themselves--\neven when they were not at fault and end up winning. Because of this, \nmany suppliers have decided that the costs of defending these lawsuits \nare just too high to justify selling raw materials to the makers of \nimplantable medical devices. In short, for those suppliers, it just \nisn't worth it.\n  How could this happen? A recent study by Aronoff Associates paints a \nclear, but dismal, picture. That study surveyed the markets for \npolyester yarn, resins such as DuPont's Teflon, and polyacetal resin \nsuch as DuPont's Delrin. The study showed that sales of these raw \nmaterials for use in manufacturing implantable medical devices was just \na tiny percentage--0.006 percent--of the overall market--$606,000 out \nof total sales of over $11 billion.\n  In return for that extra $606,000 in total annual sales, however, \nthat raw material supplier, like others, faced potentially huge \nliability related costs, even if they never lose a lawsuit. To take one \nexample, a company named Vitek manufactured an estimated 26,000 jaw \nimplants using about 5 cents worth of DuPont Teflon in each device. The \ndevice was developed, designed and marketed by Vitek, which was not \nrelated to DuPont. When those implants failed, Vitek declared \nbankruptcy, its founder fled to Switzerland and the patients sued \nDuPont. DuPont has won virtually all these cases--one of the last cases \nwas dismissed earlier this month--but the cost has been staggering. The \nstudy estimated that DuPont alone has spent at least $8 million per \nyear over 6 years to defend these suits.\n  To put this into perspective, DuPont's estimated legal expenses in \nthese cases for just 1 year would buy over a 13-year supply of DuPont's \nDacron polyester, Teflon and Delrin for all U.S. makers of implantable \nmedical devices, not just makers of jaw implants.\n  Faced with this overwhelming liability, DuPont decided 2 years ago to \nstop selling its products to manufacturers of permanently implanted \nmedical devices. DuPont has subsequently allowed manufacturers to \npurchase up to 3 more years worth of raw materials.\n  One supplier's decision alone might not be troublesome except that \nthere is no reason to believe that the economics will be different for \nother suppliers around the world. One of the witnesses at the hearing \ntestified that she has already contacted 15 alternate suppliers of \npolyester yearn worldwide. All were interested in selling her raw \nmaterials--except for use in products made and used in the United \nStates. By itself, this is a powerful statement about the nature of our \nAmerican product\n liability laws, and makes a powerful case for reform.\n\n  There's more at stake however, here than just protecting suppliers \nfrom liability. It's more than just making those raw materials \navailable to the manufacturers of medical devices. What's at stake is \nthe health of millions of Americans who depend on medical devices for \ntheir every day survival.\n  What's at stake is the health of children like Thomas Reilly from \nHouston, TX, who suffers from hydrocephalus, a condition in which fluid \naccumulates around the brain. A special shunt enables him to survive. \nBut continued production of that shunt is in doubt because the raw \nmaterials' suppliers are concerned about the potential lawsuit costs. \nAt our hearing last year, Thomas' father, Mark Reilly, pleaded for \nCongress to move forward quickly to assure that the supply of those \nshunts will continue.\n  What's at stake is the health of adults like Peggy Phillips of Falls \nChurch, VA, whose heart had twice stopped beating because of \nfibrillation. Today, she lives an active, normal life because she has \nan implanted automatic defibrillator. Again, critical components of the \ndefilbrillator may no longer be available because of potential product \nliability costs. Ms. Phillips urges Congress to move swiftly to enact \nlegislation protecting raw materials and component part suppliers from \nproduct liability.\n  The scope of this problem affects young and old alike. Take a \npacemaker. Pacemakers are installed in patients whose hearts no longer \ngenerate enough of an electrical pulse to get the heart to beat. To \nkeep the heart beating, a pacemaker is connected to the heart with \nwires. These wires have silicone rubber insulation. Unfortunately, the \nsuppliers of the rubber have begun to withdraw from the market. With \nthis pacemaker, thousands of Americans can live productive and healthy \nlives for decades.\n  Take another example, a heart valve. Around the edge of a heart valve \nis a sleeve of polyester fabric. This fabric is what the surgeon sews \nthrough when he or she installs this valve. Without that sleeve, it \nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to install the valve. Without \nthat valve, patients die prematurely.\n  In short, this developing product liability crisis will have \nwidespread and serious effects. We cannot simply allow the over 7 \nmillion people who own their health to medical devices to become \ncasualties of an outmoded legal liability system. Because product \nliability litigation costs make the economics of supplying raw \nmaterials to the implantable medical device makers very unfavorable, it \nis imperative that we act now. We cannot rationally expect raw \nmaterials suppliers to continue to serve the medical device market out \nof the goodness of their hearts, notwithstanding the liability related \ncosts. We need to reform our product liability laws, to give raw \nmaterial suppliers some assurance that unless there is real evidence \nthat they were responsible for putting a defective device on the \nmarket, they cannot be sued simply in the hope that there deep pockets \nwill fund legal settlements.\n  I have long believed that liability reform could be both proconsumer \nand probusiness. I believe the testimony we heard on this subject last \nyear proved this once again. When fear of liability suits and \nlitigation costs drives valuable, lifesaving products off the market \nbecause their makers cannot get raw materials, consumers are the ones \nto suffer.\n  When companies divert money from developing new lifesaving products \nto replace old sources of raw materials supply, consumers are again the \nones to suffer. When one company must spend millions just to defend \nitself in lawsuits over a product it did not even design or make--for \nwhich it simply provided a raw material worth 5 \n[[Page S1854]] cents--it is the consumer that suffers the most. Our \nhearing dramatically illustrated that efforts to increase compensation \nfor the injured can sometimes come at an unacceptably high cost.\n  Based on the testimony we heard, I, along with my distinguished \ncolleague from Arizona, are committed to forging a solution to remedy \nthis immediate threat to our national public health. Today, we are \nintroducing the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act of 1995, which will \nestablish clear national rules to govern suits against suppliers of raw \nmaterials and component parts for permanently implantable medical \ndevices. Under this bill, a supplier of raw materials or component \nparts can only be sued if the materials they supplied do not meet \ncontractual specifications, or can properly be classified as a \nmanufacturer or seller of the whole product. They cannot, however, be \nsued for deficiencies in the design of the final device, the testing of \nthat device, or for inadequate warnings with respect to that device.\n  I believe that enactment of this bill would help ensure that \nAmerica's patients continue to have access to the best lifesaving \nmedical devices in the world. We must act now, however. This piece of \nlegislation is preventative medicine at its best and is just the cure \nthe patients need.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 303\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Biomaterials Access \n     Assurance Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) each year millions of citizens of the United States \n     depend on the availability of lifesaving or life-enhancing \n     medical devices, many of which are permanently implantable \n     within the human body;\n       (2) a continued supply of raw materials and component parts \n     is necessary for the invention, development, improvement, and \n     maintenance of the supply of the devices;\n       (3) most of the medical devices are made with raw materials \n     and component parts that--\n       (A) are not designed or manufactured specifically for use \n     in medical devices; and\n       (B) come in contact with internal human tissue;\n       (4) the raw materials and component parts also are used in \n     a variety of nonmedical products;\n       (5) because small quantities of the raw materials and \n     component parts are used for medical devices, sales of raw \n     materials and component parts for medical devices constitute \n     an extremely small portion of the overall market for the raw \n     materials and medical devices;\n       (6) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 301 et seq.), manufacturers of medical devices are \n     required to demonstrate that the medical devices are safe and \n     effective, including demonstrating that the products are \n     properly designed and have adequate warnings or instructions;\n       (7) notwithstanding the fact that raw materials and \n     component parts suppliers do not design, produce, or test a \n     final medical device, the suppliers have been the subject of \n     actions alleging inadequate--\n       (A) design and testing of medical devices manufactured with \n     materials or parts supplied by the suppliers; or\n       (B) warnings related to the use of such medical devices;\n       (8) even though suppliers of raw materials and component \n     parts have very rarely been held liable in such actions, such \n     suppliers have ceased supplying certain raw materials and \n     component parts for use in medical devices because the costs \n     associated with litigation in order to ensure a favorable \n     judgment for the suppliers far exceeds the total potential \n     sales revenues from sales by such suppliers to the medical \n     device industry;\n       (9) unless alternate sources of supply can be found, the \n     unavailability of raw materials and component parts for \n     medical devices will lead to unavailability of lifesaving and \n     life-enhancing medical devices;\n       (10) because other suppliers of the raw materials and \n     component parts in foreign nations are refusing to sell raw \n     materials or component parts for use in manufacturing certain \n     medical devices in the United States, the prospects for \n     development of new sources of supply for the full range of \n     threatened raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices are remote;\n       (11) it is unlikely that the small market for such raw \n     materials and component parts in the United States could \n     support the large investment needed to develop new suppliers \n     of such raw materials and component parts;\n       (12) attempts to develop such new suppliers would raise the \n     cost of medical devices;\n       (13) courts that have considered the duties of the \n     suppliers of the raw materials and component parts have \n     generally found that the suppliers do not have a duty--\n       (A) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of a raw \n     material or component part in a medical device; and\n       (B) to warn consumers concerning the safety and \n     effectiveness of a medical device;\n       (14) attempts to impose the duties referred to in \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (13) on suppliers of \n     the raw materials and component parts would cause more harm \n     than good by driving the suppliers to cease supplying \n     manufacturers of medical devices; and\n       (15) in order to safeguard the availability of a wide \n     variety of lifesaving and life-enhancing medical devices, \n     immediate action is needed--\n       (A) to clarify the permissible bases of liability for \n     suppliers of raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices; and\n       (B) to provide expeditious procedures to dispose of \n     unwarranted suits against the suppliers in such manner as to \n     minimize litigation costs.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The \n     discovery conducted pursuant to this subparagraph shall be \n     limited to issues that are directly relevant to--\n       (i) the pending motion to dismiss; or\n       (ii) the jurisdiction of the court.\n       (3) Affidavits relating status of defendant.--\n       (A) In general.--Except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) \n     of subparagraph (B), the court shall consider a defendant to \n     be a biomaterials supplier who is not subject to an action \n     for harm to a claimant caused by an implant, other than an \n     action relating to liability for a violation of contractual \n     requirements or specifications described in subsection (d).\n       (B) Responses to motion to dismiss.--The court shall grant \n     a motion to dismiss any action that asserts liability of the \n     defendant under subsection (b) or (c) of section 5 on the \n     grounds that the defendant is not a manufacturer subject to \n     such subsection 5(b) or seller subject to subsection 5(c), \n     unless the claimant submits a valid affidavit that \n     demonstrates that--\n       (i) with respect to a motion to dismiss contending the \n     defendant is not a manufacturer, the defendant meets the \n     applicable requirements for liability as a manufacturer under \n     section 5(b); or\n       (ii) with respect to a motion to dismiss contending that \n     the defendant is not a seller, the defendant meets the \n     applicable requirements for liability as a seller under \n     section 5(c).\n       (4) Basis of ruling on motion to dismiss.--\n       (A) In general.--The court shall rule on a motion to \n     dismiss filed under subsection (a) solely on the basis of the \n     pleadings of the parties made pursuant to this section and \n     any affidavits submitted by the parties pursuant to this \n     section.\n       (B) Motion for summary judgment.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, if the court determines that the pleadings \n     and affidavits made by parties pursuant to this section raise \n     genuine issues as concerning material facts with respect to a \n     motion concerning contractual requirements and \n     specifications, the court may deem the motion to dismiss to \n     be a motion for summary judgment made pursuant to subsection \n     (d).\n       (d) Summary Judgment.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Basis for entry of judgment.--A biomaterials supplier \n     shall be entitled to entry of judgment without trial if the \n     court finds there is no genuine issue as concerning any \n     material fact for each applicable element set forth in \n     paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 5(d).\n       (B) Issues of material fact.--With respect to a finding \n     made under subparagraph (A), the court shall consider a \n     genuine issue of material fact to exist only if the evidence \n     submitted by claimant would be sufficient to allow a \n     reasonable jury to reach a verdict for the claimant if the \n     jury found the evidence to be credible.\n       (2) Discovery made prior to a ruling on a motion for \n     summary judgment.--If, under applicable rules, the court \n     permits discovery prior to a ruling on a motion for summary \n     judgment made pursuant to this subsection, such discovery \n     shall be limited solely to establishing whether a genuine \n     issue of material fact exists.\n       (3) Discovery with respect to a biomaterials supplier.--A \n     biomaterials supplier shall be subject to discovery in \n     connection with a motion seeking dismissal or summary \n     judgment on the basis of the inapplicability of section 5(d) \n     or the failure to establish the applicable elements of \n     section 5(d) solely to the extent permitted by the applicable \n     Federal or State rules for discovery against nonparties.\n       (e) Stay Pending Petition for Declaration.--If a claimant \n     has filed a petition for a declaration pursuant to section \n     5(b) with respect to a defendant, and the Secretary has not \n     issued a final decision on the petition, the court shall stay \n     all proceedings with respect to that defendant until such \n     time as the Secretary has issued a final decision on the \n     petition.\n       (f) Manufacturer Conduct of Proceeding.--The manufacturer \n     of an implant that is the subject of an action covered under \n     this Act shall be permitted to file and conduct a proceeding \n     on any motion for summary judgment or dismissal filed by a \n     biomaterials supplier who is a defendant under this section \n     if the manufacturer and any other defendant in such action \n     enter into a valid and applicable contractual agreement under \n     which the manufacturer agrees to bear the cost of such \n     proceeding or to conduct such proceeding.\n       (g) Attorney Fees.--The court shall require the claimant to \n     compensate the biomaterials supplier (or a manufacturer \n     appearing in lieu of a supplier pursuant to subsection (f)) \n     for attorney fees and costs, if--\n       (1) the claimant named or joined the biomaterials supplier; \n     and\n       (2) the court found the claim against the biomaterials \n     supplier to be without merit and frivolous.\n\n     SEC. 7. APPLICABILITY.\n\n       This Act shall apply to all civil actions covered under \n     this Act that are commenced on or after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, including any such action with respect to which \n     the harm asserted in the action or the conduct that caused \n     the harm occurred before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. Robb):\n  S. 305. A bill to establish the Shenandoah Valley National \nBattlefields and Commission in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n  the shenandoah valley national battlefields partnership act of 1995\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation, along with Senator Robb, to establish a new national park \nin the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia.\n  This legislation mirrors my legislation from last year, S. 1033, \nwhich passed the Senate by unanimous consent.\n  While our purpose is conventional--the preservation of treasured \nhistoric resources, our approach is innovative--a cooperative \nrelationship between the National Park Service and private landowners \nthat combines a mix of Federal ownership through donation of lands and \nprotection of private property rights.\n  This new park will preserve and commemorate the strategic \nsignificance of the Civil War battles in the valley which occurred from \n1862 to 1864. The park will consist of 1,864 acres at 10 battlefields \nin the valley at McDowell, Cross Keys, Port Republic, Second \nWinchester, New Market, Fishers Hill, Toms Brook, Cedar Creek, \nKernstown, and Opequon.\n  The Shenandoah Valley National Battlefields Partnership Act is the \nproduct of an indepth study by the National Park Service which was \nauthorized by the Congress in 1990. The Park Service conducted field \nsurveys of 15 battlefields in the valley and concluded in their \nanalysis that ``because of their size and unprotected status, the \nbattlefields of the Shenandoah Valley were its most important, most \nneglected, and most threatened resource.''\n  Mr. President, throughout my service in this body, I have been \nactively involved in the preservation of several Civil War battlefields \nin Virginia. One of my first legislative initiatives was \n[[Page S1857]] to sponsor legislation in 1980 to expand the boundaries \nof the Manassas National Battlefield Park by 1,522 acres. While some \nbattlefield preservation efforts in Virginia have been accomplished by \na consensus of support from local governments, the preservation \ncommunity and the Federal Government, other efforts have involved a \ngreat deal of acrimony.\n  I am pleased that the Senate will again give approval to my \nlegislation which represents a significant investment of time and \ncommitment by preservation groups, local governments, and many \ndedicated residents in the valley.\n  Each party interested in fostering the protection of the Shenandoah \nValley battlefields has worked diligently since the Park Service study \nbegan in 1990 to craft a consensus proposal that recognizes the limits \non the Federal Government's resources to acquire substantial acreage in \nthe valley and balances the needs of property owners and local \ngovernments to provide for their economic future.\n  Mr. President, during the past 2 years that we have worked on gaining \nnational recognition for the Shenandoah Valley battlefields, I have \nremained committed to this effort because of the steadfast support and \nleadership by the many local citizens, property owners, \npreservationists, and local officials in the valley. They have given \ngenerously of their personal time to organize local meetings, testify \nbefore Congress, and work with the Park Service to advance our \nproposal.\n  I am especially grateful to Will Greene, formerly with the \nAssociation for the Preservation of Civil War Sites; Jay Monahan and \nGarland Hudgings, with the Stonewall Brigade Foundation; and many civic \nleaders such as June Wilmot, with the Winchester-Frederick County \nEconomic Development Commission; Betsy Helm, with Historic Winchester \nFoundation; Robert Watkins, with the Frederick County Planning \nCommission, and Barbara Moore, with the Society of Port Republic \nPreservationists.\n  Mr. President, these are but a few of the many persons who have \nassumed the tremendous responsibility over the years to ensure that \nthese historic lands remain undisturbed for future generations. It is \nno exaggeration to say that this legislation would not be possible \ntoday without their firm resolve and passion to preserve these \nbattlefields.\n  With the passage of this legislation, they will no longer be \nshouldering this effort alone, but will now have the Park Service as an \nimportant partner.\n  While authorizing limited acquisition of 10 battlefields in the \nvalley, most of this land will be donated to the Park Service. The \ncentral feature of this provision is to foster and encourage an \natmosphere of cooperation between the Federal Government, State and \nlocal governments, property owners, and preservation groups.\n  We have been fortunate that the valley's predominantly agricultural \nland uses have provided protection for these battlefields. Permanent \npreservation, however, is in serious jeopardy as the rural landscape of \nthe valley declines. With the continued pace of growth in the northern \nvalley and the loss of agricultural lands, now is the time for the \nFederal Government to become a full partner in the local and private \nefforts to ensure that these lands remain protected for all Americans \nto study and enjoy.\n  This bill embodies many of the preservation approaches examined in \nthe ``Study of Civil War Sites in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia.'' \nI concur with the study's finding that ``* * * no single alternative is \nbest suited to these sites. A balance must be achieved between \npreservation, the Valley lifestyle, and economic development * * *''.\n  In keeping with these recommendations, I believe this bill provides \nthe right balance for preserving these battlefields. With limited \nFederal ownership, and a commission comprised of local representatives \nand historians to recommend further additions for Federal stewardship \nas well as cooperative arrangements with local governments and private \nlandowners, we are achieving the desired goal. It recognizes the rights \nand responsibilities of local governments to utilize their planning \nauthorities to protect these areas. It gives the Federal Government \nneeded authorities to provide technical assistance on options to \nprotect these battlefields, to provide for visitor interpretation and \nunderstanding, and most importantly, to accept lands by donation or \npurchase only from willing sellers.\n  As the study proposes a mix of public funding and technical \nassistance and acquisition of battlefield areas, our legislation \nembodies these recommendations to foster a partnership between the \nFederal Government, local governments, landowners and private \norganizations.\n  Each will share the responsibility and will prosper from the benefits \nthat a national park designation brings to neighboring communities.\n  Now is the time for the Federal Government to come forward and \nparticipate in the protection of these threatened resources.\n  Mr. President, there is no question about the historic value of these \nproperties. They have a high degree of integrity and continue to tell \nan important story of the military strategy employed during the battles \nof Thomas J. ``Stonewall'' Jackson's valley campaign of 1862 and the \nbattles comprising Union General Philip Sheridan's burning of the \nShenandoah Valley in 1864.\n  Approximately one-third of the recorded events of the Civil War \noccurred in Virginia. Dyer's ``Compendium of the War of the Rebellion'' \nrecords 297 incidents of armed conflict in the Shenandoah Valley during \nthe Civil War: 6 battles, 18 engagements, 21 actions, and 252 \nskirmishes. The Shenandoah Valley was the richest agricultural region \nin Virginia, providing provisions to the Confederate forces. In \naddition, the Confederates used the Valley as a natural corridor for \ninvading or threatening invasion of the North, while the Union forces \nrealized the importance of denying the valley's use to the Confederacy.\n  Mr. President, surely, these events deserve a permanent place in \nhistory, just as Manassas, Gettysburg, and Antietam.\n  One of the most brilliant and most studied military campaigns in \nhistory is Stonewall Jackson's valley campaign of 1862. During that \ncampaign, Jackson's army of 17,000 men defeated three northern armies \nwith a combined strength of 33,000 men in a single month, winning five \nbattles: McDowell, Front Royal, Winchester, Cross Keys, and Port \nRepublic. Most importantly, Jackson's valley campaign created a \nstrategic diversion to draw strength from the Federal's advance on \nRichmond. It was General Lee who unleashed Jackson in the valley \nbecause he understood the importance of creating a diversion to keep \nUnion troops from moving toward Richmond.\n  Mr. President, I would like to share with my colleagues a brief \nexcerpt from the study which so eloquently describes the passion that \ncontinues in the valley today:\n\n       Few regions in the United States have experienced the \n     horrors of systematic destruction, and the memories are still \n     close to the surface for many longtime Valley residents. \n     Family histories are filled with stories that relate to the \n     hardship of that time. It took a generation to repair the \n     savages of ``The Burning'' and another generation before life \n     in the Valley returned to its pre-war condition. There can be \n     found there today a fierce pride in ancestors who survived \n     the war and who struggled to rebuild all that was lost.\n       The history of the Civil War in the Shenandoah Valley bears \n     witness to the devastation and waste of warfare, but more \n     importantly, it underscores the irrepressible human will to \n     survive, to rebuild, to carry on. The historic events and the \n     human players of the Valley--heroic and tragic alike--have \n     contributed significantly to the texture of our American \n     cultural heritage.\n\n  Mr. President, I am confident that these battlefields will make a \nvery positive contribution to the Park Service preservation of this \ntragic chapter in our American history. These lands are important to \nour understanding of the events that occurred from 1862 to 1864 when \nthe momentum and tide of the Confederacy's struggle turned and the \nUnion forces began to take hold. \n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DORGAN:\n  S. 306. A bill entitled the ``Television Violence Reduction Through \nParental Empowerment Act of 1995''; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                         TELEVISION LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nthat would empower parents to deal with violence \n[[Page S1858]] on television. Specifically, the Television Violence \nReductions Through Parental Empowerment Act would require that \ntelevision sets include a technical devise parents could use to block \nout television programs that are, in their judgment, too violent for \ntheir children.\n  This legislation is identical to legislation Representative Ed Markey \nintroduced in the House the previous Congress. I introduced this \nlegislation in the Senate last year as well. I am introducing this bill \nagain because I believe that we ought to consider this approach, \ncommonly known as the V-chip bill, in the current debate over how we \nshould address the problem of violence on television. In my judgment, \nthe V-chip idea is an important part of a legislative response to the \nproblem of violence on television.\n  I understand that the Electronics Industry Association is moving \nforward on developing an industry standard that will incorporate the \nability to block programs based on a rating for violence into new \ntelevision sets. I endorse and applaud these efforts. This private \nsector initiative is a very positive development. However, it remains \nto be seen as to whether or not such efforts will accomplish the goal \nof empowering parents to control television programs coming into their \nhomes. I intend to work with the industry in this effort and I want to \nencourage the future of their efforts. Nevertheless, until such a \nstandard is in place and out common goals are accomplished, I still \nbelieve that it is necessary to keep this legislation on the table.\n  There was a great deal of debate in the 103d Congress about \ntelevision violence. Unfortunately, that debate took place, to a large \nextent, in congressional committees and no legislation was advanced. I \nthink the broadcast and cable industries, along with the EIA, have all \nmade significant efforts to address public and congressional concern \nwith TV violence. However, I still believe that some modest legislative \napproach need to be considered.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation and in general \nwork with me to advance a solution to television violence that enables \nthe public and parents in particular to send a direct message to the \nindustry. Parents and the public, and not the Government nor the \nindustry, should have the ultimate say in what should and should not be \non television The V-chip bill is a means to give consumers another \ntool.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 306\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representative of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Television Violence \n     Reduction Through Parental Empowerment Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2 FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) To the fullest extent possible, parents should be \n     empowered with the technology to choose\n      to block the display on their televisions of programs they \n     consider too violent for their children.\n       (2) Violence now touches the lives of American children \n     more than adults. From 1982 through 1984, teenagers were the \n     victims of 1,800,000 violent crimes, twice the annual rate of \n     the adult population over age 20. According to the American \n     Academy of Pediatrics, one of every 8 deaths among children \n     age 10-14 years old in 1990 was caused by a shooting. Among \n     teenagers and young adults, that figure rose to one of every \n     four deaths.\n       (3) Children watch an extensive amount of television. It is \n     estimated that a child watches approximately 22,000 hours of \n     television before finishing high school, almost twice the \n     amount of time spent in the classroom.\n       (4) The amount of violence on television has reached \n     epidemic levels. The American Psychological Association \n     estimates that the average child witnesses 8,000 murders and \n     100,000 acts of violence before finishing elementary school.\n       (5) Three Surgeon Generals, the National Institute of \n     Mental health, the Centers for Disease Control, the American \n     Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and \n     the American Psychological Association have concurred for \n     nearly 20 years as to the deleterious effects of television \n     violence on children.\n       (6) Despite periodic television industry efforts to reduce \n     the amount of television violence, reductions in the level of \n     televised violence have never been long lasting.\n       (7) Parents who are working are unable to constantly \n     monitor the television viewing habits of their children. \n     Advanced television technologies such as channel compression \n     and digitization will allow the expansion of channel capacity \n     to levels even more unmanageable for parents who want to \n     protect their children from televised violence.\n       (8) The major broadcast networks and a large number of \n     cable channels have agreed to place parental advisories on \n     programs they consider to be too violent for children. These \n     parental advisories are of limited use to parents if they are \n     not watching television with their children.\n       (9) The technology currently exists to equip television \n     sets at a nominal cost to permit parents to block the display \n     of television programs they consider too violent for \n     children. However, this technology will only be effective (A) \n     if all television programmers send any adopted rating or \n     warning system electronically with the program signal, and \n     (B) parents are able to block the display not only of \n     individual programs but to block out automatically and \n     simultaneously all programs with such rating.\n       (10) Congress calls upon the broadcast networks, \n     independent television stations, cable programmers, and \n     satellite programmers to protect the parental right to guide \n     the television viewing habits of children by sending any \n     adopted rating or warning system electronically with the \n     program signal.\n\n     SEC. 3. EQUIP TELEVISIONS TO BLOCK PROGRAMS.\n\n       Section 303 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     303) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following:\n       ``(v) Require that (1) apparatus designed to receive \n     television signals be equipped with circuitry designed to \n     enable viewers to block the display of channels, programs, \n     and time slots; and (2) such apparatus enable viewers to \n     block display of all programs with a common rating. The \n     requirements of this subsection shall apply when such \n     apparatus is manufactured in the United States or imported \n     for use in the United States, and its television picture \n     screen is 13 inches or greater in size, measured \n     diagonally.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. SHIPPING OR IMPORTING.\n\n       (A) Regulations.--Section 330 of the Communications Act of \n     1934 (47 U.S.C. 330) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (d); and\n       (2) by adding after subsection (b) the following new \n     section:\n       ``(c) No person shall ship in interstate commerce, \n     manufacture, assemble, or import from any foreign country \n     into the United States any apparatus described in section \n     303(v) of this Act except in accordance with rules prescribed \n     by the Commission pursuant to the authority granted by that \n     section. Such rules shall provide performance standards for \n     such blocking technology. Such rules shall further require \n     that all such apparatus be able to receive the rating signals \n     which have been transmitted by way of line 21 of the vertical \n     blanking interval and which conform to the signal and \n     blocking specifications established by the Commission. As new \n     video technology is developed, the Commission shall take such \n     action as the Commission determines appropriate to ensure \n     that blocking service continues to be available to consumers. \n     This subsection shall not apply to carriers transporting such \n     apparatus without trading it.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 330(d) of such Act, as \n     redesignated by this Act, is amended by striking ``section \n     303(s), and section 303(u)'' and inserting in lieu thereof \n     ``and section 303(s), 303(u), and 303(v)''.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to design and \nissue new counterfeit-resistant $100 currency; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n     the counterfeiting and money laundering deterrence act of 1995\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nCounterfeiting and Money Laundering Deterrence Act of 1995.\n  Counterfeit money is the cheap way for terrorists to fund their \nactivities around the world. The opening of the trial in New York of \nthe accused terrorists, who allegedly threatened to blow up the United \nNations, FBI Headquarters, and other sites, serves as a reminder that \nour Nation is not immune to such activities. This bill outlines steps \nwe should take to combat both the counterfeiting of our currency and \nthe laundering of the estimated $300 billion per year of ill-gotten \nprofits from drugs, arms smuggling, and other crimes.\n  [[Page S1859]] This legislation, which Senator Kerry and I also \nintroduced in the last Congress, would accomplish two objectives: \nFirst, it would bring our $100 currency up to date and stop letting \ncounterfeiters have a free meal ticket. Second, it would put the \nsqueeze on drug trafficking organizations that have to launder vast \nsums of money to operate--making their costs of doing business \nsignificantly higher and hopefully turning piles of their money into \nworthless paper.\n\n\n                       counterfeiting deterrence\n\n  The currency of this country faces a serious challenge from new \ntechnologies that enable counterfeiters to turn out excellent \nreproductions. According to the Secret Service, overseas counterfeiting \nof U.S. currency has increased dramatically. For example, from 1992 to \n1993, counterfeit currency detected abroad increased 300 percent.\n  A number of analysts believe the threat to the U.S. currency is \nurgent. News reports say that intelligence experts in the United States \nand Israel are aware of a highly skilled group of counterfeiters \noperating out of Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. These counterfeiters, \ncontrolled by Syria and Iran, have turned out as much as $1 billion of \nextremely high-quality reproductions of the United States $100 bill.\n  We must be very concerned with what nations like Iran or Syria can do \nwith $1 billion in bogus United States currency so convincing that it \ncan be passed onto the international market. Would these poor countries \nuse this money to purchase sophisticated weaponry that challenges the \nsecurity of the region or of this country? Would they use this currency \nin an effort to destabilize U.S. currency? Would they use it to fund \nsmaller scale but still serious terrorist activities throughout the \nworld? No one knows.\n  The opening of the Russian Republics and the Eastern Bloc has also \nresulted in increased counterfeiting activity. Because the situation is \nchanging in this part of the world so fast, it is difficult to \ndetermine the amount of counterfeiting that occurs there. According to \nthe chief of the Russian Interior Ministry's Department of Economic \nCrimes, the amount of counterfeit United States currency confiscated by \nRussian authorities increased 10 times from 1992 to 1993. With \norganized crime increasingly taking hold in the Republics, \ncounterfeiting has become a national cottage industry according to \nMoscow news reports. Because of mounting inflation of the ruble, \nforeign currency such as the U.S. $100 bill has a special place in that \ncountry's economic system, making it particularly attractive to \ncounterfeiting.\n  What makes this situation all the more pressing is that the U.S. \ncurrency is among the most easy to counterfeit in the world. Although \nrecently updated with a deterrent polyester strip, our bills do not use \nthe watermarks or sophisticated dying and engraving techniques that \nother countries employ to make it difficult to reproduce their bills \nconvincingly. Nor do we change the appearance of our currency from \ntime-to-time to discourage counterfeiters as other countries do.\n  To address this threat, this legislation requires the Secretary of \nthe Treasury to design a new $100 bill that incorporates some of the \ncounterfeit-resistant features that other countries have adopted. The \nTreasury Department has already done substantial design work on a new \n$100 bill, and it is the intention of this legislation to permit the \nSecretary to draw on that work in meeting the requirements of the act.\n\n\n                      money laundering deterrence\n\n  But aside from bringing our currency into modern times to address \nstate-of-the-art counterfeiting technology, this legislation is \ndesigned to put a full court press on money laundering. We need to \nrealize that the international drug industry is a multibillion-dollar, \nhighly sophisticated enterprise. A single undercover operation in which \nFederal agents operated a fake bank to launder money recently netted \n$52 million in cash and assets. If we are really going to stop \ninternational drug trafficking and terrorist activities, we need to \nfocus more on stopping the ease with which those organizations move \ntheir money internationally to finance their crimes.\n  My bill strikes two blows against money launderers. First, the bill \nrequires all existing $100 denomination U.S. currency to be exchanged \nwithin a 6-month period. This would make drug traffickers who hoard \nvast amounts of hard currency hard-pressed to convert their existing \ncash into the new money. If they cannot convert the money within the \nspecified time frame, their funds become worthless under the bill. Even \nif drug organizations could somehow convert their money within the \nexchange period, the likelihood of their being traced by currency \ntransaction reporting increases substantially, as does the cost of \nlaundering their ill-gotten gains. Of course, there is an exception for \nhardship cases in the bill where money has not been derived from \nunlawful activity.\n  Second, the bill establishes two new versions of the $100 bill: One \nfor use at home and one for use abroad. The only business that relies \non exporting large amounts of hard currency is drug trafficking. This \nprovision would make money smuggled out of the United States worthless, \nturning the tables on drug traffickers who covertly move money from the \nstreets of this country to foreign banks who launder it without \nreporting illicit transactions to the Treasury.\n  A U.S. citizen traveling abroad who wished to bring $100 currency \nwith him would hardly be inconvenienced by this measure: A quick stop \nat a U.S. bank to convert their greenbacks into differently colored \nforeign-use bills would be all that is necessary--just like purchasing \ntravelers' checks. The only ones inconvenienced would be drug \ntraffickers who would hate to exchange their greenbacks for foreign-use \ncurrency at a U.S. bank because of currency transaction reporting \nrequirements.\n  To the extent drug traffickers cannot exchange their $100 bills \nwithin the timeframe and they become worthless, this is a debt against \nthe U.S. Treasury that can be written off to finance the costs of this \nlegislation, and further, to pay off other obligations of the U.S. \nTreasury.\n\n\n                let's begin a discussion on these issues\n\n  I know there will be opposition from some quarters to this proposal. \nThe Federal Reserve likes the current situation and believes the good-\nold, easily copied $100 bill provides welcome stability to the \ninternational monetary system. The banks feel burdened by the currency \ntransaction reporting requirements. Adding new counterfeit-resistant \nfeatures to bills is not costless. The Drug Enforcement Administration \nsupports the concept but some there would prefer to go further and \nestablish domestic and foreign use versions of all our currency.\n  Let us begin a serious discussion and debate on the steps we should \ntake to address high-technology counterfeiting and money laundering. If \nthis proposal is not the best way to go, then let's work to fashion a \nmeasure that will take strong steps against these threats. I am not \ncomfortable with the current situation: We face the threat of \npotentially billions of passable counterfeit U.S. dollars going into \nthe hands of terrorists. We must do more to cripple the big business of \ndrug trafficking. Continuing to put our collective heads in the sand \nwill not suffice. I encourage my colleagues and the relevant agencies \nand others with expertise in these areas to consider and take the steps \nnecessary to address these important issues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Summary of the Counterfeiting and Money Laundering Deterrence Act of \n                                  1995\n\n       Section 1. The short title of the bill is the \n     ``Counterfeiting and Money Laundering Deterrence Act of \n     1995.''\n       Section 2. Findings and Purposes. Congressional findings \n     are summarized and the purposes of the bill to combat \n     counterfeiting and money laundering are described.\n       Section 3. Counterfeit-Resistant $100 Denomination \n     Currency.\n       The bill amends Title 31, United States Code, with new \n     section 5123 to require the Secretary of the Treasury, in \n     consultation with the Attorney General and the Administrator \n     of the Drug Enforcement Administration, to design and \n     designate new counterfeit-resistant $100 bills for domestic \n     and foreign use within 6 months of enactment.\n       The new bills must have counterfeit-deterring features such \n     as watermarks, multi-colored dyes, holograms, sophisticated \n     engraving techniques etc.\n       [[Page S1860]] The domestic use bills would be legal tender \n     only in the U.S.; the foreign use bills would be legal tender \n     abroad only. The two types of money could be exchanged at \n     banks subject to U.S. currency transaction reporting \n     requirements only. The domestic use bills have distinctly \n     different coloring from the foreign use bills. This means \n     money smuggled out of the country to be laundered at offshore \n     banks that do not engage in currency transaction reporting \n     would be worthless.\n       A 6-month currency exchange period would begin one year \n     from the date of enactment. Old $100 bills must be exchanged \n     for new domestic or foreign use $100 bills within this 6-\n     month period, or they become worthless. The bill includes a \n     process for extending the exchange period for hardship cases.\n       The currency exchange must occur at banks regulated by U.S. \n     currency transaction reporting and anti-money laundering laws \n     or at foreign banks that the Secretary of the Treasury finds \n     by treaty or agreement abide by currency transaction \n     reporting laws.\n       The Act would be financed by using credits obtained from \n     extinguishing the Treasury's liability for $100 bills not \n     exchanged within the exchange period. Additional credits so \n     generated would be returned to the general fund.\n       Section 4. Notice of Currency Exchange Period. The \n     Secretary must begin notifying foreign and domestic \n     governments and financial institutions of the upcoming \n     exchange period within 6 months of enactment.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMPSON (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. \n        Murkowski, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Craig, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Akaka):\n  S.J. Res. 26. A joint resolution designating April 9, 1995, and April \n9, 1996, as ``National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day''; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n          the national former prisoner of war recognition day\n\n Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my good \nfriend and predecessor as chairman of the Committee on Veterans \nAffairs, Senator Rockefeller, in introducing a Joint resolution which \nwould recognize the service and dedication of America's former \nprisoners of war [POW's]. The Joint resolution would designate April 9, \n1995, and April 9, 1996, as ``National Former Prisoner of War \nRecognition day.'' April 9 is the anniversary of the fall of Bataan in \n1942. On that day more Americans became POW's than any other day in our \nhistory.\n  Every American who dons the uniform of our country makes a unique \ncommitment of service and duty to our country and to our fellow \ncitizens. Many factors, some as random as fate itself, determine how \nthat commitment will be realized. For some, military service may be \nlittle more than an office job here in the United States. For others, \nmilitary service can combine bitter privation with the agony of combat. \nPerhaps no American veterans have been called upon to honor their \ncommitment to our country under circumstances more difficult than those \nendured by our former POW's.\n  Former prisoners of war have seen combat. By definition they were \nclose enough to the enemy to be captured; frequently after being \nwounded, shot down, or sunk by enemy action. But for them, the war \ndidn't end when they were taken by the enemy, it was just beginning. At \nthe worst, their experience was one of malnutrition, torture, and \nnonexistent medical care, combined with the burden of watching comrades \ndie as fellow slave laborers while working under conditions that would \nmake the worst villain of a Dickens novel look like a philanthropist.\n  Even under the best possible conditions, the POW experience places \nAmerican service members in the position of being dependent upon our \nnation's enemies for every scrap of food, every bandage, every human \nneed. In such circumstances, the reward for treason, or even \ncooperation, is high. The penalty for resistance and loyalty is \nimmediate, frequently painful and sometimes fatal. This resolution \nrecognizes the sacrifice and loyalty of the POW's who maintained their \ncommitment of service to our country. In so doing, it helps fulfill the \nduty we have to former POW's. A duty derived from the faithful \ndischarge of their duty to us.\n  Mr. President, in this century 142,257 American servicemembers have \nbecome POW's. For over 17,000 of them, the experience was fatal. They \ndied while in the hands of our enemies. Of the 125,202 who returned to \nour shores, only about 62,000 remain alive today.\n  This Joint resolution commemorates the service of former POW's who \nsustained their commitment to our country under circumstances that few \nof us can imagine, and none would willingly endure. I ask this body to \nhonor the memory of those who have already died; I urge the Senate to \nexpress its gratitude to those still alive; and I call upon my \ncolleagues to join with Senator Rockefeller, members of the committee \non Veterans' Affairs, and myself in sponsoring this Joint \nresolution.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/31/senate-section/article/S1848-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 12\n\n  At the request of Mr. Breaux, the name of the Senator from Maryland \n[Ms. Mikulski] was added as a cosponsor of S. 12, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage savings and investment \nthrough individual retirement accounts, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 141\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from \nGeorgia [Mr. Coverdell] was added as a cosponsor of S. 141, a bill to \nrepeal the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 to provide new job opportunities, \neffect significant cost savings on Federal construction contracts, \npromote small business participation in Federal contracting, reduce \nunnecessary paperwork and reporting requirements, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 210\n\n  At the request of Mr. Thomas, the name of the Senator from Idaho [Mr. \nCraig] was added as a cosponsor of S. 210, a bill to amend title XVIII \nof the Social Security Act to provide for coverage under part B of the \nmedicare program of emergency care and related services furnished by \nrural emergency access care hospitals.\n\n\n                                 S. 227\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Wyoming \n[Mr. Simpson] was added as a cosponsor of S. 227, a bill to amend title \n17, United States Code, to provide an exclusive right to perform sound \nrecordings publicly by means of digital transmissions and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 233\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from Indiana \n[Mr. Lugar] was added as a cosponsor of S. 233, a bill to provide for \nthe termination of reporting requirements of certain executive reports \nsubmitted to the Congress, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 245\n\n  At the request of Mr. Cohen, the name of the Senator from North \nDakota [Mr. Dorgan] was added as a cosponsor of S. 245, a bill to \nprovide for enhanced penalties for health care fraud, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 262\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the names of the Senator from \nNebraska [Mr. Kerrey], the Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], and the \nSenator from Louisiana [Mr. Breaux] were added as cosponsors of S. 262, \na bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase and make \npermanent the deduction for health insurance costs of self-employed \nindividuals.\n\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 17\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kempthorne, the names of the Senator from North \nCarolina [Mr. Helms] and the Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham] were \nadded as cosponsors of Senate Joint Resolution 17, a joint resolution \nnaming the CVN-76 aircraft carrier as the U.S.S.

Mr. President, the issue of capital punishment is \ngoing to rear its head again in this session of Congress, and, once \nagain, we will probably do what is politically expedient but is wrong.\n  I will continue to vote against capital punishment.\n  Recently, William H. Rentschler of my State, a member of the \nexecutive committee of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, \nhad an op-ed piece in the Chicago Tribune on the question of capital \npunishment. It contains so much common sense that I ask to insert it \ninto the Record at this point.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Nov. 29, 1994]\n\n                   The Death Penalty--A Pivotal Issue\n\n                       (By William H. Rentschler)\n\n       Autumn of 1994 was ``the killing season.''\n       The ancient art of state-sanctioned killing clearly was a \n     dominant issue, largely ignored in most post-election \n     analyses of the Nov. 8 balloting.\n       The death penalty probably was as decisive a factor in the \n     Republican sweep as the call for less government intrusion, \n     even though the two are philosophical opposites.\n       Virtually every major winner, in upsetting incumbents, \n     promised, in effect, to kill more human beings for an ever \n     wider assortment of crimes, and to kill them deader and \n     quicker.\n       Today, an overwhelming percentage of Americans tell \n     pollsters they favor capital punishment, which seems to have \n     become nearly as popular as tax cuts, Sunday afternoon \n     football and strawberry yogurt. Which, of course, is why \n     candidates seized on the issue with such self-righteous, \n     drum-beating fervor.\n       If indeed all those elected keep their promises to enforce \n     the death penalty more vigorously and broadly, this nation, \n     in the final years of the 20th Century, will be witness to \n     the greatest killing spree on American soil since the Civil \n     War.\n       Never mind that:\n       There is no valid evidence capital punishment deters \n     homicides and other violent crimes. Quite the contrary, \n     homicides typically increase in the proximity of where an \n     execution is carried out.\n       In our society, where the criminal justice system is \n     erratic and uncertain, we inevitably will continue to execute \n     some innocents.\n       A grossly disproportionate percentage of those who die at \n     the hands of the state or wait their fate on death row are \n     poor, illiterate, African-American or Hispanic. The homicide \n     rate is highest in those states where executions are most \n     frequent. Texas is the prime example. The death penalty no \n     longer exists in any Western nation except the United States.\n       The public is angry and uptight. People are terrified and \n     intolerant of escalating crime. Many want to rid society \n     permanently of the slavering brutes they perceive as \n     perpetrators of violence. A sizable majority of citizens \n     would give the state virtual carte blanche to exterminate \n     these beasts.\n       But wait. The ``slavering brute'' image embraces only a \n     fraction of those who murder, maim and commit hideous, \n     heinous crimes. Chicago Police Commissioner Matt Rodriguez \n     states that homicides are committed in great numbers by \n     family members, including parents and children, friends, \n     neighbors, and business associates, than by prowling, \n     predatory strangers. And the increasing numbers of random \n     murders by violent, out-of-control youths, especially gang \n     members, occur mainly in their own urban neighborhoods,\n      according to Rodriguez.\n       Slight, bespectacled Susan Smith, the small-town South \n     Carolina mother who rolled her two tiny sons to a watery \n     grave in the family car, hardly fits the bestial profile \n     society embraces so readily. Yet her apparent crime was \n     monstrous and unfathomable.\n       Many, I believe, wish somehow the murderer would have been \n     the black male of her fictional alibi. Then the answer would \n     have been neat and simple; it would have fed inherent \n     prejudice. That the killer, by her own confession, turned out \n     to be the pathetically confused and conscienceless young \n     (white) mother, tortured by the demons of a failed marriage, \n     mounting bills and doomed romance, is much more complicated \n     and challenging to our emotions, attitudes and pat, built-in \n     assumptions.\n       The death penalty is so widely accepted largely because it \n     provides a measure of seeming certainty to a society greatly \n     frustrated by its inability to solve its most vexatious \n     problems. But it is a simplistic answer, akin to the \n     primitive law of the jungle. It is evidence of a society \n     unwilling and incapable of coming to grips rationally with \n     hard challenges.\n       Capital punishment makes a mockery of such noble legal \n     canons as equal justice under law and the bedrock right of \n     all to simple fairness.\n       No matter how atrocious Smith's crime, precedent tells us \n     she almost certainly will not be executed; yet the make-\n     believe black man of her grotesque fairy tale surely would \n     have been found guilty and put to death if her charade had \n     been accepted.\n       Los Angeles prosecutor Gil Garcetti already has announced \n     O.J. Simpson, a rich celebrity and one-time role model, will \n     not be executed if convicted of two murders by a jury. Nor \n     will any murderer of wealth, fame and community standing. \n     This confirms an old Russian proverb: ``No one is hanged who \n     has money in his pocket.''\n       The death penalty is reserved exclusively for society's \n     little people, its powerless, its rabble, its dregs. This \n     alone makes capital punishment wrong in a just society.\n       Since we really execute very few, since the death penalty \n     will never be a prime factor in curbing violent crime, since \n     the nation is faced with many other nagging concerns begging \n     for solutions, it is hardly unreasonable to say that those \n     candidates who collectively spent countless hours and \n     millions of TV dollars trumpeting their passionate support \n     for capital punishment were behaving irresponsibly and short-\n     changing voters.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/31/senate-section/article/S1861-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1861-S1862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH.
