Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on H.R. 1058 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     1058) to reform Federal securities litigation, and for other \n     purposes, having met, after full and free conference, have \n     agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     Houses this report, signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of November 28, 1995.)\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote on the \nconference report to H.R. 1058, the Private Securities Litigation \nReform Act of 1995.\n  This legislation has been 4 years in the making. It is a thoughtful \nand carefully crafted bill. The provisions in the conference report are \nbalanced to make the legal system fairer and better for investors. The \ncurrent system does not protect investors, it exploits them. Now, the \nsystem is not fair to investors and is not fair to American business. \nPlaintiffs' lawyers know that and take advantage. It is time to reform \nthe securities class action litigation from a moneymaking enterprise \nfor lawyers into a better means of recovery for investors.\n  The present system is a feeding frenzy for plaintiffs' lawyers who \nprey on companies with volatile stock prices, eat up the companies' \nprofits with a strike suit and move on to the next victim. Lawyers are \nnow able to file a baseless securities class action lawsuit against a \ncompany, claiming millions of dollars in damages, and coerce huge \nsettlements. About 300 securities class action lawsuits are filed each \nyear. The same lawyers, and in some cases the same plaintiffs, the \nworld's unluckiest investors, show up in these lawsuits time after \ntime.\n  Frequently, the same complaint comes out of a word processor barely \nchanged. In one infamous case, a lawsuit against Philip Morris claimed \nfraud in the ``toy industry.'' In other words, the forms are set, the \nstock price drops, and bang, the suit is filed with the same plaintiffs \nhired--in many cases, the plaintiff owns only 10 shares of stock. We \nhave seen some cases where the same plaintiffs appears in as many as 13 \nlawsuits. They are professional plaintiffs.\n  A drop in a public company's stock price, a failed product \ndevelopment project, or even adverse market conditions that affect \nearnings, can trigger one or more securities fraud lawsuits. Many times \nthe complaint simply alleges that management's predictions about the \ncompany's future did not come true.\n  Once discovery begins, plaintiffs' counsel begins a fishing \nexpedition for evidence. One witness told a securities subcommittee \nthat his company produced 1,500 boxes of documents during discovery in \nthis type of case. The discovery ended up costing the company $1.4 \nmillion.\n  The threat of a protracted securities class action lawsuit is \npowerful. Companies pony up huge settlements rather \n\n[[Page S 17934]]\nthan face the time and expense of a class action lawsuit. The lawyers \ndo not just go after the money in the company's pockets, they also name \nother deep pockets--the company's lawyers, accountants, underwriters \nand directors--as defendants to assure a hefty settlement will be paid \nout. The plaintiffs' lawyers are rarely disappointed. Almost 93 percent \nof the cases settle at an average settlement cost of $8.6 million.\n  In 1994 alone, companies or their insurers paid out $1.4 billion to \nsettle these cases. The so-called victims of the fraud recover pennies \non the dollar and the lawyers pocket the rest. While the lawyer's share \nis taken out, the class members get about 6 cents on the dollar. \nFrequently, the only egregious offense is committed when the company's \nshareholders are forced to pick up the tab.\n  The conference report reforms the system for securities litigation.\n  First, the conference report makes it harder to file frivolous \ncomplaints and sanctions attorneys who do.\n  The conference report stops abusive securities litigation before it \nstarts. It will help to weed out frivolous complaints before companies \nhave to start paying enormous legal bills.\n  The legislation creates a uniform standard for complaints that allege \nsecurities fraud. This standard is already the law in New York. It \nrequires a plaintiff plead facts giving rise to a strong inference of \nthe defendant's fraudulent intent.\n  The conference report also provides a strong disincentive for lawyers \nto file abusive lawsuits. The legislation does not contain a loser pays \nprovision, which would go too far. Instead, the bill requires courts to \nmake findings about whether an attorney filed a frivolous complaint, \nmotion or responsive pleading and to sanction attorneys who do.\n  Second, the conference report makes sure that the victims of \nsecurities fraud bring the lawsuit--not professional plaintiffs.\n  The conference report puts control of the lawsuit into the hands of \nthe victims. Right now, there often is no victim, just a professional \nplaintiff whose name appears in lawsuit after lawsuit.\n  Professional plaintiffs are paid well for their services, usually in \nthe form of a bounty payment. News accounts report that one individual, \na retired lawyer, appeared as lead plaintiff in 300-400 lawsuits. Last \nyear, an Ohio judge refused to permit class certification, noting that \nthe lead defendant had filed 182 class actions in the last 12 years.\n  The conference report discourages the use of professional plaintiffs \nby eliminating bonus payments to name plaintiffs and prohibiting \nreferral fees.\n  The conference report encourages real investors, especially pension \nfunds and other institutional investors, to take control of the \nlawsuit. It provides that the plaintiff with the largest financial \ninterest in the outcome of the case should be the lead plaintiff.\n  Third, the conference report allows companies to talk about the \nfuture of the company without the threat of a lawsuit.\n  The conference report will get more information to shareholders about \nthe future prospects of a company. The conference report codifies \nexisting law to provide a safe harbor to companies that make forward-\nlooking statements accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements.\n  Now, corporate management is afraid to make statements about the \nfuture of the company, knowing that incorrect projections will \ninevitably lead to a lawsuit. One study found that over two-thirds of \nventure capital firms were reluctant to discuss their performance with \nanalysts or the public because of the threat of litigation.\n  The conference report includes a safe harbor that fairly balances the \nneed for a free flow of information to the marketplace and the need for \ninvestor protection.\n  The conference report creates a two-pronged safe harbor. The first \nprong gives safe harbor protection if there is a good enough warning \nabout why the forward-looking statement may not come true.\n\n  The safe harbor does not give a license to lie. The second prong does \nnot give safe harbor protection when forward-looking statements are \nmade with actual knowledge that the statement is false or misleading.\n  The conference report safe harbor does not cover areas where there is \npotential for abuse. For example, the safe harbor does not cover IPO's, \nfinancial statement information, penny stocks or limited partnerships. \nThere is no safe harbor for brokers.\n  The conference report safe harbor is balanced. The conference \ncommittee worked with the SEC to make sure the safe harbor is safe for \ninvestors as well as companies. I would like to include in the Record \nas if read in its entirety, a letter from the SEC to me, dated November \n16, 1995, supporting the safe harbor provision.\n  Fourth, the conference report modifies the system of liability so \nthat deep pocket peripheral defendants cannot be coerced into paying \nmore than their share of the damages.\n  The conference report reduces the coercive effect of unlimited \nliability by making peripheral defendants liable only for the share of \ndamages they caused. Now, all defendants are on the hook for 100 \npercent of the damages--even if they are only responsible for 1 \npercent.\n  In class action lawsuits with hundreds of plaintiffs, the potential \nliability can be staggering. Deep pocket defendants who may only be 1 \npercent liable routinely settle for much more rather than face paying \n100 percent of the damages.\n  The conference report changes that by requiring peripheral defendants \nto pay for only the share of damages they caused under a system of \nproportionate liability.\n  This bill does not leave small investors out in the cold. Small \ninvestors are always compensated for 100 percent of their damages if \nthey have a net worth of $200,000 or less.\n  The conference report does not change the system of liability for \ndefendants who knowingly commit securities violations. Anyone who has \nknowingly committed a securities violation will still be liable for 100 \npercent of the damages. That's fair.\n  Fifth, the conference report improves the settlement process by \ngetting more information to investors about a proposed settlement and \nrestricting the amount attorneys may recover in fees.\n  The conference report enables the plaintiffs to receive a favorable \nsettlement rather that the attorneys. All too often, plaintiffs' \nlawyers take the money and run. The legislation requires counsel to the \nclass to inform investors about the terms of a proposed settlement and \nto be available to answer questions about the settlement.\n  The conference report also restricts the percentage of the recovery \nthat goes to the lawyers. Lawyers fees now sometimes add up to more \nthan 50 percent of the entire settlement. This legislation puts more of \nthe settlement money into the pockets of investors by limiting the \nlawyers portion to a reasonable percentage of the settlement amount.\n  Sixth, the conference report also contains other provisions that make \nthe system for securities litigation reform fairer and better for \ninvestors.\n  The legislation requires auditors to be on the lookout for wrongdoing \nand report any evidence of fraud to the SEC. The conference report also \nreinstates the SEC's authority--which the Supreme Court put into \nquestion in the Central Bank of Denver case--to bring actions against \ndefendants who knowingly aid and abet securities fraud.\n  The bill prohibits document destruction by making it unlawful for a \nparty to destroy documents once a complaint is filed. Finally, the bill \nmakes sure that small investors are always compensated for 100 percent \nof their damages if they have a net worth of $200,000 or less.\n  In summary, the bill will put a stop to abusive securities \nlitigation. It will curtail the use of professional plaintiffs. It will \nempower real investors, especially pension funds and other \ninstitutional investors, to take control of the lawsuit.\n  This legislation is aimed at weeding out frivolous cases by making it \nharder to file factually baseless complaints. It also provides that \neach defendant is liable for only his or her fair share of the damages, \nmaking it more difficult for lawyers to coerce settlements from the \ndeep pocket defendants--that is, the defendant that has some assets or \nmoney. At the same time, it will make accountants report fraud to the \nauthorities. \n\n[[Page S 17935]]\n\n  Finally, this bill creates a safe harbor from private lawsuits about \nforward-looking statements. The legislation will solve the problem of \nabusive securities litigation without preventing investors from \nbringing meritorious lawsuits.\n  I congratulate my Senate colleagues for all the time and effort they \nhave put into this important legislation. I particularly would like to \nthank Senators Dodd and Domenici, who introduced this legislation more \nthan 4 years ago.\n  I thank Senator Gramm, the chairman of the Securities Subcommittee, \nfor his leadership. And I thank the staff who has worked so hard on \nthis bill. Our staff director, Howard Menell; the Banking Committee \nstaff: Laura Unger, Bob Giuffra, Wayne Abernathy, Mitchell Feuer, and \nAndrew Lowenthal; Senator Domenici's staff: Denise Ramonas and Brian \nBenczkowski, and the other key staff members, including Robert \nCresanti, Dave Berson, Peter Hong, and Carol Grunberg, who have been \nindispensable to this process.\n  I also want to thank the SEC, the Security and Exchange Commission, \nits staff, and the judicial conference, and all the others who have \nmade this piece of legislation successful.\n  The conference report is balanced. It hits the bullseye of the \ntarget, curtailing abusive securities litigation, while allowing \ninvestors to bring meritorious lawsuits. Once this bill becomes law, \ninvestors will have a system of redress that serves them and not \nentrepreneurial lawyers.\n  Mr. President, let me take the time now to indicate that on November \n15 I received a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission, \nsigned by Chairman Levitt, and Steve Wallman, a Commissioner. And let \nme ask that I be permitted to read the letter into the Record.\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As we approach the end of the long road \n     traveled on securities litigation reform, you have asked we \n     provide our views of the current draft of the legislation. At \n     the outset, let us express our appreciation for your \n     willingness to heed the concerns of the Commission regarding \n     the draft conference report October 23, 1995. Together we \n     have sought to achieve the most responsible reform possible.\n       While the Commission has raised a number of concerns about \n     earlier versions of this legislation, we believe the draft \n     conference report dated November 9th responds to our \n     principal concerns. We understand the need for a greater flow \n     of useful information to investors in the markets and we \n     share your desire to protect companies and their shareholders \n     from the costs of frivolous litigation.\n       The safe harbor provisions of the draft bill have been of \n     particular interest to us. While we could not support earlier \n     attempts at a safe harbor compromise, the current version \n     represents a workable balance that we can support since it \n     should encourage companies to provide valuable forward-\n     looking information to investors while, at the same time, it \n     limits the opportunity for abuse. The need of legitimate \n     businesses to have a mechanism for early dismissal of \n     frivolous lawsuits argues in favor of codification of the \n     ``bespeaks caution'' doctrine that has developed under the \n     case law. While the trade-off requires that class action \n     attorneys must have well written and carefully researched \n     pleadings at the outset of the lawsuit, we feel this is \n     necessary to create a viable safe harbor, given that it does \n     not prevent Commission enforcement actions, and excludes the \n     greatest opportunities for harm to investors.\n       Outside of the safe harbor provisions, we have consistently \n     advocated reversal of Supreme Court decisions of Lampf and \n     Central Bank. It is unfortunate that Congress has not \n     restored these investor protections that were removed by the \n     Supreme Court; however, we recognize that amendments on both \n     subjects were defeated in the course of this legislative \n     effort, thereby making it difficult to include such \n     provisions in the bill. The conference bill raises other \n     minor issues, but the language in the conference report \n     hopefully will prevent any unintended consequences. We remain \n     grateful to you and your staff, as well as the other members \n     and their staffs, for the willingness to engage in a dialogue \n     with us aimed at getting a better deal for investors.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n\n  Signed Arthur Levitt, chairman.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               U.S. Securities and\n\n\n                                          Exchange Commission,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 15, 1995.\n     Hon.

Wallman,\n                                                     Commissioner.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me conclude by simply saying that \nthis bill may not be the perfect solution and, indeed, there may be \nsome unintended consequences that create problems. This Senator and, I \nknow, Senator Dodd and Senator Domenici and all of my colleagues are \nready to deal with any problems that may come about.\n  But let me say this, too. First, in this bill we go after the \ngreatest abuse that is taking place, which is lawyers who do not \nrepresent the general public but represent themselves. They have for \nhire plaintiffs who are not really aggrieved, who own minimal, in some \ncases as little as 10 shares, of stock. As soon as there is a price \nvariation, these lawyers race to the courthouse so that they can file a \nclaim so they will control the case. There is little regard for the \ncompany, little regard for the real aggrieved investors. We have \nchanged that significantly. No longer will there be permitted \nprofessional plaintiffs.\n  Second, for the first time we say that the court shall look at the \nfacts as they relate to the questions: Is there a pension fund? Is \nthere a large investor involved whose interests should be protected? \nThe court will look at these questions as they relate to the lawyer's \nrepresentation so that we have lawyers, who really represent the \naggrieved investors, controlling the case, not a string of \nprofessional, sharks, sharks for hire.\n  Third, we have made it more difficult to bring suits that are aimed \nat forcing settlements.\n  Fourth, we answer questions which are long overdue. Should we hold \nsomebody responsible for the total loss, if there is a loss, if they \nhave been minor participants and if they have been responsible for 1 or \n2 or 3 or 4 percent of the loss, because they are wealthy or have a \nmember of the board of directors who has deep pockets? Do we want to \nencourage people to participate in corporate governance, or do we want \nto discourage it; do we want to make it impossible for large firms to \ncome in and use their expertise because they are afraid of being sued \nso they say, ``No, I do not want to audit your books; the exposure is \ntoo great''?\n  Do we really want to have a system where people are forced--forced--\nto \n\n[[Page S 17936]]\ngive up and settle a case because if there is even the slightest doubt \nas it relates to liability, they may be facing huge, huge losses. These \ncompanies, therefore, are forced to settle even when they know they \nhave not committed any tortious acts, but the risk of the jury finding \nany evidence in the way of negligence, even a small, minute amount, \nmight jeopardize the company with huge claims?\n  So what you literally have is a group of bandits who force companies \ninto settlements of millions and millions of dollars. Is that fair to \nthose companies? Is that fair to the shareholders? I do not think so. \nWhat we have said in this conference report is, if you are negligent, \nif you have committed a tortious act, you should be held responsible \nfor the percentage of losses due to your tortious act, not that the \nfull consequences of somebody else's actions should fall on you simply \nbecause you are a person who has some money and some resources. That is \nwrong. That is not fair.\n  If you are intentionally defrauding investors? That is a different \nmatter. You will be held. I think this is fair. I think this is \nreasonable.\n  I understand that there are some provisions that some of my \ncolleagues have some differences with, but I think overall we have \nmoved forward in a very conscientious manner in the attempt to have a \nfair and balanced system, so that those who truly have committed \ntortious actions will be held accountable for their actions, and they \nwill not be held accountable for other people's actions, nor will they \nbe forced to make settlements that are indeed unfair. We have \neliminated a terribly unscrupulous practice that I believe is a stain \non the legal profession.\n  I have stood up and I have battled on behalf of litigants and on \nbehalf of the attorneys who represent them, so that they may have a \nlevel playing field. But the law as it exists today is not a level \nplaying field. And there have been and there are a handful who have \nabused the system. We are attempting to deal with those abuses.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for their participation. I certainly \nwant to thank Senator Bennett for his job in terms of working with us. \nI urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the final passage. And I thank \nthe Chair.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, later today the Senate will vote on the \nfinal version of the securities litigation bill which has been brought \nback from conference. Supporters of the bill argue that it is a \nbalanced response to a widespread problem; namely, frivolous securities \nlitigation. What should be clear to all Senators, however, is that this \nbill is not--is not--a balanced response to that problem.\n  This legislation will affect far more than frivolous suits. When the \narguments are made for the legislation, the examples that are always \ncited are examples of frivolous suits. And I do not know of any \ndifference in here, that we ought to find ways to get at those and that \nthose are an abuse of the system. But this bill goes way beyond that. \nThis bill will make it more difficult for investors to bring and \nrecover damages in legitimate fraud actions--legitimate fraud actions.\n  As the editors of Money magazine concluded, this legislation hurts \ninvestors. In fact, the December editorial of Money magazine warns, \n``Now only Clinton can stop Congress from hurting small investors like \nyou.''\n  At every stage of the legislative process, this bill has been amended \nto make it more difficult for investors to bring legitimate suits. As \nit has moved through the process, provisions favorable to investors \nhave been taken out. Balanced provisions in the legislation have been \nmade harmful to investors. Individual investors, local governments and \npension plans all will be hurt by this legislation. All will find it \nmore difficult to bring fraud actions and to recover full damages as a \nresult of the measure now before the Senate. That is why this bill is \nopposed by a broad coalition of regulators, State and local government \nofficials, labor unions, consumer groups and investor organizations, \nand by literally dozens and dozens of editorials in major newspapers \nand magazines across the country.\n  I want to review just some of the areas in which this negative trend \ntook place in the course of the legislative consideration of this \nlegislation.\n  First, the statute of limitations. The process of hurting investors \nbegan in the Banking Committee when it deleted the extension of the \nstatute of limitations. The bill originally introduced by Senators \nDomenici and Dodd, who have had a keen interest in this matter, Senate \nbill 240, that original bill as introduced by them extended the statute \nof limitations for security fraud suits--that is, the period of time \navailable to investors to discover that they have been defrauded and to \nfile a claim. This was in fact the one clearly proinvestor provision in \nthat bill introduced by Senators Domenici and Dodd. It responded to the \nexperts in this area--the Federal and State securities regulators--all \nof whom agree that the current statute of limitations is too short to \nprotect investors.\n  For over 40 years, courts held that the statute of limitations for \nprivate rights of action under section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange \nAct of 1934, the principal antifraud provision of the Federal \nsecurities laws, was the statute of limitations determined by \napplicable State law. While these statutes varied from State to State, \nthey generally afforded securities fraud victims sufficient time to \ndiscover that they had been defrauded and sufficient time to bring \nsuit.\n  In 1991, in the Lampf case, the Supreme Court significantly shortened \nthe period of time in which investors may bring securities fraud \nactions. By a 5-to-4 vote--in other words, a very closely divided \nSupreme Court--the Court held that the applicable statute of \nlimitations is 1 year after the plaintiff knew of the violation and in \nno event more than 3 years after the violation occurred. These time \nperiods are shorter than the statute of limitations for private \nsecurities actions which existed under the law of 31 of the 50 States.\n  Regulators have testified unanimously that this shorter period does \nnot allow individual investors adequate time to discover and pursue \nviolations of securities law. Testifying before the Banking Committee \nin 1991, SEC Chairman Richard Breeden stated, and I quote,\n\n       The timeframes set forth in the [Supreme] Court's decision \n     is unrealistically short and will do undue damage to the \n     ability of private litigants to sue.\n\n  Chairman Breeden pointed out that in many cases, and I quote, \n``events only come to light years after the original distribution of \nsecurities and the cases could well mean that by the time investors \ndiscover they have a case, they are already barred from the \ncourthouse.'' In other words, if the perpetrator of the wrong can \nconceal it long enough under this very shortened statute of \nlimitations, the victim will have no remedy.\n  The FDIC and the States securities regulators joined the SEC in favor \nof overturning the Lampf decision. What happened to this provision that \nwas in the legislation as originally introduced by Senators Domenici \nand Dodd? It disappeared when the Banking Committee met to consider \nthis bill. Despite the fact that all the securities regulators \nrecommended it, despite the fact that Senators Domenici and Dodd had \nincluded it in their original bill, despite the fact that the Banking \nCommittee had approved this provision before in 1991, despite the fact \nthat it was the one clearly proinvestor provision in the bill, the \nprovision was dropped.\n  Let me make clear that the statute of limitations issue has nothing \nto do with frivolous cases. The current statute of limitations keeps \nworthy cases from the courthouse. Both Republican SEC chairmen and \nDemocratic SEC chairmen have told us that the statute of limitations \nimposed by the Supreme Court in 1991 is too short. It allows con \nartists to perpetrate frauds, and it prevents defrauded investors from \nseeking restitution.\n  When the statute of limitations provision disappeared from the bill, \nthe bill moved down the path of being an unbalanced effort. At that \npoint, the bill began to tilt away from individual investors, away from \npension funds and county treasurers, in favor of corporate insiders and \nthe attorneys and accountants who advise them.\n  When the Banking Committee dropped the lengthening of the statute \n\n[[Page S 17937]]\n  of limitations provision, it went beyond deterring frivolous lawsuits \nand began hurting investors.\n  I want to underscore that because that is the basic point that must \nbe understood about this conference report. Again and again it goes \nbeyond deterring frivolous lawsuits and hurts investors.\n  Let me turn now to another example of this proposition, that is, the \naiding and abetting issue. Failure to include the extension of the \nstatute of limitations removed the balance from this bill and tilted it \ntoward corporate wrongdoers. The Banking Committee could have added \nsome balance to the bill by restoring the ability of investors to sue \nthe accountants and attorneys who aid and abet securities fraud. This \nwas recommended by the SEC, the State securities regulators, and \nvarious bar associations. Again, however, the committee hurt investors \nby leaving this key provision out of the bill.\n  Prior to 1994, courts in every circuit in the country had recognized \nthe ability of investors to sue aiders and abettors of securities \nfrauds. Most courts required that an investor show that a securities \nfraud was committed, that the aider and abettor gave substantial \nassistance to the fraud, and that the aider and abettor intended to \ndeceive investors or behaved recklessly toward the fraud. In other \nwords, the investor had to show that the aider and abettor either \nintended to deceive the investors or behaved recklessly toward the \nfraud. Aiding and abetting liability was most often asserted against \nlawyers, accountants, appraisers, and other professionals whose \nassistance is often crucial to perpetrating a fraud.\n  In 1994, in the Central Bank of Denver case, the Supreme Court \neliminated the right of investors to sue aiders and abettors of \nsecurities fraud. Writing for the four dissenters--this was another 5-\nto-4 opinion--Justice Stevens criticized the five-member majority for \n``reach[ing] out to overturn a most considerable body of precedent.'' \nWhile the issue was not directly before the Court, Justice Stevens \nwarned that the decision would also eliminate the SEC's ability to \npursue aiders and abettors of securities fraud; in other words, not \nonly a private cause of action, but the SEC's ability as well.\n\n  One of the lead sponsors of this legislation, Senator Dodd, stated at \na Securities Subcommittee hearing in May 1994, and I quote:\n\n       Aiding and abetting liability has been critically important \n     in deterring individuals from assisting possible fraudulent \n     acts by others.\n\n  Testifying at that hearing, the Chairman of the SEC stressed the \nimportance of restoring aiding and abetting liability for private \ninvestors, and I quote:\n\n       Persons who knowingly or recklessly assist the perpetration \n     of a fraud may be insulated from liability to private parties \n     if they act behind the scenes and do not themselves make \n     statements directly or indirectly that are relied upon by \n     investors. Because this is conduct that should be deterred, \n     Congress should enact legislation to restore aiding and \n     abetting liability in private actions.\n\n  The North American Securities Administrators Association, the \nAssociation of States Securities Regulators, and the Association of the \nBar of the City of New York also endorsed restoration of aiding and \nabetting liability in private actions.\n  This bill, unfortunately, restores only the SEC's ability to go after \naiders and abettors of violations of the securities laws and then only \nin part--only in part. The provision in the bill is limited to \nviolations of section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and to \ndefendants who act knowingly. It ignores the recommendation made by the \nSEC, the States securities regulators and the bar association that \naiding and abetting liability be fully restored for the SEC and private \nlitigants as well. By ignoring the needs of individual investors, the \ncommittee further tilted this bill toward the corporate insiders and \ntheir professional advisers who abuse the investor.\n  The effort in the Banking Committee, which I have alluded to with \nrespect to the statute of limitation and the aiders and abettors \nprovision, which tilted this bill away from the investor, that effort \nwas continued in the conference committee. Consider what happened in \nthe conference committee to the provision that directly addresses the \nfiling of frivolous cases.\n  Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is the principal \nsanction against the filing of frivolous lawsuits in the Federal \ncourts. Rule 11 requires all cases filed in the Federal courts to be \nbased on reasonable legal arguments and supported by facts. That is the \nrequirement of rule 11. The case is to be based on reasonable legal \narguments and supported by facts.\n  As passed by the Senate, this bill required the courts to include \nspecific findings in securities class actions regarding compliance by \nall parties and attorneys with rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure. That is the way the Senate passed it. If a court found the \nviolation of rule 11 by either the plaintiff or the defendant, the \ncourt was required to impose sanctions. That provision was balanced. \nThe sanctions would have applied equally to plaintiffs and to \ndefendants. It was intended as a deterrent to frivolous cases, and it \nmight well have worked in an efficacious manner.\n  What happened to this balanced provision, between plaintiffs and \ndefendants, in conference? The balance was removed so that it now \napplies more harshly to investors than the corporate insiders. The \nSenate bill had contained a presumption that the appropriate sanction \nfor failure of the complaint or the responsive pleading or motion to \ncomply with rule 11 was an award of reasonable attorneys' fees and \nother expenses incurred as a direct result of the violation. That was \nthe presumption: An award of reasonable attorneys' fees and other \nexpenses incurred as a direct result of a violation. That applied, in \nthe bill passed by the Senate, both to the plaintiff and to the \ndefendant.\n  The conference changed this presumption so that it no longer applies \nequally to plaintiffs and defendants. Under the conference provision \nnow before us, if the defendant substantially violates rule 11, he pays \nonly reasonable attorneys' fees and other expenses incurred as a direct \nresult of the violation; namely, the provision that was in the Senate-\npassed bill. But now under the conference-reported measure, if the \nplaintiff substantially violates rule 11, he pays all attorneys' fees \nincurred in the action, not just those resulting from the violation.\n  Disparate treatment. The bill, as sent out of the Senate, had \nbalanced treatment with respect to plaintiffs and defendants. Now we \nhave this disparate treatment, and there is no justification for it. \nIts true purpose, I think, is to scare investors from bringing \nmeritorious fraud suits. When the conference removed the balance from \nthis provision, it was not deterring frivolous lawsuits, it was hurting \ninvestors.\n  The conference further hurt investors by changing the pleading \nstandard provision of the bill. Pleading standard refers to what an \ninvestor must show in order to initiate a securities fraud lawsuit. The \nbill reported by the Senate Banking Committee codified the pleading \nstandard adopted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. \nThis standard says investors who seek to file securities fraud cases \nmust ``specifically allege facts giving rise to a strong inference that \nthe defendant acted with a required state of mind.'' This standard, it \nshould be noted, is more stringent than the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure and is the minority view among the circuit courts. \nNevertheless, that was the standard adopted by the Banking Committee.\n\n  When the bill came to the Senate floor, the Senate adopted an \namendment to this provision offered by the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania, Senator Specter. Senator Specter's amendment codified \ninto the legislation additional second circuit holdings clarifying the \nstandard they had earlier enunciated. These additional holdings state \nthat a plaintiff may meet the pleading standard by alleging facts \nshowing the defendant had motive and opportunity to commit fraud, or \nconstituting strong circumstantial evidence of state of mind. In other \nwords, the second circuit laid down this standard and then had \nsubsequent opinions that elaborated upon it and developed it, and \nSenator Specter said that if you are going to include the second \ncircuit standard as initially enunciated, you should also include the \nfurther holdings by the second circuit clarifying this standard.\n  This, I think, was the one proinvestor amendment adopted on the \nSenate \n\n[[Page S 17938]]\nfloor. What happened to this amendment in conference? It disappeared. \nIt was dropped from the legislation. This is part of this process that \nI have been outlining here of now you see it, now you don't. Of course, \nthe person who bears the brunt of that is the investor.\n  The draft conference report deleted the Specter amendment, leaving \ninvestors without the protection of the additional second circuit \nholdings. Once again, a proinvestor provision that would have provided \nsome balance to the bill was removed.\n  Let me turn briefly to the proportionate liability provisions of the \nbill, which reduce the amount of damages that defrauded investors can \nrecover from people who have participated in committing the fraud. This \nprovision is not targeted at frivolous suits and never has been. It \naffects even legitimate securities fraud suits and, therefore, is \nharmful to all investors. The conference found a way, though, to tilt \nthe legislation even further away from the investor and toward the \ncorporate insider.\n  The legislation changes the rule for liability for securities fraud \nfrom joint and several liability to proportionate liability. Under the \ncurrent rule of joint and several liability, all fraud participants are \nliable for the entire amount of the victim's damages--both fraud \nparticipants who intended to mislead investors and fraud participants \nwhose conduct was reckless. The rationale for this in the law, which \nhas been the traditional holding over the years, is that a fraud cannot \nsucceed without the assistance of each participant, so each wrongdoer \nis held equally liable.\n  Let me just observe that the recklessness standard for liability is a \nvery demanding standard, and it is one usually applied to a company's \nprofessional advisers, such as accountants, attorneys, and \nunderwriters.\n  The bill limits joint and several liability under the Federal \nsecurities law to certain defendants, specifically excluding defendants \nwhose conduct was reckless. The bill, thus, reduces the accountability \nof accountants and attorneys whose conduct is found to be reckless. \nThis change will hurt investors in cases where the principal framer of \nthe fraud is bankrupt, has fled, or otherwise cannot pay investors \ndamages. In those cases, the innocent victims of fraud will be denied \nfull recovery of their damages.\n  Unfortunately, this provision became even worse in conference for the \ninvestors. The bill passed by the Senate did nothing to disturb \nliability under the securities law for reckless conduct. The \nconference, however, added language that could call liability for \nreckless conduct into question. The language of the conference report \ncould be read as inviting the courts to eliminate all liability for \nreckless conduct under the securities fraud provisions. The conference \nfurther added language that could be read as applying the new \nproportionate liability rules not just to suits brought under the \nantifraud provisions of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as \nunder the bill passed by the Senate, but to suits brought under the \nSecurities Act of 1933, as well. So the conference, again, took this \nbill down the path of reducing protections and remedies for investors \nand providing an additional sheltered area for those who practice \ncorporate fraud and abuse. In the areas, then, of the statute of \nlimitations, aiding and abetting liability, rule 11 sanctions, pleading \nstandards, and proportional liability, this legislation before us hurts \nthe investor, and it has been made significantly worse by the actions \nin the conference.\n  Before I conclude the discussion of the substance of the bill, let me \nnow turn to the so-called safe harbor provision, and I underscore ``so-\ncalled.'' This bill creates a statutory exemption from liability for \nforward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are broadly \ndefined in the bill to include both oral and written statements. \nExamples include projections of financial items such as revenues and \nincome for the quarter or for the year, estimates of dividends to be \npaid to shareholders, and statements of future economic performance, \nsuch as sales trends and development of new products. In short, \nforward-looking statements include precisely the type of information \nthat is important to investors deciding whether to purchase a \nparticular stock.\n  The SEC currently has a safe harbor regulation for forward-looking \nstatements that protects specified forward-looking statements that were \nmade in documents filed with the SEC. As originally introduced, the \nbill could have allowed the SEC to continue its effort to conduct a \ncomprehensive review of safe harbor regulations. However, the committee \nabandoned this approach in favor of enacting a statutory safe harbor.\n  I am aware of the letter that the chairman read from the SEC about \nthe safe harbor provision, but I remain concerned that the safe harbor \nprovision before us today will, for the first time, provide protection \nfor fraudulent statements under the Federal securities laws. For the \nfirst time, fraudulent statements will receive protection under the \nFederal securities laws.\n  The American Bar Association wrote the President last week that the \nsafe harbor ``has been transformed not simply into a shelter for the \nreckless, but for the intentional wrongdoer as well.'' Projections by \ncorporate insiders will be protected no matter how unreasonable, no \nmatter how misleading, no matter how fraudulent, if accompanied by \nboilerplate, cautionary language.\n  Let me just take a moment to explain this. It is claimed by its \nsupporters that this draft codified the legal doctrine applied by the \ncourts known as bespeaks caution.\n  Now, as I understand it, all courts that have applied this doctrine \nhave required that projections be accompanied by disclaimers \nspecifically tailored to the projections. The courts have not accepted \nboilerplate disclaimers. They have required that the projections be \naccompanied by disclaimers specifically tailored to the projections. If \ncompanies want to immunize their projections, they must alert investors \nto the specific risks affecting those projections.\n  The bill before the Senate today does not include this requirement of \nspecific cautionary language to alert investors. The Association of the \nBar of the City of New York warned of this provision:\n\n       The proposed statutory language, while superficially \n     appearing to track the concepts and standards of the leading \n     cases in this field, in fact radically departs from them and \n     could immunize artfully packaged and intentional \n     misstatements and omissions of known facts.\n\n  That letter was signed for the bar association by Stephen Friedman, a \nformer SEC Commissioner. Under this bill, fraud artists will be able to \nshield themselves from liability simply by accompanying their \nfraudulent statements with general cautions that actual results may \ndiffer. I predict that this provision will come back to haunt us in the \nyears to come.\n  Because this bill hurts investors, because it makes it harder for \ndefrauded investors to bring suits, because it makes it harder for \ndefrauded investors to recover losses, dozens and dozens of newspapers \naround the country have expressed their opposition. From the Bangor \nDaily News to the Miami Herald, from the Minneapolis Star Tribune to \nthe San Francisco Chronicle, editorial pages have argued this bill is a \nbad deal for investors and urged a Presidential veto. The headline of \nthe Wisconsin State Journal editorial sums up the argument nicely: \n``The Securities Reform Act goes too far.'' I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed at the end of my remarks some sampling of these editorial \ncomments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. A New York Times editorial last week stated:\n\n       The securities bill that Congress is about to pass \n     addresses a nagging problem, frivolous lawsuits by investors \n     against corporations, but in such cavalier fashion that it \n     may end up sheltering some forms of fraud against investors. \n     President Clinton should veto the bill and demand at least \n     two fixes to protect truly defrauded investors.''\n\n  Citing the failure to extend the statute of limitations and to \nrestore aiding and abetting liability, the Times warned that \n``provisions threaten to shut off valid suits'' and suggested that ``a \nwell-targeted veto might force this bill back on the right track.''\n  No publication has editorialized more strongly against this bill than \nMoney magazine. For 4 months in a row, Money magazine has devoted \neditorial columns to this bill. In September 1995, Money magazine \nwarned ``Congress aims at lawyers and ends up shooting \n\n[[Page S 17939]]\nsmall investors in the back.'' In October, they urged ``Let's stop this \nCongress from helping crooks cheat investors like you.'' In November, \nthey were hopeful that ``Your 1,000 letters of protest may stop this \nCongress from jeopardizing investors.'' This month they stated:\n\n       . . . the new bill jeopardizes small investors in several \n     ways. . . . The bill helps executives get away with lying. . \n     . . Investors who sue and lose could be forced to pay the \n     winner's court costs. . . . Even accountants who okay \n     fraudulent books will get protection.\n\n  Investors around the country agree with Money magazine's analysis \nthat this bill hurts investors and are voicing their opposition. The \nNational Council of Individual Investors, an independent membership \norganization of individual investors, has written to the President to \n``express opposition to the recent draft report,'' saying, ``The draft \nconference report fails to treat the American investor fairly.''\n  The labor movement has said, ``This bill tips the scales of justice \nin favor of the companies and at the expense of stockholders and \npension plans.''\n  The Fraternal Order of Police wrote the President urging him ``to \nreject a bill which would make it less risky for white collar criminals \nto steal from police pension funds * * *.''\n  A coalition of consumer groups, including the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, Consumers Union, USPIRG, and Public Citizens also oppose this \nbill.\n  But perhaps most telling about this bill is the opposition of \nhundreds and hundreds of State and local government officials. The \nNational League of Cities, the National Association of Counties, and \nthe Government Finance Officers Association all oppose this \nlegislation.\n  Keep in mind that State and local investors issue securities--State \nand local governments raise money through bond issues. As issuers of \nsecurities, it is asserted by the supporters of this legislation, they \nwould stand to benefit from the bill. Why, then, do they oppose it? \nBecause they also purchase securities as well. They invest taxpayers' \nmoney and retirees' money in securities and sometimes are victimized by \nunscrupulous brokers.\n  Orange County, CA, lost over $2 billion in leveraged derivative \ninvestments. In my own State of Maryland, Charles County lost nearly $3 \nmillion in derivatives. Orange County is currently suing the brokers \nwho sold it these securities. When such scandals occur again, and they \nwill, this bill will make it harder for taxpayers to bring securities \nfraud actions and recover losses.\n  Let me quote further from the letter of these government officials \nwho are seeking meaningful remedies in case they are defrauded:\n\n       The following are the major concerns State and local \n     government have with the latest ``draft conference report'':\n       Despite changes in the safe harbor provision relating to \n     forward-looking statements, there are still loopholes in that \n     provision that would allow false predictions to be made and \n     that will shield a company from liability.\n       Aiders and abettors of fraud would still remain immune from \n     civil liability and would not have to pay back fraud victims \n     for the losses they suffer.\n       The ``draft conference report'' maintains the short three-\n     year statute of limitations that will allow a wrongdoer who \n     can conceal his fraud to be completely let off the hook.\n\n  Eleven State attorneys general wrote to express their opposition. \nThey said, ``If enacted, this legislation would severely curtail our \nefforts to fight securities fraud and to recover damages for our \ncitizens if any of our State or local funds suffer losses due to \nfraud.'' They went on to say, ``This is unwise public policy in light \nof rising securities fraud and substantial losses suffered by States \nand public institutions from high-risk derivatives investments.'' The \nAmerican Bar Association and the Association of the Bar of the City of \nNew York oppose this bill as well.\n  When this measure originally came to the Senate floor, I received a \ncommunication from the securities commissioner of the State of \nMaryland, Robert McDonald. I expect that most Senators received similar \nletters from their State securities commissioners.\n  In that letter, Commissioner McDonald opposed the bill, writing:\n\n       Our financial markets depend not so much on money as on \n     public confidence. The confidence that investors have in the \n     American financial marketplace will be shattered if they \n     believe that they have little recourse against those who have \n     committed securities fraud.\n\n  Now, the managers of this bill in their conference report state at \nthe outset,\n\n       The overriding purpose of our Nation's securities laws is \n     to protect investors and to maintain confidence in the \n     securities markets, so that our national savings, capital \n     formation, and investment may grow for the benefit of all \n     Americans.\n\n  So, they pick up the first part of Commissioner McDonald's statement \nabout ``our financial markets depend not so much on money as on public \nconfidence,'' but the supporters of this bill ignore the second part of \nCommissioner McDonald's warning that the confidence of investors will \nbe shattered ``if they believe they have little recourse against those \nwho have [committed] securities fraud.''\n  The editors of Money magazine wrote, ``this bill will undermine the \npublic's confidence in our financial markets. And without that \nconfidence, this country is nowhere.''\n  By making it harder for investors to bring legitimate securities \nfraud suits, by reducing investors' recoveries when they win securities \nfraud suits, by consistently hurting investors and helping corporate \ninsiders and their accountants and attorneys--in other words, by going \nway beyond anything necessary to deal with the frivolous lawsuits--this \nbill will end up rewarding con artists and punishing America's \nindividual investors, pension funds, and local governments.\n  For all of the reasons I have described, I oppose this legislation \nand I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 30, 1995]\n\n                      Overdrawn Securities Reform\n\n       The securities bill that Congress is about to pass \n     addresses a nagging problem, frivolous lawsuits by investors \n     against corporations, but in such cavalier fashion that it \n     may end up sheltering some forms of fraud against investors. \n     President Clinton should veto the bill and demand at least \n     two fixes to protect truly defrauded investors.\n       The bill seeks with good reason to protect corporate \n     officials who issue honest but unintentionally optimistic \n     predictions of corporate profitability. In some past cases, \n     opportunistic shareholders have waited for a company's stock \n     price to fall, then sued on the grounds that their money-\n     losing investments were based on fraudulent \n     misrepresentations of the company's financial prospects. \n     Their game was to use these ``strike'' suits to threaten \n     companies with explosively expensive litigation in the \n     cynical attempt to win lucrative settlements.\n       Such suits are a real, if infrequent, problem that can \n     discourage responsible management from issuing information \n     that investors ought to know. The bill would stymie these \n     suits in part by immunizing predictions of corporate \n     profitability that are accompanied by descriptions of \n     important factors--like pending government regulatory \n     action--that could cause financial predictions to prove \n     false. But the language is ambiguous, leading critics to \n     charge that it would protect corporate officials who \n     knowingly issue false information. The President should ask \n     Congress for clarification.\n       Some provisions of the bill would protect investors by, for \n     example, requiring accountants to report suspected fraud. But \n     other provisions threaten to shut off valid suits. The bill \n     would prevent private litigants from going after lawyers and \n     accountants for inattention that allows corporate fraud. \n     Worse, the bill limits the authority of the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission to use accountants and others for aiding \n     fraud. The bill would also provide a short statute of \n     limitation that could easily run out before investors \n     discover they have been victimized.\n       Mr. Clinton should demand that Congress extend the statue \n     of limitations so that investors will have time to file suit \n     after they discover fraud. He should also demand that the \n     bill restore the S.E.C.'s full authority to use accountants \n     who contribute to corporate fraud. So far, Mr. Clinton has \n     been curiously restrained. A well-targeted veto might force \n     this bill back on the right track.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                      [From Money, December 1995]\n\n Now Only Clinton Can Stop Congress From Hurting Small Investors Like \n                                  You\n\n                            (By Frank Lalli)\n\n       The debate over Congress' reckless securities litigation \n     reform has come down to this question: Will President Clinton \n     decide to protect investors, or will he give companies a \n     license to defraud shareholders?\n       Late in October, Republican congressional staffers agreed \n     on a so-called compromise version of the misguided House and \n     Senate bills. Unfortunately, the new bill jeopardizes small \n     investors in several ways. Yet it will likely soon be sent to \n     Clinton for his signature. The President should not sign it. \n     He should veto it. Here's why: \n\n[[Page S 17940]]\n\n       The bill helps executives get away with lying. Essentially, \n     lying executives get two escape hatches. The bill protects \n     them if, say, they simply call their phony earnings forecast \n     a forward-looking statement and add some cautionary boiler-\n     plate language. In addition, if they fail to do that and an \n     investor sues, the plaintiffs still have to prove the \n     executives actually knew the statement was untrue when they \n     issued it, an extremely difficult standard of proof. \n     Furthermore, if executives later learn that their original \n     forecast was false, the bill specifically says they have no \n     obligation to retract or correct it.\n       High-tech executives, particularly those in California's \n     Silicon Valley, have lobbied relentlessly for this broad \n     protection. As one congressional source told Money's \n     Washington, D.C. bureau chief Teresa Tritch: ``High-tech \n     execs want immunity from liability when they lie.'' Keep that \n     point in mind the next time your broker calls pitching some \n     high-tech stock based on the corporation's optimistic \n     predictions.\n       Investors who sue and lose could be forced to pay the \n     winner's court costs. The idea is to discourage frivolous \n     lawsuits. But this bill is overkill. For example, if a judge \n     rules that just one of many counts in your complaint was \n     baseless, you could have to pay the defendant firm's entire \n     legal costs. In addition, the judge can require plaintiffs in \n     a class action to put up a bond at any time covering the \n     defendant's legal fees just in case they eventually lose. The \n     result: Legitimate lawsuits will not get filed.\n       Even accountants who okay fraudulent books will get \n     protection. Accounts who are reckless, as opposed to being \n     co-conspirators, would face only limited liability. What's \n     more, new language opens the way for the U.S. Supreme Court \n     to let such practitioners off the hook entirely. If such a \n     lax standard became the law of the land, the accounting \n     profession's fiduciary responsibility to investors and \n     clients alike would be reduced to a sick joke.\n       Moreover, the bill fails to re-establish an investor's \n     right to sue hired guns, such as accountants, lawyers and \n     bankers, who assist dishonest companies. And it neglects to \n     lengthen the tight three-year time limit investors now have \n     to discover a fraud and sue.\n       Knowledgeable sources say the White House is weighing the \n     bill's political consequences, and business interests are \n     pressing him hard to sign it. ``The President wants the good \n     will of Silicon Valley,'' says one source. ``Without \n     California, Clinton is nowhere.''\n       We think the President should focus on a higher concern. \n     Our readers sent more than 1,500 letters in support of our \n     past three editorials denouncing this legislation. As that \n     mail attests, this bill will undermine the public's \n     confidence in our financial markets. And without that \n     confidence, this country is nowhere.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Banger Daily News, Nov. 30, 1995]\n\n                               Do No Harm\n\n       Among the most dramatic but least discussed spin-offs of \n     the Contract With America is securities litigation reform \n     legislation, which earlier this year quietly passed both \n     houses of Congress in different forms, but this week could \n     become part of a public spectacle, highlighted by a \n     presidential veto.\n       House Republicans argued in the contract, which set the \n     tone for the early months of this session, that accumulated \n     legal abuses cost American consumers $300 billion a year. \n     Proponents characterize H.R. 1058 and S. 240, the two bills \n     on which a conference compromise of the Securities Litigation \n     Reform Act is expected to be voted on this week, as antidotes \n     to costly, frivolous lawsuits pursued by greedy lawyers.\n       Opponents believe the critical elements of both bills, but \n     especially as reflected in the conference version, are \n     destructive of consumer interests. In the best Washington \n     hyperbole, they refer to it as ``The Crooks and Swindlers \n     Protection Act'' because of the manner in which it tilts the \n     courtroom in favor of corporate defendants in securities and \n     fraud cases.\n       From the perspective of those who are interested in \n     Congress making good choices in the public interest, the act \n     has two more problems. It is an extremely complex area of \n     policy--one that can cause the eyes of a CPA to glaze over--\n     and it is an extension of the catechism of the contract. \n     Consequently, it is an issue that has been exposed to very \n     little sunlight in open debate and it will be defended as \n     political gospel by some Republicans.\n       Sen. William Cohen voted against the Senate version of the \n     act. Sen. Snowe supported it. As a result, the campaign to \n     persuade the delegation is focused on her office. Critics of \n     the act make excellent arguments against specific provisions, \n     including loser-pays, which will discourage aggrieved small \n     investors from filing suit; and restrictions on legal \n     standards of liability, which limit plaintiffs' opportunities \n     to fully recover legitimate damages.\n       Another example, the provision of the act narrowing the \n     time window for bringing suit, was the target of a letter \n     from Stephen L. Diamond, securities administrator for the \n     state's Bureau of Banking to Sens. Cohen and Snowe. ``A good \n     portion of the several million dollars in restitution we have \n     obtained for Maine citizens during my tenure,'' Diamond wrote \n     in June, ``would have been irretrievably lost if we had been \n     subject to a three-year limitations period.''\n       Diamond pointed out that under Maine law, there ``is no \n     absolute outside limit'' for commencing a suit for securities \n     fraud.\n       The Securities Litigation Reform Act has the potential to \n     save consumers nothing, protect white-collar criminals and \n     add to the burden of the victims of fraud.\n       It could have serious consequences for Maine taxpayers, \n     investors and retirees. On record opposing the House version \n     are municipalities of all sizes, from the small, Clifton and \n     Berwick, to the state's largest, Portland and Lewiston.\n       The CMO (collaterized mortgage obligation) disaster that \n     struck Auburn, concern about the integrity and solvency of \n     government and private pension accounts and 401k plans, and \n     public awareness of the threats to the security of \n     investments of an aging population all are reasons for \n     members of the Maine delegation to treat this issue with \n     utmost respect, and caution: do no harm. This one could hurt.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, Nov. 14, 1995]\n\n                         Liars' Bill of Rights?\n\n       While most of the country is paying attention to the feud \n     over the federal budget, a sinister piece of legislation is \n     making its way through Congress unnoticed. This bill lets \n     companies report false information to investors. That's \n     right, it essentially licenses fraud. It has passed both \n     houses in slightly different forms. A compromise bill will be \n     written soon. If it passes, President Clinton ought to slay \n     it in its tracks.\n       This bill is a story of good intentions. Some companies \n     have been plagued by frivolous lawsuits from investors who \n     aren't happy with the company's performance. The investors \n     allege, in essence, that the company had forecast good \n     results and then didn't deliver. That, say the plaintiffs, \n     constitutes fraud.\n       Well, often it doesn't. Investing has risks, including \n     market downturns. When investors sue over mere bad luck, they \n     cost companies money, clog courts, and drain profits from \n     other investors.\n       Trouble is, by trying to stop this abuse, Congress mistook \n     a simple answer for the right answer. Its solution, in plain \n     terms, was to declare virtually all promises by all companies \n     to be safe from legal challenge. Under this ``remedy,'' \n     company executives now can promise investors anything they \n     like, with not so much as a nod to reality.\n       They can't legally lie about the past, but if their claims \n     are ``forward-looking,'' they can promise you the moon to get \n     you to invest, and no one can sue them later for being \n     misleading.\n       Well, almost no one. The bill would allow legal action in \n     the case of egregious, deliberate fraud, but you'd have to \n     prove that it was intentional. And you'd have just three \n     years to discover the fraud and furnish your proof.\n       It's rare enough to prove outright intent under the best \n     circumstances, but under this bill, if executives can stiff-\n     arm you for just 36 months (not a big challenge), they'd be \n     home free. And then--in another hair-raising provision of the \n     bill--you'd be stuck for the company's entire legal bill. \n     Facing such a risk, no small investor, no matter how badly \n     cheated, would ever dare sue.\n       This bill evidently struck many members of Congress as a \n     simple answer to a nagging problem. It's nothing of the kind. \n     The problem is real enough, but its solution isn't simple. \n     And it certainly doesn't reside in a law authorizing phony \n     statements to investors.\n       President Clinton should veto this blunder. Then, when the \n     fight over the budget is over, Congress can take time to \n     think up a more rational solution to the problem.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 [From the Star Tribune, Nov. 17, 1995]\n\n                            Securities Bill\n\n       Give Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., credit for being a good \n     friend to American investors. Since late October, Bryan has \n     stymied passage of ill-designed legislation that would curb \n     investors' rights to sue for securities fraud, Bryan's move \n     is buying time to marshal enough opposition to give the bill \n     the fate it deserves--either significant alteration or death. \n     What opponents need most, though, is support from the top--\n     President Clinton.\n       At first glance, the legislation appears reasonable. The \n     bill seeks to protect public companies and their underwriters \n     from frivolous lawsuits by disgruntled investors. It would \n     provide legal protection for companies whose earings \n     forecasts turn out to be inaccurate, and would limit the \n     liability of accounting firms, legal advisers and others who \n     fail to detect fraud. The bill also would ban ``professional \n     plaintiffs'' who repeatedly sue companies for even minor \n     losses.\n       Proponents argue that more and more investors are forsaking \n     the win-some-lose-some attitude of investing, opting instead \n     to sue if they lose money because of unexpected events, \n     particularly sudden and steep drops in stock prices. Recent \n     high-profile securities court cases seem to prove their \n     point. From the ongoing Orange County fiasco to Piper \n     Jaffray's stumblings a year ago, many investors, both \n     government and private, have gone to court to recoup losses.\n       However, securities cases gain notoriety mainly because \n     they rarely occur. The number of securities class-action \n     lawsuits nationwide has fallen to 290 in 1994 from 305 in \n     1974. In fact, such cases represented little more than 1 \n     percent of new federal civil cases filed last year. The \n     statistics show that curbing investors' rights to sue amounts \n     to a solution in search of a problem.\n\n[[Page S 17941]]\n\n       Indeed, there would be problems if this legislation passed \n     unaltered. The bill would eliminate the current legal \n     standard of joint-and-several liability, which holds even \n     those peripherally involved in fraud to a high degree of \n     liability. Thus, firms providing accounting and other \n     services to corporate clients would have less incentive to be \n     alert to wrongdoing. In addition, this legislation would have \n     a chilling effect on even many valid complaints; it would \n     require a plaintiff who lost a case to pay the defendant's \n     court costs.\n       The bill's opponents have begun to make a stink. A couple \n     of weeks ago, Minnesota Attorney General Hubert Humphrey III \n     joined 13 other attorneys general in asking Clinton to veto \n     the bill in its current form. A day earlier a coalition \n     representing hundreds of state and local government officials \n     announced its opposition. Consumer groups have fought the \n     legislation all summer.\n       But the opponents need help. Though the Senate passed the \n     bill by a veto-proof margin, a veto threat from Clinton could \n     prompt needed changes in the measure. That threat should come \n     now, while political momentum favors the opposition.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n           [From the San Francisco Chronicle, Nov. 27, 1995]\n\n                       Opening the Door to Fraud\n\n       If a House-Senate conference committee meeting tomorrow \n     does not result in significant changes to legislation \n     regarding investment fraud lawsuits, President Clinton should \n     quickly veto the bill.\n       Compromise has softened some of the anti-consumer aspects \n     of the legislation, which has the stated goal of eliminating \n     frivolous class-action securities fraud lawsuits. But despite \n     the worthwhile aim, the provisions of a draft conference \n     report on H.R. 1058 and S 240 go far beyond curbing trivial \n     court actions and instead would wipe out important \n     protections against hustlers of fraudulent securities.\n       In a letter asking Clinton to veto the bill, San \n     Francisco's chief administrative officer, Bill Lee, noted \n     that the legislation would ``erode investor protections in a \n     number of ways: it fails to restore the liability of aiders \n     and abettors of fraud for their actions; it limits many \n     wrongdoers from providing full compensation to innocent fraud \n     victims, by eroding joint and several liability; it could \n     force fraud victims to pay the full legal fees of large \n     corporate defendants if they lose; it provides a blanket \n     shield from liability for companies that make knowingly \n     fraudulent predictions about an investment's performance and \n     risks; and it would preserve a short, three-year statute of \n     limitations for bringing fraud actions, even if fraud is not \n     discovered until after that time.''\n       Securities fraud lawsuits are the primary means for \n     individuals, local governments and other investors to recover \n     losses from investment fraud--whether that fraud is related \n     to money invested in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, individual \n     retirement accounts, pensions or employee benefit plans.\n       As the draft report stands, investors would be the losers. \n     And their hopes of receiving convictions in suits similar to \n     those against such well-known con men as Michael Milken and \n     Ivan Boseky would be severely hampered.\n       In the name of the little guy, Clinton should not let that \n     happen.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         American Federation of Labor, Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n         Washington, DC, November 29, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: The AFL-CIO opposes the conference agreement \n     on H.R. 1058, the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. \n     The conference agreement significantly weakens the ability of \n     stockholders and pension plans to successfully sue companies \n     which use fraudulent information in forward-looking \n     statements that project economic growth and earnings. There \n     is a new ``safe harbor'' provision in this conference \n     agreement that allows evidence of misleading economic \n     information to be discounted in court if it is accompanied by \n     ``appropriate cautionary language.''\n       The AFL-CIO believes this compromise will vastly increase \n     the difficulties that investors and pension plans would have \n     in recovering economic losses. Similarly, the joint and \n     several liability provisions in this bill provide added, and \n     unwarranted, protection for unscrupulous companies, \n     stockbrokers, accountants and lawyers.\n       In short, this bill tips the scales of justice in favor of \n     the companies and at the expense of stockholders and pension \n     plans. Both of these latter groups are forced to rely \n     exclusively on information provided by these companies when \n     evaluating a stock, but this information would not be able to \n     be used in court to recover economic damages for misleading \n     information.\n       The Congress should reject the conference agreement on H.R. \n     1058.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Peggy Taylor,\n     Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           Securities and Exchange Commission,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Levitt and Commissioner Wallman: On behalf of \n     a coalition of state and local government officials, the \n     above organizations wish to express our concern over your \n     November 15, 1995, letter to Senator Alfonse D'Amato \n     regarding your views on the most recent ``draft conference \n     report'' on securities litigation reform. Our organizations \n     have worked closely with the Commission over the years on \n     numerous issues of importance to the securities markets. \n     Although your letter did not specifically endorse the ``draft \n     conference report,'' proponents of this legislation are \n     already representing your letter as an SEC endorsement. We \n     remain opposed not only to the latest version of the safe \n     harbor provision in the legislation, on which your letter \n     focused, but to several other provisions in the bill which \n     are critical to us and which we understood were critical to \n     you as well.\n       We support efforts to deter frivolous securities lawsuits. \n     We believe, however, that any legislation to accomplish this \n     must also maintain an appropriate balance that ensures the \n     rights of investors to seek recovery against those who engage \n     in fraud in the securities markets. We believe that H.R. \n     1058, S. 240, and the various versions of the ``draft \n     conference report'' all fall short in achieving this balance, \n     and erode the ability of investors to seek recovery in the \n     cases of fraud.\n       The following are the major concerns state and local \n     governments have with the latest ``draft conference report:'' \n     Despite changes in the safe harbor provision relating to \n     forward-looking statements, there are still loopholes in that \n     provision that would allow false predictions to be made and \n     that will shield a company from liability. Deliberately false \n     forward-looking statements are still immunized under this \n     draft as long as they are accompanied by cautionary language.\n       Aiders and abettors of fraud would still remain immune from \n     civil liability and would not have to pay back fraud victims \n     for the losses they suffer. If aiders and abettors are immune \n     from liability, as issuers of debt securities, state and \n     local governments would become the ``deep pockets,'' and as \n     investors they would be limited in their ability to recover \n     losses. In Chairman Levitt's letter of May 25, 1995, to \n     Chairman D'Amato and members of the Senate Banking Committee, \n     he indicated that failure to resolve this issue was one of \n     two ``important issues'' for the Commission. We are \n     disappointed that you have not unequivocally stated that this \n     is still a serious concern to the SEC, as it is to state and \n     local governments.\n       The ``draft conference report'' maintains the short three-\n     year statute of limitations that will allow a wrongdoer who \n     can conceal his fraud to be completely let off the hook. The \n     current statute of limitations is widely regarded as too \n     short. Despite the May 25, 1995, statements to the Senate \n     that this too was an ``important issue'' for the Commission, \n     the most recent draft does not include an extension.\n       The latest draft adds language opening the way for the \n     Supreme Court to eliminate any implied private right of \n     action under the federal securities laws for victims of fraud \n     by imposing a ``rule of construction'' stating that nothing \n     in the legislation ``shall be deemed to create or ratify any \n     implied right of action.'' Given the historic role of private \n     suits in keeping the markets honest, and the SEC's previous \n     support for such actions as a complement to its own \n     enforcement activities, we are surprised that no objection \n     was raised in your letter to the inclusion of this new \n     language.\n       The pleading standard has been changed in the new draft \n     from requiring that the complaint ``specifically allege'' \n     facts giving rise to a state of mind--an already harsh \n     standard--to a ``state with particularity'' standard. This is \n     a much more difficult standard and will make it even more \n     difficult for plaintiffs to bring suit. Combined with the \n     deletion of the Specter amendment, this raises the pleading \n     standard to one different from that employed by the Second \n     Circuit.\n       Under the newest draft, fraud victims face a potential \n     ``loser pays'' sanction and a possible bond requirement at \n     the beginning of a case, which could discourage many \n     investors from seeking a recovery of their losses. In \n     addition, the victim will now have to show that a shift of \n     full attorneys' fees and costs to the plaintiff would impose \n     an ``unreasonable burden'' on the plaintiff or his attorney \n     and that the failure to shift fees would not impose a greater \n     burden on the defendants.\n       The strength and stability of our nation's securities \n     markets depend on investor confidence in the integrity, \n     fairness and efficiency of these markets. To maintain this \n     confidence, investors must have effective remedies against \n     those persons who violate the antifraud provisions of the \n     federal securities laws. In recent years, we have seen how \n     investment losses caused by securities laws violations can \n     adversely affect state and local governments and their \n     taxpayers. Indeed, you, Chairman Levitt have addressed many \n     of our members personally over the past year to underscore \n     just this concern about the markets.\n       Access to full and fair compensation through the civil \n     justice system is an important safeguard for state and local \n     government issuers and investors alike and is a strong \n     deterrent to securities fraud. Because of the importance of \n     this issue, we are requesting a meeting with you to discuss \n     your recent letter to Senator D'Amato and to convey our \n     concerns about the unwise public policy outlined in the \n     ``draft conference report.'' We stand ready to work with you \n     in vigorously opposing this legislation, particularly in \n     light of other efforts--budgetary and statutory--to further \n     weaken the regulatory protections provided to state and local \n     government investors and others. Betsy Dotson of GFOA will \n     follow up on our meeting request with your staff.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n[[Page S 17942]]\n\n                                        Fraternal Order of Police,\n\n\n                                 National Legislative Program,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 29, 1995.\n     Hon.

The recently released \n     draft of the House/Senate conference report clearly reflects \n     a dramatic reduction in the ability of private, institutional \n     and government investors to seek redress when victimized by \n     investor fraud.\n       As a matter of fact, the single most significant result of \n     this legislation would be to create a privileged class of \n     criminals, in that it virtually immunizes lawyers, brokers, \n     accountants and their accomplices from civil liability in \n     cases of securities fraud.\n       This bad end is reached because of several provisions of \n     the legislation: first, it fails to restore the liability of \n     aiders and abettors of fraud for their actions; second, it \n     limits wrongdoers from providing full compensation to victims \n     of fraud by eroding joint and several liability; third, it \n     could force fraud victims to pay the full legal fees of \n     corporate defendants if the defrauded party loses; and, \n     finally, it retains the short three year statute of \n     limitations for bringing fraud actions, even in cases where \n     the fraud is not discovered until after three years has \n     elapsed.\n       Mr. President, our 270,000 members stand with you in your \n     commitment to a war on crime; the men and women of the F.O.P. \n     are the foot soldiers in that war.

The principal effect of this \n     legislation would be to shield wrongdoers from liability for \n     securities fraud committed against an unsuspecting public.\n       Any securities litigation reform must achieve a balance \n     between protecting the rights of defrauded investors and \n     protecting honest companies from unwarranted litigation. \n     Abusive practices should be deterred and sternly sanctioned. \n     However, Congress must keep open the doorway to the American \n     system of civil justice for investors to seek recovery of \n     what has been wrongfully taken from them.\n       If enacted, this legislation would severely curtail our \n     efforts to fight securities fraud and to recover damages for \n     our citizens if any of our state or local funds suffer losses \n     due to fraud. There are several provisions in both bills that \n     would make it exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, for \n     consumers and state and local governments to use the federal \n     courts to recoup losses due to fraud:\n       Broad immunity from liability for fraudulent corporate \n     predictions and projections; Failure to reinstitute liability \n     for ``aiders and abettors'' under private actions, thereby \n     fully immunizing them from any responsibility for their \n     wrongful actions; A ``loser pays'' provision imposing a \n     significant risk of fraud victims having to pay the \n     defendants' full legal fees;\n       Severe restrictions on the joint and several liability of \n     wrongdoers, making it impossible for many victims to fully \n     recover their losses; Preservation of an inadequately short \n     statute of limitations (one year after discovery and three \n     years after the fraud was committed); Highly onerous pleading \n     standards; and Elimination of liability under the federal \n     racketeering statute, except after a criminal conviction.\n       Such extraordinary limitations on our states' ability to \n     recover citizens' tax dollars is of grave concern to us.\n       As our states' chief law enforcement officers, we cannot \n     countenance such a weakening of critical enforcement against \n     white-collar fraud. Private actions, as a complement to \n     government enforcement, have proven to be extremely effective \n     in deterring securities fraud and in compensating injured \n     investors. This longstanding practice has deterred even \n     greater fraud in the markets and has reduced the burdens that \n     would otherwise accrue as a result of the government having \n     to fully police the markets.\n       If investors are limited in their right to initiate private \n     causes of action, we fear that victims will turn more and \n     more to the state enforcement agencies, such as the Attorney \n     General, for solutions. There will be more demands on our \n     offices to pursue wrongdoers for fraud, thus increasing the \n     burden on our taxpayers' resources. The legislation would \n     simply force another unfunded mandate on the states.\n       Effective private enforcement of securities fraud rests on \n     the ability of defrauded investors to take legal action \n     against wrongdoers. Yet there is little, if anything, in the \n     draft conference report that would enhance the ability of \n     defrauded investors to seek redress in the courts, provide \n     enhanced protection for investors or ensure the continued \n     honesty and fairness of our markets. The major provisions of \n     the draft pose significant obstacles to meritorious fraud \n     actions.\n       While H.R. 1058/S240 would achieve its goal of affording a \n     measure of protection to large corporations and accounting, \n     banking and brokerage firms, it goes so far beyond what is \n     necessary for that goal that it would likely result in a \n     dramatic increase in securities fraud as the threat of \n     punishment declines. This would hurt our entire economy as \n     investors lose confidence in the integrity of our financial \n     markets. This is unwise public policy in light of rising \n     securities fraud and substantial losses suffered by states \n     and public institutions from high-risk derivatives \n     investments.\n       As custodians of the tax dollars of our citizens, our \n     states have a vested interest in keeping the securities \n     markets safe and secure for investors. The stakes could not \n     be higher for consumers since it is often their retirement \n     savings that are lost in securities frauds. Moreover, the \n     states' economic health, tied inexorably to the nation's \n     economy, depends on continued investor confidence. There must \n     be appropriate recourse to the courts for all investors.\n       We join the federal and state securities regulators, the \n     state and local government finance officers, mayors and other \n     public officials, labor groups, and all major senior citizen \n     and consumer groups in opposing H.R. 1058/S240.\n       Given the draft conference report released on October 24th, \n     we strongly urge you to veto the legislation if it is \n     presented to you without substantial amendment to the \n     provisions outlined above.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom Udall,\n       Attorney General of New Mexico.\n     Winston Bryant,\n       Attorney General of Arkansas.\n     Robert A. Butterworth,\n       Attorney General of Florida.\n     Tom Miller,\n       Attorney General of Iowa.\n     Hubert H. Humphrey III,\n       Attorney General of Minnesota.\n     Jeremiah J. Nixon,\n       Attorney General of Missouri.\n     Joseph P. Mazurek,\n       Attorney General of Montana.\n     Frankie Sue Del Papa,\n       Attorney General of Nevada.\n     Heidi Heitkamp,\n       Attorney General of North Dakota.\n     Charles Burson,\n       Attorney General of Tennessee.\n     James Doyle,\n       Attorney General of Wisconsin.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Nevada \nwishes to speak. I will not take a great deal of time. I do want to \nrespond, however, while the walls are still ringing with the oratory of \nmy friend from Maryland, to some of the particular points that he made. \nThen I will allow the Senator from Nevada to proceed.\n  I come at this with some background because I have been the CEO of a \ncompany that has been involved in litigation, and I have members of my \nfamily who have been involved in this circumstance. I also am not a \nlawyer and have a little difficulty following the twists and turns of \nthe lawyers talking about the intricacies of rule this or rule that.\n  The overall point that I think has to be made here is simply this. \nThere is no division between companies and investors. Investors own the \ncompany. That which damages the company, damages the owners of the \ncompany, who are the investors. So, when the Senator from Maryland \ntalks about pitting investors against the company, he is talking about \npitting people against themselves. He implies that this bill helps the \ncompany to the detriment of the investors. That, frankly, is \nimpossible. If the company thrives, who gets the money? The investors, \nthe stockholders. If the company survives a market problem and becomes \nstronger as a result, who benefits? The stockholder, the owner of the \ncompany. The two are not separate, in spite of the fact that we have \nhad all of this rhetoric implying that they are.\n  The most significant problem, from my perspective, with this whole \nissue has been the attempt to divide the two and imply that the company \nis doing something to damage the investor and doing it deliberately for \nthe benefit of \n\n[[Page S 17943]]\nthe company. It simply does not wash. It simply does not track.\n  Where have these lawsuits come from? They have come from lawyers who \nhave not sought to protect investors and not sought to help the \ncompany, but to enrich themselves. I will give you one example that \ndemonstrates the power of this circumstance. Let us say we have a \ncompany with 100 shares. Let us keep it very simple. We have a company \nwith 100 shares. We have an investor who owns 1 of those 100 shares. We \nhave another investor who owns 99 of those shares. Keep it very, very \nsimple.\n  The lawyer would rush to court and file a class action suit on behalf \nof the shareholder who owns one share on the grounds that the company \nhas been damaged. And when the shareholder who owns 99 shares shows up \nand says, ``I would like to have a say in how this suit is prosecuted \nbecause it is going to damage my 99 shares,'' under the present law we \nare told, no, the investor with the one share got to the court before \nyou did and he controls the suit and therefore he can make all kinds of \nclaims he wants to in favor of the shareholders.\n  The shareholder who owns 99 percent of the stock says, ``Don't do me \nany favors. Don't stand there and file this suit; it is going to damage \nmy interests and, frankly, damage the interests of the shareholder who \nhas one share as well, proportionately.'' Ah, but it does not matter, \nbecause the shareholder who has one share as well has a side deal with \nthe lawyer and he is a professional plaintiff and the lawyer will pay \nhim for filing the suit so the lawyer will get the settlement. That is \ninevitably what happens.\n  Finally, the company says, ``It is going to cost us $1 million to \nfight this case.''\n\n  ``OK,'' says the lawyer, ``you don't want to spend the $1 million? \nThat is fine with me. Let us settle it out of court for $750,000.''\n  Management says, ``We are not in the business of fighting lawsuits; \nwe are in the business of producing products. Faced with that kind of \nblackmail, we have to do the best thing--for whom? We have to do the \nbest thing for our shareholders. It will damage our shareholders $1 \nmillion to go to court. We can save them $250,000 if we pay this guy \nhis blackmail and send him on his way.''\n  So they pay the $750,000. The lawyer takes his contingency fee, pays \noff his professional plaintiff on the side deal, and walks away saying, \n``I have protected shareholder rights,'' when what he has really done \nis looted the company.\n  What this bill says, what this conference report says, is in a \ncircumstance like that the shareholder with 99 of those 100 shares can \ngo to court and say, ``I am in control of this suit, not the one who \nhas one share, and I move to dismiss.'' And the issue is over.\n  Who is damaged by this bill under that scenario? The lawyer. Not the \nshareholder, not the investors; they are benefited by this bill.\n  One other point I will make and then we can hear from the Senator \nfrom Nevada. This bill says there will be a proportionate liability, \nsaying if someone was involved in a loss that was 3 percent that \nsomeone's fault, that someone is only liable for 3 percent of the \ndamages.\n  Oh, that is terrible, we are told. What a chilling effect that will \nhave. Why, accountants and lawyers supporting the company will be \nimmediately up to their eyeballs in fraud because they know they are \nonly liable for a proportionate amount.\n  That makes for interesting rhetoric on the floor of the Senate. It \nhas little or no relevance to the real world. Let me give an example \nout of my own experience.\n  I was an investor in a company that was trying to develop a \nparticular mining project in the Western States. Unfortunately for me \nand my fellow investors, we did not do very well. For a variety of \nreasons, a variety of problems, we ultimately had to close down the \noperation. In the process of doing that whole activity we engaged the \nservices of a very fine lawyer in Los Angeles, one of the premier \nlawyers of Los Angeles. And he gave us sound legal advice. He helped us \nthrough.\n  A disgruntled supplier working with us on that circumstance kept \ntrying to find some way to drag the lawyer who was helping us into a \nmanagement role. He kept pushing and probing. I could not understand \nwhy. What in the world did he want to get the lawyer involved in the \nmanagement kinds of decisions of this company that did not go anywhere?\n  Finally, the fellow leveled with me. He said, ``If we can get into \nthat lawyer's errors and omissions policy and prove that somehow he was \ninvolved in a management decision we think was a mistake, his insurance \ncompany will pay us a big payoff just to keep it out of court.''\n  The lawyer we were dealing with was careful enough that did not \nhappen. But that was the motivation. Not to try to solve the problem, \nbut to tap into the deep pocket of the insurance company for errors and \nomissions insurance that this lawyer prudently carried for his firm.\n  So they were looking for every possible technicality to get past the \nmanagement of the firm--the firm, being bankrupt, had no money to \noffer--and into the errors and omissions policy and the insurance \npolicy of the lawyer. As I say, fortunately he was not successful. But \nthat kind of attitude is the kind of attitude that causes lawyers to \nsay, ``I will not help you,'' which causes his accountant to say, ``I \nwill not take your account, I will not give you the expert advice you \nwill need because I will get caught up in this.'' And it is to protect \nwho? It is the investors who need the services of that lawyer and who \nneed the services of that accountant that this bill is written as it \nis.\n  So, Mr. President, I intend to come back to this theme often as we go \nthrough this debate. Let us not lose sight of what it is we are trying \nto do here. We are trying to protect the investor, and the investor, by \ndefinition, is the person who owns the company. Anything that damages \nthe company damages the investor. Anything that chills the company's \naccess to sound legal advice and sound accounting counsel damages the \ninvestor. Anything that causes the company to pay blackmail, out-of-\ncourt settlements damages the company, which damages the investor.\n  So let us understand through this whole debate what the conference \nreport does, what the bill does, what the committee approach does is to \nprotect the investor. As we listen to rhetoric, saying let us protect \nthe investor and punish the company, let us always keep that basic \nprinciple in mind: The owner of the company is the investor.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. I reserve to myself such time as I may \nneed at this point.\n  Mr. President, the Senate today is considering the legislation that \nmay well have dramatic consequences for the operations of our \nsecurities markets. America's securities markets are the envy of the \nworld. Our markets are the safest, and they enjoy universal investor \nconfidence.\n  American companies have been able to prosper in large part because of \ntheir ability to raise capital in our financial markets. We should all \nbe proud of these markets, yet, at the same time, we must be extremely \ncareful not to jeopardize this investor confidence.\n  Even though our securities markets are the world's safest, we still \nhave our share of bad apples. There will always be people who feel it \nis necessary to cut corners, or that they can get away with financial \nwrongdoing. We have not seen the last of the Keatings, the Boeskys, the \nMilkens, the Icahns of the 1980's, who penalize the American public by \ntheir commitment to greed and avarice, and with horrendous cost to the \ninvestors, to the public, and to public institutions as a result of \ntheir actions.\n  The legislation we are considering today will make it more difficult, \nin my judgment, to bring legitimate fraud cases and will make it more \ndifficult to recover stolen assets.\n  That having been said, Mr. President, let me be clear that the \nlegislation before us today, although it purports to \n\n[[Page S 17944]]\ndeal with the issue of frivolous lawsuits, is in point of fact a \nsmokescreen, if you will, the Trojan horse, as I have characterized it, \nto really get at the heart and substance of this legislation, which is \nto insulate and immunize perpetrators of fraud from legitimate investor \nrecovery. If this legislation were about frivolous lawsuits, sign me \nup; count me as being on board. There are some provisions that enjoy \nuniversal support. They are incorporated in this bill. Let me mention a \ncouple of them.\n\n  There are included in the provisions a requirement that plaintiffs \ncertify individually in each of these securities actions that the \nactions are brought in good faith, that they are not acting in a \nfrivolous fashion, that, indeed, they are not part of the referral \nprocess, all of which I think make a lot of sense and deal with some of \nthe concerns that have been raised by my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle.\n  There are further provisions that prohibit the payment of referral \nfees to brokers. That, in my judgment, is legitimate and is designed \nspecifically to deal with the issue of potential frivolous lawsuits. \nThe concern is that we should not give stockbrokers, or anyone else, \nincentives for referral of potential securities fraud cases, and, \nindeed, these actions ought to be prohibited and the legislation does \nthat.\n  The legislation also deals with the issue of banning bonus payments \nto class plaintiffs, and I think this, too, deals with the issue of \nfrivolous lawsuits. It requires the lawyer who has an interest in \nsecurities, who brings the action, to have his actions reviewed for \npotential conflict of interest. That, I think, is highly appropriate, \nand it calls for improved settlement notice to class members in terms \nof the proposed terms of the settlement. It contains provisions that \nlimit attorneys fees.\n  In the original version of this bill, as it passed the Senate, it \ndealt with the sanction provisions of rule 11, saying that those \npersons, whether they be attorneys on behalf of plaintiffs or \ndefendants, who take frivolous actions, can, indeed, have the full \nsanction of the law brought against them.\n  And this was done in an even and fair-minded way. That, Mr. \nPresident, in my judgment, deals with the bona fide, legitimate \nquestion of frivolous lawsuits. If that is what this legislation was \nall about, we would not be having this debate on the floor today. I \nconcur and I suspect that all of my colleagues want to work to \neliminate some of the abuses that have occurred in the system. But, Mr. \nPresident, that requires a laser-like action to specifically craft \nlegislation that deals with some of the practices that have been \nabused.\n  The referral fees to brokers, the bonus payments, the potential \nconflicts of interest, the improved notice to class members of the \nterms of a settlement, the limitation of attorney fees and the \nstrengthened sanction provisions of rule 11. That, my friends, is what \nfrivolous lawsuit legislation reform ought to be about. But this goes \nso much further and, in my judgment, is more about protecting \nmisconduct and fraud than it is about frivolous lawsuits.\n  Let me point out first, for those who may not be familiar with what \nis involved in bringing a securities action, let me make a disclosure \nat the outset I have neither been plaintiff, defendant, nor as a lawyer \nhave I represented anyone in a securities action. But this is what is \ninvolved in bringing a securities fraud case.\n  First, a person must prove that he or she actually purchased the \nsecurities. The person must prove that the fraud, the manipulation or \ndeception was in connection with the purchase or sale of a security. \nThe person must prove that a defendant acted with scienter, that is, an \nintent to deceive or a reckless disregard for the truth or the falsity \nof the statement.\n  It needs to be emphasized that negligence, simple ordinary \nnegligence, is not the kind of misconduct that is a predicate for a \nsecurities action. So anyone who makes a statement inadvertently or is \ninvolved in negligent action does not come within the purview of the \nprovisions of the Securities Act of 1934.\n  A person must prove a defendant's misstatement or nondisclosure was \nmaterial, not just incidental, but material. A person must prove that \nhe or she reasonably relied on the defendant's misstatement. A person \nmust prove how he or she was damaged. And, finally, a person must prove \na defendant's conduct caused the damages.\n  Now, those are reasonably difficult things to prove. And they ought \nto be. They ought to be. I do not have any quarrel with that. These \nactions ought not to be taken lightly. Our colleagues point out that \nthere is a great expense involved in defending class actions. I \nacknowledge that. But that is the burden of proof that plaintiffs must \nsubmit themselves to under the current law. And it is a rather \nsubstantial burden of proof, Mr. President. As I have indicated, with \nrespect to frivolous actions this Senator has no sympathy, and the full \nprovisions of rule 11 under the Federal rules, as strengthened by the \nversion passed by the Senate before this bill went into conference, \nappropriately deals in a balanced fashion when there has in fact been a \nfinding that a lawsuit has been filed frivolously by a plaintiff or \nactions by defendants' attorneys are frivolous.\n\n  Let me talk for a moment about what is happening in the market. And I \nwould invite my colleagues' attention to a recent Wall Street Journal \narticle. We are not just talking about some remote contingent fraud \nthat may occur in the marketplace. We are dealing with the reality in \nwhich, as the Wall Street Journal fairly recently pointed out in a May \narticle earlier this year, in a front page story, the title of which is \n``How Career Swindlers Run Rings Around SEC and Prosecutors,'' and the \nsubhead of the story ``White-Collar Crooks Serve Little Jail Time, \nLeave Billions in Fines Unpaid, The Bad Guys Are Winning.''\n  Mr. President, this does not appear in the American Trial Lawyers \nAssociation Journal. This appears in one of the icons of the business \npublications in America, the Wall Street Journal. In effect, there is \nmore investor fraud, not less. And even with the resources available at \nthe SEC, this article concludes that the bad guys, in fact, are \nwinning. I offer this as a somber and hopefully sobering assessment \nthat there is massive fraud out there and that we have not seen the \nlast of the Ivan Boeskys and the Mike Milkens or the Charles Keatings. \nThose are not just some part of a historic record that no longer \nconcerns us in America. There are folks out there every day who, \nthrough whatever artifice and device, continue to perpetrate investor \nfraud. And that ought to suggest to us in this deliberative body that \nwe ought to proceed with some caution as we approach securities \nlitigation reform.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street Journal \narticle of Friday, May 12, 1995, be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Let me just also invite my colleagues' attention, in a \nsimilar vain--here is a similar business publication called Crain's New \nYork Business, the date of which is December 4th through the 10th, \n1995. It cannot be much more contemporary than that. That is this very \nweek. And its headline indicates ``New Scams for a new generation.'' \nThe subhead is, ``Driven by high-tech rip-offs, financial fraud is \nsoaring.'' That, Mr. President, is a publication of this very week, \n``financial fraud is soaring.'' And I again ask unanimous consent that \nthis publication be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 12, 1995]\n\n       How Career Swindlers Run Rings Around SEC and Prosecutors\n\n                        (By John R. Emshwiller)\n\n       Santa Monica, CA.--For more than a quarter century, Ramon \n     D'Onofrio has been playing games with the law--and mostly \n     winning.\n       The 67-year-old Mr. D'Onofrio, operating out of a modest \n     office suite at the airport here, is a master stock swindler. \n     He is responsible for fleecing the public out of tens of \n     millions of dollars in the course of numerous stock \n     manipulations, say officials who have tangled with him in \n     about 20 civil and criminal investigations. A federal appeals \n     court once referred to him as ``ubiquitously criminal.''\n       Mr. D'Onofrio has been convicted of fraud-related crimes \n     five times and is once again under investigation, people \n     familiar with the case say. Yet he hasn't spent a day in \n     prison in the past 20 years--and he served only about a year \n     behind bars before that. His most recent criminal conviction \n     came in 1991; he received probation. While the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission has ``permanently'' enjoined Mr. \n     D'Onofrio from future \n\n[[Page S 17945]]\n     violations of securities laws, it has done so seven different times. \n     Meanwhile, he has left unpaid about $11.5 million in fines \n     and civil judgments.\n\n\n                     Billions in Uncollected Fines\n\n       Mr. D'Onofrio isn't alone. Hundreds of career swindlers, \n     many of whom have infiltrated legitimate industries ranging \n     from securities to health care, are laughing all the way to \n     the bank--with other people's money. ``If you have the \n     aptitude and you're enough of a sociopath, there are few \n     places where the pickings are as easy'' as swindling, says \n     Scott Stapf, investor-education adviser for the North \n     American Securities Administrators Association, a group of \n     state regulators.\n       Data gathered from government agencies show that it takes \n     far longer to bring white-collar criminals to justice than \n     perpetrators of other crimes. Once apprehended and convicted, \n     swindlers generally receive light sentences--frequently \n     nothing more than probation and a fine. Often, as with Mr. \n     D'Onofrio, they aren't compelled to pay back what they have \n     stolen; extraordinarily, about $4.48 billion in uncollected \n     federal criminal fines and restitution payments is currently \n     outstanding.\n       While nobody argues that high-priority battles against \n     drugs and street crime should be neglected, many white-\n     collar-crime investigators contend that the devastating \n     impact of fraud isn't sufficiently appreciated. Rough \n     estimates by government agencies and others indicate that \n     white-collar crime costs Americans more than $100 billion \n     annually. And increasingly, free-lance stock swindlers are \n     joining forces with organized crime, to the benefit of both.\n\n\n                        Victim Committed Suicide\n\n       ``These are people who are stealing millions from working-\n     class Americans. These are people who ruin lives,'' says John \n     Perkins, until recently Missouri securities commissioner. The \n     former regulator still recalls a Thanksgiving Day nearly 20 \n     years ago when a local farmer, after having mortgaged his \n     property and lost the money in an investment swindle, \n     committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. Quinton \n     Darence Cloninger, who was convicted of helping run that \n     swindle, was out of prison after three years--and back in the \n     investment business. He couldn't be located for comment.\n       Over the years, Mr. D'Onofrio and his ilk have benefited \n     richly from the fact that civil authorities don't have much \n     enforcement clout without the backing of the criminal-justice \n     system. Criminal prosecutors, in turn, aren't always \n     interested in white-collar offenses--and may be becoming less \n     so.\n       Consider the SEC civil injunctions that Mr. D'Onofrio and \n     others so often ignore. Violations of such injunctions--which \n     often bar the individual from working in the securities \n     industry--can lead to criminal-contempt charges and jail \n     time. But, SEC officials concede, contempt is a rarely used \n     weapon. Records supplied by the SEC show that only a handful \n     of criminal-contempt cases have been brought in the past five \n     years.\n\n\n                         Reluctant Prosecutors\n\n       For one thing, the agency has to persuade a U.S. attorney's \n     office to prosecute a contempt case. The chances of that \n     happening are usually ``slim to none,'' says one SEC \n     attorney, particularly since criminal-contempt cases usually \n     don't produce long sentences. Many prosecutors are loath to \n     put in time on a case where the potential payoff is small.\n       In 1990, at the SEC's request, the U.S. attorney's office \n     in Salt Lake City did bring a criminal-contempt case against \n     Mr. D'Onofrio. According to a complaint filed in federal \n     court there, Mr. D'Onofrio violated a 1982 court injunction \n     requiring disclosure of his significant stock holdings, an \n     order that resulted from an earlier SEC lawsuit over stock \n     manipulation. Mr. D'Onofrio pleaded guilty, was given \n     probation and continued his career unimpeded.\n       Mr. D'Onofrio declined numerous requests for an interview \n     for this article. ``Some people do talk to the press and some \n     people don't,'' says his attorney, Ira Sorkin, the former \n     head of the SEC's New York regional office. Mr. D'Onofrio \n     ``falls into the latter category,'' adds Mr. Sorkin, who \n     won't talk about his client either. (As an assistant U.S. \n     attorney in New York 20 years ago, Mr. Sorkin helped \n     prosecute a criminal case in which Mr. D'Onofrio was an \n     unindicted co-conspirator.)\n       Contempt isn't the only criminal charge available in \n     swindling cases; frequently, scam artists can be prosecuted \n     criminally under fraud or racketeering laws. But Philip \n     Feigin, a Colorado regulator and current president of the \n     North American Securities Administrators Association, bemoans \n     a ``vicious cycle'' in which securities regulators, \n     investigators and prosecutors often relegate criminal \n     statutes to an ``afterthought.''\n\n\n                          buried by documents\n\n       One reason is that white-collar criminal cases often eat up \n     enormous amounts of time and resources. Stewart Walz, a \n     veteran federal prosecutor and former head of the criminal \n     section of the U.S. attorney's office in Salt Lake City, \n     recalls one complex white-collar case several years ago that \n     required a quarter of his section's attorneys for a five-\n     month trial. Although multiple convictions resulted, Mr. Walz \n     asks: ``How many other cases went unprosecuted?''\n       On average, it takes more than 10 months for a white-collar \n     criminal case to be filed in court from the time it is \n     referred to a federal prosecutor's office, according to \n     national statistics gathered by the Transactional Records \n     Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University in New York. That \n     is nearly three times as long as for the average drug case. \n     Complex, document-laden white-collar cases frequently take \n     years to complete.\n       When prosecutors do bring fraud charges, they often end up \n     disappointed with the sentences that result. The latest \n     federal prison statistics show that the median jail term for \n     fraud is just 12 months; even violators of pornography and \n     prostitution laws receive 33 months behind bars, while drug \n     traffickers are sent away for a median of 60 months. A check \n     of state sentencing statistics in California and Florida, two \n     centers of white-collar crime, also shows large disparities \n     in sentences between fraud and drug trafficking.\n       James Sepulveda, a prosecutor in the district attorney's \n     office of Contra Costa County in Northern California, says he \n     has helped convict hundreds of white-collar criminals during \n     the past 14 years. Some 90% of them, he estimates, received \n     probation: ``The bad guys are winning,'' he says.\n       Such experiences have made prosecutors increasingly \n     reluctant to take on many potentially promising cases. These \n     days, if a case is worth less than $1 million, some big-city \n     prosecutors won't even touch it, experts say.\n       A major factor is the nation's war on drugs, which has been \n     overwhelming prosecutors' offices, courts and prisons. In \n     1985, for instance, only 34% of the federal prison population \n     was serving time for drug-related crimes. Today, the figure \n     is 62%. As recently as the early 1980s, the average federal \n     prosecutor handled about the same number of white-collar and \n     drug cases each year, according to the Syracuse University \n     group. By 1993, that same prosecutor was handling nearly \n     twice as many drug matters as white-collar cases.\n       Of the thousands of white-collar cases filed by the federal \n     prosecutors annually, only several dozen involve alleged \n     securities fraud, according to records of various government \n     agencies. The SEC keeps only what an agency spokesman terms a \n     ``spongy'' count of such cases.\n\n\n                          poor record keeping\n\n       Though Justice Department officials agree that drug cases \n     have been getting more and more attention, they insist that \n     the agency's commitment to prosecuting white-collar cases \n     hasn't diminished. They note that in recent years the \n     department has focused increasingly on particularly complex \n     and time-consuming white-collar cases. While not great in \n     number, these prosecutions tend to have a significant impact, \n     they say.\n       Nonetheless, the scarcity of government record keeping in \n     this area seems to underscore the relatively low priority \n     given to white-collar crime. The Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, for example, annually gathers from more than \n     16,000 local and state law-enforcement agencies detailed \n     statistics on crime ranging from murder to auto theft. That \n     survey doesn't include fraud, for which much less detailed \n     information is assembled. FBI officials say they are working \n     on a new reporting system that will gather more information \n     on white-collar crimes, but they don't expect it to be in \n     place before the end of the decade.\n       For its part, the SEC has established no formal system for \n     identifying or tracking repeat offenders. Nor does it always \n     know their whereabouts. During a recent interview, Thomas \n     Newkirk, an associate director for enforcement, proclaims \n     that Thomas Quinn is safely ensconced in a European jail. But \n     Mr. Quinn, one of the major stock manipulators of the 1980s--\n     who regulators say was responsible for as much as several \n     hundred million dollars in investor losses world-wide--has \n     been out of jail for months and is living on Long Island, \n     N.Y. Mr. Quinn says he isn't involved in the securities \n     business and ``never will be again. I am just trying to get \n     on with my life.''\n       William McLucas, the SEC's enforcement chief, says there \n     ``should be a place in the system'' to deal ``harshly'' with \n     securities-law recidivist, and that the agency does its best \n     to make sure they are brought to justice. But he also notes \n     that the SEC has to regulate thousands of public companies \n     and investment advisers and a vast mutual-fund industry. ``We \n     have a whole lot of market realities we are trying to keep \n     pace with,'' he says. ``So we must make some hard judgments \n     about where to put resources.''\n\n\n                           Cases Move Slowly\n\n       Some of these judgment calls have made life easier for Mr. \n     D'Onofrio. The two most recent SEC lawsuits against him--one \n     filed in Los Angeles federal court in 1993, the other in New \n     York federal court last September--were years in the making \n     and involve alleged stock manipulations that occurred, in \n     some cases, more than a half-decade earlier.\n       Such time lags aren't uncommon, SEC officials say. The \n     continuing criminal investigation, which involves some of the \n     same activities as the two civil cases, also seems to be \n     moving at a glacial pace. Hovhanness ``John'' Freeland, an \n     alleged D'Onofrio confederate in one of the civil cases, \n     pleaded guilty to criminal stock fraud in a related case in \n     New York federal court. He entered that plea more than two \n     years ago but hasn't been sentenced yet. Mr. Freeland, who is \n     back in the business world, declines to be interviewed, and \n     prosecutors won't comment on the criminal case.\n       When charges are brought against Mr. D'Onofrio, he is as \n     likely to quit as to fight. \n\n[[Page S 17946]]\n     Indeed, Mr. D'Onofrio's success with the law has stemmed partly from \n     his willingness to cooperate when caught. This has helped \n     keep his incarceration time to a minimum, even though by the \n     early 1970s he was clearing as much as $1 million annually in \n     stock manipulations, according to one court ruling.\n       In one early instance of cooperation, Mr. D'Onofrio agreed \n     to be the main witness against his former business associate \n     and onetime state-court judge, Joseph Pfingst, in a \n     bankruptcy-fraud case in Brooklyn, N.Y. Mr. D'Onofrio was \n     sentenced to probation after helping get Mr. Pfingst \n     convicted; the former New York judge got a four-month term.\n\n\n                       Making ``A Lot of Money''\n\n       In another case against an alleged co-conspirator, Mr. \n     D'Onofrio testified readily to his own role as a \n     ``manipulator of stocks'' who causes ``the price of the stock \n     to rise by fraudulent means and in the process makes a lot of \n     money,'' according to a federal-court opinion. But Mr. \n     D'Onofrio has always been extremely secretive concerning \n     anything that might interfere with his continuing prosperity. \n     In one case, he was jailed 22 days for contempt rather than \n     discuss his overseas bank accounts.\n       Lately, Mr. D'Onofrio has been dabbling in new business \n     ventures, aided by a 1990 SEC rule change. ``Regulation S'' \n     allows a company to sell stock overseas without going through \n     the time-consuming and expensive disclosure procedures \n     normally required to sell new stock in the U.S. The idea is \n     to give companies a tool for raising capital. Such is the \n     latitude of Regulation S that the SEC doesn't even track \n     which firms do such transactions.\n       Law-enforcement officials say they believe Mr. D'Onofrio \n     and others have been using Regulation S to obtain millions of \n     shares of stock, which they fail to pay for or buy at a deep \n     discount, then resell to the public before the price of the \n     stock crashes.\n       The SEC has voiced concern about possible Regulation S \n     abuses but has done little to curb them. In 1991, the agency \n     did file suit in Washington, D.C., federal court against \n     several defendants in a Regulation S transaction involving a \n     small Tucson, Ariz., company, Work Recovery Inc. The SEC \n     obtained injunctions and disgorgement orders against the \n     defendants, whom the agency charged with failing to pay for \n     1.5 million Work Recovery shares and then illegally selling a \n     substantial number of these shares to U.S. investors.\n       Though one of Mr. D'Onofrio's firms was Work Recovery's \n     investment banker, the SEC didn't name him or the firm in \n     its suit. The agency declines to say why. Work Recovery \n     later sued Mr. D'Onofrio and others in Denver federal \n     court and won a default judgment of nearly $9.5 million in \n     April 1993. It remains unpaid.\n       In a 1992 interview, Work Recovery President Thomas Brandon \n     recalled being impressed by Mr. D'Onofrio's plush office \n     suite, chauffeured limousine and seeming dedication to \n     helping small companies such as his raise capital through \n     Regulation S transactions. Mr. Brandon said the pitch ``was \n     almost evangelical in tone.''\n       Mr. D'Onofrio and his associates recently latched onto \n     another small publicly traded company, Madera International \n     Inc., a Calabasas, Calif., firm with a bizarre past that \n     included plans for an automatic-weapons factory in China. By \n     last year, Madera had a new business--exporting timber from \n     Nicaragua--and a new investment banker, First Capital Network \n     Inc.\n       Mr. D'Onofrio has been operating from First Capital's Santa \n     Monica office. According to several individuals who have done \n     business with the firm, he was involved in financing and \n     stock transactions for First Capital, despite an outstanding \n     court order barring him from ``acting as a promoter, finder, \n     consultant, agent or other person who engages in . . . the \n     issuance or trading of any security.'' Repeated requests for \n     comment from company officials, left by phone and in person \n     at the firm's office, received no response.\n\n\n                         madera stock collapsed\n\n       Madera Chairman Daniel Lezak says of Mr. D'Onofrio that \n     ``it was my impression that he helped run the firm.'' Mr. \n     Lezak says, and SEC filings confirm, that First Capital \n     arranged the transfer of millions of new shares of Madera \n     stock to itself or offshore buyers at no cost or at deep \n     discounts through Regulation S and other transactions. Mr. \n     Lezak says he believes much of that stock was quickly dumped \n     in the U.S., a move he believes contributed to Madera stock's \n     dropping to about 10 cents a share from a high last year of \n     more than $3. Mr. Lezak says he fired First Capital as \n     Madera's investment banker, but says he still sometimes \n     consults with firm officials,\n       Mr. D'Onofrio has had serious heart problems of late, law-\n     enforcement officials say. But he appears to be passing his \n     accumulated knowledge to others, including his 34-year-old \n     son Mark, who for the past several years has been working \n     with his father.\n       Already, the younger Mr. D'Onofrio has been the subject of \n     three SEC injunctions for alleged securities-law violations. \n     He recently pleaded guilty in connection with federal \n     conspiracy and fraud charges filed in Los Angeles federal \n     court as part of the criminal investigation that also \n     involves his father. Mark D'Onofrio remains free pending \n     sentencing, scheduled for later this year. His attorney, Mr. \n     Sorkin, says the son, like the father, doesn't talk to the \n     press.\n       But Mr. Brandon, the Work Recovery executive, recalls a \n     dinner conversation where Mark D'Onofrio talked of how he \n     ``was proud of his father's doggedness'' and wanted ``to \n     follow in his father's footsteps.''\n\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From Crain's New York Business, Dec. 4-10, 1995]\n\n                     New Scams for a New Generation\n\n\n        driven by high-tech rip-offs, financial fraud is soaring\n\n                    (By Judy Temes and Geri Willis)\n\n       John Chilelli believed in two things: technology and radio \n     talk show host Sonny Bloch.\n       Looking for a way off the rough-and-tumble docks of \n     Bayonne, N.J., the longshoreman, 37, plunged nearly half his \n     savings--$22,000--into a high-tech investment in paging \n     systems last fall. His dream was to earn enough to leave his \n     90-hour-a-week job operating a crane to buy a Pizza Hut \n     franchise.\n       ``I figured if Bloch had his own show all these years, and \n     he's telling people to buy this, it's gotta be on the up-and-\n     up,'' explains Mr. Chilelli.\n       But federal authorities say Mr. Bloch lined his own pockets \n     working in collusion with a number of advertisers to hustle \n     ill-advised and fraudulent high-tech investments to loyal \n     listeners, ultimately stealing $21 million.\n       Mr. Bloch says he is innocent of any wrongdoing, but today \n     he sits in jail awaiting trial.\n       The Bloch case is emblematic of how technology has \n     unleashed an unprecedented wave of investment fraud that is \n     ripping off consumers for billions of dollars. Investors are \n     attracted to technology because they have seen the way it has \n     changed their own lives. Many are also searching for the next \n     Microsoft Corp. Instead, they are being lured into phony \n     deals in interactive video, mobile telephones, pager systems \n     and wireless cable.\n       Technology is not only transforming the products sold by \n     these investing hucksters; it is also dramatically changing \n     how they do business. Today's snake oil salesmen are reaching \n     more people than ever by broadcasting their message over the \n     Internet, as well as radio and television. They bounce their \n     offers off satellites and communicate via conference calls, \n     900 numbers and late-night infomercials.\n       Carefully mimicking legitimate providers of investment \n     advice, scam artists have mastered direct mail techniques, \n     lifting new headlines and even stories to make their appeals \n     sound authoritative.\n       Mr. Bloch went one important step further. He co-opted \n     legitimate media, employing 200 radio stations, satellite \n     technology and a telemarketing operation to broaden his \n     reach. Once in investors' living rooms, he studded his \n     show with noted experts. A string of book titles and \n     frequent public appearances cemented his credibility with \n     listeners desperate for a trustworthy, accessible \n     financial adviser.\n       By some estimates, people like Mr. Bloch are costing \n     Americans $100 billion a year. The Securities and Exchange \n     Commission's caseload has climbed 30% in five years, while at \n     the same time, criminal convictions by state regulators have \n     quadrupled. Investment fraud complaints to state and federal \n     agencies are soaring, with 50,000 logged by the Federal Trade \n     Commission in the past three years.\n\n\n          americans face life with fewer financial guarantees\n\n       Behind this rise in financial fraud is a sea change in \n     personal investing patterns. A new generation of Americans is \n     facing life with fewer financial guarantees. Many no longer \n     believe that Social Security will provide for their \n     retirement. Medicare programs are under siege. The number of \n     workers with fully company-funded pensions is dwindling. Home \n     values, once the foundation of a typical family's net worth, \n     are eroding.\n       Facing the prospect of outliving their savings, more people \n     are buying stocks, bonds and mutual funds--one in three \n     American families, compared with only one in 17 in 1980. Each \n     week, these newly minted investors plow some $9.6 billion \n     into mutual funds alone.\n       But most are ill-prepared for this new burden. Lacking \n     investing skills, the postwar generation confronts an array \n     of complex products and is dazzled by thousands of options. \n     For example, there are now twice as many mutual funds--\n     5,600--as there are stocks listed on the New York Stock \n     Exchange.\n       Investors are confused because even legitimate firms can't \n     be entirely trusted. Big brokerages still pay incentives to \n     salesmen to hype products. The media adds to this charged \n     environment by tantalizing investors with the possibility of \n     high returns. ``Quit young and enjoy the rest of your life,'' \n     beguiles a recent Money magazine cover.\n       ``Investors are clearly more vulnerable,'' says Arthur \n     Levitt, chairman of the SEC.\n       At stake is nothing less than the future prospects of \n     millions of investors: their retirement funds, their \n     children's college education money and the resources to care \n     for their aging parents.\n       The longshoreman, Mr. Chilelli, has been forced to put his \n     dreams on hold. ``I feel foolish,'' he says. But, he asks, \n     ``How do you tell what to invest in? Who do you trust?'' \n\n[[Page S 17947]]\n\n\n\n                      technology blinds investors\n\n       Bob Shifman was getting a sick feeling in the pit of his \n     stomach as he listened to a slick promoter pitch wireless \n     cable television to a roomful of retirees last June.\n       Richard Horne described wireless as the cellular telephone \n     of the 1990s, a technological miracle capable of providing \n     better service at lower costs. Why, he asked, would \n     reasonable people invest in an unpredictable stock market or \n     in real estate with such a ``tremendous opportunity'' \n     available?\n       ``This is an excellent place to park your money,'' Mr. \n     Horne concluded.\n       Even as the room erupted into applause, Mr. Shifman thought \n     of the $15,000 in savings he had sunk into the enterprise. \n     The Jersey City retiree had planned to give the money to his \n     two adult children and six grandchildren.\n       Eleven months later, the U.S. Attorney's office filed an \n     indictment charging the operators of the wireless venture, \n     known as Greater Columbia Basin, with defrauding consumers of \n     a total of $21 million.\n       Among those implicated were Sonny Bloch, James Barschow, \n     Joseph Glenski, Bruce Schroeder and Milton Sonneberg. Five \n     others have pleaded guilty to felony charges that they worked \n     with Mr. Bloch, including Steven Wiegner. Mr. Wiegner, who \n     was president of Mr. Bloch's Independent Broadcasters \n     Network, pleaded guilty last week and is cooperating with the \n     government.\n       Mr. Horne, meanwhile, has been named as a defendant in an \n     investor suit against Columbia, but lawyers representing \n     investors have been unable to track him down.\n       Crooks are selling schemes and products with a high-tech \n     spin to a generation that has eagerly watched laptop \n     computers, cellular phones and interactive multimedia change \n     the way people work and play.\n       Con artists use this fascination to lure investors into a \n     variety of ploys that use interactive video, mobile \n     telephones, pager systems and wireless cable. But the \n     smartest ones don't stop there. They pitch Wall Street's own \n     computer-based products and trading techniques--derivatives \n     and arbitrage--to a gullible public eager to emulate the \n     securities industry's savviest traders.\n       ``Technology has the interest of people,'' says Stephen \n     Gurwitz, an attorney at the FTC. ``The schemes follow the \n     headlines.''\n\n\n                   personally endorsed by sonny bloch\n\n       Wireless cable fraud alone costs investors half a billion \n     dollars each year, the FTC estimates. The SEC has filed 21 \n     wireless cases in the past three years. The FTC, which \n     investigates instances of misrepresentation, has filed 14 \n     high-tech cases since 1990, five this year alone.\n       Such a scam cost Ray LaCava $30,000--money he received from \n     a car accident that disabled him for life. Well invested, Mr. \n     LaCava thought, that money could buy his daughter an annuity, \n     or perhaps even set her up in business.\n       A paging license seemed ideal. The Long Island resident had \n     made a successful high-tech investment before; he says he \n     netted half a million dollars a decade earlier on a cellular \n     phone license.\n       ``I knew paging was up and coming,'' recalls Mr. LaCava. \n     ``I was noticing more and more people with beepers.''\n       When salesmen from Manhattan-based Breakthrough \n     Technologies Inc. called last fall, Mr. LaCava was primed to \n     listen. For $7,400 per license, Breakthrough would conduct \n     engineering studies and file an application for Mr. LaCava to \n     ensure him of a prime operating area. The company was \n     personally endorsed by Sonny Bloch, who described \n     Breakthrough President Michael Taylor as his ``good friend.'' \n     Says Mr. LaCava. ``That clinched it for me.''\n       Salesmen from Breakthrough took Mr. LaCava and a dozen \n     other investors to a legitimate conference at the Newark \n     Marriott hotel held by paging equipment manufacturer \n     Motorola, which knew nothing about Breakthrough. A limo \n     ride and dinner were part of the package.\n       Mr. LaCava forked over $22,200 that night in a five-for-\n     three deal, buying licenses in Kansas City, Mo., Louisville, \n     Ky., and three other cities.\n\n\n                     Big fees for useless licenses\n\n       He never received the licenses. Principal Michael \n     McGuinness, using the name Michael Taylor, put off Mr. LaCava \n     for two months, cancelling meetings and blaming the delays on \n     government bureaucrats. Investors finally stopped buying the \n     excuses and reported Breakthrough to postal inspectors last \n     December. Mr. McGuinness pleaded guilty to charges of mail \n     fraud earlier this year.\n       Like Mr. LaCava, many investors have made millions off such \n     new technologies as cellular telephones, heightening interest \n     in high technology. Holding out the promise of similar huge \n     returns, hustlers charge unsophisticated investors as much as \n     $7,500 to file a license application that could be filed with \n     the Federal Communications Commission for as little as $50. \n     They justify the expense by promising engineering, and \n     population studies.\n       Often, the studies are never delivered. When they are \n     delivered, they usually prove worthless. And that's just the \n     beginning of the subterfuge.\n       Investors are often misled about the capability of the \n     technology or simply the location of the licenses that they \n     apply for. Little is said about the heavy responsibilities \n     that accompany the ownership of a license, such as a \n     requirement that owners build transmission towers and \n     stations costing hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n       Investors in Manhattan-based Metropolitan Communications \n     Corp. were told that their specialized mobile-radio licenses \n     would become part of a nationwide wireless telephone network, \n     according to an FTC complaint. For an initial investment of \n     $7,000, investors were allegedly told, they could make as \n     much as $58,000 a year before expenses.\n       In less than two years, roughly 2,500 investors funneled \n     $28 million into the deal. About half of them signed separate \n     agreements to lease their licenses to a manager, expecting \n     the manager in turn to pay them a stream of income that would \n     resemble an annuity.\n       The manager was really a sister company of Metropolitan. \n     Both companies, authorities say, lacked the capital to \n     properly build the towers that would make the system work.\n       The company tired to mislead regulators by building at \n     least 300 temporary towers, according to Danny Goodman, who \n     was appointed by the U.S. District Court to take over the \n     company last year. In each location, the company would \n     broadcast for a day or two, pull down the tower, shove it \n     into a van and move it to the location of the next license, \n     where workers would go through the same motions.\n       ``Metropolitan thought it would fool investors,'' says Mr. \n     Goodman. It did--until the FTC stepped in. The agency filed a \n     complaint against Metropolitan in January 1994 and froze the \n     assets of its central players.\n       Metropolitan principal Sheldon Jackler signed a consent \n     order last year agreeing to cease operations. But he has \n     since decided to fight the government's case and disputes \n     some of the government's claims. His lawyer, Stephen Hill, \n     says Metropolitan had every intention of making the system \n     operable, but its plan was interrupted by the court-imposed \n     receivership.\n\n\n                   Targeting the savings of retirees\n\n       Some investors are so mesmerized by the promise of high-\n     tech products that they even entrust their retirement money \n     to these products.\n       In an elaborate ruse, Jerry Allison and Qualified Pension \n     Investments Inc. of Scottsdale, Ariz., convinced retirees to \n     sign over their entire retirement accounts to the ``IRA \n     approved'' pension administrator.\n       ``There is no such legal statement as `IRA approved,' '' \n     says Kenneth Lench, SEC branch chief, whose Washington office \n     filed a QPI complaint.\n       QPI should have acted as a disinterested third party in \n     administering the accounts. Instead, Mr. Allison's company \n     allowed backers of phony wireless cable operations to mail \n     QPI brochures to prospects alongside their own promotional \n     materials. In return, the Scottsdale company stuffed those \n     retirement accounts full of worthless wireless cable \n     investments. The company took in $270 million of retirement \n     money from 14,500 people nationwide between 1991 and 1994.\n       Mr. Allison faces a trial on the SEC complaint that he \n     misappropriated at least $4.5 million in retirement funds. A \n     subsequent receiver's report shows that as much as $9.5 \n     million may be missing.\n\n\n                    Scam artists imitate Wall Street\n\n       Scam artists also have followed Wall Street into complex \n     financial instruments. Chuckles Kohli of Princeton-based \n     Sigma Inc. said he could make investors returns of 10% a \n     month using derivatives and exchange-traded options to \n     develop lucrative currency arbitrages.\n       ``All the banks are getting rich doing swap derivatives,'' \n     an elderly investor later told authorities. ``I wanted to \n     share in it.''\n       Another individual pumped more than $100,000, just about \n     all of his retirement fund, into a portfolio managed by Mr. \n     Kohli.\n       ``There were these people I knew who were living a lot \n     better than I was, driving nicer cars, without the income I \n     had,'' says the 52-year-old father of three. ``I said, `Oh \n     shoot, I could live like that, too.' ''\n       Mr. Kohli took in about $40 million from investors, \n     according to court documents filed by the Commodity Futures \n     Trading Commission and the U.S. Attorney's office in Newark.\n       He allegedly violated a host of securities rules: He never \n     registered as a commodity pool operator, and he mingled \n     investor dollars. During his four years in business, he never \n     filed a single tax return. And to top it all off, he lost $20 \n     million of investors' money while telling them they were \n     reaping huge returns.\n       He squandered another $5 million on expenses, which \n     included a personal limo driver, go-go dancers and a strip \n     bar.\n       He was indicted for mail fraud and is now in jail awaiting \n     trial.\n\n\n                     The underside of the Internet\n\n       Forget the old boiler rooms were high-pressure swindlers \n     pitched penny stocks and other risky investments. Today's \n     hustlers have jettisoned the phone banks for computers, \n     modems and the Internet to broaden their audience and lower \n     their costs. They're using computer-generated mailing lists, \n     satellite transmissions and radio networks to appeal to \n     millions of potential targets.\n       The new scam artist appears on late-night television and \n     uses desktop technology to produce pitches that mimic those \n     of legitimate personal investing experts.\n       These tools have made financial fraud so easy to perpetrate \n     that one search for cyber-crooks nabbed a 19-year-old hacker \n     peddling an investment in eel farms. His tools: a personal \n     computer and an active imagination. \n\n[[Page S 17948]]\n\n       Nowhere does the possibility for abuse loom larger than on \n     the Internet and on-line services, where investor chat lines \n     burn 24 hours a day with stock tips and ideas.\n       While activists criticize on-line services for their \n     unwitting role as purveyors of pornographic pictures, the \n     real smut is often financial. A recent visit to America \n     Online found these dubious offers:\n       Stop Paying Income Taxes Legally . . . Get a letter from \n     the IRS stating: ``You are not liable for income taxes.'' \n     This is honest, legal and REAL.\n       $250,000 by Christmas or Sooner!!! Call the World's Most \n     Profitable Number.\n       Get out of the DEBT Cycle! . . . Stop putting your banker's \n     kids through school or paying for his new swimming pool!\n       Investors who would be wary of a telemarketer are less \n     suspicious of an electronic pitch--particularly when it is \n     personalized.\n       ``There is a clubby mentality. It's like hanging out at the \n     campfire at Malibu,'' says Mark S. Herr, New Jersey consumer \n     affairs director.\n       A recent SEC case shows how electronic schemers get close \n     to their prospects. The initial hook was an ad on Compuserve, \n     where subscribers were promised ``High Returns for \n     Investors!!'' last July. People who responded to that pitch \n     were mailed an authentic-looking contract describing a \n     $12,000 ``prime bank'' investment.\n       Gene Block, a Durham, N.C., business consultant, gained the \n     trust of investors by chatting with them through e-mail. He \n     promised that their investments would double in just six \n     months and were protected by top bank guarantees, says the \n     SEC in a complaint.\n       But Mr. Block was really a member of an international ring \n     that marketed these phony investments, scoring $1 million for \n     their efforts. So far, the SEC has recovered $250,000 from \n     the bank accounts of the scheme's originator, Renate Haag, \n     who is believed to have fled to her native Germany.\n       But the scheme is noting new. The SEC has 24 other prime \n     bank cases on the books, and more are on the way.\n       ``In the old days, you had the boiler rooms where you had \n     to hire 20 people to make thousands of phone calls to sell \n     fraudulent securities. Now one person can do this by the push \n     of a button,'' says James B. Adelman, former head of \n     enforcement of the SEC's Boston office.\n       Mr. Block faces a trial on the SEC complaint. His attorney, \n     Paul Prew, doesn't deny that his client participated, but \n     says, ``He was used as a pawn by people who knew better or \n     should've known better.''\n       Con artists are combining PC power with other technology. \n     Richard Welch, formerly the operator of a fantasy telephone \n     sex line, drew on his knowledge of 900 numbers to develop a \n     Ponzi scheme in which people were invited to invest in a \n     worldwide lottery service said to be sponsored by North \n     American Indian tribes.\n       The con was a one-two punch that started with telephone and \n     fax solicitations. Early investors in the ruse then used e-\n     mail and computer bulletin boards to recruit others, \n     according to a complaint filed by the SEC.\n       By harnessing the power of these technologies, Mr. Welch \n     and his coconspirators drew in 20,000 people in a four-month \n     period. The agency is still trying to locate Mr. Welch, who \n     has not responded to the complaint.\n\n\n                    Scam artists dialing for dollars\n\n       But crooks don't have to be experienced Net surfers to \n     benefit from technology: Simple PC desktop publishing \n     software allows stock front-runners, for example, to design \n     professional-looking newsletters to push up the prices of the \n     stocks they hold.\n       Others are also using computers to find and track good \n     targets. In one of the fastest-growing telemarketing ploys, \n     ``recovery rooms,'' fraud artists use computers to build \n     lists of people who have already been defrauded so they can \n     be tapped again.\n       According to an FTC complaint, Meridian Capital Management \n     Inc. promised to recover money that victims had lost in \n     telemarketing schemes, sometimes passing itself off as a \n     regulatory agency. For 10% of their original loss, the Las \n     Vegas firm told investors, it would launch a class-action \n     suit, or tap a performance bond said to be posted by the \n     first round of crooks.\n       ``The idea was to entice consumers to send good money after \n     bad,'' says FTC staff attorney James Reilly Dolan.\n       Meridian collected $1.6 million from 800 people, many of \n     them New Yorkers, in just eight months.\n       Acting on a request from the FTC, a court froze Meridian's \n     assets in August, and the company is no longer in business.\n       Mr. Dolan says such pitches are particularly convincing \n     because the swindlers know details about the victims, often \n     including the exact amounts they have lost.\n       Lists of potential targets cost $5 a name for initial \n     leads, but $15 for the names of people who've already been \n     fooled once.\n       Hackers' use of technology is also giving them a leg up in \n     evading their trackers. Once a cyber-huckster gets a hint \n     that someone is on his tail, he can easily move on.\n       ``You cancel your account with your on-line service and \n     vaporize,'' says Richard Lee, assistant regional director in \n     the SEC's New York office.\n       Regulators lack the tools to go after some of the more \n     subtle misrepresentation that occurs on the Internet. \n     Investor bulletin board postings are singed only by names \n     similar to CB handles. Because of the anonymity, people can \n     easily camouflage their identities. A stock touter, for \n     example, can be a broker, a savvy penny-stock promoter or \n     even the president of the company.\n       Mr. Herr, the New Jersey consumer affairs director, \n     concedes that regulators are playing catch-up.\n       ``We are in the embryonic stage,'' he says. ``Right now, \n     the bad guys are ahead of the good guys.''\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. With that background, one might rightly inquire, why \nshould the Congress be considering legislation that makes it more \ndifficult for defrauded investors to bring and win cases? The simple \nanswer is that those who advocate this conference report in its present \nform, in my judgment--and I say this with all due respect--are \nlegislating by anecdote and clearly lawyer bashing.\n  I understand that lawyers are a difficult group to love. I fully \nacknowledge that some of my lawyer friends have been guilty of \nmisconduct and that there are indeed frivolous lawsuits filed. But in \nour effort to focus on frivolous lawsuits, in my judgment, the \nprovisions of this piece of legislation effectively emasculate private \ninvestor protection.\n  During the debate today, we will hear repeatedly how often our high-\ntechnology companies are sued. What we will not hear a lot about is \nsuits brought by one company against another. Mr. President, this \nlegislation does nothing and says nothing about one company's right to \nsue another company. The sole focus of this legislation is lawsuits \nbrought by private investors as part of a class action proceeding.\n  Let me again invoke the Wall Street Journal, if I may. This was an \narticle that appeared in December 1993. Its premise was ``Suits by \nFirms''--that is other companies--``Exceed Those by Individuals.'' Let \nme just read one paragraph, if I may, that I think illustrates the \nthrust of this article.\n\n       Preliminary data in the first-ever study of litigation \n     patterns of Fortune 1000 companies show that businesses' \n     contract disputes with each other constitute the largest \n     single category of lawsuits filed in federal court.\n\n  Let me repeat that because I know that it tends to run counter to the \nprevailing myth about what is actually occurring in the so-called \nlitigation explosion.\n\n       Preliminary data in the first-ever study of litigation \n     patterns of Fortune 1000 companies show that businesses' \n     contract disputes with each other constitute the largest \n     single category of lawsuits filed in federal court.\n\n  I know that is not the accepted view, and it goes contrary to the \nconventional wisdom that is being espoused on the floor that there is \nthis explosion of class action lawsuits. But that is what the Wall \nStreet Journal has to say.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street Journal \narticle to which I have made reference, of Friday, December 3, 1993, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 3, 1993]\n\n               Suits by Firms Exceed Those by Individuals\n\n                           (By Milo Geyelin)\n\n       Businesses may be their own worst enemies when it comes to \n     the so-called litigation explosion.\n       Preliminary data in the first-ever study of litigation \n     patterns of Fortune 1000 companies show that businesses' \n     contract disputes with each other constitute the largest \n     single category of lawsuits filed in federal court. Trailing \n     behind are personal-injury suits and product-liability cases \n     brought by individuals.\n       This result--while limited to federal courts--seems to \n     challenge companies' frequent claims that personal-injury \n     plaintiffs' lawyers are the main engines of litigation in \n     America. And it may force some companies to review their own \n     penchant for using the courts to resolve commercial disputes.\n       The finding is part of an ongoing study by University of \n     Wisconsin sociologist Joel Rogers and RAND Institute for \n     Civil Justice senior researcher Terence Dunworth. Ultimately, \n     by looking at 1,908 companies that have been ranked among the \n     Fortune 1000 from 1971 to 1991, the study will chart federal \n     trends industry by industry and company by company.\n       The results so far, presented in draft form at a symposium \n     at the University of Wisconsin's Institute for Legal Studies \n     two weeks ago, also show that the once-steady annual \n     increases in overall legal filings involving Fortune 1000 \n     companies peaked in 1987 and have declined 21% since then. \n     Similarly, business litigation involving smaller companies \n     and individuals peaked in 1986 and has since dropped 12%. \n\n[[Page S 17949]]\n\n       When cases are broken down by category, the study shows \n     that labor and civil-rights claims have increased in recent \n     years. So have filings involving a single product such as \n     asbestos-related injuries. Otherwise, product-liability suits \n     against Fortune 1000 companies have actually dropped, from a \n     high of 3,500 in 1985 to 1,500 in 1991.\n       ``I know that business doesn't want to hear that, but these \n     data don't seem to lie,'' says Mr. Rogers.\n       The reasons for the various litigation patterns are far \n     from clear, however. For example, says Mr. Rogers, the high \n     incidence of commercial legal disputes among businesses may \n     be the result of their litigiousness or may just reflect the \n     increase in the number of contracts in effect--and thus \n     potentially subject to dispute--in a growing economy.\n       In either event, the results suggest that by pointing the \n     finger at plaintiffs' lawyers, business leaders and advocates \n     of legal reform may be bypassing other contributors to the \n     overburdened civil-justice system, at least in the federal \n     courts.\n       In response to the study's finding, legal-reform advocates \n     voiced skepticism about what the federal-court results may \n     mean. ``The overwhelming majority of product-liability claims \n     are filed in state courts,'' says Victor Schwartz, a lawyer-\n     lobbyist in Washington, D.C., who represents backers of a \n     proposed federal law to rein in some product-liability \n     claims.\n       State courts are generally regarded by plaintiffs' lawyers \n     as friendlier forums for personal-injury and product-\n     liability claims than federal courts, and most suits against \n     local businesses and manufacturers would more likely be \n     filed in local courts. But comprehensive state-court data \n     are nearly impossible to compile. So studies of state \n     systems have been confined to a limited number of courts. \n     Thus, few useful comparisons can be made with the federal \n     numbers.\n       Responds RAND researcher Mr. Dunworth: ``It's better to \n     light a candle than to curse the darkness. Even if that's all \n     you're doing by looking at federal courts, you're further \n     ahead than you were.''\n       Messrs. Rogers and Dunworth relied on a computer database \n     of more than four million federal lawsuits between 1971 and \n     1991 to identify 2.48 million suits that involved at least \n     one business entity. Fortune 1000 companies were involved \n     either as plaintiffs or defendants in 457,358 of those suits, \n     or nearly 20%, according to the study. Not surprisingly, they \n     were defendants in virtually all personal-injury cases (95%) \n     and in most labor and civil-rights cases (85%). In contract \n     disputes, Fortune 1000 companies sued each other as often as \n     they were sued.\n       To get a more detailed look at how Fortune 1000 companies \n     compared with other litigants--such as other businesses, \n     governments and individuals--the study examined 405,908 cases \n     that landed in federal court solely because the parties came \n     from different states, thus creating so-called diversity of \n     jurisdiction. Since 1985, records in such cases have \n     indicated whether either party is a corporation, large or \n     small.\n       According to these records, 43% of the civil lawsuits \n     involving Fortune 1000 companies between 1985 and 1991 were \n     contract disputes. For smaller corporations, the percentage \n     was even higher--51%. Taken together, business disagreements, \n     whether among individuals, companies or corporations, made up \n     nearly half of all federal litigation in this sample. Federal \n     suits over contracts outpaced any other single category of \n     litigation.\n       Yet even these cases are on the decline now. Contract \n     lawsuits peaked at 10,253 in 1987 and dropped 30% to 7,182 in \n     1991. A key reason, corporate legal experts say, is \n     companies' growing willingness to settle disputes through \n     arbitration and mediation. ``When you have businesses suing \n     businesses,'' says Shelby R. Rogers Jr., general counsel for \n     the Texas Medical Association, in Houston, ``you find that \n     getting to the courthouse takes a number of years . . . and \n     as a result we see many more businesses going to different \n     forms of alternative dispute resolution.''\n       But Mr. Rogers, of the Texas Medical Association, says he \n     is yet to be persuaded that federal litigation trends bear \n     any relation to what's happening in jurisdictions such as the \n     Texas state courts, long regarded as among the most pro-\n     plaintiff in the country. And even Mr. Dunworth concedes \n     there's ``a great deal of uncertainty about what's taken \n     place in state courts.'' But he adds: ``if there are \n     significant trends at work (generally), they surely must be \n     evident in federal courts.''\n       Lawyers at big firms nationwide rank Cravath, Swaine & \n     Moore as their toughest competitor, followed by Skadden, \n     Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & \n     Katz. The three New York-based firms are followed by Wilmer, \n     Cutler & Pickering, of Washington, D.C.\n       The survey of about 1,300 large-firm lawyers at 158 firms \n     was conducted by Global Research, an arm of London-based \n     Euromoney Publications PLC, as part of a larger study of law-\n     firm management practices.\n       In addition to leading the overall rankings, Cravath was \n     first choice in three of the 19 subspecialties in which \n     respondents also were asked to nominate blockbuster \n     competitors. The hard-charging Wall Street firm, whose \n     partners have been known to boast that its cafeteria is as \n     crowded at dinner as it is at lunch, was seen as dominating \n     in tax, securities and asset finance.\n       Skadden eclipsed others in mergers and acquisitions, while \n     Wachtell led in banking; the second-ranked firm in both \n     categories was New York-based Shearman & Sterling. Other \n     champions included Fulbright & Jaworski, Houston (arbitration \n     and litigation); Weil, Gotshal & Manges, New York \n     (bankruptcy); Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett, New York \n     (antitrust); O'Melveny & Myers, Los Angeles (corporate); and \n     Sidley & Austin, Chicago (environment).\n\n  (Mr. CAMPBELL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, there are a number of reasons why I oppose \nthis legislation, and I would like to very briefly make reference to \nsome of the primary reasons. My colleague, Senator Sarbanes, indicated \nin a very thoughtful and very comprehensive statement why he was \nopposed, and I share and associate myself with his comments.\n  If this was designed to be balanced legislation, something that \nfairly dealt with the frivolous lawsuit problem in America, and yet at \nthe same time protecting private investors who have been defrauded, I \nthink it would be very easy to craft a piece of legislation.\n  Every regulating body that I know of, from the Securities and \nExchange Commission to the North American Association of Securities \nAdministrators, all have urged upon us to deal with a serious problem \nconcerning an unduly restrictive and shortened statute of limitations. \nThe Lampf case of 1991 shortened the statute of limitations for class \naction suits to 1 year from the point of discovery, a 3-year bar. \nEveryone who is involved in protecting investors from fraud \nacknowledges that this is too short, and, indeed, when we discussed \nchanges in this legislation in 1993, my colleagues on the Banking \nCommittee said, ``Yes, we would be willing to go along with this change \nin the statute of limitations, but it must be done in the broader \ncontext of overall reform.''\n  Mr. President, that is what we are purporting to do today. Disagree \nas I may with the thrust of much of which, in my judgment, undermines \nthe ability of innocent private investors to recover from fraud, this \nis a comprehensive review, but I think it is indicative of the bias \nthat infects this legislation, that this has nothing to do with \nprotecting investors, this purports in no way to be fair and balanced. \nThis is simply designed to immunize perpetrators of wrongdoing from \nlegal responsibility, from their reckless misconduct that has caused \ngreat loss to individual investors, to pension funds, to securities \nportfolios held by cities, counties, States, and universities and \ncolleges in America, because although we have tried, there has been an \nunwillingness, a refusal to right the statute of limitations problem.\n  That has nothing to do with being frivolous--nothing to do with being \nfrivolous. The statute of limitations bar that currently operates \nprevents the most meritorious of cases from being brought if it exceeds \nthe current 1 year from the point of detection, 3 years overall bar. \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has testified that even with the \nenormous resources brought to bear by the Federal Government, all of \nthe investigators, all of the staff, that it takes them more than 2 \nyears to conduct such an investigation before they are prepared to \nbring an action involving investor fraud under the Securities Act. How \nmuch longer does it take a private investor without all of the \nresources available to the Federal Government to, indeed, conduct such \nan investigation and make a determination whether individually or as a \nclass they have been subjected to investor fraud.\n  Aiding and abetting. The great case, and we will say more about this \nlater this afternoon, but the Keating case is one that has become a \nsymbolic case involving the amount of investor fraud by Mr. Keating's \nactions. Ultimately, $262 million was recovered in that case on behalf \nof investors. That is recovered. That means that there has been a \ndetermination that, indeed, investor fraud occurred and that the \nindividuals bringing that action were, indeed, damaged to that extent.\n\n  Seventy percent of the recovery in that case--70 percent--was by \nthose who are aiders and abettors. Mr. Keating himself, having become \nbankrupt, or judgment proof, was unable to respond in damages. That is, \nplaintiffs filing against him could not recover from Mr. Keating \nbecause he did not have any money, and yet there were those who were \ninvolved in this very \n\n[[Page S 17950]]\ncrafty, complicated, extensive, comprehensive and pervasive fraud--\nlawyers, accountants, and others--whose actions substantially \ncontributed to this fraud who would be aiders and abettors who, under \nthis legislation, are now immunized.\n  We sought to restore the provisions of aiding and abetting, having \nnothing to do, Mr. President, with a frivolous lawsuit. We are talking \nabout individuals who have been determined to have been guilty of \nreckless misconduct that caused damage to private investors; they are \nnow going to be immunized from this liability. That has nothing to do \nwith the frivolous action, the proportionate liability that Senator \nSarbanes talked about extensively.\n  Again, the whole theory of our system of American jurisprudence is \none of balancing the scales of justice. On one hand, we are talking \nabout individuals who are totally innocent. All they did was to respond \nto an entreaty or a sales approach to buy securities, subsequently \nfinding themselves defrauded as a result of the purchase of those \nsecurities, and, subsequently, it is determined that individuals who \nare reckless in their actions--ordinary negligence, there is no \nliability for ordinary negligence. So those simple mistakes, mishaps \nthat all of us are aware of in life, we are not talking about that kind \nof conduct. We are talking about reckless misconduct.\n  We are now saying that in terms of balancing, who should accept the \nbenefit, who should bear the burden, we are now saying, Mr. President, \nthat those individuals who are guilty of reckless misconduct, that \ntheir liability is limited only to the proportion that the court finds \nthem to be responsible.\n  The practical consequences of that, as in the Keating case, for \nexample, where you have the primary perpetrator bankrupt, is that the \ninnocent investor is unable to secure full recovery, because what we \nare talking about in this legislation is to limit that liability to the \nproportionate amount.\n  So if the determination is made that there is only a 20-percent \nliability or fault found with respect to the reckless defendant and \nthat the 80-percent liability under this hypothetical would be the \nprimary defender and the primary defender is bankrupt, that is it. That \nis it, even though it is the conduct of the reckless defendant that \ncontributed to the loss. That, Mr. President, has absolutely nothing to \ndo with a frivolous lawsuit. That is a value judgment as to who ought \nto be protected: the innocent investor or the individual whose reckless \nconduct contributed to the loss.\n  For eons of time under the common law, in those situations the public \npolicy has always been weighing these scales of justice that the burden \nought to fall on the individual whose reckless conduct contributed to \nthe loss rather than to have that burden borne by the innocent investor \nwho was not responsible in any way at all. Again, this has nothing, \nabsolutely nothing, to do with a frivolous lawsuit.\n\n  Rule 11 is the provision under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nthat is available to sanction lawyers who bring frivolous lawsuits. I \nbelieve that the proponents of this legislation, in the Senate version, \nhit it right on the mark. Whether one is a plaintiff's lawyer or a \ndefendant's lawyer, if that lawyer is involved in frivolous action, the \nfull sanction of the law ought to attach, and that lawyer ought to pay \nthe cost as a result of undertaking that frivolous action. I have no \nquarrel with that at all. That is the way it was when it left the \nSenate, Mr. President. But what has occurred is part of this ongoing \nand skewing process, having nothing to do with frivolous lawsuits. \nEverything is weighted in this legislation toward protecting those who \nperpetrate fraud and those attorneys who represent them, because now \nthe full force of the sanction only applies to plaintiffs' lawyers. \nDefendants' lawyers who are guilty of frivolous actions are not \nsubjected to the same standard. It has been pointed out by Senator \nSarbanes that the pleading requirements are more difficult. That, too, \nhas nothing to do with frivolous lawsuits.\n  Finally, although it is a bit arcane, are the so-called safe harbor \nprovisions. I want to comment for a moment on safe harbor. Prior to \n1979, one could not make what is called a forward-looking statement--\nthat is, predictive conduct about the security because such and such is \ngoing to happen next week, next month, or next year. The reason why \nthat is the rule is that because those kinds of future predictions have \nbeen the subject, historically, of overstatements, making it very easy \nto mislead people by false encouragement: ``Buy this stock and you are \ngoing to be a big-time winner''--that type of thing.\n  In 1979, for the first time, they permitted forward-looking \nstatements. I do not come to the floor as a Member of this institution \nas an expert in securities law. Whether that was a good provision in \nthe law, I do not know. But in doing so, the SEC did recognize that \nthere was great risk and great danger because those people who sell and \noffer these securities oftentimes get carried away and make such \noptimistic and rosy predictions that people are misled. And so the \nstandard that was employed was that you could make these forward-\nlooking statements and you were protected from liability if your \nstatements were made, first, in good faith and, second, with a \nreasonable basis.\n  As I say, I am not an expert in this area, but that strikes me as \nbeing a pretty reasonable standard. There is no liability, even though \nthe statements may be inaccurate or misleading, if they were made in \ngood faith and with a reasonable basis.\n  Now, Mr. President, as a result of the action taken by the \nconference, even statements that are false, totally false--we are not \ntalking about misleading or inaccurate; we are talking about totally \nfalse statements--are protected. That is, those who offer those \nstatements now enjoy no liability if they simply add cautionary \nlanguage. ``Yes, this stock is going to triple, but there may be a \ncontingency out there in the future that if the economy goes sideways \non us, that may not happen.'' Just cautionary language. That is pretty \noutrageous, in my view, once again, this having nothing to do, in my \nview, with frivolous lawsuits but having everything to do with \nprotecting those individuals who make statements that turn out to \nbe inaccurate and misleading and immunizing them from liability.\n\n  Now, our securities investor protection system in America is really \npredicated on three individual pillars--two of them governmental, one \nin the private sector. Clearly, the Securities and Exchange Commission \nat the Federal level has the ability to assist in protecting the \nmarketplace from fraud and to provide the measure of investor \nconfidence that has characterized the American securities market. Many \nof my colleagues who have had State experience know that each of the \nStates have securities offices which also serve as an adjunct to \nprotect the public from investor fraud. But recognized as being \nextremely important in policing the market and providing for that \ninvestor confidence that characterizes and distinguishes the American \nsecurities market as no other securities market in the world is the \nability of private investors, through class actions, to bring cases \nthemselves. The SEC fully acknowledges that, and so it is that \nprotection which is being undermined by this legislation.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office, which is invoked with a \nlevel of respect and devotion that I have not seen in my previous 6\\1/\n2\\ years here in this institution, has estimated that as a result of \nwhat this piece of legislation does in terms of preventing access by \nprivate investors who are victimized by fraud, it would require another \n$25 to $50 million a year in addition to the existing budget of the SEC \nto offset that loss. That is, it is recognized under the current system \nthat the SEC cannot adequately police the securities market, and its \nphilosophical predicate is that the private investor, through the class \naction mechanism, is a very important function. We now, in my judgment, \nrender that private class of action much less viable in protecting the \nmarketplace. Some 11 attorneys general have complained about these \nchanges and have characterized this as an unfunded mandate.\n  We hear repeatedly, and we will hear during the course of the day, \nthat this legislation is absolutely necessary because the mainspring of \nthe private enterprise system that all of us respect and acknowledge as \nhaving created the highest standard of living for us in America, or \nanyplace in the world, is \n\n[[Page S 17951]]\nthat as a result of these lawsuits, private investor actions, the \nsecurities market has been limited in terms of the ability of the \nentrepreneur, the startup company, to generate the kind of capital \nneeded to bring new products and services into the marketplace. We will \nhear that ad nauseam.\n  Here are the facts. The Dow Jones industrial average recently \nexceeded the 5,000 mark. In 1995, we have seen the Dow Jones rise \nhigher in 1 year than at any previous year in its history. Initial \npublic offerings--that is, the mechanism used to generate this capital \nby new companies and other companies who are wishing to develop a new \nproduct or service--have risen by 9,000 percent in the last 20 years. \nThe capital raised as a consequence of those new offerings has \nincreased by 58,000 percent. That is good news for Americans. I am \npleased to hear it. I think all of my colleagues should be. But it does \nnot make the argument that the proponents of this bill assert that this \nlegislation--to immunize this whole category of malefactors--is \nnecessary in order that businesses can generate the kind of capital \nneeded to bring new products into the marketplace.\n  We will also hear that investors invariably sue every time the stock \ndrops to any degree, regardless of their reasons. Let me again make the \npoint, Mr. President, that the evidence simply does not support this.\n  In fact, the University of California study of 589 stocks that \ndropped more than 20 percent in 5 days showed that only 3 percent were \nsued by investors. This is a far cry from the perception that \nproponents of this legislation will try to paint.\n  We will also hear investor suits are filed just to get a quick \nsettlement. Here again, the evidence is to the contrary. The SEC \ntestified that surveys show most judges in these cases believe \nfrivolous litigation is not a major problem and could be dealt with \nadequately through prompt dismissals.\n  We have also heard there has been an explosion of these class \nactions. Mr. President, that is simply not true. Of all of the civil \nactions brought in the Federal court system--all of them, from soup to \nnuts, all of them--about 0.1 percent involve class action security \ncases--0.12 percent is the precise number.\n  If you look at a table over the last 20 years from 1974 to 1993, you \nwill see that the number of cases filed have remained essentially the \nsame. This is a document prepared by the Office of the U.S. Courts, \nindicating that about 270, 260 are actions filed a year--no change--\neven though in the past 20 years the population in America has grown \nsubstantially.\n  Of the 14,000 companies listed on the exchange, about 120 each year \nfind themselves being sued; about 120.\n  I think we just need to put that in perspective as we go through \nlegislation here that radically changes the system that has worked \nessentially well for us in America, admittedly requiring the fine \ntuning I alluded to in those provisions that, in my opinion, deal \nlegitimately with the frivolous lawsuits.\n  This is a meat ax approach. Make no mistake, its purpose is not to \nprotect against frivolous lawsuits. It is to limit liability or to \ninsulate liability from a whole category of persons whose conduct \ncaused the investor loss.\n  The conference report would preclude many consumer institutions and \nState and local governments from recovering their losses in Federal \ncourts when they are defrauded in the financial market.\n  The conference report takes the worst features of the Senate bill and \ncombines them with many of the most dangerous provisions in the House \nversion.\n  This legislation will harm consumers, consumers who have savings in \nretirement funds, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or other investments. In \nfact, it will harm taxpayers who depend on the financial stability of \ntheir State and local governments in places like Orange County, as an \nexample.\n  That is why, notwithstanding the efforts of the proponents of this \nbill to portray this--if you are for starting entrepreneurial \ncompanies, if you are for eliminating frivolous lawsuits in the \nmarketplace, you should support this legislation; if you want to help \nthe trial lawyers, you should be opposed to it. That is not what this \nis all about.\n  That is why the National Association of State Financial Officers--\nthose would be the State treasurers, comptrollers, however the State \nfinancial portfolio is managed--the national association of these \ngroups has expressed its strong opposition. So, too, has the National \nAssociation of County Treasurers and Financial Officers. The national \nassociation that deals with municipal financial officers and the \nnational association that deals with the portfolios and securities \nmanaged by America's universities and colleges also oppose this \nlegislation.\n  Also, the National Council of Senior Citizens, the National League of \nCities, the National Association of Counties--I will not belabor the \nrecord with all of these--the Fraternal Order of Police, all have \nexpressed their strong opposition, and for the same reason that I have \nalluded to, because it is far, far beyond what is needed to address the \nlegitimate concern of frivolous lawsuits as it relates to securities \nactions.\n  I know there are a number of my colleagues who need to speak. I will \njust be very brief. Let me say I will comment in more detail. Some of \nyou who voted for this legislation when it passed the Senate--some said \non the floor and to a number of us, ``Look, if this thing moves in the \nwrong direction in conference, I will reconsider my position.'' To \nthose of my colleagues who voted albeit somewhat reluctantly for this \nlegislation when it passed the Senate, let me say that it is materially \nworse now than it was as it left the floor of the Senate.\n  With respect to the provisions dealing with the safe harbor \nprovisions, the pleading requirements, the balance of equity and \nfairness of rule 11, the proportionate liability provisions have been \nmade much more onerous. All of these provisions, including the RICO \nprovisions which, as the bill left the Senate, concluded that, if any \nindividual were convicted of a RICO fraud, then all that were involved \nwould be subject to RICO sanctions in terms of the measure of damages \nthat can be recovered--that has been greatly eliminated.\n  Perhaps even more perniciously, the provision that left the Senate \ndealt with the Securities Act of 1934. Now we have brought in the \nSecurities Act of 1933 which deals with a whole different category of \nactions and we have applied many if not all of the provisions of that. \nI invite my colleagues' attention to that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I will allow my colleagues to proceed, \nbut I did want to respond briefly to some of the comments made by the \nSenator from Nevada, having been on the floor through his entire \nstatement. I think there are a few points we need to make and then I \nwill sit down and let my colleague proceed.\n\n  As I took notes from the comments of the Senator from Nevada, his \nfirst point listed how difficult it is to prove fraud. He gave us seven \nthings he said are hard to prove. I agree with him completely. These \nare hard to prove. They are also very easy to allege and an alleging of \nthese things is what leads to the settlements out of court that are the \nproblem for many of the companies we are dealing with.\n  Second, he quotes from the Wall Street Journal. He quotes from \nCrain's, saying fraud is soaring; the Wall Street Journal headline, \n``The Bad Guys are Winning.''\n  My only comment is if indeed that is so, why are not the Bill \nLerach's of this world going after those bad guys instead of conducting \nthe kind of practice that we have seen described here on the floor in \nthe previous debate?\n  Third, he makes the point that the biggest number of suits are \nbetween companies, not class action suits on behalf of the individual \ninvestors. He says this bill does not address that.\n  I agree with him, this bill does not address that. If he feels that \nis a problem that needs to be addressed, he can file a bill that \naddresses that. The fact this bill does not address that does not mean \nthat the issues the bill does address are not meritorious and need not \nbe addressed.\n  Then he talks about the statute of limitation. There has been a lot \nof debate about that. I only make the point that this bill does not \nchange the present level of the statute of limitation. We are not \ntalking about putting a heavier statute of limitation burden \n\n[[Page S 17952]]\nthan currently exists. We are talking about allowing the current law to \ncontinue.\n  Fifth, he talks about the great loss to cities and pension funds that \ncannot be recovered if we cannot go after the aiders and the abettors. \nEarlier in his statement he said we are being given evidence by \nanecdote on the part of those of us in support of this bill, but he \ngives us no anecdote to show the great loss by cities and pension funds \nexcept the anecdote that we hear again and again--and he brought it up \nunder these circumstances--of Charles Keating.\n  Well, I take some time to make the record very clear on Charles \nKeating, because we hear that again and again as the anecdote of what \nwe will lose if this bill is passed. I will make these points, Mr. \nPresident.\n\n  Most of the losses from the savings and loan scandal did not result \nfrom securities fraud. They resulted from outright criminal activity \nand looting the assets of the companies. They do not fall under the \npurview of this bill at all. They are simply irrelevant to this \ndiscussion. Even those S losses that did result in part from \nsecurities fraud would have been recoverable under this bill. It does \nnot in any way, ex post facto, go back and say, if this bill had been \nin law at the time, you could not have gotten this recovery, you could \nnot have gotten this recovery.\n  Why do I say that? Here are the reasons. Statements by Keating and \nhis cohorts would have failed every one of the stringent preconditions \nin the conference report safe harbor provision for forward-looking \nstatements. Every one of Keating's statements and his people's \nstatements would have been actionable had this report been law.\n  Second, the conference report would not have immunized the alleged \naiders and abettors because the conference report authorizes the SEC to \ntake enforcement action against aiders and abettors, and the Keating \ninvestors would have recovered fully even without those aiding and \nabetting claims.\n  Third, the conference report would not have rendered Keating's \nactions time barred. It would have no impact on the statute of \nlimitations in those areas because, as I say, it does not change \ncurrent law, and all of the actions under Keating were brought within \nthe applicable timeframe. Therefore, the Keating thing does not apply \nthere as an anecdote.\n  We must understand that Keating's fraud did not apply to forward-\nlooking statements. They made flat statements of error about the past. \nThey lied flat out about what had been done. This bill does not protect \nanybody who is going to lie flat out about the past.\n  The conference report would not have empowered Keating's cohorts to \ncontrol the litigation. Under this bill, they would be as liable as \nthey were in previous law. It would not have delayed or imposed any \nobstacles to the actions that were taken. The conference report does \nnot, as some claim, inflexibly require courts to stay discovery every \ntime a motion to dismiss is filed. It would have had no effect if this \nbill had passed--it would have no effect on the damage awards. Joint \nand several liability would still have been available under the fact \ncircumstance of Keating.\n  I could go on and on. The point I want to make is very clear. It is a \nred herring in this debate to talk about Charles Keating and the S \ndisaster because this legislation would have had no impact whatsoever \non the Government's ability to proceed in criminal action or an \nindividual investors' ability to proceed in class actions against \nCharles Keating.\n  The comment was made that the safe harbor will now allow people to \nlie. No, it will not. If you make a false statement, the one referred \nto as an example by the Senator from Nevada, ``The stock is going to \ntriple,'' this bill does not protect you because you cannot make a \nprediction about what is going to happen to the stock under current SEC \nregulations and not be called in violation of those regulations for \nthat.\n  What you can say is we believe we will be able to make the \nmarketplace with our widget on such and such a date, and that we will \nhave X numbers of copies of that widget.\n  But why would any executive make that statement if he did not believe \nit were the case? Nothing could be more damaging to his company or his \nreputation or his credibility as an executive than for him to make that \nkind of statement, meeting in front of securities analysts at the time \nof an IPO. You want to be very careful to preserve your credibility \nwith the investment community.\n  No, this is not the problem, CEO's making statements to securities \nanalysts. I will tell you what the problem is and why we need a safe \nharbor. Let us say, within your company you have two engineers who are \nexamining your product. Engineer A says, ``I do not like the way this \nthing works. I would like to fine tune it.'' Engineer B says, ``I \ndisagree with you. I think it works just fine and it is ready for \nmarket.'' Along comes one of these strike suits and the discovery \nstarts and the lawyer gets ahold of engineer A's position and \nimmediately he stands up and says, ``Mr. Chairman,'' speaking to the \nCEO of the company, ``you have within your files a document where one \nof your employees told you absolutely this product was defective.'' He \nis quoting engineer A. He conveniently does not quote engineer B, who \ndisagrees with him. And, there you are, you have made a false \nstatement. And, ``If you did not know the product was defective, you \nshould have known the product was defective.''\n  That is the problem. That is the kind of thing that happens over and \nover again in these circumstances, and that is why people settle. We \nare not talking about CEO's standing up and predicting the stock will \ntriple when we talk about a safe harbor. We are talking about safe \nharbor for people who make statements that they believe are true at the \ntime and then will get trapped in this kind of activity that I have \ndescribed later on.\n  Finally, we come to the point where the Senator from Nevada says \nthere is no need for this. There has been no explosion of these strike \nsuits. This is not a phenomenon that has suddenly hit us.\n  I close by quoting. He quotes from appropriate publications. I have a \nfew that I would like to quote from. The first one, the Washington Post \non the 18th of November, 1995. Referring, in an editorial, to this bill \nit says:\n\n       The bill was a response to a genuine outrage. A small \n     number of lawyers have developed a technique of pouncing on \n     any company whose stock price suddenly drops sharply. They \n     then comb through past statements by the company to find the \n     conventional expressions of hope for the future--and sue on \n     grounds that those statements have misled and defrauded \n     investors. That's a highly strained definition of fraud, but \n     the present state of law makes this kind of suit very \n     dangerous to a company. Although these are nominally \n     shareholders' suits, they generally are instigated and \n     controlled entirely by the lawyers. The companies most \n     vulnerable to this destructive tactic are a particularly \n     valuable kind--small, recently established high-tech firms \n     whose stock prices tend to be volatile.\n\n  And then from the Economist magazine dated December 2, 1995, in \nanother editorial, ``Suits or Straitjackets,'' the subhead says ``The \nAmerican Congress wants to make it harder for some shareholders to sue \ncompanies for fraud. This would be a good thing.''\n  The editorial says the following:\n\n       Class-action lawsuits, in which a bunch of investors join \n     together to sue a firm whose shares have fallen sharply, are \n     a growing problem for America's high-tech companies. More \n     than 650 such suits have been filed in the past four years \n     alone, including ones against each of the ten biggest firms \n     in Silicon Valley. There is nothing wrong with investors \n     using the courts to protect their rights. But a growing \n     number of these suits are being brought by those who are \n     victims not of corporate misinformation, but of their own \n     (and their lawyers') greed. As a result, many managers now \n     hesitate to offer investors any predictions at all, lest they \n     end up in court.\n       That is why Congress is about to pass a measure that would \n     make frivolous securities lawsuits harder to bring. Among \n     other things, the bill, which should clear both the House and \n     Senate easily, does three things. First, it allows firms to \n     issue forecasts to investors providing that they list all of \n     the important factors--a change in interest rates, say, or a \n     slump in the consumer-electronics industry--that could affect \n     them. Second, a defendant's auditors and equity underwriters \n     would no longer be liable for the full extent of \n     shareholders' losses, but only for those that are caused by \n     their own misbehavior. Third, the bill encourages judges to \n     slap fines on lawyers who bring groundless suits.\n\n  The final paragraph of the editorial summarizes it very well. It \nsays:\n\n       As a general rule, it is a good idea to allow shareholders \n     to protect themselves. This would not change under the \n     proposed legislation. And in exchange for reform, they would \n\n[[Page S 17953]]\n     get more (and better) corporate information on which to base their \n     investment decisions. Mr. Clinton faces a choice. Either he \n     can veto the bill on the mistaken ground that he is \n     protecting shareholders' rights, or he can sign it and help \n     put more money in their pockets.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of both \neditorials be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 18, 1995]\n\n                      Antidote to the Strike Suit\n\n       It started off last winter as a flamboyant ideological \n     statement. But the bill to curb shareholders' strike suits \n     has now been whittled and sanded by many hands into a truly \n     useful piece of legislation. An intemperate initiative is \n     turning out to be much more promising than seemed possible \n     last March, when the House originally passed it.\n       The bill was a response to a genuine outrage. A small \n     number of lawyers have developed a technique of pouncing on \n     any company whose stock price suddenly drops sharply. They \n     then comb through past statements by the company to find the \n     conventional expressions of hope for the future--and sue on \n     grounds that those statements have misled and disfrauded \n     investors. That's a highly strained definition of fraud, but \n     the present state of the law makes this kind of suit very \n     dangerous to a company. Although these are nominally \n     shareholders' suits, they generally are instigated and \n     controlled entirely by the lawyers. The companies most \n     vulnerable to this destructive tactic are a particularly \n     valuable kind--small, recently established high-tech firms \n     whose stock prices tend to be volatile.\n       The new Republican majority in the House rushed to defend \n     them. It was one of the promises in the Contract With \n     America. But they overdid it. In their zeal to do away with \n     constraints on the entrepreneur, they wrote sweeping language \n     that would have protected a lot of real fraud--and would also \n     have protected those lawyers and accountants who earn fees by \n     turning a blind eye to it.\n       The Securities and Exchange Commission objected vigorously. \n     To their credit, the congressional Republicans slowed down \n     and took another look. After months of negotiation the SEC's \n     chairman, Arthur Levitt, has now given his assent to a much-\n     modified version of the bill. It would succeed in making \n     spurious fraud suits much riskier to the plaintiff, but \n     without hampering investors who have real grievances.\n       Before President Clinton signs it, the administration needs \n     to address one remaining point. The statute of limitations in \n     these cases is now only three years. With highly complex \n     investments increasingly common, it can easily be a matter of \n     years before customers discover a fraud. Five years is a more \n     reasonable limit. With that further improvement, this bill \n     would make securities law much fairer both to companies and \n     to shareholders.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                  [From the Economist, Dec. 2-8, 1995]\n\n                        Suits or Straitjackets?\n\n       It is a familiar story. Soaraway Shares Inc, a budding \n     Silicon Valley firm, launches a sexy new software product for \n     the Internet. Its managers predict booming sales and \n     boundless profits. Suitably impressed, investors pile in and \n     the firm's share price takes off. But a year later the \n     product flops, the shares plummet--and disgruntled investors \n     head for the nearest courtroom.\n       Class-action lawsuits, in which a bunch of investors join \n     together to sue a firm whose shares have fallen sharply, are \n     a growing problem for America's high-tech companies. More \n     than 650 such suits have been filed in the past four years \n     alone, including ones against each of the ten biggest firms \n     in Silicon Valley.

Not only will the bill give \n     managers a license to lie, these groups say, but firms' \n     auditors and underwriters will no longer have any incentive \n     to catch them in the act. The bill's critics also fear that \n     when shareholders do have a legitimate gripe against a \n     company, lawyers may be deterred from bringing the case by \n     the threat of a penalty if it is ultimately thrown out.\n\n\n                               uninformed\n\n       These fears sound reasonable enough. But they ignore a \n     crucial fact: financial markets thrive on information. The \n     more investors know about what managers are thinking, the \n     better they are able to gauge the risk of investing, and to \n     commit their resources accordingly. They need not (and should \n     not) treat the views they receive as gospel. Indeed, firms' \n     shareholders have proven time and again that they can be \n     better than managers at deciding what is important. The \n     problem with the explosion of frivolous lawsuits is that it \n     is discouraging companies from giving out much-needed \n     information. As a result, the entire market suffers.\n       Admittedly, striking the right balance between protecting \n     shareholders' rights and encouraging more openness is tricky. \n     But the bill's trade-off is a good one. Although the reforms \n     make it harder to bring groundless lawsuits, they do not \n     prevent regulators from prosecuting swindlers. Nor do they \n     let auditors and underwriters off the hook--though by \n     limiting their liability they make it harder for class-action \n     lawyers to win settlements from firms that have simply fallen \n     on hard times. A mere drop in a company's share price usually \n     is not evidence of fraud but the consequence of plan bad \n     luck.\n       As a general rule, it is a good idea to allow shareholders \n     to protect themselves. This would not change under the \n     proposed legislation. And in exchange for reform, they would \n     get more (and better) corporate information on which to base \n     their investment decisions. Mr. Clinton faces a choice. \n     Either he can veto the bill on the mistaken ground that he is \n     protecting shareholders' rights, or he can sign it and help \n     put more money in their pockets.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues. \nThe distinguished Senator from Connecticut, one of the original \ncosponsors of this bill and one of leaders of this fight for more years \nthan I have been in the Senate, is now on his feet, and I am delighted \nto yield to him such time as he may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to thank my \ncolleague from Utah for his eloquent statement in response to some of \nthe charges that were raised about this piece of legislation and the \ninclusion of editorial comment and note of major publications about the \nworthiness of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, let me begin by laying out for our colleagues some \nidea of the amount of labor and work that has gone into this bill. We \nare here today debating a conference report, the final step in the \nlegislative process before this bill is either sent to the President \nfor his signature or veto. I think it is important to note how much \neffort and how much work have gone into producing this bill that our \ncolleagues will be asked to vote on later today.\n  Mr. President, Senator Domenici and I began this effort more than 4 \nyears ago. In fact, the effort and discussion began even earlier than \nthat, but the first bill was introduced 4 years ago, and the House bill \nwas introduced at roughly the same time. So we have been at this for \nsome 1600 days, if you want to put it in category of days. This is not \nsomething that just sort of came up a few weeks ago. I know that it was \nmentioned in this so-called Contract With America, but the bill has a \nhistory that predates that by several years. It has been considered, in \nfact, Mr. President, in three Congresses now. This will be the first \ntime in three Congresses we are actually going to vote on a bill that \nwill allow it to go to the executive branch.\n  We have had 12 congressional hearings on the bill before us. We have \nheard from almost 100 witnesses on this legislation. We have almost \n5,000 pages of testimony that have been accumulated. We have had a \ntotal number of six staff reports totaling 300 pages. We have had some \n103 submissions to the record, and we have had testimony from eight \nMembers of Congress both pro and con on this. The SEC, the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, has testified on 13 different appearances. The \nChairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission has testified four \ntimes and his predecessor has testified four times.\n  So, Mr. President, what we are talking about here today is a piece of \nlegislation that has been considered in great detail. The bill passed \nthe U.S. Senate by a vote of 69 to 30 several months ago and by a vote \nof 325 to 90 in the other body after extensive hearings there. And \nobviously, with those vote totals, it was passed on a bipartisan basis \nin both Chambers. \n\n[[Page S 17954]]\n\n  So I think it is important for our colleagues and the public at large \nto know that this is how the Congress ought to do its business. This \nbill has been changed, it has been worked upon, it has been reformed, \nit has been analyzed, and in 1,000 different ways, over the past 4 \nyears.\n  We have put a great deal of time and effort into producing a bill \nthat we think--those of us who have authored it and supported it--by \nand large deals with what everyone now admits and acknowledges is a \nserious problem. Prior to this, Mr. President, when we first offered \nthe legislation, there was the threshold debate of whether or not there \nwas any problem at all. In fact, many of the people who have spoken \nhere today against this bill argued initially very strenuously that \nthere was no problem at all--none whatsoever.\n  So I am encouraged at least that we have put aside the debate and \ndiscussion about whether or not we are addressing a legitimate problem. \nEven the opponents of this legislation now admit that there was a \nserious problem that needed to be addressed. They disagree with certain \nprovisions here. Most of their disagreements deal with what we were not \nable to include in the legislation. I will get to this in more detail \nin a moment.\n  But as one who offered a number of the suggestions, two particularly \nthat did not make it into the bill, you do not make the good the enemy \nof the perfect here. We have a very sound piece of legislation that \ndeals with a legitimate issue, and that does not deal with every single \nproblem Members would like. But there is certainly no reason whatsoever \nto disregard and to reject this legislation in its entirety. That would \nbe a huge mistake. Even editorial comment that disagrees with the bill, \nMr. President, acknowledges the tremendous work product and the \npositive things included in this legislation.\n  So, Mr. President, again, because at the end of these debates \nsometimes the people who have done such a tremendous amount of work are \nrarely noted or recognized, let me begin by thanking my colleague from \nNew Mexico with whom I have worked so very, very closely on this \nlegislation, our colleague and the chairman of the Banking Committee, \nSenator D'Amato, for his leadership on this and moving aggressively in \nthis Congress to see to it that we complete the hearing process and the \nlegislative business of the Senate, and, of course, my colleague from \nUtah, who has been tremendously helpful on this bill as well.\n  Let me also compliment and thank my colleagues who disagree with us. \nSenator Sarbanes has been tremendously cooperative and helpful in \nseeing to it that we would have a debate and has not engaged in the \nkind of procedural tactics that were available to him to delay \nconsideration of this legislation. Senator Bryan, whom our colleagues \nhad the privilege of hearing just a few moments ago, while he disagrees \nwith this bill, has brought very worthwhile ideas and suggestions and \nnote to the legislative process; Senator Boxer of California, as well, \nwho disagrees with the bill but who has offered some positive insight \nas to how we might proceed.\n  I also would be remiss if I did not recognize those people who work \nfor these Members, who spent literally hundreds of hours in \nnegotiations. I mentioned the amount of time spent at hearings and \npages of testimony. I cannot even begin to calculate the number of \nlegislative staff hours spent in negotiations and efforts to work on \nthis product that now is before us in this conference report. \nCertainly, Andy Lowenthal of my office, who is seated to my left, has \ndone a tremendous job on this bill, along with Diana Huffman of my \noffice and Courtney Ward; from Senator D'Amato's office, Howard Menell, \nBob Guiffra, and Laura Unger have done a tremendous amount of work; and \nSenator Domenici's office, Denise Ramonas and Brian Benczkowski have \ndone tremendous work; Mitchell Feuer in Senator Sarbanes' office, along \nwith Brian McTigue in Senator Boxer's office.\n  There are many others. I apologize for not referencing all of them, \nbut I want our colleagues to know and others that, again, in addition \nto the work the Members do, the staff's participation and involvement \nhas been significant.\n  So, Mr. President, I am very pleased to be standing here this morning \nas the Senate begins the final consideration of the conference report \non S. 240 and the House companion bill, H.R. 1058, the Private \nSecurities Litigation Reform Act. This legislation is fundamentally \nimportant not only for thousands of American businesses, but more \nimportantly I think to literally tens of millions of American \ninvestors. That is what this bill is all about. It is not about the \nbusinesses. It is not about the trial bar. It is about the investors, \nthe people who take their hard-earned money and invest it in American \nbusiness and industry that provide the quality of life and growth in \nthis country that we have seen over the past number of decades.\n\n  Passage of this legislation, we believe, will help restore integrity \nand fairness to the country's private securities litigation system. And \nthrough this reform, Mr. President, the bill will defer, we believe, \nabusive and frivolous lawsuits that needlessly drain millions--in fact, \nbillions--of dollars out of our emerging industries, the biotech \nindustries, the high-tech firms that are the businesses and industries \nthat drive the engine of this country's economy in the 21st century.\n  These are not just small questions. Each dollar that a company must \nspend on responding to America's meritless securities lawsuits, known \nas strike suits, is a dollar that could instead go to improving \ninvestor return, increasing research and development, expanding plants \nand, most importantly, creating the jobs in this country, the good-\npaying jobs that are critical for the health and well-being of this \nNation.\n  In other words, Mr. President, the consequences, in my view, of \nfailing to approve this conference report could not be higher. Mr. \nPresident, we have gone well beyond the day, as I said earlier, when we \nmust argue about whether the securities litigation system is broken. It \nis painfully clear, Mr. President, to almost everyone, including the \nopponents, that the idea that there are no problems is just wrong, and \nthere are massive flaws in the system as it is currently operating.\n  In fact, just last January, Mr. President, Arthur Levitt, the \nChairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission stated--this is last \nJanuary at one of our hearings: ``There is no denying,'' he said, \n``that there are real problems in the current system--problems that \nneed to be addressed not just because of abstract rights and \nresponsibilities but''--listen to this, Mr. President--``because \ninvestors in markets are being hurt by litigation excesses.''\n  The problems in private securities litigation have become so deep, \nMr. President, and so deep rooted that we do not have the luxury, in my \nview, of idly waiting for the courts or some regulatory body to fix \nthem for us. Everyone who knows anything about the present system--\neveryone--will tell you it must be changed, that it does not work, \nexcept for a few of the attorneys who benefit as a result of the \ncurrent system.\n  One of the core problems, Mr. President, afflicting private actions \nunder rule 10(b) is that such actions were never expressly authorized \nby the Congress. This is not based on some laws we passed here but \ninstead have been construed, if you will, and refined by the court \nsystems in this country, with Congress sort of going along because we \nnever acted to change it. It was not as a result of legislation passed \nthrough long and extensive debates but rather interpretations by the \ncourts over the years.\n  We all know what that leads to, Mr. President. It is precisely the \nlack of congressional involvement that has created conflicting legal \nstandards for bringing such actions and has created so many holes \nwithin the foundation of the private action that it threatens the very \nsystem itself--unequal justice, a patchwork. Just watch where a lot of \nthe lawsuits are brought, and you will understand exactly what I am \ntalking about.\n  There is forum shopping going on all over the country because the \ntrial bar in this particular area of law knows that in certain \njurisdictions they are favored and others they are not. So you have \nthis tremendously unequal system all over the country because we have \nnot acted over the years to try and clarify the situation as to how \ninvestors ought to be treated regardless \n\n[[Page S 17955]]\nof where they live in this country. That is one of the core problems \nthat we attempt to address with this legislation, for us as a body, the \nlegislative body, to speak clearly and intelligently as to how this \nsystem ought to work across the country.\n  So, I would submit, Mr. President, to my colleagues, that Congress is \nthe only institution that is equipped to comprehensively address these \nmyriad problems in a thoughtful and moderate manner. My confidence in \nthe legislative process, Mr. President, is borne out by this conference \nreport before us today and the years we have spent in putting it \ntogether. This legislation carefully and considerably balances the \nneeds of our emerging high-growth industries with the rights of \ninvestors, large and small, Mr. President.\n\n  I am proud of the spirit of fairness and equity that permeates this \nbill. In order to understand why so much time and effort is being \nexpended to fix the securities litigation system, I think it is \nimportant to remember the vital role that private securities litigation \nplays in ensuring the integrity and success of America's capital \nmarkets. And I take no back seat to anyone in my determination to see \nto it that the private litigation system is maintained, because it is a \nvital ingredient to protecting consumer and investor confidence.\n  The private securities litigation system is far too important to \nallow a few entrepreneurial lawyers to manipulate--that is what they \ndo--to manipulate and abuse the system to the degree that they have \ndone over recent years.\n  Let me be clear, Mr. President: Private securities litigation is an \nindispensable tool with which defrauded investors can recover their \nlosses without having to rely on Government intervention. It is \nprecisely, Mr. President, because of this important role that the \nlegislation does not impinge on the ability of legitimate aggrieved \ninvestors to file suits and, if successful, collect judgments or \nsettlements from the parties that defrauded them.\n  I have maintained from the outset, Mr. President, of this reform \neffort that securities lawsuits brought by private investors are \ncritical to ensuring public and global confidence in our capital \nmarkets. That is not the issue here. And it is to this high standard \nwhich this conference report seeks to return private securities \nlitigation actions.\n  But, Mr. President, the current system has drifted. It has drifted so \nfar from its original goal that we see more opportunistic lawyers \nprofiting from abusive suits that take advantage of the system than we \nsee corporate wrongdoers exposed by it. While some have charged that \nthe beneficiaries of this legislation are just thousands of American \ncompanies, the people who will be most harmed by our failure the enact \nreforms will be the millions of investors who do not participate in \nthese class action lawsuits.\n  As Kenneth Janke, president of the National Association of Investors \nCorp., which I might point out represents more than 325,000 individual \ninvestors, said recently in a letter to President Clinton, ``Too many \ntimes, class action suits are initiated against companies which result \nin filling the coffers of lawyers with little or no benefit to \nshareowners. Those types of `nuisance' suits,'' he says, ``do little to \nenhance a return for shareowners.'' He says, ``The money spent by \ncorporations on frivolous lawsuits would better serve all shareowners \nif it remained in the company, resulting in higher net profits \nand earnings per share.''\n\n  Or take, if you will, Mr. President, the statement of Ralph Whitworth \nof the American Shareholders Association, who told the Securities \nSubcommittee more than 2 years ago in his testimony, ``The winners in \nthese suits are invariably the lawyers who collect huge contingency \nfees, professional `plaintiffs' who collect bonuses, and, in cases \nwhere fraud has been committed, executives and board members who use \ncorporate funds and corporate-owned insurance policies to escape \npersonal liability. The one constant,'' he says, ``is that the \nshareholders pay for it all.'' And that is what we try to stop here.\n  Even institutional investors, Mr. President, who invest on behalf of \nmillions of individual Americans--in fact, most investors invest \nthrough their institutional investor--these individuals, municipal, \nState, or private pension funds, have expressed their concerns as well.\n  Mary-Ellen Anderson of the Connecticut Retirement & Trust Funds \ntestified before our committee that the participants in the pension \nfunds--and I quote her here:\n\n       . . . are the ones who are hurt if a system allows someone \n     to force us to spend huge sums of money in legal costs . . . \n     when the plaintiff is disappointed in his or her investment.\n\n  Our pensions and jobs, she says, depend upon our employment by and \ninvestment in our companies. If we saddle our companies with large \nunproductive costs, ``* * * we cannot be surprised if our jobs and our \nraises come up short as our population ages.''\n  (Mr. ASHCROFT assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, one of the biggest vulnerabilities of the \nsecurities class action lawsuits is that plaintiffs' attorneys appear--\nappear--to control the settlement of the case with little or no \ninfluence from either the named plaintiffs or the larger class of \ninvestors. For example, during the extensive hearings on the issue \nbefore the Subcommittee on Securities, a lawyer for one of these firms \ncited one case, and I quote him, as ``a showpiece''--those are his \nwords, not mine--``a showpiece of how well the existing system works.''\n  This particular case settled before trial for $33 million, Mr. \nPresident. The lawyers asked the court--they asked the court--for $20 \nmillion, the lawyers did, of the $33 million settlement. Remember, this \nis a lawyer saying this is a showpiece case. He picked this one out. I \ndid not pick it out. This is the attorney talking now. And $33 million \nwas in the settlement. They asked the court for $20 million of the $33 \nmillion. That is what they asked for. And they are claiming this is a \nsystem that does not need to be fixed.\n  My God, what are they talking about here? So $20 million in request \nof $33 million. They got $11 million, by the way. That is what the \ncourts gave them: $11 million. They asked for $20 million but got $11 \nmillion. Of course, the attorneys for the defense, they got $3 million. \nThe investors recovered 6.5 percent of the recoverable damages--6.5 \npercent--and this is a case identified by the trial bar as a showpiece \nexample of how well the system works. That is the best piece of \nevidence they may offer, that is what they think. This kind of \nsettlement might well be satisfactory for the entrepreneurial \nattorneys, but it does little to benefit companies, investors, or even \nthe plaintiffs on whose behalf these suits have been brought.\n\n  The second area of abuse is frivolous litigation. Companies, \nparticularly in the high-technology and biotech industries, face \ngroundless securities litigation days or even hours after announcements \nare made. In fact, the chilling consequence of these lawsuits is that \ncompanies, especially new companies, in emerging industries, in my view \nthe industries of the 21st century in this country, frequently only \nrelease the minimum of information required by law so that they will \nnot be held liable for any innocent forward-looking statements that the \ncorporation may make.\n  These predatory lawsuits--and there is no other way to describe \nthem--have had the result of thwarting 15 years of efforts by the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission to encourage companies to provide \nmore information about their future expectations for earnings and \nproducts. I refer my colleagues to the comments made by our colleague \nfrom Utah in talking about the importance of these forward-looking \nstatements. It is precisely this kind of information that is demanded, \nand rightfully so, by investors who are looking to make the most \nprudent investment decisions.\n  The conference report, we think, provides a mechanism for investors \nnot only to obtain this positive information but to also obtain \ninformation about what the company views as its important risk factors \nin the coming months of their plans.\n  Let me quote the recent comments of J. Kenneth Blackwell, the State \nTreasurer of Ohio. I might point out since the Presiding Officer--\nexcuse me, the Presiding Officer is not from Ohio, he is from Missouri. \nThat is the second time I made that mistake, but he may be interested \nin this. J. Kenneth Blackwell manages more than $105 billion in pension \nfunds. These are his statements. He said:\n\n\n[[Page S 17956]]\n\n       Intelligent investment strategy requires maximum possible \n     disclosure, and if I'm not offered frank assessments of \n     various companies' potential, how can I rest assured that \n     Ohio's pensioners' money is being invested wisely?\n\n  That statement, I think, deserves being listened to. In fact, the \nsafe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the conference \nreport is strongly supported by the Securities and Exchange Commission \nitself.\n  Let me quote a letter which we received from Arthur Levitt. It says:\n\n       The current version of this bill represents a workable \n     balance that we can support since it should encourage \n     companies to provide valuable forward-looking information to \n     investors while at the same time it limits the opportunity \n     for abuse.\n\n  The Supreme Court, in Blue Chip Stamps versus Manner Drugstore, has \nalso voiced serious concern about the vulnerability of securities class \naction suits to abusive practices. Let me quote from the Supreme Court \ndecision in that case:\n\n       In the field of Federal securities laws governing \n     disclosure of information, even a complaint which by \n     objective standards may have very little success at trial has \n     a settlement value--\n\n  Has a settlement value.\n\n     to the plaintiff out of any proportion to its prospect of \n     success at trial.\n\n  The decision goes on to say:\n\n       The very pendency of the lawsuit may frustrate or delay \n     normal business activity of the defendant which is totally \n     unrelated to the lawsuit.\n\n  Mr. President, a third area of abuse is that the current framework \nfor assessing liability is simply unfair and creates a powerful \nincentive to sue those with the deepest pockets, regardless of their \nrelative complicity in the alleged fraud.\n\n  The current system of joint and several liability encourages \nplaintiffs' attorneys to seek out any possible corporation or \nindividuals that may have extensive insurance coverage or deep pockets. \nThat is why they are brought in. It is not because even the plaintiffs' \nattorneys think they are necessarily culpable, but it is because they \nhave the deep pockets, they have the insurance behind them that they \nare brought into the lawsuits. That is why they are brought in--there \nis no illusion about it--even if they have nothing to do with the \nclaimed alleged fraud.\n  Although these defendants could frequently win the case if it were to \ngo to trial, the expense of protracted litigation makes it more \neconomical for them to settle with plaintiffs' attorneys. That is what \nthey do, they settle, because going to court would be far more costly \ndown the road over an extended period of years.\n  One example was chronicled in a recent Wall Street Journal just this \npast June. I quote from that story:\n\n       The jury ruled in Peat Marwick's favor in 1993, but the \n     firm spent $7 million to defend itself.\n\n  The court ruled in their favor. And what was this about? It was about \na $15,000 contract that Peat Marwick had to do some accounting for a \nbusiness--a $15,000 contract to do some accounting for the firm. They \nended up expending $7 million to defend themselves against a $15,000 \ncontract. Of course, what has happened is these accounting firms are \nnot taking on these clients any longer. So you do not get the \naccounting from the big seven or reputable accounting firms because of \nthis kind of problem. The minute they take on a client for $15,000, \nthey can look to end up paying a bill of $7 million, or more in some \ncases.\n  The current Chairman of the SEC, Arthur Levitt, as well as two former \nChairmen, Richard Breeden and David Ruder, have all spoken out against \nabuses of joint and several liability. Chairman Levitt said at the \nApril 6 hearing of our committee that he was concerned ``about \naccountants being unfairly charged for amounts that go far beyond their \ninvolvement in particular fraud.''\n  Again, this is borne out in a recent article in the Wall Street \nJournal which chronicled the stunning number of audit clients dropped \nby the big six accounting firms over the past few years. I quote the \narticle:\n\n       Peat Marwick, the fourth largest American accounting firm, \n     is dropping approximately 50 to 100 audit clients annually, \n     up from zero 5 years ago. . .\n       Arthur Anderson has either dropped or declined to audit \n     more than 100 companies over the past 2 years.\n\n  Does anyone believe that is sound, that is good, that is the way we \nought to be doing business, how to encourage these accounting firms to \nbe involved with these new industries starting up? I hope not.\n  Again, the current system has devolved to the point where it favors \nthose lawyers who are looking out for their own financial interests \nover the interests of virtually everyone else.\n  As was the case with S. 240 that was passed by this body, the \nconference report contains a number of significant and balanced \ninitiatives to deal with these complex problems. Let me address what we \nattempt to do with this bill.\n  First, the conference report empowers investors so that they, not \ntheir attorneys, have the greater control over the class action cases \nby allowing the plaintiffs with the greatest claim to be named \nplaintiff and allowing that plaintiff to select their counsel.\n  What an outrageous and radical thought this is, the idea that we \nmight insist that at least to offer--you do not have to force it--but \nyou offer to the plaintiff who is going to be most affected by the \nlawsuit to have an opportunity to become the lead plaintiff. All you \nhave to do is offer it, Mr. President. We are not demanding, we are \nencouraging, and they might be able to decide which law firm would \nrepresent them.\n  That is considered a radical idea here, needless to say opposed by \nthe trial bar. They do not want that to happen at all.\n  Second, this legislation enhances existing provisions designed to \ndeter fraud and restores enforcement authority to the Securities and \nExchange Commission. That was lost, Mr. President, in the 1994 Supreme \nCourt case, the Central Bank case. We, in this bill, restore what the \nCentral Bank took away from the SEC here.\n  Third, the conference provides a meaningful safe harbor for \nlegitimate forward-looking statements so that issuers are encouraged \nto--instead of discouraged from--make much-needed disclosures.\n  Fourth, it makes it easier to impose sanctions on those attorneys who \nviolate their basic professional ethics.\n  Fifth, it rationalizes the liability of deep-pocket defendants, while \nprotecting the ability of small investors to fully collect all damages \nawarded them through a trial or settlement.\n  Let me go over the points in a little more detail. First, on \nempowering investors. The conference report--this bill--takes a number \nof steps to guarantee that investors, not their marauding attorneys, \ndecide whether to, one, bring a case, two, whether to settle the case \nand, three, how much the lawyer should receive. Again, I do not think \nit is a terribly radical idea that we would allow them to decide \nwhether or not to bring a case--after all, they are the injured \nparties, we are being told--or whether they want to settle it all or \nnot. Maybe they do not want to settle. Maybe they think they have such \na good case they would like to go to trial. That ought to be their \ndecision, not the lawyer's.\n  Third, how much the lawyers get, rather than being decided by the \nlawyers, let the plaintiffs decide what their attorneys should be \nreceiving.\n  The conference report strongly encourages the courts--``encourages,'' \nI emphasize that--to appoint the investor with the greatest financial \ninterest in the case--often an institutional investor like a pension \nfund--to be the lead plaintiff. After all, they are the ones who are at \nthe greatest risk. If there is real fraud, they have the most to lose. \nIf the lawsuit is frivolous and millions are going to be spent to \ndefend the suit, they lose as well. This plaintiff will have the right \nto select their own counsel and to pursue the case on behalf of the \nclass.\n  So for the first time in a long time, Mr. President, securities \nlitigation attorneys will have a real client to answer to. We are \nbeginning to end the days when a plaintiff's attorney can crow--again, \nI will quote such a plaintiff's attorney. In Forbes magazine, listen to \nwhat this attorney said: ``I have the greatest practice of law in the \nworld because I have no clients.'' ``I have the greatest practice in \nthe world,'' he said, talking about securities litigation cases, \n``because I have no clients.'' ``I bring the case,'' he says. ``I hire \nthe plaintiff. I do not have some \n\n[[Page S 17957]]\nclient telling me what to do. I decide what I want to do.'' That is \nwhat this is all about. That is why this bill is important. That is \nwhat we want to stop here--we want to stop these situations in which a \nbunch of attorneys decide what they are going to do, and we want to \nhave the aggrieved plaintiffs deciding what they are going to do. That \nis why this bill is important. Of course, this presumption can be \nchallenged, as I said earlier--the presumption of the most injured \nplaintiff being the lead plaintiff, if other class members feel that \nthe lead plaintiff is not fairly or accurately representing the class. \nSo we are not insisting or legally requiring it. We are just asking the \ncourts to step forward and ask the most injured party to come forward.\n  This change, we feel, Mr. President, will also end the unsavory \npractice of rushing to the courthouse. That is what happens under the \npresent system. The first person to show up in the courthouse gets the \ncase--the first person. This is a hallmark of the current system of the \nsecurities class action litigation.\n  Last June, I received a letter from Raytheon Co., one of the Nation's \nlargest high technology firms. Raytheon, Mr. President, made a tender \noffer of $64 a share for E-Systems, Inc., another company. That is a 41 \npercent premium over the closing market price. Putting aside whether or \nnot you think that is fair or not, nonetheless, most people thought it \nwas a pretty fair offer. But I am not here to argue the fairness or \nunfairness of the offer. Let me allow, if I can, Raytheon to explain \nwhat happened next in a letter that I received from them:\n\n       Notwithstanding the widely held view that the proposed \n     transaction was eminently fair to E-System's shareholders, \n     the first of eight purported class action lawsuits was filed \n     within 90 minutes after the courthouse doors opened on the \n     day that the transaction was announced.\n\n  An hour and a half later, one of eight lawsuits was filed in court. I \ndo not care how good a lawyer you are, you do not go around and find \nplaintiffs in an hour and a half with a public announcement about an \noffer to buy another company. That is exactly what we are talking about \nhere, racing to the courthouse. Do not look at the facts and examine \nwhether or not it is right or wrong; file the lawsuit and immediately \ntrigger the kind of costs associated with it. What about investors in \nthat case, Mr. President? What happens to them in that case--the \ninvestors in Raytheon, the investors in E-Systems? Do the lawyers think \nabout them at all, or the cost to those particular firms, and just \nanswer the pleadings once a lawsuit is filed? Does anybody care about \nthem at all under the present system? It does not appear so.\n  Mr. President, the conference report requires notice--a radical idea \nhere again--of settlement arrangements that are sent to investors, who \nmust clearly spell out important facts, such as how much investors are \ngetting or giving up by settling, how much their lawyers will receive \nin the settlement. Again, let me emphasize here, in many cases, \nsettlement is the wrong conclusion. An aggrieved plaintiff may want to \ngo to court. They ought to have the right, these investors. Plaintiffs \nought to have the right to decide whether or not they want a settlement \nand make the decision themselves after listening to intelligent \narguments about what is the best course of action.\n  This means, under this bill, plaintiffs will be able to make an \ninformed decision about whether or not the settlement is in their best \ninterest or in their lawyer's best interest. Currently, the actual \nplaintiffs only receive, on average, 14 cents or less of every \nsettlement dollar. But the plaintiffs' attorneys receive 33 cents, on \naverage, of each settlement dollar. That is 14 cents for the \nshareholders, the investors, and 33 cents for the lawyers. You do not \nneed to be a rocket scientist to understand that this system is broken, \nwhen plaintiffs, investors, are getting that minor return in these \ncases and the lawyers are collecting more than twice what they are \ngetting.\n  The conference report puts an end to this outrageous practice, called \nthe ``lodestar'' approach, by encouraging courts to award attorney's \nfees based upon a reasonable percentage of the total amount of the \nsettlement or judgment.\n  The New York Times stated just 2 weeks ago in an article entitled \n``Math of Class Action Suits; Winning $2.19 Cents Costs $91.33.''\n  It says:\n\n       Many class actions end with plaintiffs winning meager \n     awards, while their lawyers walk away with millions of \n     dollars in fees.\n\n  Taken together, Mr. President, these provisions should ensure that \ndefrauded investors are not cheated a second time by a few unscrupulous \nlawyers who skim their exorbitant fees right off the top of any \nsettlement. One of the areas of the conference report that has received \ntoo little attention, in my view, is the effort to deter fraud. We have \nbeen talking about how you deal with it when fraud has arisen, when \nthere is an allegation of fraud. What we try to do with this bill that \nwe have worked on for more than 4 years now, through the number of \nhearings we have held and the witnesses we have heard from, is \ndetermine how we deter fraud from occurring in the first place so that \ninvestors are really protected? One of the areas, as I said, that \nreceived very little attention, in the midst of all of the hot air \nblowing from the plaintiffs' bar are those provisions that provide new \nprotections, Mr. President, that have never existed before for \ninvestors against fraud.\n  I commend my colleague, Senator Domenici, and others, for really \nworking to see to it that we have these provisions in the bill. For the \nfirst time, Mr. President, auditors, under this bill, are required to \ntake additional new steps to detect fraud, and if they find fraud, they \nmust--not may, but must--be reported to the Securities and Exchange \nCommission. They must look for the fraud--the auditors, the private \ncompanies--and if they find any, they have to report it. That has never \nbeen required before. That is a new standard, a new bar that we have \nraised here to try and deter fraud in the first instance. Nobody has \nmentioned that part. If they do, it is in just a passing way.\n  The conference report maintains current standards of joint and \nseveral liability just for those persons who knowingly, Mr. President, \nengage in a fraudulent scheme, thus keeping a heavy financial penalty \nfor those who would commit knowing securities fraud.\n\n  Perhaps most significant, the bill restores the ability of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission to pursue those who knowingly aid \nand abet securities fraud. My colleagues who oppose this bill talk \nabout our failure to get all of the aiding and abetting back in it. I \ndo not disagree.\n  But what we have been able to do in this bill which could not get \ndone--you would not get it done if you just had a freestanding aiding \nand abetting provision. I do not think it would pass. I disagree with \nthat. I think we should.\n  To hear my colleagues say how bad this bill is because we do not deal \nwith all of the things they would like in aiding and abetting, yet we \nget the class actions covered after the Supreme Court rules against us. \nInstead of denouncing this bill, they ought to be adding far more \nsupport to what we were able to accomplish here and make a major step \nforward.\n  This is a power diminished by the Central Bank decision of last \nyear's Supreme Court case. In fact, some recent SEC enforcement actions \nhave been dismissed, Mr. President, because Federal courts are ruling \nthat the Commission had its aiding and abetting authority taken away by \nthe Central Bank decision. We are restoring that in this bill and \ngiving the SEC the power that they are being denied by lower court \nrulings around the country.\n  The conference report clarifies current requirements that lawyers \nshould have some facts--again, a radical idea here--should have some \nfacts to back up their assertion of security fraud by adopting most of \nthe reasonable standards established by the U.S. Second Circuit Court \nof Appeals.\n  This legislation, therefore, is using a pleadings standard that has \nbeen successfully tested, Mr. President, in the real world. This is not \nsome arbitrary standard pulled out of a hat. Again, this is a standard \nthat has been used and tested and been tried. We include that in this \nbill, as well.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield? \n\n[[Page S 17958]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. Let me finish my remarks, and I will be glad to yield. I am \nalmost through.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, the bill requires the court's settlement \nto determine whether any attorney had violated rule 11 of the Code of \nCivil Procedure, which prohibits lawyers from filing claims that they \nknow to be false or frivolous.\n  Of course, the lawyers want the status quo for business and no \nstandards at all for themselves in this area.\n  In the event of a violation of the complaint, the bill requires that \nthe court find a substantial violation of rule 11 to have occurred in \norder for any sanctions to be triggered.\n  Mr. President, let me emphasize what this does. This is in the filing \nof a lawsuit. It turns out it is a tough standard to meet. But if the \ncourt determines that the attorneys knew that this was a frivolous \nlawsuit, that the allegations are false, then it can go after those \nattorneys that bring the lawsuit.\n  Now, the same standard applies in the defense attorneys' response to \nthe pleadings. And they say that is unfair. It is not unfair at all. It \nis the plaintiff's attorneys that are bringing the case in the first \ninstance. We are saying that if, in fact, the lawyers knew this was \nfrivolous and false, then they ought to be held accountable for doing \nthat. If attorneys on the other side in the filing of pleadings also \nengage in any false or frivolous allegations, then, they, too, will be \nheld accountable for those statements. We think this is a fair and \nadequate standard to be applied to the attorneys.\n  The conference report does not change existing standards of conduct. \nIt does put some teeth, however, into the enforcement of these \nstandards. I point out what has happened over the years. While the \nrules have existed, nothing has ever been done with them in the past. \nIn fact, they have been sitting there almost as idle pieces of paper \nwith no real meaning at all.\n  The conference report provides a moderate and thoughtful statutory \nsafe harbor for predictive statements made by companies that are \nregistered with the SEC.\n  Mr. President, this is one of the most contentious parts of the bill. \nIt provides no such safety for third parties, like brokers, or in the \ncase of merger offers, tenders, rollups or issuance of penny stocks. \nThat is not where the safe harbor applies.\n  By adopting this provision, the Senate will encourage responsible \ncorporations to make the kind of disclosures about projected activities \nthat are currently missing in today's investment climate.\n  Since the safe harbor has been the subject of so much attention, Mr. \nPresident, it is worth spending a little time to delve into the details \nof these provisions.\n  This reconfigured safe harbor that is in this conference report has \ntwo parts to it. The first is that any forward-looking statement may be \naccompanied by ``meaningful cautionary statements that identify \nimportant factors that could cause'' the prediction not to come true, \nor if a company or officer fails to meet that test, all that a \nplaintiff must do is prove that the person actually knew that the \nstatement was false or misleading.\n  Mr. President, that is the very scienter standard written by our good \nfriend and colleague from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes, and proposed by \nhim during the Senate floor consideration of S. 240 in June.\n  Quite honestly, it is hard for this Member to envision how anyone \ncould lie in their predictive statements and still be covered by this \nsafe harbor; this insulation from abuse is no doubt a key reason why \nthe safe harbor is strongly supported by the Securities and Exchange \nCommission in their letter of support of this bill.\n  As the Commission stated:\n\n       The need of legitimate businesses to have a mechanism for \n     early dismissal of frivolous lawsuits argues in favor of a \n     codification of the bespeaks caution doctrine that has \n     developed under the case law. While the trade-off requires \n     that class action attorneys must have well written and \n     carefully researched pleadings at the outset of the lawsuit, \n     we feel this is necessary to create a viable safe harbor. \n     Given that it does not prevent Commission enforcement \n     actions, and excludes the greatest opportunities for harm to \n     investors.\n\n  The idea that this conference report contains any license to lie is \nsimply and totally untrue and, particularly in light of the strong \nsupport of the Securities and Exchange Commission, represents just a \nlast, in my view, desperate attempt by opponents of this legislation to \nderail the process.\n  The legislation before us, Mr. President, preserves the rights of \ninvestors whose losses are 10 percent or more of their total net worth \nof $200,000. These small investors will still be able to hold all \ndefendants responsible for paying off settlements regardless of the \nrelative guilt of each of the named parties.\n  This is the modification for the joint and several sections. This \nthreshold, I think, should more than protect the vast majority of \nindividual investors participating in the markets today.\n  Let me tell you why I say that. A 1993 census report stated that the \naverage net worth, Mr. President, of an American family was about \n$47,000. That is their net worth, $47,000. While in 1990, the New York \nStock Exchange study found the median income--the income, now, the \nmedian income--for individual investors was $43,800 a year, which, \naccording to the census data extrapolates to a net worth of roughly \n$150,200.\n  Let me explain that again. The words can be confusing. The average \nAmerican family has a net worth of something in excess of $47,000 a \nyear; the average of the median investor in the New York Stock Exchange \nhas an income of $43,000 a year; the Census Bureau extrapolates an \nincome of $43,800 to a net worth of those investors of $150,000.\n  That is why we chose the $200,000 level and below, so that the \nmajority of investors--the majority of investors, the small investors--\nwould not be adversely affected by the proportional liability standards \nincluded in the bill. We tried in this bill to see to it that those \nsmaller investors would not be adversely affected.\n  While the bill will fully protect small investors so they will \nrecover all of the losses to which they are entitled, the bill \nestablishes a proportional liability system to discourage the naming of \nthe deep pocket defendants that I talked about earlier.\n  The court would be required to determine the relative liability of \nall the defendants, and thus deep-pocket defendants would only be \nliable to pay a settlement about equal to their relative role in the \nalleged fraud. What a radical idea that is as well. A defendant who is \n10 percent responsible for the fraudulent actions would be required to \npay 10 percent of the settlement amount. That is just fair. That is \nequitable.\n  I would say, quickly, again, we protect smaller investors. We say, \nfor them we are going to have a different standard, but for those who \nare above that line, to go after someone who is only fractionally \ninvolved and say that you ought to pay the whole amount here ought to \nstrike every person in this country as fundamentally unfair, and that \nis what we try to change in this bill. However, as I said, in the event \nof an insolvent defendant, all the other defendants would be required \nto contribute as much as an additional 50 percent of their proportional \nshare of a settlement to ensure that investors receive as close to 100 \npercent of their just settlements as possible. By creating a two-tiered \nsystem of both proportional liability and joint and several liability, \nthe conference report preserves the best features of both systems.\n  Having spent so much time on what is in the conference report, let me \nbriefly spend a few minutes, if I can, discussing a few of the things \nthe conference report does not do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator from \nConnecticut, under the previous order, the hour of 12:30 having \narrived, the Senate would stand in recess until 2:15 p.m.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 5 \nadditional minutes, if I could, to complete the statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object, under the procedural \nstatement, I ask unanimous consent that debate on the bill be extended \nfor 15 minutes beyond. I know that is an imposition on the Presiding \nOfficer. I have 15 minutes reserved, and I have been here for most of \nthe morning, a \n\n[[Page S 17959]]\ngood part of the morning, waiting to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Reserving the right to object, I ask if we could extend \nthat to 25 minutes so we could go straight to 1 o'clock?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and to make life easier for \nthe distinguished Presiding Officer, I ask unanimous consent that \nunanimous-consent request be amended to allow me to be recognized for \nno more than 6 minutes at 2 o'clock, which I understand is the time we \nare coming back in?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 2:15 is the previously agreed upon \ntime.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that unanimous-consent request be \namended so that I am recognized for 6 minutes at 2:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing no objection, the \nfollowing will be the order: an additional 5 minutes will be extended \nto the Senator from Connecticut, and then 15 minutes will be extended \nto the Senator from Pennsylvania, after which 10 minutes will be \nextended to the Senator from Wisconsin, and, at 2:15, 6 minutes will be \nextended to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I have no objection, just a parliamentary \ninquiry. Those who are speaking with reference to the pending matter, \nthat will be in accordance with the practice that those speaking on \nbehalf, their time will be charged to the distinguished Senator from \nUtah, the time of those speaking in opposition will be charged to the \ntime remaining of the Senator from Nevada; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the unanimous-\nconsent agreement be modified further, that Senator Hatch be recognized \nto speak following Senator Leahy when we come back after lunch, for 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for clarification, my 6 minutes will be as \nin morning business, so it will not be charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nunanimous consent is so modified.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I think I just lost my 5 minutes so I will \nask you to be slow with that gavel.\n  First and foremost, Mr. President, here is what the bill does not do. \nIt is nothing like the legislation that was adopted in the House. Let \nme say, had the House bill come back in this area, I would have voted \nagainst it and spoken vehemently against it. This bill was much closer \nto the bill that passed this body earlier this year and, in fact, \nstrengthens the legislation, as I mentioned earlier, with the inclusion \nof language by our distinguished colleague from Maryland, Senator \nSarbanes. In my view, the House bill would have been a tragedy.\n  For instance, we do not have loser pay provisions here. My colleagues \nknow what that means. We took that out of the bill. That was part of \nthe House bill. The House legislation established pleading standards \nthat were so high, I would say--and I know my colleague from \nPennsylvania is interested in this--that it would have been impossible \nto bring a suit, in my view, had the House language been adopted. We, \nas I said earlier, adopt the Second Circuit Court of Appeals standard.\n  The House legislation contained no safety net for small investors. As \nI have just described, we do. The conference report maintains joint and \nseveral liability for small investors and requires, even in \nproportional cases, where you have a totally insolvent plaintiff, the \nconference report requires that defendants pay a total of 150 percent \nof their proportionate share in the event of insolvent people. The \nHouse legislation had a safe harbor provision that, frankly, you could \nhave parked the entire 7th Fleet in, if you had wanted to. That is not \nthe case here. We have strengthened safe harbor. The conference report \ncreates a narrow safe harbor that is strongly supported by the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission.\n  So, this conference report is a far cry from the intemperate measure \npassed by the House. Instead, it reflects the moderate and balanced \napproach adopted by the Senate when it passed this body by a margin of \n69 to 30. In fact, a dramatic change from the original House bill was \nrecently noted in an editorial by the Washington Post, which is \nentitled ``Antidote to the Strike Suit.''\n  ``It started off,'' the editorial said, ``last winter as a flamboyant \nideological statement. But the bill to curb shareholders' suits has now \nbeen whittled and sanded by many hands into a truly useful piece of \nlegislation. An intemperate initiative is turning out to be much more \npromising than seemed possible last March when the House originally \npassed it.''\n  So I think we put together a good package here. I urge my colleagues \nto support this legislation. We are not writing the Ten Commandments \nhere. We are trying to address a serious problem. Time will tell \nwhether or not particular provisions here have done everything we would \nlike them to do. But, clearly, the system is broken and it needs to be \nchanged.\n  This bill has been well thought out. It has been worked on in a \nbipartisan way. We have listened to the best experts in the country who \nhelped us put it together. And the Securities and Exchange Commission \nendorses this bill and has worked with us to make it a good bill.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to be supportive of it. I \nurge the President to sign it. I know he is considering whether or not \nto lend his pen to this bill. I think he will sign it. I think we can \nmake a strong case that we have put together a sound piece of \nlegislation that will truly make a difference, particularly for those \nbusinesses which must be the future economically for our country in the \n21st century, those high-technology firms, those startup industries \nthat are the ones who are the prey of these attorneys who go out and \ntake advantage of their being in flux, that they are not quite stable \nyet, that they are getting their legs. They are the ones that are \npreyed upon. That is what we need to stop here. This bill does that, we \nthink, in a significant way, and I urge its adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had sought to ask my distinguished \ncolleague from Connecticut a question relating to the pleading standard \nwhen he had said, in his presentation, that the standard in this \nstatute is a tested standard. Then, later in his presentation, he made \nreference to this Senator on the pleading issue.\n  The question that I have for my colleague from Connecticut turns on \nwhat the pleading standard of the bill is, as having come back from \nconference, which is significantly different from that which left the \nSenate. The amendment which this Senator offered had incorporated into \nthe statute the second circuit language which would have clarified the \nlanguage in the Senate bill, which provided that, ``In any private \naction arising under this title, the plaintiff's complaint shall, with \nrespect to each act or omission alleged to violate this title, \nspecifically allege facts giving rise to a strong inference that the \ndefendant acted with the required state of mind.''\n  That was the tough second circuit standard. This Senator offered an \namendment, which was accepted on the Senate floor, to incorporate what \nthe second circuit said was the way of establishing that strong \ninference, to provide it by ``alleging facts to show the defendant had \nboth motive and opportunity to commit fraud, or by alleging facts that \nconstitute strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or \nrecklessness by the defendant.'' The conference report struck out the \nlanguage which my amendment had inserted which would have given \nguidance to how plaintiffs could meet that very stringent standard.\n  In addition, the conference report added that these facts had to be \n``stated with particularity,'' which is an even tougher standard than \nthe language which had gone from the Senate bill.\n  So when the distinguished Senator from Connecticut talks about, in \nhis words, and he referred to the House \n\n[[Page S 17960]]\nmeasure as ``intemperate''--I will not seek to characterize it, but I \ndo know his characterization of the House measure was ``intemperate''--\ncontrasted with what he said the Senate action was, ``moderate,'' that \nthe bill that has come back from conference is a lot different than the \nbill which the Senate sent out. I think there is an enormous \ndifference.\n  So the question that I have for my colleague from Connecticut is, \nwhere has this language in the conference report on the pleading \nstandard for state of mind been tested in light of the fact that the \ntoughest standard in existence to this moment is the second circuit \nstandard, and this conference report toughens up the second circuit \nstandard in two important respects by striking out the way you plead \nthat tough state of mind standard and also by adding the requirement of \npleading with particularity?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me respond to my colleague. I know he \nhas a great deal of interest in this whole area of competing standards. \nBasically, what we intended to do here was to codify the second \ncircuit's pleadings standards, not to indicate disapproval of each \nindividual case that came before it. What we were driving at here was \nto insist that facts be pleaded, that there be an explanation of where \nthese facts come from in these lawsuits that are being brought.\n  Indeed, the Banking Committee reported with its bill--and included \nsimilar language in support--and said the committee does not intend \nbefore we consider the bill to codify the second circuit's case law \ninterpreting this pleading standard, although courts may find this body \nlaw instructive.\n  So, in response to my colleague from Pennsylvania, even before we \nbrought the matter up, we made it quite clear that we were, as I say, \ntaking every case that had come before the second circuit but rather \napplying the pleading standard requirements there. That had been \ntested.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I challenge that.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me respond. Even my colleague's amendment goes beyond \nthat in a sense. So you cannot, on the one hand, have us stick with it \nrigidly and have the Senator's in the amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I challenge that. If I have the floor, I challenge that.\n  In what respect does my amendment go beyond this? That simply is not \ntrue.\n  What my amendment does is to take the second circuit language under \nwhich a plaintiff can meet the tough state of mind standard, and put \nthat in the statute. This body agreed to that. And now it has come back \nfrom the conference report deleted.\n  In what respect did my language go beyond the second circuit?\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator's amendment adopted the guidance of the second \ncircuit, but the amendment of the Senator from Pennsylvania completely \nomits a critical qualification in the case law. The courts have held \nthat ``where motive is not apparent, a plaintiff may plead scienter by \nidentifying circumstances'' indicating wrongful behavior, but ``the \nstrength of the circumstantial allegations must be correspondingly \ngreater'' from the number of cases. If I may respond, the Senator's \namendment seriously, in the view of the----\n  Mr. SPECTER. From where is the Senator reading? In a circuit court \nopinion?\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator's amendment seriously--\n  Mr. SPECTER. Where is the Senator reading from? Is it in a circuit \ncourt opinion?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. From where?\n  Mr. DODD. There are several here.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Tell me where the citation is, because I have the \nopinions here. I challenge that any language appears from the second \ncircuit opinion which was not incorporated in my amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I am quoting here three different cases.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Tell me where.\n  Mr. DODD. The Three Crown Limited Partnership versus Caxton \nCorporation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. What page?\n  Mr. DODD. Does the Senator want to go to 817 Federal Supplement 1033, \nBeck versus Manufacturing Hanover Trust? There are two right there.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the language handed down by the second \ncircuit was articulated by Chief Judge Jon Newman as follows:\n       These facts or allegations must give rise to a strong \n     inference that the defendants possess the requisite \n     fraudulent intent. A common method for establishing a strong \n     inference of scienter is to allege facts showing a motive for \n     committing fraud and a clear opportunity for doing so. Where \n     motive is not apparent, it is still possible to plead \n     scienter by identifying circumstances indicating conscious \n     behavior by the defendant, though the strength of the \n     circumstantial allegations must be correspondingly greater.\n\n  The amendment which this Senator offered and was adopted by the \nSenate followed the pleading requirement by saying that the required \nstate of mind may be established either by alleging facts to show the \ndefendant had both motive and opportunity to commit fraud or by \nalleging facts that constitute strong circumstantial evidence of \nconscious misbehavior or recklessness by the defendant.\n  I submit that the amendment which I offered and was adopted by the \nSenate tracked the second circuit's language directly, and that by \nstriking the amendment which the Senate agreed to, by conceding to the \nHouse, the conference report omits a very critical factor in giving \nguidance as to how a plaintiff meets this tough standard for pleading \nstate of mind.\n  I would ask my colleague from Connecticut whether it is not true that \nthe conference report came back with an additional toughening factor \nrequiring that the facts going to state of mind be pleaded with \nparticularity.\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague, what we are attempting to do here, \nagain, I think, is instead of trying to take each case that came under \nthe second circuit, we are trying to get to the point where we would \nhave well-pleaded complaints. We are using the standards in the second \ncircuit in that regard, then letting the courts--as these matters \nwill--test. They can then refer to specific cases, the second circuit, \notherwise, to determine if these standards are based on facts and \ncircumstances in a particular case. That is what we are trying to do \nhere.\n  I say to my colleague that I supported my colleague's amendment when \nhe offered it here in on the floor of the Senate back when the bill was \nconsidered. Again, as I say, personally, it says the statute of \nlimitations and a few others. But we are dealing in conference here, \nand the bulk of what came back from the conference report was what was \nin the Senate bill.\n  My colleague would have preferred, I know, to have his amendment kept \nin its entirety here. We are trying to strike a balance. As he knows, \nhe has been to conferences as often as I have been in the past and \nknows the nature of well-pleaded complaints. That is the standard we \nare trying to hold to that came out of the second circuit, not on a \ncase-by-case basis where they differed in some degree in \ninterpretation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Pennsylvania reclaim his \ntime?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes and 50 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Connecticut for responding. \nWhen you have a dialog in debate it is invariably more instructive than \nthe speeches we make, however eloquent our individual speeches may be. \nBut I have very limited time remaining.\n  The point that I wanted to make is that regardless of what the \nconference report intends--and the Senator from Connecticut talks about \nwhat we are trying to accomplish--the plain truth of the matter is that \nthis is an impossible pleading standard, that where you take what was a \ntough standard by the second circuit on pleading state of mind, and \nthen you delete the ways you prove state of mind, and then add in \naddition a particularity requirement, you simply do not have a way that \na plaintiff realistically can go into the Federal court under the \nsecurities acts and have a fair chance to state a case.\n  I say that with some substantial experience in the practice of law, \nas a trial lawyer for some 10 years in the civil field and with \nsubstantial practice in the criminal field, which has some bearing, and \nmy work in the past 15 years on the Judiciary Committee, that where you \nhave a situation here where there is a mandatory stay of discovery when \na motion to dismiss is \n\n[[Page S 17961]]\nfiled, that you simply do not give an opportunity to plaintiffs to go \ninto court and have a chance to articulate a case.\n\n  We are dealing here, Mr. President, with enormous sums of money. In \n1993, the most recent year available from the New York Stock Exchange \nand NASDAQ, there was some $3.6 trillion traded, not even taking into \naccount the American Stock Exchange, more than half of the gross \nnational product of the United States. And we have had an enormous \nnumber of very, very important fraud cases. The Keating case involved \nsome losses in excess of $4.4 billion. The Drexel Burnham case, the \nQuorum case, the tremendous matter now pending involving the losses \nincurred by Orange County.\n  So we are talking about gigantic interests. The bill that has come \nback from conference, Mr. President, virtually forecloses a realistic \nopportunity to bring a suit under these pleading standards. And what we \nare not trying to do is what specifically has been done here. The \nstandard of review is especially problemsome in the context of the \nmandatory rule 11 review required by the conference report.\n  In earlier argument on June 27 of this year, at page S9165 of the \nRecord, I put in an extensive listing of letters from judges who did \nnot want to have this mandatory rule 11 review, the Federal judges who \npractice in it.\n  Then the conference report has a presumption that, after the \nmandatory review, if there are sanctions against the complaint, the \ncosts of litigation and lawyers' fees will be imposed upon the \nplaintiff. This is realistically more than a chilling effect. It will \nhave the effect really to virtually discourage litigation in an \nimportant field where these private lawsuits have had a very important \nimpact on policing the field. The Securities and Exchange Commission \ncannot possibly undertake it by themselves. The distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut concedes that in his speech about the importance of \nprivate rights of action to enforce the securities laws. But I am \nconcerned, as a person who has had experience in the field in \nrepresenting, under the Securities Act, defendants as well, that this \nbill in its present form simply is unrealistic and unreasonably \nrestrictive----\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield on this point?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Not on my time. I will be glad to if we can get an \nextension.\n  Where you have especially the problem compounded by the short statute \nof limitations, which is 1 year from discovery and 3 years from \ncommission. Efforts were made to extend the time to 2 and 5 years, \nfavored by the Securities and Exchange Commission, but they failed. And \nwhere you have the safe harbor provisions which have come back here \ncontrary to what has been asserted here, that there is no liability for \nforward-looking statements with cautionary statements no matter what \nthe intent. The Senate bill said, if there was a knowing misstatement, \nthat it not be covered by the safe harbor. That has been turned around \nby the conference report. What has come before us, Mr. President, I \nsubmit, is unreasonable, unrealistic, and imposes restraints which do \nnot protect investors. It does not strike an appropriate balance.\n  I would be glad to yield to my colleague from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. I was going to point out with regard \nto my colleague----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield for 30 seconds?\n  The point we made from ``particularity'' to ``specificity''--we can \nlose an audience here quickly in debate--that was recommended by the \njudicial conference. They are really responding to what they thought \nwas a better use of language there than what we incorporated in the \nbill. It was not a slight at all intended to be aimed at our colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania. The judicial conference recommended that word \nchange. They felt it would be better. That is why we adopted it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If my colleague would yield to me.\n  When you talk about particularity, it may not mean a lot on the \nSenate floor, but it means a lot in litigation, and billions can be \naffected by that kind of a pleading change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I rise in opposition to H.R. 1058, the Private \nSecurities Litigation Reform Act, and do so because voting against the \nconference report, I think, is in the best interests of the average \ninvestor, not only in my home State of Wisconsin but all across the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to note that this bill was \nproposed with the worthy goal of trying to limit frivolous litigation. \nIn particular, the goal was to stop the so-called strike suits that we \nhave heard so much about. I think there is no question that trying to \nstop that is a legitimate goal that we can all support. However, the \nevolution of this bill starting from its introduction to its \nmodification and initial passage in this body, to the conference report \nbefore us today has, Mr. President, been marked by a steady and \nunwarranted erosion of the basic protections the average investor in \nthis country expects and, in my opinion, deserves.\n  Simply calling this or any other piece of legislation a reform act \ndoes not make it so. The term ``reform'' implies that change is taking \nplace that will serve the greater good. Sadly, this measure fails to \nachieve this worthy goal. In fact, when one looks closely, it becomes \nevident to me that this bill will work to the detriment of hard-working \nAmericans who depend upon the securities laws to protect their savings \nand retirement and investments.\n  As many of my colleagues have noted, this bill seemingly gets worse \nwith each subsequent version that is placed before us. For example, the \nconference report expands the already flawed safe harbor provision \nwhich passed this body in July. The language of this bill protects \nforward-looking statements by insulating the maker of those statements \nfrom liability even if they are deliberately false, provided the \nstatement is accompanied by what is termed ``cautionary'' language. \nTherefore, in the face of a disclaimer, investors will be left with no \nrecourse against a corporate insider who makes predictions which were \ndeliberately false.\n  Furthermore, the conference report includes language contained in the \nHouse bill which explicitly states that there is absolutely no duty for \nany individual to update a forward-looking statement. What that means \nis even if it becomes apparent that a previously made forward-looking \nstatement is false, the person who made the statement has no legal \nobligation to inform anyone of this new knowledge. It is difficult to \nimagine that this provision can provide the average American investor \nwith any level of comfort or confidence.\n  Mr. President, beyond this baseless inequity, the bill also fails to \nremedy the inadequate statute of limitations period for bringing these \nvery complex cases of securities fraud. The failure to extend the \nstatute of limitations in the face of evidence that these cases often \ntake a great deal of time to discover and develop and prosecute is, in \nmy view, counter to the notion that securities law exists to protect \nthe investor.\n  The practical result of this failure will be that legitimate \nplaintiffs, through no fault of their own, will be turned away at the \ncourthouse door. This again, is hardly the kind of result you would \nexpect from something that has the label ``reform.''\n  There are other flaws in this legislation as well, including the \nfailure to hold liable those professionals, such as lawyers, \naccountants and underwriters, who aid and abet in the perpetration of \nsecurities fraud.\n  Additionally, the bill sets forth pleading thresholds that are very \ndifficult to attain. The effect is to require the establishment of \ncertain facts at the outset of a case, although the plaintiff, Mr. \nPresident, has had no opportunity to conduct any discovery. In setting \nthis unusual standard, the conference elected to drop an amendment \noffered by my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, which \npassed this body with 57 votes. It would have clarified that what was \nrequired to constitute a well-pleaded complaint was evidence that the \ndefendant had motive and opportunity to defraud, not actual proof of \nintent at that point.\n  The conference report, in making the plaintiff prove the case even \nbefore the \n\n[[Page S 17962]]\ncase has begun, goes a lot further than eliminating frivolous suits. \nWhat it will do is have an adverse and potentially detrimental effect \non legitimate cases as well.\n  The fee-shifting provisions of this bill will actually establish a \nharsher consequence for plaintiffs than for defendants who violate the \nFederal rules.\n  As Ed Huck, the director of the Alliance of Cities, in the Wisconsin \nState Journal, said:\n\n       Imagine city or county officials being swindled out of \n     millions of taxpayer dollars--and learning that they'll have \n     to risk millions more if they want to pursue a lawsuit. \n     That's what the ``loser-pays'' provision of this legislation \n     means--And, in a word, that's ``intimidation'' of crime \n     payers.\n\n  Mr. President, we should be wary of any legislation that has the \neffect of intimidating victims of fraud.\n  In short, Mr. President, this bill is unbalanced, misguided, and will \nharm thousands of Americans who bear no relation to the frivolous \nlawsuits that this bill is supposed to target.\n  There is no doubt that frivolous litigation, in any area of the law, \nis detrimental to our system of justice and to the society at large. \nHowever, the answer to these types of suits is not to foreclose the \nability of legitimate plaintiffs to protect themselves against fraud, \nnor is it to deprive them of the right to seek recovery in court when \nthey are defrauded.\n  In my opinion, the negative consequences of this unbalanced bill will \nbe significant and far reaching.\n  Mr. President, I note that the report that accompanied the original \nS. 240 pointed out the simple, but important, goal of American \nsecurities law, and that is to promote investor confidence in the \nsecurities market. Sadly, the provisions of this bill fall very short \nof attaining that fundamental goal.\n  We must be vigilant in our efforts to seek out and eliminate \nfrivolous litigation. However, equally as important is our obligation \nnot to lose sight of the average American investor, the person \ninvesting for retirement or to put children through college or simply \nto have a little better quality of life.\n  In our zeal to reform, it is protection of these people which must \nguide and inform our efforts.\n  So it is unfortunate that the provisions of this bill provide little \nmore than hollow comfort to the American investor, but such is the case \nwith H.R. 1058. In my opinion, the bill offers its alleged reform at a \nprice that cannot be justified. Protecting the American investor should \nnot be sacrificed in the misapplied name of ``reform.''\n  The securities laws of this Nation are essential to hard-working men \nand women all across America. Given that this conference report fails \nto uphold the tradition of protecting these hard-working men and women, \nI simply cannot support it. I intend to vote against this conference \nreport.\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada for his strong leadership on this \nissue. I yield back the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I understand that under the previous \norder, we now stand in recess for lunch?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We stand in recess until 2:15.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, prior to that action, I ask unanimous \nconsent that following Senator Hatch's presentation this afternoon, \nthat the senior Senator from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond, be \nrecognized for 15 minutes on a nongermane matter. This, I might note, \nis the senior Senator's 93d birthday, and he has asked for this time. I \nthink anyone who lives to that age and retains the faculties that the \nsenior Senator from South Carolina has ought to be given whatever it is \nhe asks for on his birthday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I have no objection, but I would further \nlike to amend the unanimous-consent request that following the 15 \nminutes of the distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina, to put \nSenator Boxer for 30 minutes, I am told, although it is not on our \ntime. And I just seek to clarify, Senator Reid has sought time.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask unanimous consent to include Senator Reid for 15 \nminutes following Senator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair inquires, is the time of Senator \nBoxer and Senator Reid to be charged against----\n  Mr. BRYAN. Senator Boxer's time will be charged to the Senator from \nNevada; Senator Reid's time, as I understand, will be charged to the \nSenator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask the Chair, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 hours and 24 minutes remaining for \nthe Senator from Utah; 2 hours and 13 minutes remaining for the Senator \nfrom Nevada.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/05/senate-section/article/S17933-5", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17962-S17963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in some ways parody is becoming reality. I \nrefer to the debate that is going on in the telecommunications \nconference over how we are to impose Government regulation over \nconstitutionally protected speech on the Internet.\n  Last year, the magazine PC Computing published an April Fool's \nparody. Let me tell you a little bit about it. It said that I \nintroduced a bill, No. 040194--for April 1, 1994--to ban drinking on \nthe information superhighway. According to the article, this bill that \nI supposedly introduced would prohibit anybody from using a public \ncomputer network while intoxicated. They also said there was a rider on \nthis bill to make it ``a felony to discuss sexual matters on any public \naccess network, including the Internet, America Online, and \nCompuServe.'' Senators were chided for thinking there is a physical \nhighway and that a permit was required to ``drive'' a modem on the \ninformation highway. The article noted that complaints about the \nimaginary bill are ``getting nowhere'' because ``who wants to come out \nand support drunkenness and computer sex?''\n  The parody concludes on a gloomy note, with the following words:\n\n       There is nothing to stop this bill from becoming law. You \n     can register your protests with your Congressperson or Ms. \n     Lirpa Sloof in the Senate Legislative Analyst's Office. Her \n     name spelled backwards says it all.\n\n  I enjoy using a computer, as a lot of us do, but sometimes some who \nuse them do not have a tremendous sense of humor, just as some Members \nof Congress do not. They did not notice that the name spelled backward \nis ``April fools.'' The bill number was April 1, 1994. It should have \ntold somebody something. But some actually thought this was real, and I \nstarted getting calls over the phone and messages over the Internet to \nmy office saying, ``What are you doing about this drunk driving on the \ninformation superhighway bill?'' But that was then, and that was a \njoke. Today, unfortunately for all Internet users, the debate taking \nplace in the telecommunications conference about imposing far-reaching \nnew crimes for indecent speech over the Internet is not a parody but \nvery real.\n  The conferees have been meeting and going over this enormous task \ndetermining how parts of telecommunications would work, how you \nregulate cable operators, wireless systems, and how you protect \nuniversal service. You would think they would not have time to look at \nsomething like cyberporn, but that seems to be one major consideration \nthey have. Even though there are no members of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee at that conference, they are trying to figure out how to make \nnew Federal crimes as part of the telecommunications bill.\n  The Senate, of course, passed the Exon-Coats Communications Decency \nAct, which would punish with a 2-year jail term any Internet user who \nposted a message with indecent language or used a four-letter word in a \nmessage to \n\n[[Page S 17963]]\na minor. As originally written, it would make it illegal to receive \nindecent material whether or not the user knew the material was \nindecent at the time he downloaded it. Service providers would also \nrisk criminal liability and fines for their subscribers' use of \nindecent language.\n  Now, we have to ask ourselves if this makes such sense. We saw what \nhappened in Vermont last week. A Vermonter from Underhill, VT, found \nthat her personal profile on America Online had been deleted. She asked \nwhy it was deleted and was told it was because vulgar words were used \non it. So she checked to see what was the vulgar word. The word \n``breast'' was used. Why? Because she was a breast cancer survivor and \nwas using America Online to correspond with other breast cancer \nsurvivors. So, this word came up and because of hypersensitivity over \nCongress being worried about words used on the Internet, she was yanked \noff. This is ridiculous in this day and age.\n\n  One wonders if, in the future, recipes for chicken cacciatore sent \nonline will only call for dark meat to avoid using the ``B-'' word.\n  We should understand there are plenty of laws on the books that apply \nto the Internet by banning obscenity, child pornography and threats \nfrom being a distributed. What we are talking about is regulating \nconstitutionally protected speech. One proposal under consideration by \nthe conference would impose penalties on anybody who transmits \nprotected speech if it is considered indecent.\n  In addition to effectively banning indecent speech, the conference is \nconsidering proposals to impose criminal liability on both the speakers \nof indecent content as well as online service providers. The result \nwould be to draft the service providers into the role of Net police. \nService providers like America Online and Prodigy, telephone companies \nproviding modem connections, and libraries and schools hooking our \nNation's children up to this brilliant new medium would face the risk \nof being fined and even jailed.\n  To avoid liability, service providers, libraries, and schools would \nbear the onus of asserting complicated defenses to prosecution. The \nimplications of being hauled into court in the first place--especially \nfor schools and libraries--should not go unnoticed. Many providers will \nseek to avoid the risk of litigation altogether by censoring all online \nspeech to that appropriate for kindergarten children, or refusing to \nserve children at all.\n  These extreme proposals on the table in the telecommunications \nconference would leave online communications in a severely \ndisadvantaged position in our society. While Newsweek magazine's recent \ncover story trumpeted the vision of the computer mogul Bill Gates, the \nU.S. Congress is simultaneously poised to shut down this new medium and \nvastly change the landscape of the information age. We must stop being \npaternalistic Luddites and embrace our new communications potential.\n  Because indecency means very different things to different people, an \nunimaginable amount of valuable political, artistic, scientific and \nother speech will disappear in this new medium. What about, for \nexample, the university health service that posts information online \nabout birth control and protections against the spread of AIDS? With \nmany students in college under 18, this information would likely \ndisappear under threat of prosecution.\n  I understand that Representative White will make an alternative \nproposal to the telecommunications conference tomorrow. His proposal \navoids regulating constitutionally protected speech, and limits any \nregulation to materials harmful to minors. This is a step in the right \ndirection, but still leaves Internet users guessing at what may be \nconsidered harmful to minors in different areas of this diverse \ncountry.\n  The Internet and other computer networks hold enormous promise for \nenhancing our lives in ways that would have been unthinkable only a \nbrief decade ago. But the growth of this network will no doubt be \nchilled if users fear that they risk criminal liability by using \nparticular words that might, in some jurisdictions, be considered \nindecent. Or, if service providers simply refuse to provide Internet \naccess to children under 18 years of age, due to the risk of criminal \nliability.\n  I have written, along with several other Members, to the chairman and \nranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee urging the conferees to \nappreciate the implications that these proposals will have for the \nInternet. They should not rush consideration of these weighty issues. \nThis is a great new communications medium and the conference should \ndeliberate carefully before it gives its blessing to new crimes for \nsaying things that some people, some where in this country, may deem to \nbe indecent for children.\n  We should all be concerned lest the parody becomes reality.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/05/senate-section/article/S17962-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17963-S17964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CENSORING THE INTERNET\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to follow the \nSenator from Vermont who spent a few minutes to address a matter which \nwas reported by the news media throughout the country this weekend in \nwhich the Senator from Vermont referred to and has a great relevance to \nlegislation which the Senate passed this summer and will consider soon \nagain.\n  The telecommunications conferees may within the next 24 hours decide \nwhether this Congress is going to take the unwise step of censoring the \nInternet.\n  I am speaking of the Communications Decency Act which passed the \nSenate overwhelmingly as an amendment to the telecommunications \nderegulation bill in June. The Communications Decency Act contained \ncriminal penalties for the transmission of constitutionally protected \nspeech over computer networks. The penalty for transmitting indecent \nspeech which might be accessed by a minor was up to 2 years in prison \nand fines of up to $100,000. Indecency, unlike obscenity, is \nconstitutionally protected. Indecent language has thus far, only been \ndefined by the FCC in regard to the time, place, and manner in which it \nmay be transmitted. The definition includes the so-called seven-dirty \nwords including what some might call mild profanity.\n  When this legislation was offered as an amendment in the Senate, I \nobjected for a number of reasons. My fundamental concern was, and \ncontinues to be, that prohibitions on speech labeled indecent are \nunconstitutional. While courts have upheld restrictions on indecency to \nminors on other some forms of media, the Communications Decency Act \nwould restrict communications between adults as well. The legislation, \nas passed by the Senate, could subject consenting adults communicating \nover a public USENET group to criminal penalties if their conversation \ntook place in a forum that was accessed by a minor. I believe that not \nonly is that unacceptable, it is also unconstitutional. Adults should \nnot have to self-censor their words over public information forums. A \nprofane exchange between two adults on a street corner which is \noverheard by a child would not subject those adults to criminal \nsanctions. However, if that exchange occurred on a public forum over \nthe Internet and a child accessed that forum, those same adults could \nland in jail.\n  During the floor debate, I raised serious concerns that the \nCommunications Decency Act would have a chilling effect on computer \nnetworks, forcing adults to self-censor their words to what is \nappropriate for the youngest of children in the most conservative \ncommunities in the country. I, along with my colleague from Vermont, \nSenator Leahy, suggested that this type of censorship would also have a \nchilling effect on the many socially valuable forums that exist via the \nInternet. There exist currently many on-line support groups for child \nabuse victims, rape victims, victims of disease, for those coping with \nAIDS, and other social issues. In addition, there exist chat groups, \nbulletin boards and USENET groups to discuss presumably adult topics \nwhich might contain the seven dirty words or other adult language. I \nsuggested that the Communications Decency Act would suppress those \ntypes of forums, limit the content of the discussions within those \nforums, and ultimately result in their termination. \n\n[[Page S 17964]]\n\n  The proponents of the Communications Decency Act assured the Senate \nthat such was not the intent of the amendment. In fact, Mr. President, \nsome suggested that these types of concerns were raised in an effort to \nspin the issue. They suggested these fears were not real and were not \nlikely to be realized.\n  I suggest to Members of this body that news reports over the weekend \nconfirm just how quickly those fears could be realized if the \nCommunications Decency Act became law. One of the companies providing \non-line services to consumers, America Online, in an effort to screen \nout filthy, vulgar and obscene language, apparently included the word \n``breast'' in the list of prohibited words on AOL's services.\n  Mr. President, the word ``breast'' has been used many times on the \nSenate floor with respect to health care legislation, is not even among \nthe so-called seven dirty words. It is not indecent. It is not profane. \nYet it was screened out by a service which has been under tremendous \nfire for not policing its networks carefully enough.\n  Of course, the deletion of the word breast was met with an enormous \noutcry by women who participate in a breast cancer survivors online \nsupport group. According to press reports the deletion of the word \nbreast from allowable AOL language became known when an AOL subscriber \ncreated her member profile identifying herself as a breast cancer \nsurvivor. She received a message from AOL indicating she could not use \n``vulgar words.'' AOL soon was barraged by complaints by other users of \nthe breast cancer survivors chat room. The word ``breast'' was \nsubsequently allowed back on the service. However, an AOL spokesperson \ncaveated that with ``as long as it is used in an appropriate manner.''\n  I mention this incident not to fault America Online. They are \nresponding to a series of calls by interest groups, Members of \nCongress, and others to police speech over their services and to keep \nAOL family friendly. AOL like other on-line service providers is \nanticipating additional Government restrictions on speech over the \nInternet. When under the threat of Government imposed speech \nrestrictions and potential criminal sanctions, it is quite reasonable \nto overreact, to be overly cautious, and to restrict more than that \nwhich is necessary.\n  Mr. President, this is exactly what I fear will happen if the \nCommunications Decency Act becomes public law. Words will be banned. \nSpeech will be restricted. This, Mr. President, is the chilling effect \nthat Senator Leahy and I referred to on the Senate floor just 5 months \nago. Perfectly reasonable and acceptable language will be restricted \nand prohibited.\n  Mr. President, while it may seem ridiculous that the word ``breast'' \nwas, at least for a short period of time, considered vulgar, it would \nnot be unreasonable for a company like AOL to restrict such words if \nthe Communications Decency Act becomes law. Indecency is a largely \nundefined term. We know how the FCC has defined indecency for \nbroadcast, but it is unclear what would be indecent on computer \nnetworks. If such restrictions are imposed, people will err on the side \nof caution in their speech. Under the Communications Decency Act, to \nprotect themselves from criminal liability, on-line services will \nlikely find themselves prohibiting the word ``breast'' as well as many \nother words. Adults with direct Internet access will also be forced to \nself-censor their speech, guessing what might be indecent, and guessing \nwho might access their communications.\n\n  In Saturday's Chicago Tribune, Barbara LeStage, a member of the \nAmerican Cancer Society, commented on the AOL prohibition on the use of \nthe word ``breast''. Her comments, I think are fairly insightful. She \nstated\n\n       I don't have any problem with AOL trying to keep dirty \n     words off their service. But I don't consider breast to be a \n     dirty word. If you have people who see it as dirty, for \n     whatever reason, then this [prohibition on use] is going to \n     continue to happen.\n\n  Mr. President, Ms. LeStage is exactly right. If indecency is going to \nbe outlawed and the term therefore defined by community standards and \nthe courts, this will continue to happen. People differ in their \nbeliefs about what is appropriate for children, about what is dirty, \nvulgar or indecent. To some individuals even extreme profanity may not \nbe indecent, to others, perhaps the word ``breast'' is indecent. When \nAOL determined that ``breast'' would be allowed under appropriate \ncircumstances, we must wonder under what circumstance would it be \ninappropriate and who decides.\n  This is the danger of government censorship of the Internet. Who \ndefines what can be said without criminal sanctions? Who defines what \nis indecent? Who defines when certain terms are used appropriately and \nwhen they are not?\n  Mr. President, Congress has entered a very dangerous area in its \nattempt to restrict constitutionally protected speech on the Internet. \nIn the next 24 hours, the Telecommunications conferees will decide \nwhich road to take--that of Government excess or that of caution.\n  I urge the conferees to err on the side of caution and to protect \nfirst amendment rights of Internet users. Such a goal is not \ninconsistent with our overriding objective of protecting children. \nTechnology exists now to allow parents to screen out materials they \nfind objectionable for their children. Obscenity, child pornography, \nand solicitation of minors via the Internet is already a violation of \ncriminal law and is being aggressively prosecuted by the Department of \nJustice.\n  I urge my colleagues not to take the step toward censorship. I \nbelieve we will immediately regret it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina is to be recognized to speak.\n  Mr. SIMON. I have the consent of my colleague from South Carolina to \nspeak for 2 minutes, if there is no objection, and I ask unanimous \nconsent to speak.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, I have to be at a \nnegotiating session at 3 o'clock. I introduced this bill 4 years ago, \nso I ask if maybe I could have some time before 3 o'clock, 10 minutes \nor something?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I suggest that we grant the unanimous-\nconsent request of the Senator from Illinois, during which time--not to \nbe disrespectful to his announcement--we sort out the time on this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair must clarify that under the previous \norder, the Senator from Utah is to be recognized, then the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  Mr. SIMON. I ask my colleague from Utah if he would permit me to \nspeak for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/05/senate-section/article/S17963-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17964-S17965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CONGRATULATING THE NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY WILDCATS\n\n  Mr. SIMON.

Mr. President, last week, the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee conducted a hearing with national security, foreign policy \nand intelligence experts, who were all former executive branch \nofficials under Presidents Bush, Reagan, and Carter. All three \nwitnesses supported deploying United States military forces to Bosnia \nto implement the peace plan because they believe it is critical to \npreserve the credibility and reliability of the United States as a \nworld leader and as a member of the North Atlantic Alliance. While the \nthree witnesses endorsed the deployment of U.S. military forces to \nimplement the agreement, they also highlighted their concerns about the \nlikelihood of disaster and questioned the ability of the implementation \nforce to achieve any meaningful mission objectives. In fact, the \nwitnesses all agreed that the best that could be hoped for would be to \nsustain the ceasefire for the time period that NATO forces are in the \nregion.\n  Last week, the President traveled to Europe to visit with our allies, \nand speak with the young men and women of the 1st Armored Division \nstationed in Germany who are to be deployed to Bosnia very shortly. One \nSunday, President Clinton was briefed on the NATO implementation plan, \nand gave his conditional approval to the concept. Following that \nconditional approval, the President authorized the deployment of around \n700 United States troops who will lay the goundwork for the arrival of \nthe main body of the NATO Implementation Forces, who will deploy to \nBosnia once the peace agreement is formally signed in Paris next week.\n  President Clinton spoke to the troops, informing them of the United \nStates national interests that warrant their deployment to Bosnia to \nenforce the peace agreement. The President assured the troops that \ntheir mission is clear, limited and achievable and that the risks to \ntheir safety will be minimized. According to the director for strategic \nplans and policy in the office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Wes \nClark, all U.S. forces should be in the region within 30 days of the \nformal signing of the agreement in Paris on December 14.\n  According to the Department of Defense, the overall concept of the \nmission of the implementation force will be to monitor and enforce \ncompliance with the military aspects of the Dayton peace agreement.\n  The military tasks of the Dayton agreement include: Supervise the \nceasefire lines and zones of separation; monitor, and if necessary \nenforce the withdrawal of forces to their respective territories within \nthe agreed time periods; establish and man the 4-kilometer zone of \nseparation; establish liaison with local military and civilian \nauthorities; and create joint military commissions to resolve disputes \nbetween the parties.\n  All implementation forces, NATO and non-NATO, will operate under NATO \nrules of engagement. Those rules of engagement will permit the right to \nuse force up to and including deadly force for self-defense to protect \nagainst hostile acts or hostile intentions, and, in order to accomplish \nthe mission.\n  Despite a briefing by the President, the Secretary of Defense, and \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as congressional \nhearings this past week with administration officials, I continue to \nhave grave concerns and questions about the clarify of the mission, and \nwhether the goals and objectives of the mission can be achieved within \nthe limited deployment framework.\n  I know that our young military men and women are well-trained, the \nbest equipped in the world and ready to go. What I am most concerned \nabout is whether all their training and equipment will have prepared \nthem for the sniper fire, the landmines, the terrible terrain and \nweather in which they will have to live. I am also concerned about \npossible kidnapings that could occur and how our troops will be \ntreated. Will they be treated as prisoners of war, or political or \nlegal detainees.\n  In 1945, United States military forces were sent into to an area near \nTuzla to keep Yugoslavian partisan out of Trieste. We were not \nofficially at war, but the partisans resented the presence of the U.S. \nforces and ambushed U.S. patrols and aircraft with sniper fire, \nlandmines, and booby traps. It took 9 years for an agreement to be \nreached before the 1 year mission was completed and U.S. forces came \nhome.\n  Mr. President, there are already signs of dissensions among the \nparties to the agreement. The Serbs continue to press for \na renegotiation because the agreement would require Sarajevo to come \nunder control of the Moslem-Croat federation and Serbian civilians feel \nthey will not be protected. Our French allies have raised concerns that \ntheir troops could become trapped if there is renewed fighting. \nAdditionally, the United States is being viewed as being partial to the \nBosnians as a result of their support and there is a feeling that \nUnited States military forces will not be impartial.\n\n  As I stated earlier, in statements on the floor and in hearings, I \ncontinue to have grave concerns about the vital interests that have \nlead the President to commit U.S. military forces to implement this \npeace agreement. I am not yet convinced that we have a vital national \ninterest in Bosnia that requires the deployment of United States \nmilitary forces, or that our national security interests are being \nthreatened.\n  On Wednesday, Secretary of Defense Perry, Assistant Secretary \nHolbrooke and General Shalikashvili will appear before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. I intend to ask more questions about the mission, \nobjectives of the mission and the timeframe, the exit strategy; why it \nis necessary to have over 60,000 heavily armed military forces with \narmored vehicles as peacekeepers; how the implementation forces will \nseparate the opposing forces; and how the U.S. military forces will \navoid taking on nonmilitary tasks, when it appears that the civilian \nhumanitarian services and operations will take at least 6 months to \nbegin operation.\n  Mr. President, I do not intend to rubberstamp a commitment by the \nPresident. I will reserve final judgement until after the hearings have \ntaken place, and then make a final decision.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/05/senate-section/article/S17965-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17965-S17991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report. \n\n\n[[Page S 17966]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nconference report to H.R. 1058, the Private Securities Litigation \nReform Act of 1995. I was an original cosponsor of the Senate bill, S. \n240, and am a strong supporter of the conference report.\n  This legislation will protect investors and consumers, while \nremedying abuses that have plagued securities issuers and companies--\nparticularly in cases in which attorneys have used class action \nlawsuits to force settlements on parties that have done no wrong.\n  It is my hope that President Clinton will defend the interests of the \nAmerican people by signing this legislation, rather than favor the \ntrial lawyers who would benefit from his veto.\n  In my view, this conference report represents a significant step \ntowards addressing some of the egregious litigation abuses seen in the \nlegal system today. On a related front, the Senate's product liability \nbill is going to conference, and it is my hope that in the future \nCongress will pass more broad-ranging litigation reforms that will \naffect the entire civil justice system.\n  I would like to extend my gratitude to Senator D'Amato, Senator Dodd, \nand Senator Domenici for their hard work in bringing this significant \nand well-drafted legislation to fruition. This bill has been perfected \nover several congresses and is the result of a strong bipartisan \neffort.\n  Abusive securities litigation lawsuits have imposed a high and \nharmful tax on American businesses. Because of the fear of being sued--\nand the high costs associated with securities lawsuits--many companies \nhave declined to go public. Other companies have declined to make \ninnovations or disseminate certain information.\n  The unfortunate irony is that, while securities litigation laws were \ndesigned to safeguard investors, in reality the current system ends up \nhurting investors.\n  The current system hurts investors who could have invested \nsuccessfully in those companies that decided not to go public due to \nfears of litigation.\n  It also harms investors who could have earned greater profits on \ntheir shares had the companies they invested in been more profitable--\nfor example, if those companies had been able to invest more money in \nresearch and development rather than wasting it on securities \nlitigation costs. Not only have investors gotten hurt, but certain \nlawyers have raked in exorbitant fees.\n  Companies have all too often been reluctant to disclose information \nfor fear that doing so will provoke a lawsuit. That goes completely \nagainst the grain of the securities laws, which are designed to \nencourage openness and full information in the securities markets.\n  The conference report addresses some of the worst abuses that have \nbeen seen in securities litigation. At the same time, the Report \npreserves and reinforces the core values of the American stock market--\nintegrity, openness, and the free exchange of information.\n  The conference report does so through a number of specific measures.\n  The legislation provides that discovery is stayed whenever a motion \nto dismiss is pending in a securities action.\n  Discovery costs have been estimated to account for 80 percent of the \ncosts of defending a lawsuit in a securities action. The burden of this \ntime-consuming and expensive discovery process will accordingly be \nsignificantly reduced. That should remove some of the skewed incentives \nthat have frequently forced companies to settle securities lawsuits \neven when they have done no wrong.\n  The conference report specifically addresses abuses involving the use \nof so-called professional plaintiffs as lead plaintiffs in securities \naction lawsuits. Many plaintiffs have been motivated to file suit to \nreceive a bounty payment or bonus.\n  There has also all too often been a race to the courthouse by \nplaintiffs' lawyers seeking to be the first to file a complaint in a \nsecurities action. Lawyers representing a class are often appointed by \nthe court on a first come, first serve basis: the first lawsuit filed \ndetermines who will serve as lead plaintiff and who will be the lead \nattorney.\n  In many cases, the professional plaintiff has not even reviewed the \ncomplaint filed against the defendant. This legislation will require \nthe lead plaintiff to file a sworn certified statement along with the \ncomplaint, stating: First that the plaintiff has reviewed and \nauthorized the filing of the complaint; second that the plaintiff did \nnot purchase the security involved at the request of an attorney or to \nbe a party to the securities action; and third that the plaintiff is \nwilling to serve as the lead plaintiff for the class.\n  A lead plaintiff may not serve as a lead plaintiff in a securities \naction more than five times in 3 years. The legislation also limits the \nclass representative's recovery to the lead plaintiff's pro rata share \nof the settlement or final judgment. These provisions limit some of the \nskewed incentives that have led to the rise of professional plaintiffs.\n  Once a securities litigation class action lawsuit has been filed, the \ncourt will then determine separately which plaintiff is the most \nadequate plaintiff. Any party who has received notice of the suit may \npetition the court to serve as lead plaintiff within 60 days of when \nthe suit was filed. In determining which plaintiff is the most adequate \nplaintiff, the court determines which party has the greatest financial \ninterest in the lawsuit.\n  The most adequate plaintiff selects the lead attorney and negotiates \nattorneys' fees. That plaintiff also weighs in on settlement decisions \nand other significant decisions pertaining to the lawsuit.\n  The legislation also provides improved settlement notice to class \nmembers. Class members will have to be provided notice of a proposed \nsettlement and specified information. That information would include, \nif the parties agree on a figure, the average amount of damages per \nshare that would be recoverable or, if the parties do not agree an a \nparticular amount, a statement from each party as to why there is \ndisagreement.\n  Notice must also include an explanation of the attorneys' fees and \ncosts involved; the name, telephone number, and address of the class \nlawyer; and a brief statement explaining the reasons for the proposed \nsettlement. Those provisions will improve the information provided to \nindividual shareholders and increase the involvement of individual \nclass members in litigation decisions.\n  The conference report also limits attorneys' fees to a reasonable \npercentage of the amount of recovery awarded to the class.\n  On a separate note, this legislation creates a modified system of \nproportionate liability, under which each co-defendant is generally \nresponsible for only the share of damages that that defendant caused to \nthe plaintiff.\n  To balance plaintiffs' needs, however, there is a provision to \nprotect plaintiffs from insolvent codefendants. Where defendants have \ncommitted a knowing securities violation, those defendants will be \njointly and severally liable for damages. Also, in the case of an \ninsolvent codefendant, a proportionately liable codefendant would \nprovide additional damages to up to 150 percent of its share of the \ndamages.\n  There is even an additional, special protection for small investors: \nall defendants will be jointly and severally liable for uncollectible \nshares of insolvent codefendants for plaintiffs whose damages are more \nthan 10 percent of their net worth, and whose net worth is less than \n$200,000.\n  This legislation is proconsumer and protects small investors.\n  In a separate measure, the legislation adopts the second circuit \npleading standard so that, in a securities action, plaintiffs must \nstate facts with particularity, and those facts must give rise to a \nstrong inference of scienter or intent. This should help weed out at an \nearly stage lawsuits filed against innocent defendants.\n  The bill also includes a cocalled safe harbor provision to protect \nforward-looking, predictive statements.\n  It structures damages so that they will reflect real losses rather \nthan fortuitous market fluctuations.\n  Finally, the proposed legislation would establish new civil penalties \nagainst independent public accountants who fail to inform corporate \nofficers of any illegal acts they discover while performing audits. \nThat further protects investors.\n  In short, this legislation should protect individuals and free up \nresources that have imposed substantial and needless litigation costs \non American businesses in Utah and all across this country. \n\n[[Page S 17967]]\n\n  As I noted, I would like to see Congress take a more comprehensive \nlook at litigation abuses across the civil justice system. This \nlegislation is certainly a significant step in that direction. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to achieve broader reforms.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, as modified, the \nSenator from New Mexico is recognized for up to 10 minutes, to be \nfollowed by the Senator from California for up to 30 minutes, to then \nbe followed by the Senator from Nevada for up to 15 minutes.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is now recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Utah, the floor \nmanager, for arranging the time and for his diligent work.\n  Let me, right up front, indicate that there are many Senators and \nmany Members of the House who deserve credit for getting this bill \nbefore us in this conference report. I personally want to thank the \nchairman of the Banking Committee, Senator D'Amato, because without his \nguidance and total commitment we would not be here.\n  I want to thank my original cosponsor, Senator Chris Dodd. Actually, \nthe two of us fought a lonesome battle until this year. It looked like \nthis would never happen. But with the change in the Congress, and the \nWhite House making some changes in the way they thought about this, we \nare here today with a bill that I understand the President may very \nwell sign.\n  What are we doing here and why are we here? First of all, let me talk \na little bit about an industry in America. In recent days there has \nbeen much conversation about the executive officer of Microsoft Corp. \nThat is a high-technology industry, an industry that is involved in \ncomputers and everything that goes with it and the entire high-\ntechnology community of interest.\n  The high-technology, high-growth companies are the backbone of the \nAmerica's economy and are vital to our ability to compete in a growing \nglobal market. We can no longer allow abusive lawsuits to stifle these \ncompanies' abilities to pursue new technologies and create new jobs.\n  The high-technology companies contribute about $400 billion in goods \nand services in the United States. They employ 2\\1/2\\ million people, \nwhich is 14 percent of the total manufacturing jobs in America. High-\ntechnology jobs are some of the best jobs also. The average salary is \n$42,000 per worker, and high technology is a larger segment of our \neconomy than transportation, aviation, and the auto industry combined. \nIt is a rapidly growing part of our economy and it is our future.\n  In my small State alone, there are 305 electronics firms with 16,000 \nhigh technology, high-paying jobs with a total payroll of $609 million, \nand they produce approximately $2.5 billion in goods and services.\n  From my standpoint, this bill will make their jobs more secure. It \nwill make those companies that I have just described as a backbone of a \nnew kind of industrial revolution in America more successful rather \nthan less, and no one will be hurt in the process.\n  Let me right up front refer to four letters. It does not look like \nseveral letters because it is enormously thick, but there are four \nletters signed by about 1,000 chief executive officers and presidents \nof electronics and high-technology firms. The letters are not directed \nto the Senator from New Mexico or to the Senator from Utah or to the \nSenator from Nevada. They are directed to the President of the United \nStates. In short, these letters are urging the President to sign this \nbill because it is good for their growth and the jobs and the well-\nbeing of the thousands of workers they represent.\n  Mr. President, Federal securities law that we are considering here \ntoday provides a comprehensive legal framework designed to do three \nthings:\n  First, protect investors in the securities market. Let me repeat \nthat. First, protect investors in the securities market.\n  Second, provide ground rules for companies seeking to raise money in \nour capital markets.\n  And, third, to encourage disclosure of more accurate information \nabout publicly traded companies.\n  The trend is opposite to that third point because of the lawsuits \nthat follow when information is disseminated.\n  This bill updates our securities laws to better achieve these \nobjectives and in a better, balanced way. When the U.S. Supreme Court \ncreated the implied right of action--the class action--it noted that \n``litigation under rule 10(b)(5) presents a danger of vexatiousness \ndifferent in degree and kind from that which accompanies litigation in \ngeneral,'' citation of the case, close quote.\n  ``Vexatiousness'' is not a word that I use very often, nor do I hear \nit used very often. It comes from the verb ``to vex,'' which means to \nharass, to torment, to annoy, to irritate, and to worry. As a noun, it \nis synonymous with troublesome. In the legal context, it means a case \nwithout sufficient grounds in order to cause annoyance to the defendant \nor proceedings instituted maliciously and without probable cause.\n  In these frivolous securities class action cases, the lawyer hires \nthe client instead of the other way around. It sounds a lot like \nmodern-day champerty. In law school we studied about this thing called \nchamperty. That is another word that is not heard very often. But it \nexisted where a person assisted another with money to carry out his \nlawsuit. In times past, someone who would pay for, in whole or in part, \nthe cost of litigation was engaged in champerty, including doing things \nthat tend to obstruct the course of justice or to promote unnecessary \nlitigation. It was such a serious offense that not too many years ago \nit was against the law.\n  This bill will hopefully curb this modern-day champerty, stop the \nvexatiousness and restore integrity to our security laws by filtering \nout abusive, frivolous class action lawsuits that harm investors and \nonly benefit the class action attorneys. Senator Bennett made a very \ngood point earlier today: The company is the investors. We can no \nlonger allow entrepreneurial lawyers to squeeze the research and \ndevelopment budgets, to depress dividend yields to all investors for \nthe benefit of a few professional plaintiffs. We can no longer allow \nlawyers to muzzle the chief executive officers from making predictions \nand statements about the future of their companies.\n  Professional advisers, like accountants and outside directors, should \nnot be held 100 percent liable just because they are deep pockets. This \nbill will force lawyers to be good lawyers and lawsuits to have merit.\n  This bill recognizes that stock volatility is not stock fraud. Let me \nrepeat that. This bill recognizes that stock prices go up and down--\nthat is stock volatility--it is not stock fraud. It recognizes that all \ninvestors benefit when there is more disclosure of information. It \nrecognizes that predictions about the future are valuable information \nto investors. It recognizes that predictions may not come true. Such \nstatements are predictions, not promises.\n  In the safe harbor provision that is currently in the bill before us, \nthere are really three safe harbors. I will not go through all of them, \nbut I will refer to the third one which has received most of the \nattention. It is a variation of the ``bespeaks caution'' doctrine. We \ntried to make it workable and not too cumbersome. The chief executive \nofficer needs to identify the statement as a forward-looking statement, \nneeds to provide meaningful cautionary statements and needs to identify \nsome important factors that tell the audience why the prediction may \nnot come true.\n  This bill retains the two-tiered liability. We wanted to change the \neconomics of these cases so that the merits will once again matter. \nPeople should not be sued because they have deep pockets or a lot of \ninsurance. We created special rules so that small investors will be \nmade whole in the event of an insolvent codefendant who cannot pay \ninvestors for their losses.\n  We required disclosure of settlement terms and lawyers fees in plain \nEnglish so that investors will know what they might recover and how \nmuch of the settlement fund the lawyers are asking for. And, in a \nsense, this makes the system much better in 12 ways:\n  First, it puts investors with real financial interests, not lawyers \nin charge of the case. It puts investors with real financial interests, \nnot professional plaintiffs with one or two shares of stock in charge \nof the case. \n\n[[Page S 17968]]\n\n  The provisions that accomplish this include most adequate plaintiff; \nplaintiff certification; ban on bonus payments to pet plaintiffs; \nsettlement term disclosure; attorney compensation reform; sanctions for \nlawyers filing frivolous cases; restrictions on secret settlements and \nattorneys fees.\n  Second, it provides for notification to investors that a lawsuit has \nbeen filed so that all investors can decide if they really want to \nbring a lawsuit.\n  It is likely that the people trusted to manage pension funds and \nmutual funds [the institutional investors] will get more involved. \n(Most adequate plaintiff provision).\n  Third, it puts the lawyers and his clients on the same side. This is \naccomplished by reforms that change economics of cases, in particular, \nproportionate liability, settlement terms disclosure.\n  Fourth, it prohibits special side-deals where pet plaintiffs get an \nextra $10,000 or $15,000.\n  It protects all investors, not just the lawyers' pet plaintiffs, so \nthat settlements will be fair for all investors.\n  Fifth, it stops brokers from selling names of investors to lawyers.\n  Sixth, it creates environment where CEO's can, and will talk about \ntheir predictions about the future without being sued.\n  It gives investors a system with better disclosure of important \ninformation. (Safe harbor).\n  Seventh, better disclosure of how much a shareholder might get under \na settlement and how much the lawyers will get so that shareholders can \nchallenge excessive lawyers fees.\n  Eighth, no more secret settlements where attorneys can keep their \nfees a secret. (Restrictions on settlements under seal).\n  Ninth, it limits amounts that attorneys can take off the top. Limits \nattorneys' fees to reasonable amount instead of confusing calculations. \n(Attorney compensation reform, limiting lodestar method of calculating \nfees).\n  Tenth, it provides a uniform rule about what constitutes a legitimate \nlawsuit so that it will no longer matter where a case is filed. \nInvestors in Albuquerque will have the same rules as investors in New \nYork. (Pleading reform).\n  It stops fishing expeditions where lawyers demand thousands of \ncompany documents before the judge can decide if the complaint is so \nsloppy that it should be dismissed on its face. (Discovery stay).\n  Eleventh, it makes merits matter so that strong cases recover more \nthan weak cases. Makes sure people committing fraud compensate victims. \nImproves upon the current system so that victims will recover more than \n6 cents on the dollar.\n  Twelfth, by weeding out frivolous cases, it gives the lawyers and \njudges more time to do a good job in protecting investors in \nmeritorious cases. High-technology companies' executives can focus on \nrunning their companies and growing their businesses. Investors will \nget higher stock prices and bigger dividends.\n  America needs securities litigation reform for many reasons. One \nreason we need this legislation is because the system as it currently \noperates encourages a race to the courthouse to file poorly researched, \nkitchen sink complaints by entrepreneurial class action lawyers \nunconcerned with the merits of their cases. These lawyers know that it \nis very easy to allege securities fraud, and they often use the current \nsystem's liberal pleading rules to extort settlements from innocent \ncompanies.\n  Entrepreneurial plaintiffs' lawyers favorite targets are usually \nhigh-technology, start-up firms which cannot bear the costs of fighting \neven the most frivolous lawsuit. Over the past 4 years a total of $2.5 \nbillion has been paid in settlements in securites class action cases. \nThis is money that could have been better spent on enhanced research \nand development, product development and high paying job creation.\n  Even when small, high-technology companies are forced to surrender \nand settle abusive suits without much of a fight, they still must \ndivert important scarce resources toward the lawsuit and away from job \ncreation and product development. Testimony at congressional hearings \non securities litigation reform indicated that the typical frivolous \nsecurities lawsuit costs $8.6 million and 1,000 hours of management \ntime just to settle the case.\n  John Adler, president and CEO of Adaptec, Inc. told the Senate \nBanking Committee that the money his company spent fighting a frivolous \nsecurities lawsuit would have paid for 20 additional engineers. Intel \nspent $500,000 in 1991 just to have two abusive cases withdrawn. That \nmoney would have paid for 10 production workers or 5 engineers at its \nfacility in my home State. Legent Computer Corp. spent nearly $2 \nmillion in legal fees and several million dollars to comply with the \nplaintiffs' lawyers request for 290,000 pages of documents, even though \na judge eventually dismissed the lawyers' complaint. Numbers like these \nmake me realize that we need to change the current winner pays system, \nwhere innocent companies must expend vast amounts of time and resources \njust to get an abusive suit dismissed.\n  High-technology and high growth companies form the backbone of our \neconomy and the foundation of our ability to compete in the growing \nglobal marketplace. They create jobs and grow the economy. We can no \nlonger allow these abusive lawsuits to stifle our companies' ability to \npursue new technologies and create new jobs. The general counsel of \nIntel Corp. told us during a hearing that had Intel been sued when it \nwas a startup company, the lawsuit likely would have decimated its \nresearch and development budget and prevented it from inventing the \nsemiconductor. Thousands of jobs would be in Japan instead of America.\n  Entrepreneurial lawyers also like to sue deep-pocketed professional \nadvisers, like accountants and lawyers, even if they are only \nmarginally involved in the alleged fraud. Under the current law rule of \njoint and several liability, these advisers can be made to pay the \nentire multimillion dollar judgment, even if they were unaware of any \nwrongdoing. That is because the current law says that if you conduct an \naudit or sign an opinion letter for a client who violates the \nsecurities laws, then you should have known of the wrongdoing. Because \nthey face potentially massive liability for their relatively innocent \nconduct, auditors and lawyers often settle rather than fight the \nabusive lawsuit. Studies show that naming an accountant in a lawsuit \nadds 30 percent to its settlement value. Rather than continue to face \nunfair joint and several liability, auditors and lawyers have begun to \nrefuse to advise startup firms most susceptible to abusive lawsuits. \nThis hurts the companies and ultimately their shareholders.\n  Part of the problem is the race to the courthouse by entrepreneurial \nclass action lawyers, who file lawsuits within hours of news that a \ncompany came up short on an earnings projection or will be forced to \ndelay the introduction of a new product. Information provided to the \nSenate Banking Committee by the National Association of Securities and \nCommercial Law Attorneys [NASCAT] reveals that 21 percent of the cases \nare filed within 48 hours of the triggering event. The stock price \ndrops after the company makes an announcement, and the lawyers quickly \nfile lawsuits with little or no due diligence done to investigate \nwhether the suits have any merit. In fact, I would guess that the \nlawyers do not really care whether the suits possess much merit. This \nis because courts rarely exercise their authority to impose sanctions \non attorneys who file frivolous securities suits.\n  Abusive lawsuits not only drain scarce resources away from important \ncompany activities, but they also have a profound impact on the \nwillingness of corporate executives to speak freely about their \ncompany's plans and expected future performance. Several corporate \nexecutives and general counsels told the Banking Committee that they \nhad adopted a policy of not making public forward-looking statements \nout of fear that they would be sued for securities fraud if their \npredictions did not materialize. We should encourage companies to make \nforward-looking statements, because they contain precisely the type of \ninformation investors most desire--information about where the company \nis headed in the future. But we must remember, predictions are not \npromises of future performance, and executives who make forward-looking \nstatements should be protected from lawsuits unless they intended to \ndeceive investors.\n  I have spoken a great deal about how abusive lawsuits affect \ncompanies and \n\n[[Page S 17969]]\ntheir professional advisers. Even more egregious than the way the \ncurrent securities class action system treats them is the way it treats \ninvestors. When attorneys file frivolous cases, investors eventually \nbear the costs of the lawsuit. When lawyers pursue meritorious cases, \nthey often seek settlements that benefit them and leave investors with \npennies on the dollar of their losses.\n\n  Often lost in the debate over securities litigation reform is the \nfact that not just companies, but investors are harmed by frivolous \nsecurities lawsuits. Former SEC Chairman Richard Breeden testified that \n``the people who are most badly hurt--by abusive securities lawsuits--\nare the company's shareholders, who indirectly pay all the costs'' of \nthe lawsuit. Current SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt also has correctly \nnoted that investors are being hurt by litigation excesses.\n  When plaintiffs' lawyers engage in the predatory practice of filing \nan abusive securities lawsuit, shareholders eventually must bear the \ncosts of the suit. When companies are forced to divert resources from \nresearch and development budgets to litigation budgets, stock prices \ndrop and shareholders suffer. When companies must make a charge to \nearnings to pay the costs of settling an abusive lawsuit, dividends are \nlower and shareholders suffer. When corporate executives refuse to \ndiscuss the company's future plans out of fear that they will be sued, \nmarkets are denied access to the information investors need most to \nmake informed investment decisions, and shareholders suffer.\n  During the 12 congressional hearings held on securities class action \nlitigation, the most shocking thing I learned was the way plaintiffs' \nlawyers treat investors in cases of real fraud. According to studies \nand testimony presented at the hearings, in the typical settlement of a \nsecurities fraud lawsuit, investors receive around 6 cents on the \ndollar of their claimed losses, while plaintiffs' lawyers take the \nlion's share of the settlement fund as their fee award. This is because \nthe current system allows attorneys to negotiate their settlement with \nlittle or no input from their purported clients, the injured investors. \nOne of the most prominent securities class action lawyers claims to \nhave the best practice in the world because he has no clients.\n  This same attorney once settled a class action for $12 million and \nasked for the entire amount as his fee award. This would have left his \nclients with nothing. When asked whether he had a duty to his clients \nto justify his fee request, this lawyer responded that his only \nresponsibility was to justify his fee request to the court. A system \nwhich allows this sort of abuse needs to be changed. Investors deserve \nbetter.\n\n\n                              The Solution\n\n  While I have spent some time talking about the problem, I would like \nto spend the remainder of my time discussing the solution we have \ndeveloped. Our goal in crafting this legislation was to balance the \ninterests of defrauded investors with those of the companies and \nprofessional advisors who are often the subject of abusive, meritless \nlawsuits. I believe that we have developed a balanced bill that \nprovides relief from abusive suits while giving investors greater \ncontrol and a larger recovery in cases of real fraud.\n  It contains provisions which place investors, not lawyers, in control \nof the lawsuit. Unlike the current lawyer-driven system, under this new \nlaw the investors with the greatest stake in the outcome of the \nlitigation will control the case. Usually this will mean that pension \nfunds and mutual funds, which represent thousands of small investors, \nwill determine whether to pursue a lawsuit, who will be their lawyers, \nand when and for how much to settle the case. Because they have an \ninterest in protecting their small investors by discouraging frivolous \nsuits and pursuing cases of real fraud, institutional investors are in \nthe best position to decide whether to go forward with a lawsuit.\n  Unlike the current system where the first lawyer to file the lawsuit \ncontrols the case, this legislation also will allow the investors to \npick their lawyers and negotiate up front what their fee will be. This \nwill result in reduced attorneys' fees and will leave more money in the \nsettlement fund for defrauded shareholders. It will eliminate \nsituations where the attorneys request significant portions of \nsettlement fund as their fee and leave investors with pennies on the \ndollar of their claimed losses.\n  The conference report also requires that settlement notices to class \nmembers contain clear and concise disclosures of the terms of the class \naction settlement. Under the current system, investors often receive \nsettlement notices shrouded in legalese, which give them little or no \nidea what the lawyers have agreed to do. Only after they have consented \nto be part of the class and accept the settlement do they realize that \nthe lawyers have taken most of it and left them with next to nothing. \nUnder the new law, lawyers will be required to explain to shareholders \nin clear terms the total amount of the settlement, the amount of \nattorneys' fees and costs sought, and the amount per share class \nmembers will receive. With this new information, investors will better \nbe able to determine whether to accept the terms of the settlement.\n  The new system also will be good for investors because it eliminates \nmany of the unfair practices currently associated with generating a \nsecurities class action. Lawyers will no longer be able to pay bonuses \nout of the settlement fund to individuals who lend their name to the \nlawsuit and act as the named plaintiff. Nor will they be allowed to pay \nbonuses to brokers or dealers for referring potential clients. These \npractices are unfair to the shareholders not afforded the luxury of \nacting as named plaintiff and should be eliminated. Their elimination \nwill keep more money in the settlement fund for all investors, not a \nselect few.\n\n  The conference report also will benefit companies, as well as \ninvestors by utilizing reasonable means to eliminate abusive frivolous \nlawsuits. Despite what opponents say about this bill, it will not \nprotect the Charles Keatings of the world or prevent victims of \negregious fraud from obtaining relief. No Senator would vote for a bill \nwhich allowed that to happen. Instead, the conference report contains \nprovisions which will weed out frivolous cases early in the litigation \nprocess and impose fair liability standards on companies and their \nprofessional advisors to reduce the tremendous pressure on them to \nsettle even the most abusive cases.\n  To weed out frivolous cases early in the process, the conference \nreport adopts the pleading standard utilized by the second circuit \ncourt of appeals, where a large number of securities fraud lawsuits are \nbrought. This court-tested standard requires plaintiffs to plead facts \nin their complaint which give rise to a strong inference of securities \nfraud.\n  The conference report also adopts the State-law trend of \nproportionate liability--liability based upon the degree of \nresponsibility of each defendant. It retains joint and several \nliability for the really bad actors, those who knowingly defraud \ninvestors. It holds all others proportionately liable for the harm that \nthey have caused. This will reduce the pressure to settle on \nprofessional advisors who may not even have been aware of the fraud, \nbut who under the current system could be held responsible for the \nentire amount of damages.\n  Proportionate liability is not a novel concept--it's one many States \nconcerned with a fair application of liability have used for years.\n  There are three provisions in this bill which provide additional \ninvestor protection, particularly for the most vulnerable small \ninvestors. First, the bill contains a provision specifically designed \nto improve fraud detection in the areas of auditing and financial \nreporting. Auditors will now be required to report instances of \ncorporate fraud and this reporting often will take place before the \nfraudulent information makes its way into financial disclosure \ndocuments disseminated to investors.\n  The bill also contains language which will ensure that investors get \ncompensated if the main perpetrator of the fraud is bankrupt. The \nconference report requires proportionately liable defendants to pay up \nto an additional 50 percent of their liability into the settlement fund \nin cases where the primary, knowing violator is insolvent. It also \nrequires that small investors be fully compensated in all cases by \nholding all defendants jointly and severally liable for their entire \nlosses. \n\n[[Page S 17970]]\n\n  The bill also contains a fair safe harbor for predictive statements \nwhich will allow companies to provide the forward-looking information \ninvestors desire without the fear of a lawsuit if the projections do \nnot materialize. Under the current system, if one person in a company \nis aware of information which might contradict the company's \nprojection, the company can be held liable for fraud. This forces \ncompanies to adopt a policy of not making predictive statements.\n  The new safe harbor, endorsed by the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, protects predictive statements in two ways. First, \nprojections are protected from lawsuits as long as they are accompanied \nby meaningful warnings which identify important business factors which \ncould cause the prediction to fail. This provision is based on the \nbespeaks caution doctrine, a concept in the securities laws which says \nthat if a predictive statement is surrounded by sufficiently cautionary \nlanguage discussing some of the reasons why the prediction may not come \ntrue, then the statement cannot form the basis of a lawsuit. Under this \nnew rule, companies which desire the protection of the safe harbor will \nbe required to disclose certain information to investors about the \nfactors which might undermine their predictions. Companies need not \ndisclose every factor, nor must they disclose the factor which \neventually causes the prediction to fail. They simply must discuss some \nof the important business factors which could affect their prediction.\n  There has been much discussion about this first part of the safe \nharbor. Early drafts said that companies must disclose substantive \nfactors, rather than important factors. In this Senator's opinion, \nthese words are interchangeable and impose the same requirement on \ncompanies: discuss some of the important business factors which could \naffect your prediction. It imposes no hindsight state of mind \nrequirement on companies regarding which factors they believed were \nmost important. Nor should this provision be used by courts in a way \nwhich allows the current system's abusive discovery practices to \ncontinue. Courts should not read the word important to mean that \nplaintiffs are entitled to large-scale discovery on the issue of which \nfactors the company believed were important. Courts should simply look \nat the four corners of the predictive statement, as well as the \ninformation about the company already in the market, and determine \nwhether investors should have relied on the predictive statement.\n  Under this safe harbor, courts also may continue their practice under \ncurrent law and find forward-looking statements immaterial on other \ngrounds. There is an abundance of case law which says that soft \nforward-looking statements containing optimistic opinions without any \nfactual representations cannot serve as the basis for one of these \nlawsuits. The conference committee wisely chose to leave this law \nintact. This sort of sales talk or puffing has no effect on a company's \nshare price and courts should continue to quickly dismiss cases based \non these types of statements. As well, courts also should continue to \nconsider public information provided by sources other than the company \nor public information from the company not contained in the forward-\nlooking statement when determining whether a predictive statement meets \nthe securities laws' test of materiality. These concepts also are found \nin the cases, and the conference committee certainly did not intend to \nhave any effect on this area of the law.\n  Should a predictive statement not contain sufficient cautionary \nlanguage to fall into the first safe harbor, then a second safe harbor \nis available. Under the second safe harbor, the statement is protected \nunless it was made with actual knowledge that it was false. If a \nbusiness entity made the statement, then the plaintiff must prove that \nthe statement was made or approved by an executive officer with the \nactual knowledge that it was false. This will prevent the situation \nunder current law which permits lawsuits to go forward based upon the \nexistence of a memo or electronic mail by a low-level employee who \ndisagrees with management's projection. This provision is based upon \nthe standard Senator Sarbanes proposed on the floor during the Senate \ndebate, and I believe that this is an effective compromise.\n  Investors should have increased access to the company's thoughts \nabout where it is headed in the future, and the current lawsuit-driven \nsystem discourages executives from talking about the future. The \nconference report's balanced safe harbor provision encourages companies \nto speak by recognizing that predictions are not promises, while \nprohibiting outright lies by corporate executives. Again, this is a \nprovision supported by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Let me \nread into the record what the Commission says about the safe harbor in \nthe conference report:\n\n       While we could not support earlier attempts at a safe \n     harbor compromise, the current version represents a workable \n     balance that we can support since it should encourage \n     companies to provide valuable forward-looking information to \n     investors while, at the same time, it limits the opportunity \n     for abuse.\n\n  Finally, this bill addresses the fact that attorneys and courts are \nunwilling to pursue sanctions against entrepreneurial lawyers who file \nabusive suits. This legislation requires courts to review the record at \nthe end of each case to determine whether any of the attorneys violated \nrule 11 of the Federal rules. If the court finds a violation, then it \nmust impose sanctions. Requiring courts to impose sanctions against \nattorneys who file frivolous cases will reduce the number of abusive \nlawsuits without discouraging individual plaintiffs from seeking \nredress in the courts.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will vote for this conference \nreport. This legislation is substantially similar to the legislation we \npassed in July by a wide margin. I believe that the Senators who \nsupported the bill in July should have every reason to vote for this \nconference report today. It is a well-balanced bill that protects \ninvestors from intentional fraud, gives them greater control of their \ncases and addresses many of the abuses inherent in our currently broken \nsecurities class action system.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record following my \nremarks a list of those from my home State of New Mexico who support \nsecurities litigation reform. The list includes several State senators \nand representatives, as well as Gary Johnson, the distinguished \nGovernor of New Mexico.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that a copy of a series of letters from \na group of high-technology and high-growth company CEO's, and venture \ncapitalists to President Bill Clinton also be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibits 1 and 2.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to especially recognize the \nextraordinary commitment Senator Dodd has made to this legislation. \nWhen he was chairman we started the hearings, compiled a thorough \nreport and together we developed legislation. He has steadfastly worked \nto make the bill a better bill for small investors, for all investors, \nfor our capital markets and the companies using our capital markets. \nThis knowledge of the securities laws helped craft the answers to the \nproblem that we all saw.\n  I thank my colleagues Senators Dodd and D'Amato, as well as the rest \nof the conferees for all of their hard work on this important \nlegislation. This is comprehensive reform, and companies as well as our \nlegal system will work more efficiently because of it. Senator Gramm \npioneered the most-adequate-plaintiff provision and I thank him for his \ninput.\n  I must thank several members of the House who have worked so hard to \nhelp bring about securities litigation reform. The chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, Mr. Bliley and his distinguished subcommittee \nchairman, Mr. Fields, have worked tirelessly to ensure that this \nlegislation is effective and actually works in the real world. I \nrealize how difficult it can be to craft a complicated piece of \nlegislation like this, and I appreciate their help. I also would like \nto thank Representative Chris Cox from California, who practiced in \nthis area prior to coming to Congress. His practical experience and \nexpertise has helped make this a better bill. Finally, I thank \nRepresentative Billy Tauzin, a new member of the Republican Party who \nfought for many \n\n[[Page S 17971]]\nyears as a Democrat to bring this legislation to the floor of the \nHouse. Mr. Tauzin's hard work attracted over 200 cosponsors to his \noriginal bill at a time when there was very little interest by the \nHouse leadership in even bringing up the issue of securities class \naction reform. Mr. Tauzin has worked on this issue since the beginning, \nand his dedication to this issue is to be commended.\n  SEC Chairman Levitt and Commissioner Wallman made constructive \nsuggestions throughout the process. I am very pleased that they support \nthe safe harbor provisions that have been worked out and that we were \nable to address their principle concerns about the entire bill.\n  Mr. President, I urge that Senators adopt this bill today and I urge \nthe President to sign it. As we look back at this year, this will be \none of the most significant pieces of legislation that attempts to rid \nthe American economy and the entrepreneurial system from unneeded drag \nand unneeded cost so that it retains more of its vibrancy and growth \npotential.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                     New Mexico Support for S. 240\n\n\n                               government\n\n       New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson.\n       State Senator Patrick Lyons.\n       State Senator Virgil Rhodes.\n       State Senator E.M.

William J. Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As California members of the American \n     Electronics Association, we are writing to strongly urge your \n     support for securities litigation reform legislation which we \n     expect to emerge from Conference Committee early this fall.\n       For nearly four years the California High Technology \n     community has been pursuing meaningful reform of the \n     securities litigation system. We have worked closely with the \n     White House, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the \n     U.S. Congress. As a result of these efforts, both the House \n     of Representatives and the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly passed \n     securities litigation reform, by votes of 325-99 and 70-29, \n     respectively. We believe these margins clearly demonstrate \n     the consensus for reform and now we need your affirmative \n     support to bring this effort to a successful close.\n       We want to stress our belief that U.S. capital markets \n     function efficiently and effectively because of a strong and \n     balanced enforcement system. We also want you to understand \n     that the current system is no longer functional, promoting \n     inefficient markets, costing jobs, and harming investors.\n       In Silicon Valley, California, nearly 53% of technology \n     companies have been sued under Section 10(b)(5) of the \n     Securities Act of 1934. Every single one of the top ten \n     Silicon Valley Corporations--world class multinational \n     competitors--have been accused of violating the anti-fraud \n     provisions of the U.S. Securities laws. The current state of \n     affairs was described best by a prominent Silicon Valley CEO \n     who stated: ``There are only two kinds of California \n     technology companies--those that have been sued, and those \n     that are about to be sued.''\n       We want to emphasize that the provision most critical for \n     technology companies is a strong, effective safe harbor for \n     forward-looking statements--statements made by companies and \n     others about the future prospects of earnings, products, \n     technologies or the like. But the key to a safe harbor is \n     that it must be safe. Properly constructed, a true safe \n     harbor will promote maximum disclosure by corporate \n     executives and provide investor protection. Under current \n     law, if a company fails to meet management's projections or \n     analysts' expectations it often finds itself faced with a \n     lawsuit. Frequently, these lawsuits are based on changes \n     of fraud, allegedly for false and misleading past \n     statements of future expectations. And because of our \n     inherent stock volatility, rapid product development, and \n     economic and technological uncertainties facing technology \n     companies, high technology firms are easy prey for these \n     merit less lawsuits.\n       The California Public Employees Retirement System \n     (CalPERS), which provides retirement benefits to nearly 1 \n     million beneficiaries fully understands the ramifications of \n     the current system. CalPERS argues that ``the current safe \n     harbor has failed to encourage sufficient disclosure of \n     forward-looking information, principally because the rule is \n     unable to assure issuers that they will not be subject to \n     shareholder suits upon disclosing projections.''\n       Unfortunately, as with many issues in Washington, the safe \n     harbor has been the subject of a smear campaign designed to \n     preserve the status quo for those that are profiting from the \n     current system. Some have characterized the safe harbor as \n     providing issuers with a ``license to lie.'' This is either a \n     misrepresentation or a misunderstanding of the proposals. \n     Providing safe harbor protection--that is, a greater degree \n     of protection than provided for in law--has been the \n     established policy of the Securities and Exchange Commission \n     for 15 years.\n       Others have suggested that the safe harbor would protect \n     fraudulent wrongdoers. Again, this is simply not correct. \n     Truly fraudulent activity would still be fully actionable by \n     private parties under any safe harbor construction. It is \n     simply not possible to confine fraudulent activity to forward \n     looking statements without also, at some point, mis-stating \n     present fact. Moreover, nothing in any proposal would prevent \n     the Securities and Exchange Commission from bringing an \n     enforcement action against any person on the basis of a \n     forward-looking statement. The safe harbor would only curb \n     abusive lawsuits based on a revisionist view of future \n     events.\n       Mr. President, by giving companies the comfort they need to \n     talk about plans for the future--without risking a lawsuit \n     when they simply miss the mark--the safe harbor will maximize \n     disclosure of forward-looking information, improve the \n     efficiency of the market, and permit investors to make sound \n     decisions based on maximum information.\n\n[[Page S 17972]]\n\n       Once again, we want to stress the need for litigation \n     reform, including for a strong safe harbor.\n           Sincerely,\n       Wind River Systems, Tekelec Corporation, Venture Management \n     Associates, Information Storage Devices, Inc., HiTech \n     Equipment Corporation, Poly-Optical Products, Inc., VALOR \n     Electronics Inc., Fidelity Palewater, Inc., Sage Management \n     Group, Radio Therapeutics Corporation, Elpac Electronics, \n     Inc., Uptime Computer Solutions, Inc., ShareData Inc., TEAL \n     Electronics Corporation, Aurum Software Inc., Magnetic \n     Circuit Elements, Inc., Aurora Electronics, Inc., Weitek \n     Corporation, BEI Electronics, Inc., Shelly Associates, Inc.\n       Data Instruments, Inc., TAU Corporation, Nextwave Design \n     Automation, ACCEL Technologies, Inc., Emuiex Corporation, \n     Optimum Optical Systems, Inc., VertiCom Inc., Comdisco \n     Electronics Group, TeleSensory Corporation, Physical Optics \n     Corporation, Endgate Corporation, Wells Fargo Bank, Catapult \n     Communications Corporation, Orthodyne Electronics, Alzeta \n     Corporation, Printonix, Inc., Leasing Solutions RNC (LSSI), \n     Embedded Performance, Inc., Escalade Corporation, Autek \n     Services Corporation.\n       Presence Information Design, INTA, TTM Inc., Graham-Patten \n     Systems, Inc., Oxigraf, Frequency Products, Inc., Paragon \n     Environmental Systems, Inc., Radian Technology, Illustra \n     Information Technologies, Dynamic Network Solutions, Inc., \n     Data/Ware Development, Subscriber Computing, Inc., Paragraph \n     International, El Dorado Ventures, Petillon & Hansen, NFT \n     Ventures, Inc., Pioneer Magnetics, Platinum Software, \n     BioMagnetic Technologies, Inc., Lexical Technology.\n       ACT Networks, Inc., 3D Systems Corporation, WEMS \n     Electronics, The Automatic Answer, Inc., Transport Solutions/\n     RTC, Lumonics Corporation, Silicon Valley Group, Inc., The \n     Cerplex Group Inc., Interlink Electronics, Baan Company, \n     Nanometrics, Viasat, Inc., HSQ Technology, Qlogic \n     Corporation, Silicon Systems, Inc., Giga-Tronics \n     Incorporated, HNC Software Inc., ParcPlace Digitalk, Inc., \n     DCP Technology Inc., Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation.\n       Canro Scientific Instruments, Router Wave, Xircom, Inc., \n     Level One Communications, Inc., International Lottery & \n     Totalizator, Onstream Networks, Inc., Wiz Technology Inc., \n     Tandem Computers, Inc., ProBusiness, Inc., Innocal, InCirt \n     Technology, Logical Services Incorporated, Com 21, \n     Microsource, Inc., Scientific Technologies, Inc., Pacific \n     Recorders & Engineering, Kofax Image Products, Allied Telesyn \n     International Corp., Molecular Dynamics, Motion Engineering, \n     Inc.\n       Trillium Consumer Electronics, Inc., ATG Cygnet, Inc., \n     Semiconductor Systems, Inc., Reset Inc., Triconex, StrataCom, \n     Inc., Quantic Industries Inc., Advanced Matrix Technology, \n     Inc., Netsoft, Motion Engineering Inc., Inhale Therapeutic \n     Systems, Continuous Software Corporation, Xilinx, Inc., RJS, \n     Inc., Measurex Corp., Sonatech, Inc., MasPar Computer \n     Corporation, Paracel, Inc., Fisher Research Laboratory, Inc., \n     Network General Corp.\n       Gamma-Metrics, Expersoft, D.S.

We understand from \n     numerous sources within the White House that this \n     Administration believes that Silicon Valley companies do not \n     consider securities reform a pivotal issue.\n       By delivery of this letter to you. Mr. President, we wish \n     to underscore the degree of our intensity in support of \n     meaningful reform.\n       For almost four years we have devoted substantial energy \n     and efforts toward making common sense changes in the nations \n     securities laws, thereby hoping to end the relentless \n     onslaught of frivolous lawsuits against our companies.

The \n     signatories of this letter represent the leading companies of \n     Silicon Valley, and speak with confidence that we reflect the \n     views of thousands of technology companies nationwide.\n       Mr. President, believe us, this is a definitive issue for \n     our industry.\n           Sincerely,\n       National Semiconductor Corporation, Quantum, 3COM, DSV \n     Partners, Institutional Venture Partners, LSI Logic \n     Corporation, Cadence Design Systems, Symantec Corporation, \n     Oracle Corporation, Sybase, Inc., New Enterprise \n     Associates, Silicon Graphics Inc.\n       Sun Microsystems, Inc., Intel Corporation, Applied \n     Materials, Inc., Varian Associates Inc., Kleiner Perkins \n     Caufield & Byers, Hewlett-Packard Company, Raychem \n     Corporation, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Adaptec, Inc., \n     Centigram Communications Corporation, Apple Computer, Inc., \n     Tandem Computers, Trimble Navigation Limited, Xilinx, Inc., \n     Adobe Systems Inc.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                             American Electronics Association,\n\n                                Santa Clara, CA, October 13, 1995.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to urge your support for \n     securities litigation reform legislation which we expect to \n     emerge from Conference Committee early this fall.\n       For nearly four years the U.S. high technology community \n     has been pursuing meaningful reform of the securities \n     litigation system. As a result of these efforts, both the \n     House of Representatives and the Senate overwhelmingly passed \n     securities litigation reform, by votes of 325-99 and 70-29, \n     respectively. We believe these margins clearly demonstrate \n     the consensus for reform. We need your affirmative support to \n     bring this effort to a successful close.\n       We were pleased to read the report during your recent \n     Silicon Valley visit that you would ``gladly sign'' \n     legislation to eliminate frivolous lawsuits. At the same \n     time, we gather you do not fully support the legislation \n     passed by the Senate, the legislation most likely to reach \n     your desk.\n       In Silicon Valley, more than half the technology companies \n     have been sued under Section 10(b)(5) of the Securities Act \n     of 1934. Inherent stock volatility, rapid new product \n     development, and economic and technological uncertainties \n     make high technology firms easy prey for these meritless and \n     costly lawsuits. According to the American Electronics \n     Association (AEA) every one of the top ten Silicon Valley \n     companies--world-class, multinational competitors--has been \n     accused of violating the anti-fraud provisions of the U.S. \n     securities laws.\n       The provision most critical for technology companies, like \n     ours, is a strong safe harbor for forward-looking \n     statements--projections made about the company's future \n     prospects. Failing to meet the expectations of analysts who \n     follow the technology industry is inevitable. However, it is \n     hardly intentional and it is certainly not fraudulent. Yet \n     plaintiffs' lawyers seize upon the inherent volatility in our \n     industry to create a false picture of ``fraud'' where none in \n     fact exists.\n       The proliferation of class action lawsuits has prompted \n     companies to conclude that the legal risks of providing \n     projected earnings, revenue and market information to Wall \n     Street analysts or the investing public are too high. As \n     such, many companies no longer release future oriented \n     information and refuse to comment directly on analysts' \n     projections, resulting in less public information, less \n     efficient markets, fewer jobs, and in the end less informed \n     investors.\n       Except for those who profit from the current system, there \n     is nearly universal agreement that the current regulatory \n     safe harbor is no longer functional. Nonetheless, the \n     beneficiaries of the status quo have launched an aggressive \n     campaign to kill the safe harbor. They have suggested that \n     the proposed safe harbor would be a ``license to lie,'' or \n     that it would ``protect'' fraudulent wrongdoers. The fact is \n     that fraudulent activity would continue to be fully \n     actionable by private parties under either bills' safe harbor \n     construction. Moreover, nothing in any proposal would prevent \n     the Securities and Exchange Commission from bringing an \n     enforcement action against any person on the basis of a \n     forward-looking statement. The purpose and goal of the safe \n     harbor is not to provide a ``license to lie'' but to provide \n     a forum in which companies can safely provide valuable \n     information to the investing public.\n       Mr. President, it is important for us to have you \n     understand our position. Without strong, clear safe harbor \n     protection--similar to that enacted by either the Senate or \n     the House--reform efforts will be virtually meaningless. We \n     need your active support to ensure that the legislation \n     enables corporate executives to speak candidly about the \n     future and to ensure that investors receive the information \n     they need. In so doing, businesses will win, investors will \n     win, and the marketplace will win.\n           Sincerely,\n       Adaptec, Inc., National Semiconductor Corporation, Quantum, \n     3COM, LS Logic Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Raster \n     Graphics, Silicon Graphics Inc., Sun Microsystems, Inc., \n     Intel Corporation, Applied Materials, Inc., Varian \n     Associates Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, Cypress \n     Semiconductor, Raychem Corporation, Advanced Micro Devices \n     Inc., Centigram Communications Corporation, Apple \n     Computer, Inc., Tandem Computers, Trimble Navigation \n     Limited, Xilinx, Inc.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n[[Page S 17973]]\n\n\n\n                                 American Business Conference,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 1, 1995.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Shortly, you are likely to receive from \n     Congress legislation designed to reform our nation's system \n     of securities-related litigation. We are writing to urge you \n     to sign that legislation when it reaches your desk.\n       As you know, bills designed to curtail speculative \n     securities litigation--so called strike suits--passed the \n     House and Senate by wide, bipartisan margins earlier this \n     year. The House and Senate conferees will be meeting \n     presently and a draft conference report has already been \n     written. That draft report has been warmly endorsed by \n     Senator Dodd, who called it a ``balanced, moderate bill that \n     addresses the needs of legitimately defrauded investors, \n     while protecting our nation's businesses from frivolous \n     lawsuits.''\n       We, and the organization we co-chair, the American Business \n     Conference (ABC) agree with Senator Dodd's assessment. For \n     far too long, America's entrepreneurial, growth companies \n     have been harassed by speculative lawsuits brought by a small \n     coterie of lawyers in the name of investors who often are \n     unaware that a suit has been filed. These suits are initiated \n     for the purpose of securing a settlement; they amount to \n     little more than perverse transfer payments from one group of \n     investors to another with a large slice going to the \n     plaintiffs' lawyers.\n       Those companies that manage to escape being sued suffer as \n     well. They know that the promulgation of so-called forward-\n     looking information is an open invitation to a lawsuit \n     because statements about future prospects are uncertain and \n     therefore vulnerable to legal assault after the fact.\n       This means less communication of forward-looking \n     information to investors, a less efficient securities market, \n     and, ultimately, a higher cost of capital for entrepreneurial \n     firms unable to explain fully why investors should seek them \n     out. Our economy cannot afford this absurd situation to \n     continue; it is costing jobs, it is hampering new business \n     development, and, ultimately, it is a tax on our future \n     standard of living.\n       Having spoken at length with our colleagues in ABC and with \n     other business leaders from California to Massachusetts, we \n     can assure you that no business-related issue is being more \n     closely watched by America's entrepreneurs than is the fate \n     of this reform legislation. It deserves your wholehearted \n     support.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     George N. Hatsopoulos,\n       Chairman and President, Thermo Electron Corp.

Christopher Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: Earlier this year, overwhelming \n     majorities in both Houses of Congress (325-99 in the House \n     and 69-30 in the Senate) passed legislation that would reform \n     our nation's securities litigation system. The overwhelming \n     margins of support attained in these votes clearly reflect a \n     bi-partisan consensus that the current securities litigation \n     system needs to be fixed, and fixed quickly.\n       In short, the status quo is stifling our nation's growth \n     companies while padding the pockets of plaintiffs' attorneys. \n     Over the past four years, a total of $2.5 billion has been \n     paid in settlements in securities class action cases analyzed \n     by National Economic Research Associates, Inc.--a \n     ``disproportionately large number'' of which involve suits \n     against high-technology companies--with plaintiffs' attorney \n     fees averaging 32% of the settlement.\n       As concerned leaders of the American business community, we \n     urge you to capitalize on this display of legislative \n     solidarity and move this important legislation swiftly \n     through conference committee and to President Clinton's desk.\n           Sincerely,\n         Abbott Laboratories; Banc One Corp.; American Greetings \n           Corp.; The Carlyle Group; Ceridian Corp.; Chrysler \n           Corp.; Household International, Inc.; Beneficial Corp.; \n           Carolina Power & Light Co.; Chevron Corp.; Eastman \n           Kodak Co.; Nashua Corp.\n         Gilbert Amelio, National Semiconductor Corp.; James A. \n           Unruh, Unisys Corp.; John East, Actel; Allen Weintraub, \n           The Advest Group, Inc.; Robert N.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia is now recognized for up to 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, my distinguished colleague needs another \nminute or two. I thought perhaps, with the acquiescence of the \ndistinguished floor manager, we might get some additional unanimous \nconsent--I know he has several colleagues who asked to speak, or at \nleast I saw his list. I am perfectly agreeable that we might do that \nnow. If he is not prepared to do so, we would----\n  Mr. BENNETT. I do not wish to interrupt the Senator from California. \nI do not have the list in front of me, so why does she not go ahead.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the conference \nreport. This legislation claims to reform private litigation under the \nFederal securities laws. I believe there is a clear need for reforms in \nthe securities laws. For example, we need to ban the payment of bonuses \nby a small minority of unscrupulous lawyers to professional plaintiffs. \nWe need to prevent lawyers from dipping into Securities and Exchange \nCommission disgorgement funds. These are funds created by Government \nagency litigation, not by the private lawyers' litigation, and private \nlawyers should not be paid from those funds.\n  We should also ban the payment of referral fees to stockbrokers who \ndrum up plaintiffs and litigation for plaintiffs' attorneys. Securities \nlawsuits should redress real wrongs and not promote strike suits to \nshake down innocent defendants.\n  This conference report prohibits those three practices I just \ndescribed. I support those provisions. But the legislation goes much, \nmuch further. It uses, in my view, legitimate problems as an excuse to \ngut securities protections for the average American. I cannot be a \nparty to that. I feel it is very important that this debate be as \ninclusive as it can be of all aspects of this because I believe \nsomeday, as Senator Bryan has said, this vote is going to come back to \nhaunt people. And I want the Record to be clear as to where this \nSenator from California stood.\n\n  The real effect of this legislation, absent those three good parts \nthat deal with frivolous lawsuits, the real effect of this legislation \nis to unleash con artists and swindlers to prey on the investing public \nand bilk them out of hundreds of millions, perhaps even billions of \ndollars. Because of this, I call on my colleagues to vote no. And I \ncall on the President, if this legislation passes, to veto it. If you \nare fighting for the average American, you have to veto this bill \nbecause it is going to hurt the average American.\n  Mr. President, we are in a time when the middle class, especially the \nelderly middle class, is being asked by the majority in this Congress \nto give up, in my opinion, basic old-age protections. This Republican \nCongress wants to deeply cut Medicare, to give a tax break to the rich, \nand they even repeal Federal nursing home standards.\n  So the middle class, the elderly middle class are getting hit. We \nmust remember that securities fraud is aimed at the elderly--there are \nmany studies that show this--aimed at the elderly. So this is a double \nwhammy. In other words, what we are doing here today cannot be divorced \nfrom the budget battle we are waging. On the Democratic side of the \naisle, we are fighting to protect the middle-class elderly. But we do \nnot control the votes. They are going to get hurt somewhat. Why offer \nthem this double whammy?\n  I tried to get special safe harbor protections for the elderly in \nthis bill, but I could not. I could not win that fight. So the elderly \nare at risk here. As a matter of fact, all of us who invest, all of us \nare at risk here. But who will get hurt the most? Not the wealthiest of \nthe investors, because if you are worth millions and millions of \ndollars you can take a hit and wind up on your feet. Not the poorest of \nthe poor, because if you are the poorest of the poor, you do not \ninvest. So the wealthiest and the poorest are probably going to be all \nright.\n  But it is the middle class that is going to get hit. This bill is \nantimiddle class and it is antisenior citizen. It would jeopardize the \nretirement funds and old age security of millions of our citizens, and \nfor that reason, I hope colleagues will vote no.\n  The conference report is named, or I should say misnamed, \n``securities reform.'' But the conference report does not reform the \nFederal securities laws, nor does it reform litigation under those \nlaws. It does exactly the opposite, in my view. It encourages \nsecurities fraud, fraud on the most innocent and vulnerable investors.\n  I remember being visited by the victims of fraud, the victims of \nCharles Keating, and they said, ``Senator, you have to stand on that \nfloor, and you have to tell your colleagues to prevent that from \nhappening to anybody else.'' Those victims of Keating were able to \nrecover $200 million plus because of the laws we have in place today. \nNot after this bill. Not after this bill.\n  This legislation would even hurt business. Why do I say that? If you \nmake the securities laws less protective of the vast majority of \ninvestors, what will happen is people will have doubts about the safety \nof securities. So they are going to wind up not investing in \nsecurities, not lending their money to start up, holding their capital \nback, maybe just buying Government bonds, a safe investment, and, \ntherefore, these honest companies, because of the fraudulent ones, will \nhave to pay a premium when they sell their securities. It will wind up \nbeing kind of like a fraud tax because people will say, ``I'm very \nworried, I'm not going to give you my money. There has just been a \nscandal.'' And they say, ``OK, we'll pay more interest.'' So in the \nend, the honest companies will get hurt.\n  I am a former stockbroker, and I have had the experience and honor of \nhelping people with their investments. For the most part, they happened \nto be elderly people who entrusted me at that time many, many years \nago. I know how they hung on every price change, because they relied on \ntheir dividends and they knew some day if they had a family emergency, \nthey would have to sell those securities. They also relied on the \nhonesty of the companies. If we ever ran into a situation where there \nwas a company that was not being honest when they made projections or \nthey talked about their company, we saw those stock prices go down.\n  It seems to me we owe it to the investors and to the good companies \nand to the good stockbrokers to keep a very strong and very powerful \nsecurities law, because I really believe after the first scandal--and \nthere will be such a scandal, in my view, if this goes through--people \nwill just be afraid, afraid to invest their money.\n  Mr. President, this conference report would make losers of millions \nof people, particularly small investors with IRA's--that is individual \nretirement accounts--pension plans, mutual funds. It is these average \nAmericans who will be the first victims of the fraud which will be \nunleashed by this legislation. The legislation effectively repeals much \nof the Nation's antifraud laws passed in the thirties in response to \nthe \n\n[[Page S 17975]]\nrampant fraud that contributed to the stock market collapse of 1929. My \ngoodness, can we not learn from history around this place? Do we have \nto see it happen again?\n  This legislation really could be called a roadmap to swindlers and \ncon artists who will use it to defraud the public and undermine the \npublic's faith in the markets. That is why organizations representing \nmillions of average investors oppose the legislation.\n\n  Let me name a few. In my own home State of California, the California \nCongress of Seniors is opposed. ``We feel,'' they say, ``this \nlegislation puts all elderly Americans who save their money in jeopardy \nbecause it would make it practically impossible to sue a swindler for \nsecurities fraud.''\n  State and local governments would lose under the legislation.\n  The California Association of County Treasurers and Tax Collectors is \nopposed. This is a conservative group of Americans entrusted with \nmaking sure that county funds are invested wisely. What did they say \nabout this? ``We strongly urge you to oppose the Securities Litigation \nReform Act. In recent years, local California governments have lost \nmore than $2 billion in the securities markets, partly due to \nderivative investments. Some of these governments have pending \nsecurities fraud cases. Others are still deciding whether to use the \ncourts to pursue the recovery. Now is not the time to weaken defrauded \ninvestors' rights,'' they say, and this comes from the local people.\n  I thought this crowd in Congress respects the local people. I thought \nthey respect the people at the county level, the State treasurers, the \nStates attorneys general. I guess they only respect them when they \nfinally agree with them, but if they do not agree with them, they do \nnot respect them.\n  This is dangerous legislation, and that is what it is called by the \nCalifornia State organization.\n  As the city and county treasurers and tax collectors point out, State \nand local governments, as investors of public funds, bring many \nsecurities fraud suits. We know about Orange County where they are \ntrying to recover from unscrupulous brokers. The city of San Jose in \n1984 nearly went bankrupt because it unknowingly purchased risky \nsecurities. Now they were able to sue. Their city attorney who pursued \nthat case came before the Banking Committee on which I serve, and I am \nproud to serve on it, and she said, ``Don't change the laws. We had a \nvery hard time under current law recovering our money, but we were able \nto do it. Don't weaken those laws.''\n  That fell on deaf ears.\n  Government agencies that have been defrauded and forced to use the \nFederal antifraud laws are not confined to California. There are many \nexamples: Ohio and Florida where local government agencies lost \nmillions through securities frauds.\n  Taxpayers are the ultimate losers, so not only are you putting \nindividual investors at risk, I say to my colleagues, but you are \nputting taxpayers at risk who pay local taxes because local governments \nbuy securities, too.\n  (Mr. SANTORUM assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I talked about the fact that one of my \nmajor concerns is the impact of this legislation on senior citizens who \nare the clear targets of fraud. Why is that? They count on their \npension plans. They have little ability to replace their lost \ninvestments other than to sue for fraud, and they need protections that \nthis bill would take away.\n  Senior citizens save for a lifetime. They often invest, as I say, a \nsignificant part of those savings in securities. Their pension plans \nare usually full of securities. These invested savings must carry them \nthrough old age and retirement, and this bill makes it easier to get \naway with securities fraud. So it is going to be, among others, senior \ncitizens and their pension plans that will be the major victims.\n  Many of our seniors are old, they are frail. They cannot return to \nwork like some of us who can come back if somebody perpetrates a fraud \non us. We have years ahead that we can work, although I am getting \nolder every day and have fewer years myself.\n  The fact is, the seniors cannot go back to the workplace, so if they \nare bilked of their money, they have to take it on the chin, they have \nto lose their dignity as they go to their children or really live in \nabject poverty.\n  That is why the American Association of Retired Persons is against \nthis bill--AARP. They sent a letter to the Banking Committee and said:\n\n       For many older people, the money at stake represents a \n     lifetime of savings, a lump sum pension payout, or proceeds \n     from the sale of a home. Private lawsuits brought by victims \n     of fraud often represent the only legal recourse available to \n     redress the wrongs committed by unscrupulous financial \n     practitioners.\n\n  The AARP is not alone. The National Association of Public Employee \nRetirement Systems is also opposed. If you start listening to the \npeople who oppose this bill, what you will realize is that it is most \npeople. It is the special interests who favor the thing. Those are the \npeople who are being protected. The aiders and abettors of fraud are \nbeing protected and the perpetrators of fraud are being protected, but \nthe people who are responsible for protecting other people's money, \nsuch as county treasurers and attorneys general of various States, \nthese people--the AARP, who protect seniors--are opposed. The AARP says \nthat the President should veto this bill.\n  Newspaper editorials. I think it is important to take a look at these \nnewspaper editorials, Mr. President, because they do not have an ax to \ngrind. They are looking at the legislation. As a matter of fact, \nnewspapers are considered, in many cases, to be more conservative than \nthe average person. Let us hear what the Chronicle in the bay area has \nto say about this. It is called Opening the Door to Fraud.\n  ``Securities fraud lawsuits are the primary means for individuals, \nlocal governments and other investors to recover losses from investment \nfraud--whether that fraud is related to money invested in stocks, \nbonds,'' et cetera. And they say, under the conference report, \ninvestors would be the losers.\n  Dozens of other newspapers and magazines have editorialized against \nthis legislation, calling for it to be defeated or vetoed.\n  Let us look at the largest paper in my State, the Los Angeles Times. \nThe Los Angeles Times had this to say about the legislation: ``This \nisn't reform--it's a steamroller.''\n  It is a steamroller. They are very, very critical.\n  The Oakland Tribune summarized the conference report this way. They \nsay:\n\n       President Clinton should veto the measure because it leaves \n     individual investors and an array of institutional investors \n     like pension funds, municipalities, and other government \n     units without enough protection from manipulators like \n     Charles Keating, Ivan Boesky, and Michael Milken. . . .\n\n  Where are the people here in this institution? Do they not remember \nthese names from the 1980's? Do they not remember reading about the \nGreat Depression? Do they not remember the S scandal, which was \ncaused by the deregulation that was so wild that there was rampant \nfraud?\n  Let me say this. According to the Oakland Tribune:\n\n       If this law had been if in effect when thousands of \n     investors, many of them Californians, had sued Charles \n     Keating over the Lincoln Savings and Loan scandal, the \n     plaintiffs would have recovered only $16 million. Under \n     current securities-fraud laws, they were able to recover $262 \n     million.\n\n  I ask, do you think the people who were bilked by Charles Keating had \na right to recover their losses? If you say yes--and I would be \nsurprised if you did not--how on Earth can you vote for this bill which \nwould have made it impossible for them to recover any more than $16 \nmillion when the losses were in the $200 million range?\n\n  The Muskegon, MI, Chronicle had this to say:\n\n       How come GOP's contract allows ripoffs of investors?\n       . . .Let the bill's backers explain to the rest of us why \n     stock swindlers need to be ``protected'' from lawsuits.\n\n  In the Republican GOP Contract With America, there is a very specific \nreference to changing the securities laws. As a matter of fact, I had a \nhuge debate with the author of the original bill, who then backed off \nsome of the provisions, like making it retroactive, when he realized it \nmight hurt his own district. But I am glad that the Muskegon Chronicle \nin Michigan--and I have never been there and I do not know anyone who \nwrites this--caught on. This is directly coming from the Republican \ncontract. ``Let the bill's backers explain to the rest of us why stock \n\n[[Page S 17976]]\nswindlers need to be `protected' from lawsuits.''\n  I do not think anybody has answered that. They talk about frivolous \nlawsuits, but they neglect to talk about these basic problems with the \nbill, which is that it strips away important protections that investors \nrely on.\n  Money magazine has run four editorials calling for the defeat of this \nlegislation. Money magazine. Here it is. Could you ever write a more \napt title? It is, ``Congress Aims at Lawyers and Ends up Shooting Small \nInvestors in the Back.'' That is exactly what happened with this bill. \nA laudable purpose, where you get a 100-to-0 vote on the three \nprovisions that deal with cutting back on frivolous lawsuits. But they \nuse that as an excuse to open up all the securities laws, undo the \nprotections and ``end up shooting investors in the back.''\n  They say:\n\n       At a time when massive securities fraud has become one of \n     this country's growth industries, this law would cheat \n     victims out of whatever chance they may have of getting their \n     money back. . . . In the final analysis, this legislation . . \n     . would actually be a grand slam for the sleaziest elements \n     of the financial industry at the expense of ordinary \n     investors.\n\n  My colleagues, if you are watching this in the comfort of your \noffices, if you are not tied up in a meeting or a committee, just look \nat this. Money magazine. What is their purpose? To help investors. They \nsay, ``Congress Aims at Lawyers and Ends up Shooting Small Investors in \nthe Back.'' The next scandal that we have, you will all be on the floor \nsaying, ``My God, I did not think that, and I did not know that, and I \ndid not read the fine print, and so on and so forth.'' You have a \nchance today to stick with the Senator from Nevada and stick with the \nSenator from Maryland and stick with this Senator from California and \nvote with us against this conference report. It is hurtful to the \naverage investor.\n  USA Today editorialized:\n\n       The bill's sponsors claim this step is needed to rein in an \n     explosion of frivolous litigation. But the facts don't back \n     them up. . . . These bills are a blatant payoff to the \n     corporations, brokers, accountants, and others who give \n     millions to congressional campaigns.\n\n  That is a pretty tough indictment of what they view--USA Today--as \nspecial interest legislation.\n  The Miami Herald goes so far as to call this bill ``a license to \nsteal.'' They say: ``. . . Senate bill bars lawsuits against many who \nbilk investors. How does this help the economy?'', the Miami Herald \nasks. ``This is licensed larceny, and it's unconscionable.''\n\n  Then we have an interesting letter I want to share. The Fraternal \nOrder of Police have written a very good letter to President Clinton. \nThey call on him to veto this bill. They drew an interesting parallel \nto the war on crime.\n  They say:\n\n       On behalf of the National Fraternal Order of Police, I urge \n     you to veto the ``Securities Litigation Reform Act''. . . . \n     The single most significant result of this legislation would \n     be to create a privileged class of criminals. . . . Our \n     270,000 members stand with you in your commitment to a war on \n     crime. . . . I urge you to reject a bill which would make it \n     less risky for white collar criminals to steal with police \n     pension funds while the police are risking their lives \n     against violent criminals.\n\n  There are a lot of different kinds of crime. White collar crime. You \nlook at the guy and he looks terrific, but he is stealing your \nmoney because he does not tell you the truth about investment, and this \nbill would take away your protection. I think it is very interesting \nthat the Fraternal Order of Police felt it important to talk about this \nkind of crime--white-collar crime.\n\n  The National Council of Individual Investors is also opposed. They \nwrote the President:\n\n       We are writing to express our strong opposition to the \n     recent draft conference report on securities litigation \n     reform. The conference report fails to treat the American \n     investor fairly. For example, as currently drafted, the bill \n     would have cost the victims of the Keating savings and loan \n     fraud over $200 million more than they otherwise lost. In the \n     interests of protecting individual investors from fraud, we \n     strongly urge you to oppose, and if necessary, veto this \n     legislation.\n\n  Now, I have to say if Barbara Boxer stands on the floor of the Senate \nand gives her views, because I usually line up with consumer groups you \nmight say Barbara Boxer always lines up with the consumers. But my \ngoodness, you have got every respected investor advocacy organization, \nsenior citizen organization, consumer organization, local elected \npeople, States attorney generals, it goes on and on and on. They are \nall telling us ``Don't fall for this bill.''\n  There is a lot of discussion about a safe harbor. The SEC was right \nin the middle of developing a new safe harbor provision. But, no, we \ncould not wait. It reminds me of when Congress got in the middle of \nderegulating the S's and said, ``We know better.'' Look what \nhappened.\n  We are doing the same thing here. Why not let the professionals deal \nwith this. They say, well, the SEC now likes this safe harbor. I read \nthe letter. I think, frankly, there was a lot of pressure put on people \nover there. That story will come out another day.\n  When you read the fine print of this legislation, any swindler can \ncover himself, make some cautionary statement about a forward-looking \nprediction, and find cover in this new safe harbor.\n  Mr. President, the Senate should not be a party to this kind of \nlawmaking. It should not be a party to this kind of lawmaking.\n  This bill even says that the lawyer in a securities fraud case has to \nbe picked by the wealthiest investor--the wealthiest.\n  Now, it is one thing to go after professional plaintiffs, and I am \nready to do that any day of the week. Sign me on. It is another thing \nto say in each and every case the wealthiest investor is the one who \nwill be involved and be responsible, and choose the attorneys and all \nthe rest. Talk about wealth being power--maybe that wealthy individual \ncould care less about the circumstance. And other smaller investors \ncare more because proportionately they are more hurt. The wealthy one \ngets the opportunity to control the lawsuit.\n\n  I ask, what are we doing here? I think this bill is much worse than \nwhen it left here. It went to conference and it got much worse. I hope \nsome people who voted for it, sent it off to conference, will \nreconsider.\n  This conference report stacks the deck against the investor--anyone \nand everyone who has respect and objectivity in this Nation has come \nout against this bill.\n  Even an excellent amendment by Senator Specter was dropped, a very \nimportant amendment. It applies to complaints filed at the initiation \nof a securities lawsuit. It had to do with the burden of proof \nnecessary to file a case dealing with motive and opportunity to \ndefraud. It was dropped in the conference. Close the door, you drop the \nprogressive provision that would have protected investors. That was a \nvery bad change in this bill. This bill is worse, much worse now, than \nwhen it left here.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, this legislation will hurt the public. \nEveryone says in America that we have the safest securities markets in \nthe world. Everyone is so proud, so proud. Yet they are cutting the \nheart out of these protections.\n  It will do the public great harm. It is not reform. It is repeal. It \nis repeal--repeal of protections that have made our securities markets \nthe safest in the world. This bill will hurt investors and ultimately \nhonest companies that sell securities.\n  The only winners, in my view, will be those crooks who get away with \nit. Before we come back here and say, ``My God, what have we wrought,'' \nwe should go back. In the end, this legislation will erode the \nconfidence and efficiency of the Nation's securities markets. Our \nNation will be the loser.\n  What the conference committee did is they took legitimate problems \nand they used them as an excuse to destroy the very protections that \nsmall investors need.\n  I hope that people will vote ``no'' on this. Barring that, I hope \nthat the President will veto it. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNevada is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I received a call from a reporter from \nNevada, and the big news in Nevada is the two Senators in Nevada \ndisagree on something. We normally agree on almost everything. This is \none of the rare issues where the two Senators from Nevada disagree. \n\n[[Page S 17977]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, I was 1 of the 69 Senators that voted for this bill \nwhen it came the first time. I am going to be one of those Senators \nthat will vote to confirm the conference report that we just received. \nI think this is an important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, in my legal career, I have had about 100 jury trials. \nI understand the trial practice. I think this is an area of the law \nthat has been abused by trial lawyers. I think the small group of \nlawyers has abused the license they received to protect the consumers \nof this country. They have become more concerned about protecting \nthemselves and not the consumers to which they allege they protect.\n  This legislation, Mr. President, should pass. It is important, I \nbelieve, to the integrity of this aspect of the law.\n  It is often said that the truth is the first casualty in a war. I \nbelieve this adage to be particularly appropriate to the debate over \nthe bill now before this body. I realize that there is a great deal of \nmoney at stake with this legislation. I am aware that a small but \nshrewd group of plaintiffs' lawyers stands to lose a lot of money \nbecause of the reforms brought through this legislation.\n  That does not, however, excuse the frightening fictions that I \nbelieve are being paraded in some aspects by this bill--by the people \ntrying to kill this conference report.\n  I first became suspicious about the opposition to this legislation \nwhen I met with a group of people who were attempting to defeat it. In \nmy conference room, in my office here in Washington, I met with a group \nof people, most of whom were from Nevada but some from other parts of \nthe country, and they were in here to tell me how bad this legislation \nwas. I proceeded to listen to them. Everything they talked about was \nnot in the Senate bill but was in the House bill.\n  I listened to them and, trying to shake the fact that sometimes I \nlike to cross-examine people that come to visit me, I could not \novercome the temptation on this occasion. I said to the group, ``Who \npaid your way here?''\n  A number of faces turned very red and they said the name of one of \nthe lawyers, plaintiffs' lawyer, who has made a fortune in this \nlitigation.\n  I asked the next question, ``Where are you staying?''\n  And they said, ``The Willard Hotel.''\n  And I said, ``Who pays for that?''\n  The same red faces, the same affirmative answer, ``The plaintiffs' \nlawyers were paying for this.''\n  They have every right, but I think the record should be very clear. \nThere is a small group of plaintiffs' lawyers attempting to maintain a \nlock they have on part of the litigation world that I think has gone \ntoo far.\n  Mr. President, I am sorry my friend from California has left the \nfloor, but the same is true about the Money magazine that was referred \nto. Money magazine has previously editorialized on the bill without \nconsidering the legislation as a whole. Indeed, there seemed to be an \nalmost exclusive focus on the House bill. They were writing about \nsomething that was fictionalized as being here.\n  It is the House bill that was part of the Contract With America. \nToday, we have a bill almost identical to that which this body passed \nearlier this year.\n  Some of their editorials claimed that the legislation would \npotentially force investors and the lawyers who lose a case to pay the \nwinner's entire legal fees. Of course, the facts are totally different \nfrom that. The compromise agreement drops the fee-shifting agreement of \nthe bill.\n  Money magazine's claim is that the legislation would ``allow \nexecutives to deliberately lie about their firm's prospects.'' Facts: \nExecutives who deliberately lie about their company's prospects would \nbe liable under the compromise.\n  Another claim they made is that the legislation will ``prohibit the \ninvestors from suing the hired guns who assist a fraudulent company, \nthe so-called aiders and abettors, including accountants, brokers, \nlawyers and bankers.'' That is not true.\n  They go on to say the legislation ``would ratify a court ruling that \nthrows out any suit that isn't filed within 3 years after the fraud \ntook place, even if no one discovers the crime until after the \ndeadline.'' The compromise, as I understand it, does not address the \nstatute of limitations. It merely leaves current law generally as it \nnow is.\n  Money magazine's claim is that in order to bring a lawsuit, \nplaintiffs may be ``forced to post a prohibitive, multimillion-dollar \nbond to cover the defendant's legal fees just in case the suit is later \nthrown out of court.'' The provision in the House bill requiring the \nposting of a security bond prior to bringing the suit has been dropped.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the \nrefutation of one of Money magazine's editorials be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Response to Money Magazine Editorials\n\n       Recent Money magazine editorials object to securities \n     litigation reform legislation on the bases of provisions that \n     have been amended in the compromise agreement, or because of \n     grossly distorted characterizations of the effect of the \n     provisions. Stripped of their rhetorical excesses, the \n     complaints in the editorials have little substance and even \n     less relevance to the current compromise agreement. In fact, \n     the compromise is good for America's investors--which is why \n     both individual investors and institutional investor \n     organizations are strongly backing the bill. Below are \n     responses to every one of Money's claims in both the \n     September and November editorials.\n       Money's claim: The legislation would ``potentially force \n     investors and their lawyers who lose a case to pay the \n     winner's entire legal fees, if the judge later rules the suit \n     was not justified.''\n       The facts: The compromise agreement drops the fee-shifting \n     provision of the House bill. The compromise makes evenhanded \n     procedural revisions to the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n     11. Rule 11 requires that attorneys and unrepresented parties \n     have some factual and legal basis for filing any claim or \n     defense. It already authorizes (but does not require) \n     sanctions against those who violate its mandates. The \n     compromise requires courts to make a finding after a case is \n     adjudicated as to whether either side--either the plaintiff \n     or defendant--violated the Rule. The same substantive rule \n     applies to every other action brought in federal court. If \n     the court finds a violation, and it is not de minimis, then \n     the court must impose sanctions. The court has the discretion \n     not to award attorneys fees and costs if it determines that \n     such a sanction would impose an undue burden on the party \n     that violated Rule 11. The compromise does not sanction a \n     party merely because they lost their case. Every case that is \n     not settled has a loser, but courts rarely find Rule 11 \n     violations. Opponents of this provision apparently do not \n     support Rule 11 or do not trust federal judges to \n     appropriately exercise discretion in awarding sanctions.\n       Money's claim: The legislation would ``allow executives to \n     deliberately lie about their firm's prospects.''\n       The facts: Executives who deliberately lie about their \n     company's prospects would be liable under the compromise. The \n     new safe harbor in the compromise has been carefully drafted \n     to ensure that there is no ``license to lie.'' Thus, \n     projections made without adequate risk disclosure are not \n     protected by the safe harbor if they are made with ``actual \n     knowledge'' that the statements are false or misleading--a \n     standard proposed by Senator Sarbanes during floor debate \n     over the Senate bill to ensure that corporate executives who \n     lie to investors would be covered by the save harbor. \n     Forward-looking statements made with sufficient, specific \n     non-boilerplate risk disclosure are protected by the safe \n     harbor. This is a codification of the ``bespeaks caution'' \n     doctrine already being applied by the courts. In addition, \n     the compromise retains the limitations on the scope of the \n     safe harbor contained in the Senate bill, such as the \n     exclusion of any issuer who has been convicted of a \n     securities law violation in the past three years. In \n     addition, there is no safe harbor protection for projections \n     made in connection with blank check companies, penny stock \n     offerings, initial public offerings, partnership offerings, \n     roll-ups, tender offers, and going private transactions.\n       This compromise safe harbor language balances two important \n     public policy objectives: encouraging increased voluntary \n     corporate disclosure to investors, and ensuring the liars are \n     not protected. Money magazine and others that take an extreme \n     position simply ignore half of the objectives of the safe \n     harbor.\n       Money's claim: The legislation would ``prohibit investors \n     from suing the fired guns who assist a fraudulent company, \n     the so-called aiders and abettors, including the accountants, \n     brokers, lawyers and bankers.''\n       The facts: Aiders and abettors are not immune from \n     liability. The compromise agreement authorizes the SEC to \n     bring enforcement actions against those who aid and abet a \n     securities fraud, thus reversing the Supreme Court's Central \n     Bank decision as it applies to the SEC. For private actions, \n     where there has been significant abuse of aiding and abetting \n     liability by ``strike suit'' lawyers seeking to increase the \n     settlement value of a case, the bill leaves current law as \n\n[[Page S 17978]]\n     it is. However, nothing prohibits investors from suing so-called \n     ``aiders and abettors'' as primary violators, and in fact, \n     many cases were simply refiled after Central Bank alleging a \n     primary violation of the securities laws. This balanced \n     provision ensures that no wrongdoer will escape liability, \n     but prevents aiding and abetting liability to be used as a \n     dragnet to sweep in ``deep pocket'' defendants to 10b-5 \n     claims, regardless of their culpability, merely to coerce \n     settlements.\n       Money's claim: The legislation ``would ratify a court \n     ruling that throws out any suit that isn't filed within three \n     years after the fraud took place, even if no one discovers \n     the crime until after that deadline.''\n       The facts: The compromise agreement does not address the \n     statute of limitations in current law. It merely leaves \n     current law as it is. Despite dire predictions that the \n     Supreme Court's one and three year statute of limitations \n     would end all private 10b-5 actions, these actions have \n     flourished since the 1991 decision.\n       The current statute of limitations has governed express \n     causes of action under the securities laws for more than 60 \n     years, and 10b-5 actions for more than four years. There is \n     absolutely no evidence that legitimate 10b-5 cases have been \n     frustrated.\n       As one court has observed, ``[p]rudent investors almost \n     always can smoke out fraud (or enough smoke to justify \n     litigation) within three years. [The three-year statute of \n     repose] cuts off only the claims of the most trusting or \n     somnolent--or the most wily, those who wanted to wait as long \n     as possible.'' Short v. Belleville Shoe Mfg., 908 F.2d 1385, \n     1392 (7th Cir. 1990). A longer period would allow speculators \n     too much time to wait and see how their decisions to buy or \n     sell securities turned out, permitting them to use lawsuits \n     to cover their losses in the market. The current law curtails \n     their ability to institute fraud claims ``based on wisdom \n     granted by hindsight.'' Short, 908 F.2d at 1392.\n       Money's claim: In order to bring a lawsuit, plaintiffs may \n     be ``forced to post a prohibitive multimillion dollar bond to \n     cover the defendants' legal fees just in case the suit is \n     later thrown out of court.''\n       The facts: The provision in the House bill requiring the \n     posting of a security bond prior to bringing suit has been \n     dropped. The new provision gives the court discretion to \n     require an undertaking from the plaintiffs or defendants in a \n     class action, and/or their attorneys. The court may decide \n     that no undertaking is warranted. This is not a novel or \n     unprecedented provision. Other sections of the securities \n     laws already have similar undertaking provisions. Plaintiffs \n     have not been deterred from bringing lawsuits under those \n     sections.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are here today considering the compromise \nlegislation agreed to by the conferees yet the bill's opponents are \nstill running ads in opposition to the House bill. The House bill is \ngone, history. We have never given it any credence here. But they are \ndoing this in an effort to slant and improperly cite what this bill \nreally stands for. These ads are replete with half truths, hyperbole, \nand outright distortions. Indeed, it is as if the opponents have failed \nto read the compromise agreement and have chosen instead to repeat the \nearlier criticisms of a different bill, the House bill.\n  Interestingly, this is not unlike their actions in the class action \nsuits they file alledging meritless claims. I believe the status quo \nmakes a mockery of the judicial system.\n  The much-debated safe harbor provision of the conference report \nprovides investors with protection. It increases corporate disclosure \non forward-looking information and ensures that investors are protected \nagainst fraud.\n  I ask the bill's opponents how the compromise can be so pernicious if \nit received support from Arthur Levitt, Chairman of the Securities and \nExchange Commission. In a recent letter, Mr. Levitt said, ``The current \nversion represents a workable balance that we can support since it \nshould encourage companies to provide valuable forward-looking \ninformation to investors while, at the same time, it limits the \nopportunity for abuse.''\n  It seems pretty clear. These words are from a man charged with \nprotecting the rights of all investors--big investors, small investors, \nmedium-size investors.\n  Another red herring commonly referred to and flouted by some \nopponents of this legislation is it will allow for another Charles \nKeating. They add this to their Parade of Horribles, but it is without \nfoundation. Most of the losses from the Keating case did not involve \nsecurities fraud and would not be affected by this legislation. But \neven for those losses caused by securities fraud, a number of the fully \nsolvent defendants would be jointly and severally liable under the \ncompromise because they committed a knowing fraud.\n  There are also provisions that everyone on this floor understands \nthat protect small investors. If you have $200,000 or less, you lose 10 \npercent of it. The same rules apply. Small investors are protected in \nthe legislation in this compromise, in this conference report.\n  So the Charles Keating talk that we hear so much about is a red \nherring.\n  Importantly, this bill includes a provision that requires auditors to \ntake additional steps to detect fraud and report illegal acts directly \nto the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the distinguished Senator yield for a moment for a \nunanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I make this request on behalf of Senator \nDole, so all Senators may be advised as to what the schedule will be.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the conference report occur \nat 4:45 p.m., with the time between now and then divided as follows: \nSenator Heflin, 7 minutes; Senator Graham, 7 minutes, Senator Graham of \nFlorida; Senator Shelby, 7 minutes; Senator Biden, 7 minutes; Senator \nWellstone, 7 minutes; Senator Cohen, 5 minutes; Senator Sarbanes, 5 \nminutes; Senator Bryan, 10 minutes; Senator Dodd or his designee, the \nremainder of the time which, who knows, may be zero, like this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this provision will help prevent fraud \nbefore investors' assets are lost, thereby eliminating the need for \nlitigation.\n  Another myth commonly put forth by the opponents is that it includes \na loser-pays provision. We have talked about that before regarding the \nMoney magazine assertion. That was simply without foundation. The truth \nis that no one will be required to pay the other side's fees because \nthey simply lose a case. What it does, is tighten rule 11 sanctions \nagainst attorneys who file frivolous lawsuits. Rule 11 merely requires \nthat attorneys have some factual and legal basis for filing any claim. \nThis does not seem unreasonable. It already authorizes rule 11 \nsanctions against those who violate its mandates.\n  This conference report is a balanced and a fair representation of \nwhat this Senate said that it wanted. I, like my friend from \nConnecticut and others, said we are not going to support legislation \nthat is more in keeping with the House than the Senate. We will vote \nagainst it. But I think the 69 Members of the Senate who voted for this \nlegislation the first go-around should vote for it again.\n  This is good legislation. It is fair. It is balanced. It may hurt the \nsmall minority of attorneys reaping a windfall--and that is an \nunderstatement, under the current laws--but it provides much-needed \nprotection to investors and restores some sanity to our already \noverburdened courts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent any time I have remaining be \ndelegated to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from North Carolina 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nconference report on H.R. 1058. I was pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of this bill in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, securities litigation reform is a rather ominous title \nfor a bill. It certainly is not an issue well known to many Americans. \nBut the fact is, this legislation is very important for our economy, \nand very important for job creation in our country.\n  This legislation is really part of a larger issue--legal reform. Too \nmany lawsuits are crowding our court system and they are sapping the \nproductivity of many companies. Last year, over 220,000 civil lawsuits \nwere filed in Federal court.\n  Since 1980, there has been a 73-percent increase in the number of \ncivil suits filed in Federal court.\n  It is estimated that securities class action suits have increased \nthreefold in just the last 5 years. Yet, a small number of lawyers are \npushing these suits. \n\n[[Page S 17979]]\nIn fact, every 4 working days, one particular law firm files a \nsecurities class action lawsuit.\n  The cost of these suits is no small matter. At the end of 1993, over \n700 class action suits were seeking $28 billion in damages.\n  Very simply, this bill will attempt to put an end to frivolous class \naction lawsuits that are filed against America's publicly traded \ncompanies.\n  These strike suites often have little merit, but they are filed for \nthe sole purpose of blackmailing companies into settling rather than \ngoing to court.\n  Everyone of us knows that it is less expensive to settle a lawsuit up \nfront than it is to go all the way to trial. Of course, once the suits \nare settled, the attorneys that brought them, keep most of the money.\n  The impact of these suits is having a detrimental effect on our \neconomy. Many companies are afraid to go public and sell stock.\n  By remaining private, they can avoid these kinds of suits, but they \nalso sacrifice an increase in growth and jobs that can come from going \npublic. This is costing America jobs.\n  Some have even suggested that companies from overseas are afraid to \nestablish businesses in America out of fear that they too will fall \nvictim to these suits.\n  Money that would otherwise be spent on new job growth, or on research \nand development is being paid to lawyers to settle these suits or--\nworse yet, money is wasted fighting them.\n  The cost to U.S. companies is not caught in a vacuum. As is always \nthe case, excessive litigation costs are passed along to consumers in \nthe form of higher prices. All of this has a ripple affect on our \neconomy. Mr. President, it is making America less competitive.\n  In my home State of North Carolina--116 companies have contacted me \nand asked for my help in passing this bill. They are united in their \neffort to end these abusive lawsuits.\n  Together these companies employ 118,000 in North Carolina. This is \nwhy this bill is so important for jobs in my State and in this country.\n  These suits are often targeted at emerging high-technology companies. \nThis is a particularly disturbing development.\n  America is the undisputed world leader in technology. Germany, Japan, \nFrance, England, none of these countries or other countries even comes \nclose to what this country is doing in terms of technology and \ninnovation. Eighteen of the thirty largest high-technology firms in \nSilicon Valley have been sued since 1988. It has cost them $500 million \nto settle these suits.\n  Yet, this small pool of lawyers, like sharks in the ocean are just \ncircling--waiting for the stock prices to fall--then they move in with \nthe strike suite. They are waiting to attack these companies and \ntransfer the wealth to themselves.\n  We cannot let this happen. America's leadership role in technology is \ntoo important to have it fall prey to disreputable attorneys.\n  Mr. President, let me give a few examples of just how bad the \nsituation has gotten with these suits.\n  One individual has filed lawsuits against 80 companies in which he \nheld stock. One Federal judge suggested that maybe his investment \nresults were a matter of design to pursue a lawsuit. The investor \nwanted us to believe that he was just the world's most unlucky \ninvestor. I have my doubts.\n  Another individual has filed 38 lawsuits, 14 of them with the same \nlaw firm.\n  Another man--a retiree--since 1990 has filed 92 lawsuits--one for \nevery one of his 92 years of age.\n  Further, these lawsuits have so little merit, they are often filed \nwithin hours after a stock price drops. Many times the drop is due to \nsimple movement in the markets, yet, the lawyers only have to file a \npreprinted complaint alleging fraud and race to the courthouse.\n  The trick is that this allows them to become the lead attorney on the \nclass action case. And by this--they make the most money.\n  The National Law Journal reported that of 46 cases studied, 12 were \nfiled within 1 day, and another 30 within a week of publication of \nunfavorable news about a company.\n  A good example is the Philip Morris case. This case has been \ndiscussed often, but it bears repeating.\n  After Philip Morris announced that it would reduce the price of its \nMarlboro cigarette by 40 cents a pack--a lawsuit was filed within 5 \nhours--by a plaintiff who held just 60 shares.\n  Four more suits were filed the same day, and five the next day. Two \nof the lawsuits contained identical complaints.\n  In fact, one suit came so fast from a computer generated legal form--\nthat the attorney forgot to change the form in parts--so he \nmisidentified Philip Morris as a toy company.\n  This is kind of frivolity that America's companies are fighting--and, \nregrettably, having to pay for.\n  Mr. President, the conference report is an attempt to put an end to \nthese outrageous legal practices.\n  Mr. President, let me assure you that nothing in this bill will \nprevent anyone from filing a legitimate fraud case against any company.\n  If it did, I do not think 50 Members of the Senate would have \ncosponsored the bill. I don't think 69 Senators would have voted for it \nwhen it passed the Senate.\n  For those that oppose this bill in the name of the consumer, I think \nare not fairly representing the consumers of this country.\n  Mr. President, a point that is not often made is that consumers, and \nthe plaintiffs in the class action suits rarely benefit from these \nlawsuits. Study after study shows that lawyers get the lions share of \nthe settlements.\n  We had testimony that the average investor receives 6 or 7 cents for \nevery dollar lost in the market because of these suits--and this is \nbefore the lawyers are paid.\n  Mr. President, in my opinion, consumers and investors will be helped \nby this bill. Any consumer that has a job--or wants a job--or wants to \nkeep a job will be helped by this bill.\n  With this conference report, more of America's capital will be put to \njob creation and not wasted on one sector of the legal profession. That \nis really the principle issue here.\n  Mr. President, the conference report will do a number of things to \ncurtail the abuses in our legal system.\n  First, the bill allows the courts to determine who the lead plaintiff \nwill be. The conference report will also put some teeth behind the rule \nthat attorneys cannot file frivolous lawsuits.\n  Mr. President, the conference report will also help investors by \nallowing companies to dispense more information to the public without \nthe fear of being sued. This is the ``safe harbor'' provision.\n  This is critically important to the flow of information for \ninvestors.\n  It is a shame that due to the actions of a small cadre of lawyers--\nthat the free flow of information has been cut off. Now investors can \nonly get carefully written legal gibberish that is meaningless. This is \nwrong, and this bill changes that.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that I would strongly urge \nmy colleagues to support the conference report. This is the beginning \nof meaningful legal reform. I think this bill is a good, fair, and \nbalanced bill, protecting the rights of investors as well as companies.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the conference \nreport on H.R. 1058, the Securities Litigation Reform Act. After months \nof secret negotiations from which supporters of small investors, \nconsumers, senior citizens, and public officials who invest taxpayer \nmoney were excluded, the proponents of the bill have agreed upon the \nconference report.\n  Now that the light of day has been shed on the results of the \nnegotiations it is clear that the conference report is far more \ndevastating for investors than the bill which the Senate passed earlier \nthis year. The conference report fails to fix the glaring inequities \nbetween investors and unscrupulous corporate insiders. It has taken \nsome of the worst provisions from both the House and the Senate bill \nand combined them to form this unacceptable report.\n  Unlike the Senate bill, the conference report now broadly immunizes \noral or written forward-looking statements by corporate insiders with \nonly a requirement that there be ``cautionary'' language to accompany \nthe statement. The determination of what is ``cautionary'' invites \nlitigation, but for \n\n[[Page S 17980]]\nthose who have already lost their life savings based on this safe \nharbor this litigation is too late.\n  Pursuant to the conference report the individual investors who have \nbeen victimized by an unscrupulous broker, or fraudulent statement will \nprobably never have their day in court. This is due to the inclusion of \na House provision which allows the court to impose a bond requirement \nto cover the payment of fees and expenses, with no limitation on the \namount of the bond. If an individual investor attempts to seek justice \nfrom a large corporate defendant, such a bond would probably be \nunattainable.\n  Another change from the bill passed by the Senate is the financial \nrisk imposed on investors of having to pay the full legal fees of big \ncorporate defendants if they lose. The new penalty for a plaintiff for \na violation of the Federal rules requires that he or she pay all of the \ncorporate defendant's legal fees and expenses for the entire case. This \nfull fee-shifting sanction would be calculated after the case has been \ncompleted, when the court must make findings. By the way, if the \ndefendant is found at fault, he is fined only the fees and expenses \nthat are a direct result of a frivolous filing. This English rule, fee \nshifting, could virtually eliminate all securities claims, the \nmeritless along with the meritorious.\n  In another move away from the Senate bill the conferees dropped \nproinvestor language which clarified the burdensome pleading \nrequirements of the bill. In a blow to investors, the proponents have \nretained an extremely difficult pleading requirement. The report will \nrequire plaintiffs to allege facts giving rise to a strong inference \nthat the defendant acted with the required state of mind. This state of \nmind or intent requirement must be obtained before any discovery or \ntestimony has even taken place. Most courts have rejected this high \nstandard as being in conflict with the purposes and express language of \nthe Federal rules. The report not only adopts this language but raises \nthe requirement even more.\n  Furthermore, the conference report fails to correct some of the major \nproblems in the Senate bill. These problems include the extremely short \nstatute of limitations and the abrogation of joint and several \nliability in all but a very limited number of circumstances. The report \nretains the immunity for aiders and abettors which would have been a \nboon to the defendants in the Lincoln Savings failure case. The report \nalso retains the requirement that the court appoint a most adequate \nplaintiff, thus eliminating the issues of concern to smaller investors \nand inserting the concerns of the wealthiest investor.\n  I have recently received letters from organizations expressing their \nconcern with this report and legislation. The Fraternal Order of Police \nstate that this legislation would create a privileged class of \ncriminals, by immunizing many of those involved with the markets from \ncivil liability in cases of securities fraud. The UAW describes the \nlegislation as one-sided and contends that it will allow for limited \nremedies to be available for the investor and pension funds which lose \nmoney due to fraudulent investment schemes. I believe that if a more \nbalanced approach to securities law reform could be reached, the \nproponents could gain the support of these groups and hundreds of \nothers.\n  The stock market recently broke 5000 and is as robust and active as \nat any time in our Nation's history. Small investors driven away from \nthe markets due to the crash in the early eighties are starting to \nreturn to the markets. This is not the time to pass legislation which \nwill erode public confidence in the integrity of the markets. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to vote against this report and send it \nback to the conferees, demanding a more balanced approach to securities \nlaw reform.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I am pleased to come to the Senate \nfloor today to express my support for a bill I cosponsored, the Private \nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. I commend Chairman D'Amato \nand Senators Dodd and Domenici for their work on this bill. They have \ndone a fine job of crafting a strong bipartisan measure and then \nguiding it successfully through conference--and I have been pleased to \nwork with them on this issue over the past 3 years.\n  Madam President, this is an important day for many of the small \ninvestors in Washington State and throughout the country. This bill \ntakes the power out of the hands of a few lawyers and puts the power \nback in the hands of the investors. We all know that in many of these \nclass action lawsuits, the investor often recovers as little as 10 \npercent of the damages caused by fraudulent activity while their lawyer \ntakes millions.\n  Madam President, I recently heard from a constituent who received a \nsettlement in a suit against a high technology firm in Washington \nState. This particular investor received a prorata share of the damages \namounting to 3 cents per share, or just $30, while the lawyer in that \nsuit walked away with the rest. The individual in this suit told me, \n``my investment was hurt much more by my lawyer's actions, and his \nextortion of $1 million from the firm, than by any alleged actions on \nthe part of the company's management.''\n  Madam President, this is neither what our investors want nor expect. \nIt is outrageous and needs to be corrected.\n  The legislation before us will reform our securities law so that \ninvestors will have more of a say in the outcome of their suit. It will \nrestore the plaintiff's role and enable them to exercise traditional \nplaintiff functions--including the selection of lead counsel, \nnegotiating fees, and determining the distribution of settlements. \nQuite simply, it puts some common sense back into our legal system.\n  Madam President, I've seen the ads denouncing this legislation, and \nI've heard the arguments opposing this legislation. This bill has \ninspired some very intense, focused, and well-funded opposition.\n  The bill's opponents claim this legislation will harm small and \nelderly investors. Well, I believe that assertion is completely false. \nIn no way does this bill take away one's ability to file suit. Nor does \nit undermine the Securities and Exchange Commission's ability to sue \nfor damages in securities fraud. In fact, the legislation enhances the \nSEC's ability to do so.\n  Madam President, Americans have a right to know their investments are \nsecure--that our money has been invested in good faith. Today, \ninvestors are denied valuable information because companies are \nreluctant to disclose forecasts in fear of litigation. This serves \nnobody well; and it especially hurts investors that are trying to make \nsound, well-educated investments.\n\n  I am pleased to note that the SEC has endorsed the safe harbor \nprovision in this bill. SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt has written, ``the \ncurrent version represents a workable balance that we can support since \nit should encourage companies to provide valuable forward-looking \ninformation to investors while, at the same time, it limits the \nopportunity for abuse.'' I agree with Chairman Levitt and I value his \nopinion. This safe harbor provision will be good for both investors and \ncorporations.\n  Ultimately, if an investor has been the victim of fraud--no matter \nhow big or how little--they have a right to equal treatment under the \nlaw. This legislation ensures that will happen, better than under \ntoday's laws.\n  And, Madam President, Congress has a unique role in promoting \ninvestor confidence. We must encourage investments; investments that \nare needed for capital formation, economic growth, and job creation.\n  This is especially true in Washington State--which is home to many \nhigh technology and biotech companies. And investors in Washington \nState like to invest in these companies.\n  Unfortunately, Washington State's investors are well aware of the \ndamage that is caused by unwarranted court cases. They know these cases \ninhibit job creation and slow economic growth.\n  They know how companies are forced to waste resources and settle \nsuits with capital that could have been used for the research and \ndevelopment of a new product.\n  I have heard from many of these companies in my home State. Companies \nsuch as these--new, growing, forward-looking--are a point of pride in \nthe Pacific Northwest. They reflect the high technology, high wage \neconomy of the future.\n\n[[Page S 17981]]\n\n  Nobody likes to see these companies attacked by a few overzealous \nlawyers. These companies lose millions of dollars each year fighting \nthe allegations of fraud--while the actual investor receives just \npennies on the dollar when a settlement is finally reached.\n  Madam President, this system needs reform, and Congress is obligated \nto correct the situation. And, I want to make it very clear--this bill \nretains an investor's right to bring suit if they are victims of \nsecurities fraud.\n  At the same time, it will clamp down on the abusive suits they prey \non investors and small business owners. It is honest effort to reduce \nthe excessive costs that burden our investors and our economy.\n  Madam President, let me conclude by recalling the first Senate vote \non this bill. When I voted for this bill in June, I said I would not \nsupport a conference report if it contained some of the more onerous \nprovisions in the House bill. Well, not only is this conference report \nalmost identical to the Senate bill, it is even stronger in some \nrespects. It is a good compromise and it restores some common sense to \nour legal system. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n\n                              SAFE HARBOR\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to briefly discuss with \nSenator Domenici one important issue concerning the section 102 ``Safe \nharbor for forward looking statements.'' It is the clear intention of \nthe conference committee that reckless conduct cannot constitute actual \nknowledge for purposes of the safe harbor, isn't it?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. It is the clear intention of the conference \ncommittee that reckless conduct will not constitute either actual \nknowledge or be construed to constitute a knowing commission of a \nviolation of the securities laws for purposes of section 102 safe \nharbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of \n1995.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to support the Securities Litigation \nReform Act of 1995. I thank Senators Domenici, Dodd, and D'Amato for \ntheir sponsorship of this bill, and their leadership in reforming \nsecurities class actions. I am pleased to support this bill, which will \nreform the legal process by which injured parties can recover damages \nfor securities fraud and negligence. It reduces abusive litigation that \nclogs our judicial system and results in reduced recoveries to the \nplaintiffs. Too often the attorneys, not the investors, are the primary \nbeneficiaries of these securities suits.\n  The Senate Banking Committee passed a version of H.R. 1058 by a vote \nof 11 to 4 this spring. The full Senate passed this version on June 28 \nby a vote of 70 to 29. Clearly there is a bipartisan consensus for \nchange. I supported this bill because I believe it modernizes our \nsecurities class action litigation system by reducing the potential for \nfrivolous securities lawsuits, while assuring that defrauded securities \ninvestors receive a greater share of the settlements or awards in their \ncases.\n  H.R. 1058 contains several important reform provisions. It eliminates \nreferral fees currently paid by some attorneys to plaintiffs who \nsuccessfully recommend them to represent all the plaintiffs in a class \naction. It requires the courts to appoint, as lead plaintiff, the party \nwilling to serve who has the greatest financial interest, thus doing \naway with the so-called professional plaintiff who shops for cases to \nfile--frequently as the agent for a lawyer--with little financially at \nstake. The bill would allow the small investor to recover completely \nthrough joint and several liability. And it imposes an affirmative duty \non auditors to disclose financial fraud to the Securities and Exchange \nCommission [SEC], unless the fraud is properly addressed by management.\n  In many cases it is the attorneys, not the investors, who are the \nprimary beneficiaries of these securities suits. For example, National \nEconomic Research Associates, Inc. reported that, in a 12-month period \nending July 1993, the average settlement in securities class actions \namounted to $7.36 million. Attorneys earned an average of $2.12 million \nper settlement, roughly 30 percent of the total. Investors recovered \nonly about 7 cents on the dollar when compared with the amount of \nlosses alleged.\n  Some argue that the small investor will not be able to find relief \nunder this legislation; that, for example, the victims of the Lincoln \nSavings & Loan bond fraud would not have recovered their losses. This \nis incorrect. First, the final bill includes a provision that requires \nthe SEC to determine whether investors who are senior citizens, or \nthose groups with qualified retirement plans, require greater \nprotection against securities fraud. If so, the SEC must submit a \nreport to Congress containing recommendations on protections that the \nCommission determines to be appropriate to thoroughly protect such \ninvestors.\n  Second, H.R. 1058 retains joint and several liability recovery for \nsmall investors with securities claims. Even if the Lincoln S \ninvestors had sued only for those claims covered under H.R. 1058, many \nof them would have been fully compensated. H.R. 1058 specifically \nprovides that, if one defendant is insolvent, the remaining \ncodefendants will remain both jointly and severally liable to investors \nwhose net worth is under $200,000, and who lost more than 10 percent of \ntheir net worth. All of the Lincoln investors who met this standard \nwould have been fully protected had H.R. 1058 been law. In fact, those \ninvestors may have been able to recover more under H.R. 1058. This bill \nimposes statutory restrictions on the size of lawyers' fees in \nsecurities actions. Perhaps, had the plaintiffs' lawyers been prevented \nfrom taking more than the $65 million in fees off the top of the \nsettlement fund, the Lincoln S investors would have received full \ncompensation for their losses.\n  H.R. 1058 provides investors who have been injured as a result of the \nnegligence of another the opportunity to file suit. At the same time, \nit reduces abusive litigation, which clogs our judicial system and \nhurts those plaintiffs with meritorious claims. It is important that \nrecoveries go to the plaintiffs and not to cover court costs, \nattorneys' fees, and other transaction expenses.\n  Mr. President, the Securities Litigation Reform Act will eliminate \nfrivolous securities class actions. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I speak today in support of the conference \nreport to H.R. 1058, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of \n1995. The conference report is a moderate and carefully balanced \ncompromise bill that permits investors in securities to continue to \nfile and win legitimate lawsuits. However, the bill does something that \nis much needed at this time: It gives issuers of securities the ability \nto quickly dismiss meritless and abusive lawsuits.\n  The current system of securities litigation is clearly broken. Why? \nBecause it makes millionaires out of attorneys who repeatedly file \nfrivolous lawsuits. As a matter of fact, securities litigation costs \nAmerican industry $2.4 billion a year, with one-third of this amount \nbeing paid to plaintiffs' attorneys. This results in companies being \nforced to lay off worker and consumers paying higher prices for goods \nand services.\n  The bottom line is that the current system of securities litigation \ndoes not benefit investors or consumers: it benefits a handful of \nattorneys.\n  Here is how the perverse system of securities litigation currently \nworks: There are a handful of plaintiffs law firms in this country that \nspecialize in filing securities class action lawsuits. This is shown by \nthe fact that seven plaintiff law firms in this country receive 63 \npercent of the legal fees generated by securities class action cases. \nThese law firms monitor the stock prices of businesses with computers. \nWhen a corporation's stock price suffers a major drop, the plaintiff's \nlaw firm immediately files a lawsuit. Some 20 percent of securities \nlawsuits are filed within 48 hours of a major drop in the stock price.\n  The reason that these law firms are able to file their lawsuits so \nquickly is that they are suing on behalf of professional plaintiffs, \nwho receive a fee for permitting themselves to be named in the \nlawsuits. The Securities Subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee \nfound that there were plaintiffs who had as much as 14 securities \naction lawsuits filed on their behalf.\n  These law firms justify the filing of these lawsuits by generally \nalleging that the drop in the stock price was \n\n[[Page S 17982]]\ncaused by the corporation or its management acting fraudulently or \nrecklessly. The lawsuits seek for the corporation to pay to its \nshareholders damages in the amount of the difference between the stock \nprice before and after the stock's drop in value.\n  Even if the lawsuit is meritless, the corporation is forced to \nsettle. Why? First, litigating a lawsuit is costly, even if your only \ngoal is to get the lawsuit dismissed for failing to state a cause of \naction. This is because it is very difficult to dismiss such lawsuits, \nand defense expenses for complex securities class action lawsuits can \ntotal between $20,000 and $100,000 a month. Second, the depositions and \nextensive document review associated with these lawsuits are so time \nconsuming that they disrupt the management of the business. On average, \ncompanies that are sued devote 1,000 management and employee hours per \ncase.\n  The end result is that it is worthwhile for a business to settle a \nfrivolous securities lawsuit, because there is rarely ever any cheap \nway of dismissing it.\n  Now, opponents to securities litigation reform are going to tell you \nthat, notwithstanding all of the foregoing, investors still benefit \nfrom the current system of securities litigation. But I'd submit that \nthis system actually harms investors.\n  The first problem, as stated by former SEC Commissioner Carter Beese, \nis that the current system encourages ``counsel to settle for amounts \nthat are too low or fees that are too high.'' The plaintiffs in a \nsecurities class action have a conflict of interest with their lawyers. \nThe lawyers' incentive is for an uncomplicated settlement and an \navoidance of trial. This is because the difficult and time-consuming \nwork for the plaintiffs' lawyers comes at the trial phase; if it can be \navoided by a settlement, the lawyers still get their percentage for \nrelatively little effort. Thus, the lawyers-driven nature of these \nlawsuits tends to short-change investors who have truly been defrauded \nand would benefit from litigating the lawsuit to conclusion.\n  The second problem is that in securities class action lawsuits, when \na corporation makes a settlement payment to a class of shareholders, \nthe shareholders who still own the corporation's stock are not really \ngetting any tangible benefit in return. If the settlement amount is \ncoming from the corporation's money, then it is no more than a quasi-\ndividend, with a law firm taking an average of 33-percent cut for \ngiving the shareholder the privilege of having the quasi-dividend \noccur. This will generally cause the corporation's stock price to drip, \nwhich nullifies the benefit of the settlement. If the settlement amount \ncomes from the corporation's directors' and officers' liability \ninsurance, the corporation will be faced with partly paying it back \nthrough a staggeringly high premium the very next year. Either way, an \ninvestor who continues to own a share of stock in a sued corporation \ndoes not gain much from settlement of the lawsuit.\n  The third and final problem is that investors can no longer get \nuseful forward-looking information about corporations. As former SEC \nCommissioner Carter Beese testified before the Securities Subcommittee \nof the Senate Banking Committee, ``companies go out of their way to \ndisclose every conceivable bit of innocuous information, but very \nlittle useful forward-looking information. At the same time, legion of \nlawyers scrub required filings to ensure that disclosures are as \nmilquetoast as possible, so as to provide no grist for the litigation \nmill.''\n  With all of the problems that we have with our current system of \nsecurities litigation, the moderate relief offered by the conference \nreport is necessary to protect investors, in necessary to protect \nconsumers, and is necessary to protect jobs. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I thank the Chair, and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Private \nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The conference report is a \nbig win for all America's investors, our Nation's businesses, and our \noverall economy.\n  The conference report offers a balanced bipartisan bill that restores \nfairness and integrity to our securities litigation system by \nprotecting innocent companies as well as the rights of the legitimately \ndefrauded investors. The filtering out of the abusive, frivolous class \naction lawsuits that harm investors and only benefit class action \nattorneys will restore integrity to securities lawsuits. We will \nprotect investors and at the same time emerging companies will be able \nto grow and create jobs without the financial burden of abusive \nlitigation.\n  The legislation we have before us today will go a long way toward \ncurbing abuses in securities litigation. It will provide a filter at \nthe earliest stage of a lawsuit to screen out those that have no \nfactual basis. A complaint needs to outline the facts supporting the \nlawsuit and not just the simple conclusion that the defendant acted \nwith the intent to defraud. If the complaint does not outline and \npresent all the facts supporting each of the alleged misstatements or \nomissions, the lawsuit will be terminated.\n  Many times, securities class action suits are characterized by the \n``sue them all and let the judge sort it out'' mentality. In order for \na judge to sort it out, the defendants are required to spend numerous \nhours and expense to defend against a securities class action lawsuit. \nThis bill corrects that problem by requiring plaintiffs to specify the \nstatements alleged to have been misleading.\n  Securities laws are intended to help investors by ensuring a flow of \naccurate and pertinent information regarding public traded companies. \nHowever, the present system reduces the amount of information required \nand companies limit their public statements to avoid allegations of \nfraud. In fact, an American Stock Exchange survey found that 75 percent \nof corporate CEO's limit the information disclosed to investors out of \nfear that greater disclosure would lead to an abusive lawsuit. To \nencourage disclosure of information by companies, the conference report \nwill create a safe harbor. It will provide a procedural mechanism for \ncompanies who make predictive statements to be protected from frivolous \nlitigation if their prediction does not materialize.\n  Mr. President, we have heard a lot of speculation that this \nlegislation would adversely impact small investors. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth because this comprehensive measure will protect \nthe rights of investors who have been legitimately defrauded, while \nproviding new protections for the millions of Americans investors who \nhave been harmed by the recent explosion of abusive and frivolous \nlitigation. While there are many provisions in the measure to deter \nmeritless suits, the bill also requires that the auditors inform the \nSEC of any suspicions of fraudulent activity and restores the authority \nof the SEC to bring aiding and abetting cases for knowing violations of \nsecurities laws. The measure includes a system of proportionate \nliability to reduce the pressure to settle frivolous claims and so that \ncompanies pay only their fair share of a settlement, while retaining \nfull joint and several liability for small investors and for all \ndefendants who knowingly participate in securities fraud.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, this securities legislation reform is \nfair, balanced and passed with strong bipartisan support. I encourage \nmy colleagues to support the conference report and I once again want to \ncommend Senator Domenici and Senator Dodd for their work on this bill.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the conference report to H.R. 1058 addresses \nan issue of great concern to many Americans--securities litigation \nreform. While this is a subject that I believe needs to be addressed \nand one I have some personal views and experiences in, I will not be \nparticipating in the debate or votes on the floor.\n  I have previously informed the Senate that I am engaged in securities \nlitigation of the kind this legislation seeks to reform. Given the \nstatus of this suit and the pending legislation, I will again recuse \nmyself from the proceedings on the matter.\n  I thank the President and fellow Senators for their understanding of \nmy personal situation.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are able to consider \nthe conference report to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act \ntoday. I want to commend my colleagues, the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Senator D'Amato, and the chairman of \n\n[[Page S 17983]]\nthe Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, for their leadership in working \nout the necessary compromise allowing us to bring this bill to the \nfloor. I also want to commend my colleague from Connecticut, Senator \nDodd, whose involvement in this issue is proof that there is nothing \npartisan about securities litigation reform.\n  Our securities markets provide the fuel that drives our economy. When \nthese markets run efficiently, allocating capital to established \ncompanies and to newer, emerging businesses, we all win with more \neconomic growth, more jobs, and a stronger economy.\n  Unfortunately, a handful of lawyers today devote their professional \nlives to gaming the system by filing strike suits alleging violations \nof the Federal securities laws--all in the hope that the defendant will \nquickly settle in order to avoid the expense of prolonged litigation. \nThe lawyers who file these suits often rely on professional plaintiffs, \nshareholders with only a small stake in the company, but who are \nnonetheless willing to stand on the sidelines ready to lend their names \nto the litigation.\n  Needless to say, these strike suits are often baseless. If a stock \nprice falls, these lawyers will file a class action suit claiming that \nthe company was too optimistic in their projections. If the stock price \nsoars, these same lawyers will file suit saying that the company \nwithheld information that caused shareholders to sell too early. In \neffect, the lawsuits act as a litigation tax that raises the cost of \ncapital and chills disclosure of important corporate information to \nshareholders. High-tech, high-growth companies are particularly \nvulnerable to these baseless strike suits because of the volatility of \ntheir stock prices.\n  This bill will reduce the number of meritless securities fraud cases, \nwhile protecting investors, by proposing several commonsense reforms:\n  First, it diminishes the likelihood that these cases will be driven \nby lawyers, instead of real plaintiffs by allowing the most adequate \nplaintiff to be the party with the greatest financial interest.\n  Second, it clamps down on skyrocketing attorney's fees by requiring \nthat fees be awarded as a percentage of the actual recovery based on \nthe efforts of the attorney.\n  Third, it retains joint and several liability for those who knowingly \ncommit fraud, but establishes a system of proportionate liability for \nother, less culpable defendants.\n  Fourth, it adopts the second circuit's pleading standard. This \nrequires plaintiffs to point out specific statements that are supposed \nto be misleading, and removes the ``sue them all and let the judge sort \nit out'' mentality.\n  Fifth, it encourages companies to disclose information to their \nshareholders by granting limited protection to predictive statements \nmade in good faith. Statements that are knowingly false, however, are \nnot protected by this safe harbor.\n  Mr. President, with this bill the Republican-led Congress sends a \nclear message. We have fulfilled our responsibility to provide \ncompanies and investors protection from frivolous lawsuits, ensuring \nthat America will be able to compete in the global marketplace.\n  President Clinton has not indicated whether or not he will support \nthis bill. But the choice is clear. In my view, if he supports this \nbill, he supports creating jobs for Americans. If he opposes it, he \nonly supports enriching the pockets of wealthy trial lawyers at the \nexpense of consumers and investors.\n  In closing, I again commend Chairmen D'Amato and Domenici, and \nSenator Dodd for their work on this critical legislation and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, one of my priorities is to foster a \ncompetitive business environment in Massachusetts and throughout the \nNation that will lead to the creation of skilled, family-wage jobs. A \nsignificant factor in creating a favorable business environment is the \nability to generate capital. The conference report before us today \naddresses the question of the so-called securities strike suits that \nhave had a chilling effect on both the business climate and the \ngeneration of capital for Massachusetts' vanguard technology \nindustries.\n  This legislation has been the subject of intense debate. Some argue \nthat in its attempt to end frivolous strike suits, it will deny \ninvestors the opportunity to recover losses from companies that engaged \nin fraudulent securities actions. This is a legitimate concern in view \nof some of the cases in Massachusetts in which companies repeatedly \nmisrepresented sales, senior officers had to resign and some companies \nhad to declare bankruptcy.\n  Others have countered that the legislation does not go far enough to \nprevent frivolous strike suits based solely on stock fluctuations or \nmissed earnings projections and that the attorneys who bring such suits \nshould face the threat of a loser pays provision.\n  As the Senate has considered various proposals to reform our Nation's \nsecurities laws in this area, I have been mindful of the fact that, \nindeed, there are investors on both sides of this issue. My principal \ngoal--and the yardstick I have used to measure this legislation--is \nwhether it achieves a balance between discouraging truly frivolous \nstrike suits while ensuring companies and individuals are liable for \nactual fraud. Though not prefect, I do believe this legislation has \nstruck a reasonable balance between protecting investors' rights and \nreducing the possibility that companies will be subject to frivolous \nstrike suits.\n  One factor that was extremely important in helping me reach a \ndecision on this legislation was the Securities and Exchange \nCommission's evaluation of the conference report. The SEC, throughout \nthe legislative process, had withheld its endorsement of the \nlegislation. I am pleased that the SEC stated in a letter of November \n15, 1995, that: ``We believe the draft conference report responds to \nour principal concerns.''\n  Of particular importance to me is the safe harbor language that is \nthe product of months of consultation with the Securities and Exchange \nCommission. In my view this provision is the crux of the entire matter. \nThe safe harbor affects a potential investor's decision of whether to \npurchase securities and it affects a company's ability to paint a rosy \nscenario to attract investors. It also directly affects the value of \nthe benefits packages of the company's officers and employees. The \nconference report codifies the judicial ``bespeaks caution'' doctrine \nand will not allow a company simply to use boilerplate cautionary \nlanguage.\n  I am also pleased that the conference report adopts as title III \nlegislation I sponsored originally with Representative Wyden to require \naudits of public companies designed to detect illegal acts. It places \non accountants and company auditors a clear responsibility for early \ndetection and disclosure of illegal actions by management. This title \nrequires auditors to inform immediately the management and/or the SEC \nof illegal acts having a material impact on the issuer's financial \nstatements. I believe these procedures for early detection and \ndisclosure of fraud by the accountants and auditors will serve the \ninterests of both investors and businesses.\n  The conference report should lead to the creation of a more favorable \nclimate for investors and businesses. Investors should gain better \ninformation about the marketplace, more control over securities strike \nsuits and more leverage in recovering a larger share of their losses in \nstrike suits. Businesses should gain the freedom to provide statements \nabout the business outlook that investors and the SEC have encouraged \nand a more favorable climate for raising capital.\n  I especially want to commend Senator Dodd, who has worked tirelessly \non this tough issue, and Senator Domenici for their effort in achieving \na reasonable and balanced bill.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I support the conference report on \nH.R. 1058, the Securities Litigation Reform Act. It is a reasonable \nbill, one that deserves prompt enactment into law, and it provides the \nright kind of reform to help create jobs and the economic growth our \ncountry needs.\n  The need for reform is clear. The Russian roulette of securities \nstrike suits adds a cost to job creation and a chilling effect on \ninvestment. Every single one of the top 10 Silicon Valley high-\ntechnology firms has been sued for securities fraud--every single one. \nAnd 27 of the top 40 high-technology firms have been sued. These firms, \nand \n\n[[Page S 17984]]\nmany others like them, have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars--\nand even more--to defend frivolous suits, an additional cost no startup \ncompany should have to bear. And, while it cannot be quantified, there \nis no doubt that a number of companies never get born in the first \nplace because of the incalculable litigation threat.\n  There are 2,536 electronics companies in my own State of Illinois, \ncompanies that employ 112,000 people, and have an annual payroll of \n$4.9 billion, that are also among the beneficiaries. These companies \nprovide 12 percent of the total manufacturing jobs in Illinois, and the \nvalue of their annual production is over $17 billion.\n  Of course, it is not just high-technology firms in Illinois and \nelsewhere that need this bill. I have concentrated on high-technology \nfirms because they are so important to the future of our economy and \nbecause their stocks tend to be volatile, which makes them prime \ntargets for these kinds of securities lawsuits. The fact that so many \nleading high-technology firms have been sued in an indication of the \nscope and extent of the frivolous litigation problem, a problem this \nbill will correct.\n  The fact is that investors need reform, too. The current system does \nnot benefit them. The damages investors receive in a successful case \namount to as little as 10 to 14 cents on the dollar of alleged losses. \nClearly, the litigation explosion has not helped investors a whole lot.\n  Much more important than damages, however, is information. Most \ninvestors have not been part of any securities litigation class action \nlawsuit, at least not directly, but every investor that is active in \nour capital markets depends on information--and the more information an \ninvestor has, the better the information an investor has, the better \noff that investor is.\n  Enactment of this conference report will reverse the current trend of \ncompanies providing less and less information to investors. Instead, \nbecause of greater confidence that they will not be subject to \nfrivolous suits, companies will be providing more information to the \nmarket. That, in part, is why small investors like the Beardstown \nLadies, and the National Association of Investors Corp. an organization \nrepresenting over 340,000 investors and investment clubs, supports this \nlegislation.\n  Many investors also support this bill because it gives them, rather \nthan the lawyers who are supposed to be working for them, control of \nany class action suits filed. It is the client, rather than the \nattorney, that is supposed to control a lawsuit, and part of the reason \nthis bill is so necessary is that this simple principle has somehow \ngotten lost in recent years.\n\n  However, more is at stake than just the interests of companies and \ninvestors, as important as those interests are. The interests of our \noverall economy, and of our country at large, are also very much at \nissue. The interests of every person who works, or is looking for a \njob, is at stake.\n  The world economy is more and more competitive. Our future prosperity \ndepends on our ability to meet and beat that international competition. \nThat means we need a continuing supply of new ideas, new products, and \nnew companies that can produce the jobs of tomorrow. And that also \nmeans that our capital markets must work efficiently to provide capital \nin the amounts needed to the companies that will provide the jobs and \nthe economic growth that will make the future brighter and more \nprosperous for all of us.\n  These global concerns may seem a long way from the securities law \nissues that are the subject of the bill now before the Senate, but the \nconnection is both strong and direct.\n  American corporations are all too often intensely focused on the \nshort-term price of their stock, instead of the long-term growth and \nprosperity of the business. This short-term focus, which the current \nstate of our securities laws helps foster, distracts senior management, \nmakes too many of our businesses less creative, and undermines the \nability of American businesses to make the investments that have the \nlong-term payoff. By addressing the frivolous lawsuit problem, this \nconference report will free managers to focus on managing their \nbusinesses for the long term, rather than managing to minimize their \nshort term legal exposure. It will give entrepreneurs more time to \ninnovate, and to focus on the future, rather than concentrating on \ntheir legal defense. Companies will be able to concentrate on creating \nnew products and new jobs, because they won't have to devote so much \ntime and attention to lawsuits, and the threat of lawsuits.\n  Moreover, because frivolous lawsuits, and even the threat of \nfrivolous lawsuits, are an impediment to the smooth functioning of our \ncapital markets, removing that impediment will make our capital markets \nmore efficient. And that will also help produce more economic growth \nand more new jobs.\n  I cosponsored S. 240, the original bill that passed the Senate in \nmodified form last June, because that bill was based on a recognition \nof all of these facts. S. 240 was designed to maintain strong investor \nprotection, while making it more difficult to file frivolous or abusive \nlawsuits. It was designed to help ensure that new businesses that \ncreate new jobs and new products have a better chance to get the \ncapital they need, while ensuring that defrauded investors have the \nright to recover their damages. The bill attempted to reduce \ntransaction costs, so that investors who are harmed see a smaller \nportion of their recoveries consumed by attorney's fees and other \ncosts. And it was designed to help our capital markets create more jobs \nand greater long-term economic growth--something that is good for every \nAmerican.\n  I am pleased that the conference report now before the Senate very \nstrongly resembles the bill the Senate sent to conference, rather than \nthe original unbalanced House bill that I do not and could not support. \nIn one key issue area after another, the conference bill follows the \nSenate bill, rather than the House bill. For example, in the area of \nliability standards, the original House bill abolished liability for \nreckless conduct; the Senate bill did not, and the Senate position \nprevailed in conference.\n\n  The House bill abolished liability for fraud on the market. The \nSenate bill left that doctrine unchanged, and the conference bill \nadopts the Senate approach.\n  In the area of pleading, the House bill adopted a standard that was \nsignificantly higher than the second circuit standard, which was the \nstandard adopted in the Senate bill. The Senate position prevailed at \nconference.\n  In the area of fee shifting, the original House bill included a pure \nEnglish rule approach; the Senate bill adopted a rule 11-based \napproach, and the conference bill adopts the Senate position.\n  The House bill included a $10,000 named plaintiff provision; the \nSenate-passed bill did not, and the conference adopted the Senate \nposition.\n  In the area of aiding and abetting, the original House bill did not \nreverse the Central Bank case; the Senate bill restored the ability of \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission to institute enforcement actions \nagainst a person or persons who ``knowingly provides substantial \nassistance to another person in violation of this title.'' The \nconference bill includes the Senate provision.\n  I do not contend, Mr. President, that the bill before us is perfect. \nIt is a compromise. If I had controlled the conference, there would be \nsome issues that would have been resolved somewhat differently. It is \nclear, however, that the bill is a good faith attempt to protect the \npublic interest, investors' interests, and companies' interests, and \nlooking at the overall bill, I think it does a reasonable job of \nmeeting the interests of all three.\n  It is worth keeping in mind what the bill does--and does not--do, and \nwhat this area of law is all about. What we are here talking about is \n``private rights of action'' for fraud under Section 10(b) of the \nSecurities Exchange Act and rule 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission. That statute did not expressly provide private parties with \na right to sue corporations or other parties involved in the issuance \nand sale of securities; this right evolved out of a long series of \njudicial decisions, not Congressional actions.\n  Some argue that the conference report is somehow unbalanced because \nit does not fully overturn the Central Bank case involving aiding and \nabetting, or the Lampf case relating to the statute of limitations in \nprivate 10(b) cases. However, it is worth keeping in \n\n[[Page S 17985]]\nmind that defeating the bill would do absolutely nothing to overturn \neither of these cases, that it would in fact leave the SEC with less, \nrather than more, authority than the bill provides, and that it would \nleave investors and the public in a situation where the courts, rather \nthan the Congress and the President, are making the law in this area.\n  The bill has also been controversial because, in some situations, \nsome defendants are only proportionately liable, rather than jointly \nand severally liable. The conference report however, holds everyone who \ncommits knowing securities fraud jointly and severally liable. Other \ndefendants who are less culpable are proportionately liable, that is, \nthey are responsible for the share of harm they cause. That ensures \nthat parties who may be only 1 percent or 2 percent responsible for the \nfraud are added as defendants to cases simply because they have deep \npockets.\n  Proportionate liability is far from a new concept. We have had it in \nthe tort area in my own State of Illinois for a number of years. It is \nan important and necessary change. Without it, many people will not \ndeal with the small, entrepreneurial, startup companies that are most \nlikely to be sued, because the potential liability is so much greater \nthan the profit they can earn from doing business with these companies. \nMany companies are increasingly unable to find accounting firms and law \nfirms willing to do business with them, and are having increasing \ndifficulty in attracting the best people to sit on their boards of \ndirectors. And the result of that is less information and less \nprotection for investors, and greater hurdles for the new companies on \nwhich our economic future depends. And the result of that is less of \nthe new, good, well-paying manufacturing jobs our economy and our \ncountry needs.\n  Of course, in some cases, the parties most responsible for the fraud \nare judgment proof; they have no assets that can be found. In that \nsituation, the conference report provides additional protections for \nsmall investors. First, it says that defendants that are \nproportionately liable have their share of responsibility increased by \nup to 50 percent of their proportionate share, so that all investors \nare better compensated for the losses they suffered. Second, for small \ninvestors, those with a net worth of under $200,000 who suffer a loss \nof at least 10 percent of their net worth, every defendant is jointly \nand severally responsible for paying those damages.\n  Some object to the rule 11 provisions of the conference report. \nHowever, the conference report simply requires the judge to look at \nrule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure--which calls for \nsanctions for frivolous lawsuits, to determine whether any party \nviolated Rule 11 in the complaint, responsive pleadings, or dispositive \nmotions relating to the case, and if so, to impose sanctions. That \nsimply puts some teeth into the application of rule 11, and it is teeth \nthat are needed, because frivolous suits filed with little thought as \nto their merit can cost the defending companies hundreds of thousands \nof dollars in legal fees, and in the time of the companies' executives. \nAnd even those fees are not a good investment for the company, even \nwhen they win, because they divert money that should be going into \ncreating more jobs and growth.\n\n  Finally, the most controversial part of the bill involves the so-\ncalled safe harbor. This provision in the conference report has the \nsupport of the SEC and, in some ways, offers more protection for \ninvestors--and less for issuers of securities--than do some leading \ncourt decisions in this area. The heart of what is at issue here is \nwhat are known as forward looking statements: statements that describe \nfuture events or that estimate the likelihood of selected future events \noccurring. Rule 175 of the SEC, which currently partially governs this \narea, states that forward looking statements made with a reasonable \nbasis and in good faith cannot be used for as a basis for a fraud \naction. However, as a practical matter, the safe harbor it provides \nturns out not to be very safe.\n  What added real protection was a third circuit case that recognized \nthe ``bespeaks caution'' doctrine, a doctrine that is now law in at \nleast five circuits. Under this doctrine, forward looking statements \naccompanied by meaningful cautionary statements--that is, statements \nthat indicate the specific risks that the forward looking statements \nwill not come true--are, as a matter of law, immaterial and therefore \ncannot be used as a basis for a fraud action.\n  The conference report essentially codifies the bespeaks caution \ndoctrine. Moreover, in response to concerns raised by the distinguished \nranking Democratic member of the Banking Committee, Senator Sarbanes, \nthe conference report does not provide protection for statements not \ncovered under the bespeaks caution provisions made with the actual \nknowledge that they are false.\n  I am pleased to be able to say that the SEC supports the safe harbor \nlanguage in the conference report. Chairman Levitt, in a November 15 \nletter, said that the provision ``represents a workable balance that we \ncan support since it should encourage companies to provide valuable \nforward-looking information to investors while, at the same time, it \nlimits the opportunity for abuse.''\n  The SEC, in endorsing this part of the conference report, \ndemonstrated an understanding that action is necessary in the safe \nharbor area, and that the current state of the law results in companies \nproviding less information to investors than they would like to. A \nrecent report by the American Stock Exchange documented the \nCommission's concern. It found that 75 percent of corporate CEO's limit \nthe information disclosed to investors out of fear that greater \ndisclosure would make them more vulnerable to abusive securities \nlawsuits.\n  Mr. President, there is a lot more in this bill, and there is a lot \nmore I could say about it. I will conclude, however, by simply \nrepeating what I said at the outset of my remarks. This is a good bill. \nIt does not fully satisfy me, and it probably does not fully satisfy \nany other Senator. But it does provide the kind of reforms that are \nbadly needed and that are long overdue. And the bill accomplishes its \nreform objectives in a way that protects investor interests, including \nthe interests of small investors like the Beardstown Ladies.\n  I want to congratulate the distinguished chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Senator D'Amato; my good friend from Connecticut, Senator \nDodd; and the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici-- \nwho has now rejoined the Banking Committee--for their leadership and \nfor all of their hard work. This bill would not be possible without the \ncontributions that each of them have made. I also want to commend the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes, the ranking \nDemocratic member of the Banking Committee, for improving the bill, \neven though he opposes it.\n  In my view, this legislation addresses a set of issues that need to \nbe addressed. It is good for investors, companies, our capital markets, \nour economy, and for the American people generally. It will help \ngenerate additional economic growth and new jobs. I therefore urge my \ncolleagues to join me in voting for the conference report on H.R 1058, \nthe Securities Litigation Reform Act.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am going to vote against this \nconference report.\n  Mr. President, the legislation before us is described as a bill to \nprotect investors and to maintain confidence in our capital markets. In \nmy view, however, it does neither. Instead, the legislation would \nshield too many wrongdoers from being held accountable for their \nmisdeeds, and it could ultimately reduce investor confidence in our \nmarkets.\n  When this bill was before the Senate, Mr. President, I expressed \nspecial concern about the so-called safe harbor provision of the bill. \nThis provision has been improved in the conference report, but it is \nstill problematic. For example, it eliminates any duty to update \nforward-looking statements. This means that if a business projects \nearnings of a certain amount and 1 month after making this statement, \nit becomes apparent that the projected earnings will be significantly \nless, or perhaps the company will even lose money, the company is not \nobligated to correct those statements. I do not understand why we would \nwant to encourage this behavior.\n\n[[Page S 17986]]\n\n  As some of my colleagues know, prior to coming to the U.S. Senate, I \nworked in the private sector. I co-founded a company with two others \nthat today employs over 20,000 people. After the company went public in \n1961, I filed countless statements with the SEC as its CEO. As the CEO, \nI believe it was important for investors to have as much information as \npossible.\n  Each year, I made it a practice to project earnings for the following \nyear. And if those projections needed modification due to a changed \ncircumstances, I quickly went to the public to alert them to any \nrevision. This process had significant rewards because investor \nconfidence in my former company caused our stock, which is traded on \nthe New York Stock Exchange, to sell at among the highest price-\nearnings ratios of all listed securities on any exchange.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that there are abuses in securities \nlitigation, and I believe those abuses should be addressed. That is why \nI supported amendments to improve the legislation when it was before \nthe Senate. Among other things, these amendments would have provided \naiding and abetting liability in private implied actions; inserted a \nsafety net to ensure that small investors are able to fully recover \ntheir losses; and extended the status of limitations period on these \nclaims, thus making it more difficult for bad actors to hide their \nfraud.\n  In opposing these amendments, the sponsors of the bill cited some of \nthe more egregious practices of professional plaintiffs and certain \nlawyers. What they do not mention is that this behavior would have been \ncurbed by less controversial provisions contained in this bill, such as \nprohibitions against referral fees and attorney conflicts of interest; \nrequirements that the share of the settlement awarded to the name \nplaintiffs be calculated in the same manner as the shares awarded to \nall other members of the class and that the name plaintiff certify that \nhe did not purchase the security at the direction of his attorney; a \nprohibition against excessive attorney's fees; and an assurance that \nall members of the class have access to information held by counsel of \nthe name plaintiff.\n  The sponsors of this legislation cite compelling anecdotal evidence \nof abuse by the so-called professional plaintiffs and their \nunscrupulous attorneys. I agree there are abusive securities class \nactions suits filed every year. I also agree that we need to protect \ncompanies, and even other shareholders, from these people. But in our \nzeal to tackle this problem, we should take care not to stifle \nlegitimate claims and to harm our markets, which are the strongest they \nhave ever been in our history.\n  Mr. President, I would like to support legislation to curb frivolous \nsecurities lawsuits because I believe there are problems. However, I \ncannot in good conscience vote for a bill that I believe will insulate \nfraudulent conduct, prevent investors injured by fraud from fully \nrecovering damages, and chill meritorious litigation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nsecurities litigation reform legislation that has now returned from \nconference.\n  Legal reform is complex. We have to protect the interests and rights \nof consumers while ensuring the law does not allow frivolous lawsuits. \nI believe this conference report achieves that balance. I originally \ncosponsored the bill because I concluded there has been a problem in \nthe area of securities law. In Maryland, my constituents have told me \nthere is a race to the courthouse door to file a lawsuit. The victims \nof these practices include high-technology companies, their accountants \nand others.\n  We cannot afford this race to the courthouse because it ultimately \nmeans a loss of jobs, a loss of opportunity. Money spent on liability \ninsurance premiums and expensive litigation is money that cannot be \nspent on investments and jobs.\n  While I want to end abuses in the system, I also want to keep the \ncourthouse door open for the little guy, for the consumer. I am not \ninterested in protecting crooks or swindlers. That is why I support \nthis legislation. It protects both consumers and honest companies while \nallowing the law to go after fraud and abuse.\n  I am pleased that, with the enactment of this legislation, we will \nhave safe harbor rules endorsed by the Securities and Exchange \nCommission. I commend the conference committee for working with the SEC \non this matter. These rules will allow companies to provide valuable \ninformation about their future plans. I am pleased investors will have \nthe information they need to make important financial decisions. At the \nsame time, this provision does not cover company projections that \ndefraud investors. Judges will be able to make sure that a company \nqualifies for safe harbor protection.\n  This debate is about the U.S. economy in the 21st century. Much of \nour economic future is in new and developing industries such as high \ntechnology and bio-technology. These emerging jobs are created only \nwhen companies generate capital to allow them to move into new fields. \nWithout a balanced legal system these companies will spend too much on \nlitigation costs, and not enough on investments to generate jobs.\n  I am pleased that this legislation has moved forward with bipartisan \nsupport. The bill that passed the Senate received overwhelming votes \nfrom both parties. In conference it would have been easy to steer this \nbill toward extremism, but the conferees worked toward a bill that we \ncan all continue to support. I especially commend the efforts of long \ntime supporters Senator Dodd and Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. President, I hope any future legal reforms will meet the same \ntest of balance and moderation that this reform does.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in June 1995, I addressed the Senate to \noffer my support for securities-litigation reform as embodied in H.R. \n1058. Today, I am pleased to support the bill that the House-Senate \nconference committee has produced. Today's bill draws on the key \nprovisions of S. 240 to make many important reforms to prevent abusive \nlitigation connected with the issuance of securities. These changes \nwill be made without in any way undermining protection for investors \nagainst genuine fraud or other misconduct by issuers. To the contrary, \nthey will improve the investment climate in this country, which will \nmake it easier to start businesses which create jobs.\n  Today I would like to focus on one set of reforms the bill will make. \nThe bill will require courts to sanction attorneys who file frivolous \npleadings. This reform will apply both to lawyers who file frivolous \npleadings on behalf of plaintiffs and those who file frivolous \npleadings on behalf of defendants. This is a sound proposal which \nshould command strong support from both sides of the aisle.\n  Under current law, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 requires all \nattorneys to have some factual and legal basis for filing any claim or \ndefense. If attorneys violate this requirement, courts may impose \nsanctions against the violator. Right now, however, the courts do not \nhave to consider sanctions.\n  Today's bill makes three changes.\n  First, it requires courts to find at the end of all securities \nactions whether any attorney violated rule 11 in filing any complaint, \nresponsive pleading, or dispositive motion.\n  Second, the court would have to impose sanctions if it found such a \nviolation.\n  Third, the presumption is that the district court will sanction \nattorneys violating rule 11 by requiring them to pay the other side's \nattorneys' fees. Under the bill, it will be a little harder for a \ndistrict court to impose this sanction on those who file complaints \nthan on those who file responsive pleadings or dispositive motions. \nThose who file responsive pleadings or dispositive motions will be \nsubject to this sanction if the responsive pleading or dispositive \nmotion fails to comply with rule 11(b). By contrast, those who file \ncomplaints will be subject to this sanction only for substantial \nfailure to comply with rule 11(b).\n  Regardless of the party affected, the court may select another \nsanction if First, the presumptive sanction imposes an unreasonable \nburden on the sanctioned party, second, that sanction is unjust; and \nthird, declining to impose such a sanction would not impose a greater \nburden on the party in whose favor sanctions would be imposed. In the \nalternative, the party against whom sanctions would be imposed may \n\n[[Page S 17987]]\nrebut the presumption of sanctions by demonstrating that the rule 11 \nviolation was de minimis.\n  We should particularly note two important features of this reform. \nFirst, the district court will have to impose a sanction only on \nsomeone who filed a frivolous pleading--that is, a pleading wholly \nlacking a legal or factual basis. Thus, this reform will not deter \nlegitimate litigation. Second, the sanction is paid by the person \nsigning the frivolous pleading--that is to say, as a general matter, by \nthe attorney responsible for it--not by the party the attorney is \nrepresenting.\n  It was suggested, Mr. President, that S. 240's changes to rule 11 \nwere really a back-door means of shifting fees. That was incorrect. It \nis equally incorrect as to the rule 11 provisions in the conference \nreport. These are not loser-pays provisions. They will not sanction all \nthose who come up short in court. They will sanction only those who \nviolate the minimal requirement of having some factual and legal basis \nfor arguments in complaints, responsive pleadings, and dispositive \nmotions. Such frivolous behavior clogs our courts, drains economic \nresources from parties, kills current jobs, and hinders the creation of \nnew ones.\n  Moreover, the substantive rule of attorney conduct in this provision \nis the one which exists under rule 11 now. The change from the current \nrule 11 is procedural, not substantive. Today's bill simply requires \nthe district court to determine whether that rule, which already \napplies, has been violated, and to impose sanctions if it has.\n  The Supreme Court itself has observed that securities litigation has \nbeen especially prone to misuse as a tool to extort settlements. It is \nCongress's responsibility to do something to put an end to this abuse. \nThe rule 11 provisions are one mechanism this legislation puts in place \nto do just that.\n  Some on the floor have expressed concern that the Federal judiciary \nmay abuse its power to impose sanctions pursant to this provision. I \nsimply do not believe that is going to happen. From my position on the \nJudiciary Committee, I have the occasion to talk to many judges and \njudicial nominees. I have questioned judicial nominees on many topics, \nincluding their ability to exercise their powers impartially toward \nboth plaintiffs and defendants. I firmly believe that the individuals \nthis Senate is confirming, and those that have been confirmed in the \npast, will exercise this power wisely and prudently for the betterment \nof our legal system. Mr. President, the bill we are voting on today is \nan outstanding piece of legislation. Its sponsors, proponents, and the \nconferees deserve all of our thanks for producing something that will \nstrengthen our economy and it will benefit all Americans. I offer my \nwholehearted support to the bill before this Senate and urge my \ncolleagues to vote for it.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I understand the opponents of the bill \nare gathering their forces, and as we are waiting for that to happen, \nrather than spend the time in a quorum call, I would simply make an \nobservation that I have made previously in response to the Senator from \nCalifornia which is, first, that none of the losses that occurred as a \nresult of the Keating S circumstance to which she referred so often \nwould be affected by this legislation. All of the remedies that were \navailable to those people in the Keating circumstance would still stay \nin the law. The newspaper editorials which she quoted that implied to \nthe contrary are incorrect. This has nothing to do with the Keating S \ncircumstance.\n  The other point that I would make again is that when we are talking \nabout protecting investors, we are talking about the owners of the \ncompany--that is what investors are--and anything that damages the \ncompany, or damages the investors. So it is unfair to try to pit \ncompanies against investors as has been implied in some of the articles \nwhich she quoted.\n  I say to my friend from Nevada that I am prepared to yield at any \npoint that an opponent to the bill might arrive.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I appreciate, as always, the accommodation \nof my friend, the distinguished Senator from Utah. We have worked to \naccommodate leadership I think on both sides of the aisle by these time \nagreements that we previously entered into. I do not see anybody from \nour side.\n  If I might respond very briefly to the distinguished Senator's \ncomment, there is in my view a fundamental disagreement here. The \nKeating case is highly relevant, relevant in the sense that its $262 \nmillion recovery was based upon a violation of the very act that we \nseek to amend here, which is the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a caption of the lawsuit filed in the \nU.S. District Court, District of Arizona, which is the Keating lawsuit, \nbe printed in the Record. So that the recovery of some $262 million in \nthe Keating case was based upon a securities violation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  [United States District Court, District of Arizona, In re American \n Continental Corporation/Lincoln Savings & Loan Securities Litigation, \nMDL Docket No. 834, This Document Relates To: Civ-90-0566 PHX RMB, Civ-\n90-0567 PHX RMB, Civ-90-0568 PHX RMB, Civ-90-0569 PHX RMB, Civ-90-0570 \n                     PHX RMB, Civ-90-0574 PHX RMB]\n\n  Sarah B. Shields, et al., Plaintiffs, vs. Charles H. Keating, Jr., \n           Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, First . . .\n\n       [Caption continued on following page.]\n       Sixth consolidated amended class action complaint for \n     violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the \n     Securities Act of 1933, and the Racketeer Influenced and \n     Corrupt Organizations Act.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, very briefly by way of comment I say it is \nmy view--and I think the view of those who have analyzed the bill--that \nof the $262 million that was recovered in the Keating case, $121 \nmillion was recovered against aiders and abettors; that is, accounting \nfirms, law firms, and other professionals.\n  The conference report fails to restore that liability. So that at \nleast for private causes of action--that is the thrust of the \ncurtailments that this legislation imposes--there would be an inability \nfor the 23,000 plaintiffs in the Keating case that recovered $121 \nmillion. That would not be possible under the status of the law today \nbecause this legislation does not restore the aider and abettor. It may \nvery well be true that the SEC can move against aiders and abettors. \nBut even that has been somewhat obfuscated. I believe that those who \nare far more expert than I would tell you that it is not clear even if \nthe SEC would be able to seek recovery against the Keating situation of \nwhich there are aiders and abettors. But clearly those who bring \nprivate causes of action would not.\n  Again, we have this informal colloquy with my friend from Utah. He \nis, I think, suffering from the same disability as I. We have tried to \nprotect time for those who wanted to speak. But they are not on the \nfloor. I would certainly be delighted to engage him in a colloquy or \ndiscussion or let him continue to speak until someone returns to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as I look at the time allocated under the \nunanimous-consent agreement, the Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan] has 10 \nminutes. If he wishes to take that 10 minutes now, that could get us at \nleast that much farther down the road.\n  Mr. BRYAN. The suggestion of my friend from Utah is always compelling \nand intriguing and tempting. May I graciously decline his kind offer, \nwhich I know is offered in the spirit of trying to accommodate and move \nthis process forward as is his want and intent in every case. But I \nthink I will respectfully decline that. We are not going to be able to \nprotect all of the 7 minutes we have for each of the speakers. We will \nhave to make those adjustments because the time continues to run. I \nunderstand that we have more time on this side, those of us in \nopposition, than he does in support. That time is going to continue to \nrun.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Under those circumstances, Mr. President, I would \nsuggest the absence of a quorum, and ask unanimous consent that it be \ncharged to the opponents--I withhold.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I realize the time is running with a vote at \n4:45. I have time reserved. I know our colleague from Nevada, our other \ncolleague, Senator Harry Reid, yielded whatever time he had remaining \nto me.\n\n  Let me underscore a point here, Mr. President, while we are waiting. \nI will yield the floor the minute I see a colleague arrive.\n  Let me get back to the bottom line, if I can. We are talking about a \ngroup \n\n[[Page S 17988]]\nof attorneys on one side who are vehemently opposed to this bill. They \nare doing everything to stop it. I point out categorically what we are \nlooking at here for every dollar is 14 cents that goes to the investors \nand about 33 cents going to the attorneys in these matters. You do not \nneed to know much more than that. It is a system that is out of control \nand out of whack. It needs to be brought back into line of the original \nintent.\n  That is really what this is all about. We have included provisions \nthat require auditors to check for fraud and to report fraud; set up a \nsystem that protects small investors for proportionate liability \nmatters.\n  The suggestion has been made--I say this with all due respect--that \nthis is somehow a Keating matter. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth; or trying to suggest that somehow Dillinger may have been \ninvolved. This is ridiculous. The Keating matter had little or nothing \nto do with securities. It was mostly to do with S's. And this bill \nwill not change the outcome one iota because it was out-and-out fraud \nand lies. It was not about some future statements but about present \nfacts. Mr. Keating was suggesting that the Federal Government was going \nto back all of the investments that were made by people. That, of \ncourse, was a complete falsehood. There is no comparison here.\n  That is really I would say sort of an effort to try to desperately \nconvince people that somehow this legislation is harmful to the \ninterests of investors. What it does is strengthen the hand of \ninvestors tremendously by giving them the right to choose the \nattorneys, giving them the right to decide what the settlement will be, \nif there is going to be any settlement, and giving them the right to \ndetermine what the attorney's fees would be. That is what we are trying \nto do here.\n  These investors have been taken to the cleaners by hired \nprofessionals. Plaintiffs who own one or two shares of stock in many \ncases are brought in and given big bonuses for the outcome and set up \nas the plaintiffs in these cases. This is really a scam. One lawyer \nsaid, ``I have the best practice in the world when it comes to \nsecurities litigation. I have no clients.'' In fact, he was the \nattorney and the plaintiff in these matters.\n  That is what we trying to go correct here. We spent 4 years at it \nwith a strong bipartisan approach that has drawn us to the point where \nwe are about to adopt a conference report and send it to the President. \nI am hopeful he will sign it. I think it is right, it is balanced \nfairly, and it is moderate. It attempts to deal with a situation that \nmost people today agree needs to be corrected, including even the \nopponents of the legislation.\n  As someone who has been involved in this for almost 5 years, when we \nfirst brought up the legislation we were told that there was no need \nfor my bill at all.\n  At least the opponents are admitting there is a need. They just do \nnot like all the provisions of the bill. So I am hopeful that our \ncolleagues, the 69 who supported this legislation back several months \nago--we have improved this bill. We improved the safe harbor provisions \nto such an extent that the SEC, which was reluctant to support the bill \nwhen it first came out of the Senate, today says those safe harbor \nprovisions are provisions which do provide the kind of balance we are \ntalking about. That is their analysis and not mine. There are enough \neditorial comments here that indicate that this bill makes sense.\n  So, again, given the strong vote in the House, which was a totally \ndifferent bill, by the way--and Senator Reid of Nevada is absolutely \ncorrect. The ads are running, paid for by these affluent lawyers \nfrightened to death they may lose a little business. You are talking \nabout a House bill. That bill is gone. This is now the Senate version \nthat was basically adopted by the conference.\n  So I am hopeful at 4:45, less than an hour from now, the Senate will \ngive us a good, strong, bipartisan vote reflecting the work that has \nbeen done--hundreds and hundreds of hours, 5,000 pages of testimony, \nalmost 100 witnesses, 12 sets of hearings through three Congresses. \nThat is the way a bill ought to be adopted here, where you bring people \ntogether, Democrats and Republicans, fashioning a good piece of \nlegislation and endorsed by the major regulatory agency of the country \nthat believes we have done a good job here.\n  I think on balance this is a piece of legislation which is going to \nimprove the quality of life in this country, and particularly for those \nindustries and businesses that have been the primary targets. One-half \nof all the firms in Silicone Valley have been subjected to securities \nfraud suits in the last 4 or 5 years. That just gives you an indication \nof what is going on here. These new startup, high-tech firms, they are \nthe ones who are victimized by this. Those are the firms of the future.\n  Mr. President, I see our distinguished colleague from Florida has \narrived here. We were trying to fill in a little time until someone \narrived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. I will yield the floor.\n  If my friend from Florida is prepared to go----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Would you like----\n  Mr. DODD. I am going to reserve a couple minutes at the end. I was \njust trying to fill in a little gap here while we waited for the \nopponents of the bill to come on over and express their views.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, if I may, in the spirit of comity, \naccommodation, fairness, and respect, even though the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut has exhausted his time, and if we were trying \nto adhere to the rules rigidly, he would not have an opportunity to \ncomment further, I would yield from our side of the aisle 2 minutes of \nthe time heretofore allocated to the distinguished senior Senator from \nFlorida, Senator Graham, to my friend, the senior Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Well, I am always appreciative of my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \n2 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, no. I will reserve the 2 minutes. In the \nmeantime, our colleague from Florida has arrived. I know the opponents \nwant to be heard on this. I appreciate the gracious allocation, at the \nappropriate time, of 2 minutes. And I will make particular reference \nthen of the fine job that the Senator from Nevada has done on this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BRYAN. In the interest of fair and full disclosure, the Senator \nhas not 2 minutes to reserve. He has exhausted his. If he needs it, I \nwill tender it to him.\n  I yield the full 7 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Florida. \nHe can yield any part of that he feels he does not need.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it is ironic that we are having this \ndebate today. This debate coincides with the last month of the \nexistence of the Resolution Trust Corporation. The Resolution Trust \nCorporation was a congressionally created corporation to deal with the \nsecond largest financial crisis in the history of the United States of \nAmerica, second only to the Great Depression.\n  That crisis, of course, was the savings and loan debacle. That \ndebacle was not an accident. It had very specific origins. It had \nidentifiable causes. And, sad to say, Mr. President, many of those \norigins, many of those causes emanated from this Chamber.\n  It was this Chamber which in early 1980 passed ill-considered \nlegislation that, among other things, dramatically increased the level \nof Federal guarantee of savings and loans accounts, without making \nappropriate adjustments to the premiums we paid to support those \nguarantees, and made other changes which facilitated the ability of \nthose who wished to gain by plundering these institutions of trust the \nopportunity to do so.\n  As a consequence of those actions, which started here, we had one of \nthe great financial crises and one of the most expensive financial \ncrises in our Nation's history. As I say, Mr. President, it is ironic \nthat we recognize this month, December 1995, as the last month of the \nResolution Trust Corporation's efforts to try to extricate ourselves \nfrom that crisis, and in this month we now take up legislation which I \nbelieve has the potential of laying the groundwork for another great \nfinancial crisis in America.\n  Another irony, Mr. President, is that there has been no time in our \nNation's history when our stockmarkets were more in public favor. \nRecently, for the \n\n[[Page S 17989]]\nfirst time in their history, the Dow Jones passed the 5000 mark and \ncontinues to grow beyond that. The reason for the strength of our stock \nmarket is fundamentally the confidence that the investing American has \nin our stockmarkets. That is an asset of our free enterprise system, \nMr. President, that we need to guard zealously.\n\n  Mr. President, I am afraid that the action that we are being asked to \ntake today moves away from that close guarding of the confidence of the \nAmerican investor in the American stock market.\n  Let me just mention a few areas of particular concern to me. I am \nconcerned about the provision that will make it easier, will almost \nprovide immunization for oral and written statements of expectation as \nto corporate activity. The whole purpose of this legislation--and I \nthink a legitimate purpose, Mr. President--was to eliminate frivolous \nlawsuits, to eliminate a practice in which firms were subjected to \nlitigation, not with the expectation of a jury or other judicial \nverdict indicating that the company had behaved in an inappropriate \nway, but in order to be able to negotiate a settlement based on that \nsettlement being less expensive than the cost of defense and the \nadverse effect which the litigation would have on the image of the \ncorporation.\n  But this legislation goes far beyond what is required in order to \nsort out the frivolous from the serious. And one of the best examples \nof that is what has happened in this so-called safe harbor provision. \nWhen this left the Senate it contained some protections. It contained a \nprotection that stated that statements which were knowingly made with \nthe expectation, purpose, and actual intent of misleading investors \nwould not secure the benefits of the safe harbor. As hard as it is to \nbelieve, Mr. President, that provision has been eliminated from the \nlegislation as it now comes back from the conference committee.\n  Mr. President, there are other examples of where the conference \ncommittee has taken action that has made this bill less protective of \ninvestors without adding to the benefit of sorting out the frivolous \nfrom the serious litigation. I am concerned, Mr. President, about the \nfact that we have continued to have the unreasonably short statute of \nlimitations of 3 years, a period of time in which for many of these \nreal cases of fraud and abuse they would not even be known, much less \nbe known in time to do the necessary investigation prior to the \nbringing of litigation.\n  Mr. President, we have made it extremely difficult, after an award is \ngranted, after it has been determined that, in fact, there was \nfraudulent activity and a judgment is entered on behalf of the \nplaintiff, we made it very difficult for the plaintiff to be able to \nrecover, particularly, as is frequently the case, when one or more of \nthe major parties turns out to be insolvent.\n\n  So, Mr. President, in the spirit of attempting to achieve one very \nfocused objective, we have engaged in broad-scale amputation of the \nability of private litigants to maintain the integrity of our \nsecurities law. And we do this, Mr. President, at the same time we are \nabout to take up a conference report which will freeze the budget of \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission. So both of the arms which are \nused in order to contain fraudulent activities in the securities \nsector, private litigation and the Securities Exchange Commission, are \nabout to be severely restrained.\n  So, Mr. President, for those reasons, I urge my colleagues to defeat \nthis conference report in hopes that we will then focus on legislation \nthat will accomplish this narrow objective.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record statements made by one of my constituents, Mr. F.K. \nGlasbrenner of Longwood, FL, a resolution by the Florida Association of \nCounties, and an editorial from the Miami Herald, all of which bemoan \nthe inadequacies of this legislation to achieve the purpose stated.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 Longwood, FL,\n\n                                                 October 23, 1995.\n     Senator Bob Graham,\n     Hart Senate Office Bldg,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Senator Connie Mack,\n     Hart Senate Office Bldg,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Representative John Mica,\n     Cannon Bldg,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Representative Bill McCollum,\n     Rayburn Bldg,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Gentlemen: The managing editor, Frank Lalli, of MONEY \n     magazine has informed his readers, and I am one, that the \n     securities litigation reform bills, H.R. 1058 and S. 240, are \n     certainly not in the bests interests of the investor in the \n     United States.\n       The original intention of the bills were to discourage \n     frivolous securities suits but in the end they really did \n     something different. In their present form they legalize \n     securities fraud. The bills protect company executives who \n     deliberately misrepresent their firm's prospects. If an \n     invester sues to right a wrong and he loses, the judge can \n     force him to pay the winners legal fees. In addition both \n     bills failed to reinstate fundamental investor protections \n     stripped away by recent Supreme Court decisions which were:\n       Defrauded investors can be longer sue hired guns who assist \n     a dishonest company officer. This would include accountants, \n     brokers, lawyers and bankers.\n       Investors cannot sue at all if they fail to file within \n     three years after the fraud occurs, even when the crime is \n     not discovered until after the deadline.\n       I implore all of you to have the House-Senate conference \n     committee correct the final bill to vastly improve the United \n     States investor's rights. Don't allow white collar crime to \n     the legalized, there is too much of it already.\n           Sincerely,\n     F.K. Glasbrenner.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                              Florida Association of Counties,\n\n                                Tallahassee, FL, October 24, 1995.\n     Re H.R. 1058/S. 240, Securities Litigation Reform Act.\n\n     Hon. Bob Graham.\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On Behalf of Florida's 67 counties, I \n     would like to thank you for voting against final passage of \n     H.R. 1058/S. 240, the Securities Litigation Reform Act. While \n     the Florida Association of Counties favor efforts to deter \n     frivolous securities lawsuits, I strongly believe that \n     legislation to accomplish this worthy goal must also ensure \n     rights of investors to seek recovery against those who engage \n     in securities market fraud. H.R. 1058/S. 240 not only fails \n     to protect investors' rights, but seriously limits investors' \n     ability to seek recovery from those who help to commit fraud.\n       Since the provisions of the House bill, H.R. 1058, go even \n     further than the Senate bill in undermining the ability of \n     investors to seek recovery in securities fraud cases, it \n     appears that there is virtually no chance for a final bill \n     that protects the rights of investors and that it is likely \n     the House & Senate conference report will be worse than the \n     original Senate bill. I urge you, therefore, to vote against \n     the conference report on H.R. 1058 when it comes before the \n     Senate for a vote.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                 John Wayne Smith,\n     Governmental Liaison.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, Nov. 14, 1995]\n\n                         Liars' Bill of Rights?\n\n       While most of the country is paying attention to the feud \n     over the federal budget, a sinister piece of legislation is \n     making its way through Congress unnoticed. This bill lets \n     companies report false information to investors. That's \n     right, it essentially licenses fraud. It has passed both \n     houses in slightly different forms. A compromise bill will be \n     written soon. If it passes, President Clinton ought to slay \n     it in its tracks.\n       This bill is a story of good intentions. Some companies \n     have been plagued by frivolous lawsuits from investors who \n     aren't happy with the company's performance. The investors \n     allege, in essence, that the company had forecast good \n     results and then didn't deliver. That, say the plaintiffs, \n     constitutes fraud.\n       Well, often it doesn't. Investing has risks, including \n     market downturns. When investors sue over mere bad luck, they \n     cost companies money, clog courts, and drain profits from \n     other investors.\n       Trouble is, by trying to stop this abuse, Congress mistook \n     a simple answer for the right answer. Its solution, in plain \n     terms, was to declare virtually all promises by all companies \n     to be safe from legal challenge. Under this ``remedy,'' \n     company executives now can promise investors anything they \n     like, with not so much as a nod to reality.\n       They can't legally lie, about the past, but if their claims \n     are ``forward-looking,'' they can promise you the moon to get \n     you to invest, and no one can sue them later for being \n     misleading.\n       Well, almost no one. The bill would allow legal action in \n     the case of egregious, deliberate fraud, but you'd have to \n     prove that it was intentional. And you'd have just three \n     years to discover the fraud and furnish your proof.\n       It's rare enough to prove outright intent under the best \n     circumstances, but under this bill, if executives can \n     stiffarm you for just 36 months (not a big challenge), they'd \n     be home free. And then--in another hair-raising provision of \n     the bill--you'd be stuck for the company's entire legal bill. \n     Facing such a risk, no small investor, no matter how badly \n     cheated, would ever dare sue.\n\n[[Page S 17990]]\n\n       This bill evidently struck many members of Congress as a \n     simple answer to a nagging problem. It's nothing of the kind. \n     The problem is real enough, but its solution isn't simple. \n     And it certainly doesn't reside in a law authorizing phony \n     statements to investors.\n       President Clinton should veto this blunder. Then, when the \n     fight over the budget is over, Congress can take time to \n     think up a more rational solution to the problem.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I suspect not many opinions are going to be changed at \nthis late hour in the debate, but let me make an observation about what \nthis debate is not about.\n  It is not about frivolous lawsuits. If this legislation dealt only \nwith frivolous lawsuits, we would be acting by voice vote, and this \nSenator's voice would be among the loudest of the chorus of votes in \nsupport. Indeed, the provisions in this legislation that deal with the \nfrivolous lawsuit issue are essentially provisions that this Senator \nhas previously offered in a piece of legislation, so I am fully \nsupportive of that.\n  What this legislation does, in my opinion, is systematically and \npervasively dismantles the system of investor protection against \nsecurities fraud and undermines the confidence in the world's safest \nsecurities market: the United States of America. It does so for several \nreasons. Everyone who is involved in the regulatory process, whether \nthe SEC, the States securities administrators and others, all \nacknowledge that the statute of limitations is too short--too short. \nThey have urged this Congress to change the current law from 1 year \nfrom point of discovery to a 3-year date of occurrence cutoff to 2 \nyears and 5 years. The reason for that is, the SEC says, because of the \ncomplexity of securities investigations. It requires more than 2 years \nwhen they do it with all of the resources of the Federal Government \navailable.\n  Aiders and abettors: Aiders and abettors are not, under the current \ninterpretation of the Supreme Court's ruling in private causes of \naction, are not subject to liability for reckless misconduct--not \nsubject to liability. We have urged our colleagues to make them subject \nto liability, and they have declined to do so. In point of fact, there \nis substantial question as to whether the SEC itself as the enforcer \nhas the power to recover against aiders and abettors.\n  So by failing to take that action, we immunize an entire class of \nwrongdoers. The accountants, the lawyers, the people who aided and \nabetted some of the great securities frauds in America would not be \nliable under the current state of the law.\n  Unlike the earlier Senate version of this bill, we do great damage to \nthe fairness of imposing upon attorneys, whether they be plaintiffs' \nlawyers or defense lawyers, the full sanction of rule 11. As this bill \nleft the Senate, the sanctions applied equally to plaintiffs' lawyers \nand to defense lawyers.\n  Let the planets, let the stars, let everything in God's universe fall \nupon those who continue to pursue frivolous lawsuits. I am with my \ncolleague from Utah on that. But in terms of revealing the bias that is \nreflected throughout this legislative process, those sanctions only \napply now to the plaintiffs' lawyers, and the defendants' lawyers who \nare guilty of frivolous actions have a much lesser sanction.\n\n  The issue is frequently framed, are you with Silicon Valley or are \nyou with the trial lawyers? That is a false premise. Let me just read \nsome of the opinions that have been expressed on this.\n  The Akron Beacon Journal, December 1, 1995:\n\n       The legislation would close virtually all avenues available \n     to investors who reasonably seek to recover money lost in \n     securities fraud cases. President Clinton can begin the \n     effort to improve this bill by using his veto.\n\n  The San Francisco Chronicle, November 27 of this year:\n\n       Despite the worthwhile aim, the provisions of a draft \n     conference report--\n\n  The one that we are dealing with.\n\n     go far beyond curbing trivial court action and instead would \n     wipe out important protections against hustlers of fraudulent \n     securities.\n\n  Mr. President, can I ask you to give me an indication when I have 4 \nminutes left of the time allocated to me?\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The Miami Herald, November 14 of this year:\n\n       A sinister piece of legislation. It essentially licenses \n     fraud. President Clinton should veto this blunder.\n\n  The Wisconsin State Journal:\n\n       The bill allows deceitful corporate executives, securities \n     brokers, accountants and lawyers out there to thumb their \n     nose at the justice system.\n\n  The Chattanooga Times, October 30, the home State of the \ndistinguished occupant of the chair:\n\n       The bill would immunize most stock and bond fraud from \n     civil liability. This fraudulent reform could not have come \n     at a worse time. Securities fraud enforcement actions have \n     increased 118 percent and criminal convictions for such fraud \n     leaped 176 percent.\n\n  The Daily Times Call:\n\n       Charles Keating could wish this were the law when he \n     squandered millions of dollars from the savings and loan \n     industry.\n\n  The St. Louis Post Dispatch:\n\n       Those protected by this legislation would not only be \n     companies free to make reckless predictions about their \n     future, the accountants who detect fraud and keep quiet about \n     it also would be helped.\n\n  I could read on and on and on.\n  I do want to say something about the editorial that appeared in Money \nmagazine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes left.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  It has been suggested that Money magazine editorials were issued \nprior to the conference report. It is true for the first time in their \nhistory, in September, October, and November of this year, they \neditorialized strongly against it. Mr. President, they reaffirmed their \nopposition in December of this year after the conference report, \nindicating that this legislation, in their view, would do great harm to \nprivate investors.\n  Let me also point out that among the groups that oppose this are the \nAssociations of Municipal Financial Officers, State Financial Officers, \nCounty Financial Officers, and others.\n\n  I want to read the excerpt of a letter that was sent to the Las Vegas \nSun by the treasurer of Clark County, NV, which includes Las Vegas.\n\n       As Clark County's treasurer, I am responsible for taxpayer \n     funds collected and invested on behalf of three-quarters of \n     Nevada's population.\n       I am writing because legislation passed by Congress could \n     effectively eliminate Clark County's ability to file private \n     securities fraud lawsuits--the primary method for governments \n     and individuals to recover losses from investment fraud.\n\n  He speaks for hundreds of county officials throughout America, \nirrespective of political party. That is why the National Association \nof Securities Administrators, and others, have strongly condemned this \nlegislation as going far, far too far.\n  Mr. President, let me say that in 1982, the Congress ill-advisedly, \nin my judgment, passed Garn-St. Germain that opened up a wave of fraud \nthat cost the American taxpayers, in terms of the savings and loan \nindustry, $450 billion when those costs are amortized.\n  What Garn-St. Germain did for the savings and loan industry in 1982, \nit is my view this legislation will do for the securities industry. \nThose who support this legislation, if enacted and signed by the \nPresident, will rue the day. We have not seen the last of fraud. \nIndeed, the evidence is to the contrary that fraud is growing.\n  This legislation goes far beyond what is needed to address the \nlegitimate issue of frivolous lawsuits, which I fully associate myself \nwith those efforts. This legislation effectively emasculates the right \nof private investors to bring causes of action against those who \nperpetrate fraud that results in losses throughout the country.\n  In the Keating Five, and I know that people do not like the reference \nto the Keating case, but it was a securities action filed under the \n1934 law. This is a classic case in which $171 million were recovered \nagainst aiders and abettors, those attorneys and brokers and advisers \nwho were responsible.\n  Because of our failure to correct the current interpretation of the \nCourt's opinion, we immunize and give those folks a clean bill of \nhealth, a pass to continue. For those who voted for the Senate version \nearlier, let me indicate that this piece of legislation emerging from \nthe conference is far worse. It \n\n[[Page S 17991]]\neliminates the provisions Senator Specter offered with respect to RICO. \nIt heavily imbalances the sanctions that are imposed against lawyers \nwho file frivolous lawsuits by making the burden whole and entire on \nplaintiffs but not so with defendants. It enhances the pleading \nrequirements, which makes it much more difficult to bring. It fails to \naddress the statute of limitations issue. It fails to correct the \ndeficiency in the law which allows aiders and abettors to go home free. \nIt reverses hundreds of years of judicial precedent in common law in \nlimiting the right of recovery balance between an innocent investor and \nthose whose conduct was reckless. It says under the proportionate \nliability that only the proportionate responsibility shall be made \npayable to that innocent investor, when the actual perpetrator is \njudgment proof or without money to respond.\n  Finally, let me say that the conference report even diminishes that \nability to recover even further. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am just informed that the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois wants to speak as in morning business for 2 minutes. I do not \nhave any objection.\n  I ask unanimous consent that she may speak for 2 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/05/senate-section/article/S17965-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CONGRATULATIONS TO THE NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FOOTBALL TEAM\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I wanted to take a moment to \ncongratulate Northwestern University's football team, the Wildcats, \nwho, in Senate resolution 197, offered by Senator Simon and me, are \nbeing honored and congratulated for one of the greatest underdog \nchampion stories in the history of sports. The Northwestern team is now \nbeing called ``the miracle on Central Street.'' What they have done \nhere is to celebrate the first conference championship in some 60 \nyears.\n  Coach Barnett has taken this team from really a very low profile in \nthe conference to being a top contender, now in the Rose Bowl. They are \ngoing to go to Pasadena. He fulfilled his pledge to take the Purple to \nPasadena. That rally and cry has taken this team to a 10-1 season, a \nNo. 3 national ranking, and a feat which has, frankly, not been \naccomplished by any one team in over 30 years.\n  Northwestern really proved that it is possible to produce a national \nfootball champion as well as Nobel Prize winner and Pulitzer Prize \nwinners and academicians throughout the world. They have captured, by \ntheir actions, the hearts of fans all over the country. They have made \nall of us from Illinois very proud of them. If nothing else, the \nfootball team, in their perseverance, hard work, and dedication, have \nproved once again in this Christmas season that miracles do happen.\n  I thank my colleagues for their time.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I join in congratulating Northwestern. I \nwas 11 the last time they went to Pasadena. So it is time for the \nPurple not only to go to Pasadena but to win in Pasadena.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/05/senate-section/article/S17991-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17991-S17997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose, in the strongest \nterms possible, H.R. 1058--inappropriately titled the ``Private \nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.'' This bill has nothing to do \nwith reform in the normal sense of the term. Rather, the bill is about \nprotection from liability for fraud--pure and simple. The bill is the \nworst kind of special interest legislation that the American public is \nsick and tired of.\n  It will give corporations a license to lie to investors and will \nseverely restrict the ability of defrauded investors to recover their \nhard-earned dollars from the unscrupulous and reckless individuals and \ncorporations who swindled them.\n  Six months ago, I stood on the Senate floor and urged my colleagues \nto oppose this bill in its earlier incarnation because--put simply--it \nwas a bad bill. Because it was a bad bill, every major consumer group, \nState attorneys general, State and county treasurers, mayors, finance \nofficers, labor unions, the American Association of Retired Persons, \nthe National League of Cities, educators, and hundreds of other \nnations, State, and local organizations, opposed the bill.\n  It is easy to understand why when you consider that a city like San \nFrancisco has over $8 billion in pension funds and other investments \nand when more than 60 State and local governments nationwide have lost \nmore than $3.6 billion in securities markets, partly due to derivative \ninvestments.\n  Despite the tremendous opposition to H.R. 1058, which was a bad bill \nin June, it is a worse bill now. Therefore, I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to oppose it.\n  What is most disturbing about this bill is the impact that it will \nhave on what are often the forgotten Americans--that is, average \nmiddle-class Americans.\n  At a time when job and wage insecurity are at all-time highs, and \nfamily budgets are straining at the seams, middle-class Americans have \nbegun investing their hard-earned dollars in stocks in record numbers. \nIn fact, as the Washington Post reported just a few days ago, \nsecurities have supplanted real estate as the No. 1 source of family \nnest eggs.\n  Middle-class Americans believe they must invest because there may not \nbe a decent pension when they retire--either they will be let go too \nsoon because of corporate down-sizing or their company, to which they \nhave been loyal, will not be there 20 or 30, or even 10 years from now.\n  Middle-class Americans also want to invest for the future because \nthey aren't sure that Social Security or Medicare will be there for \nthem in their later years when they are most vulnerable.\n  Last, middle-class Americans believe they must invest to ensure that \ntheir children are able to receive an education that provides them with \nthe essential skills to enable them to become productive and integral \nparticipants in what will be an extremely competitive and global work \nforce in the 21st century.\n  Because middle-class Americans recognize the need to secure and \nprotect their financial futures, they have entered to stock market \ndirectly--or through mutual funds--to such a degree that the most \nsignificant asset held by American families today is not their home, \nbut their 401(k) plan. Today, assets in 401(k) plans total more than \n$500 billion. Assets in investment retirement accounts total more than \n$1 trillion. The majority of these funds are in stocks.\n  Under these circumstances, this Nation's two primary securities \nlaws--the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities and Exchange Act of \n1934--have become even more, not less, important.\n  The principal philosophy governing these two laws--enacted more than \n60 years ago after the stock market crash of 1929, caused largely by a \ncrisis of confidence due to unregulated fraudulent stock promotion--is \nthat investors and prospective investors should have access to all \nmaterial information about corporations that offer securities so that \nthe public can make informed investment decisions and that honest \nmarkets should be maintained by strong antifraud enforcement.\n  At a time when middle-class Americans are investing in record numbers \nbecause they believe they must, the U.S. Congress should be \nstrengthening the most fundamental protections for investors in our \nsecurities laws, not gutting them. Yet, gutting these laws is exactly \nwhat this bill does.\n  This bill strikes a severe blow to the heart of the middle class. Let \nme tell you about just a few of the devastating provisions in this \nbill.\n  One of the most outrageous provisions in this bill is the safe harbor \nprovision. This provision, by providing broad immunity from liability \nfor fraudulent corporate predictions and projections, essentially gives \ncorporations a license to lie. This provision is much worse than the \nsafe harbor provision in the Senate bill.\n\n[[Page S 17992]]\n\n  The Senate bill language that made knowingly fraudulent defendants \nineligible for the safe harbor was eliminated. Now, under this bill, \ndeliberately fraudulent statements, written or oral, as long as they \nare accompanied by cautionary language, will be immunized from private \nliability. Let me repeat--this bill protects deliberately fraudulent \nstatements.\n  Let me give you a frightening but likely scenario that could occur \nunder the safe harbor provision in this bill: In an effort to entice \nunsuspecting consumers to purchase stock, company X makes a bunch of \noptimistic and fraudulent predictions about how great a new product \nwill perform and how the company's profits will increase because of the \nmanufacture of this new product. The company gets its lawyers and \naccountants to vouch for the representations.\n  Based on these rosy predictions, your uncle, your grandmother, your \nsister's teacher's union, your church, and the State of California \ndecide to purchase the stock. All of them wind up losing their money \nwhen the fraud is exposed. Your grandmother believes the company should \nnot be able to get away with lying to her. The company's lawyers argue, \nhowever, that even though there were fraudulent statements, there was a \nparagraph of cautionary language in some filing at the Securities and \nExchange Commission. Under this bill, grandma loses, all the swindled \ninvestors lose, and the fraudulent company and its lawyers and \naccountants win.\n  This is absolutely outrageous. And it's just one example of the many \nanti-investor provisions in this bill.\n  To add insult to injury, this bill also fails to restore traditional \naiding and abetting liability for securities fraud in private actions. \nThus, lawyers, accountants, and others who turn a blind eye to the \nfraudulent activity of their clients, or who recklessly aid and abet \ntheir clients, will be let off scott free.\n  The bill also dramatically erodes the doctrine of joint and several \nliability and moves to a system of proportionate liability. The bottom \nline for an investor is that under this bill, if a corporate defendant \nis found guilty of fraud and goes bankrupt, the victim will not be able \nto recover all of his losses. In essence, what this bill does is \ndetermine, as policy matter, that it is more important to protect \nadjudged wrongdoers from having to pay more than their strict \nproportion of the harm than it is to protect the innocent victims of \nfraud.\n  Another of the troubling provisions in this bill, is the one which \nadopts a higher pleading standard than was in the Senate bill--higher \nin fact than the standard adopted by the second circuit--which is \ncurrently the highest standard in the land.\n  As my colleague Senator Specter discussed earlier, it was Senator \nSpecter who offered an amendment that clarified that the heightened \npleading standard in the Senate bill could be satisfied by evidence of \na defendant's motive and opportunity to commit securities fraud. The \ncurrent version of this bill, however, eliminates the language in the \nSpecter amendment.\n  This bill is also worse than the Senate bill because it imposes a \nmandatory loser-pays fee shifting penalty under rule 11 of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure that is harsher on plaintiffs than on \ndefendants.\n  Under current law, rule 11 gives courts the discretion to impose \nsanctions for pleadings and motions that are unwarranted, without \nevidentiary support, or otherwise abusive.\n  The Senate bill required courts to determine whether any party \nviolated rule 11 and to presume that the appropriate penalty for \nviolating rule 11 is fee shifting. Under the Senate bill, the party who \nviolated rule 11 would have to pay the opposing party's legal fees \nincurred as a direct result of the violation.\n  The bill on the floor today is worse than the Senate bill because it \nunfairly increased the penalty imposed against plaintiffs who are found \nto have violated rule 11 while not doing so for defendants who are \nfound to have violated rule 11. The presumptive penalty for plaintiffs \nis have to pay all of the defendant's legal fees and costs incurred in \nthe entire action.\n  Proponents of this bill claim that the bill is balanced and fair. Is \nthis provision balanced or fair? Not by any stretch of the imagination.\n  This bill, unlike the Senate bill, also adopts a provision, modeled \non the House bill, that may require plaintiffs to post a bond to cover \na possible fee-shifting penalty. Moreover, there is no limitation on \nthe amount of the bond. This could be a major obstacle for individual \nvictims or their attorneys in bringing a meritorious action against a \nlarge corporation defendant. The bill also fails to restore an adequate \nstatute of limitations for private securities fraud actions, and gives \nthe greatest control in cases to the wealthiest plaintiffs.\n  Lastly, as someone who has long sought to do what he could to combat \ncrimes of all kind, I also find it incredible that language in the \nSenate bill concerning the application of our RICO laws in securities \nfraud cases has been almost eliminated entirely.\n  Under an amendment I offered, the Senate bill allowed the RICO \nstatute to be used in a securities fraud civil case if at least one \nperson in the civil case has been criminally convicted. Under this \nbill, RICO could only be used in the civil case against the person who \nwas actually criminally convicted.\n  The safe harbor, proportionate liability, pleading, aiding and \nabetting, fee-shifting, and RICO provisions, are bad enough alone, but \ntogether, they will actually encourage the kind of conduct our \nsecurities laws were designed to eliminate.\n  I am sure that there is not one Member in this body who does not want \nto bring an end to all frivolous lawsuits, not just shareholder \nlawsuits. Yet, the legislation before us today is not the answer--it is \nfar from it.\n  Indeed, the managing editor of Money magazine, the largest financial \npublication in the United States, with over 10 million, largely middle-\nclass readers, said it well when he stated, and I quote:\n\n       At a time when massive securities fraud has become one of \n     this country's growth industries, this law would cheat \n     victims out of whatever chance they may have of getting their \n     money back . . . in the final analysis, this legislation . . \n     . would actually be a grand slam for the sleaziest element of \n     the financial industry, at the expense of ordinary citizens.\n\n  The president of the Fraternal Order of Police said it best, however, \nwhen, in his letter to the President urging him to veto the bill, he \nstated:\n\n       Mr. President, our 270,000 members stand with you in your \n     commitment to a war on crime; the men and women of the \n     Fraternal Order of Police are the foot soldiers in the war. \n     On their behalf, I urge you to reject a bill which would make \n     it less risky for white collar criminals to steal from police \n     pension funds while the police are risking their lives \n     against violent criminals!\n\n  I urge my colleagues to heed these words.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfor his statement and for his insight.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I am well aware of the hazards of abusive \nclass action lawsuits and unethical attorney conduct.\n  Just before Thanksgiving there was an article on the front page of \nthe New York Times about a constituent of mine who received a benefit \nof $2.91 from a class action suit concerning overcharges in mortgage \nescrow accounts, but had $91.00 removed from his account to pay the \nattorney's fees of class counsel. I will soon be introducing \nlegislation to protect consumers from these types of abuses.\n  There are undoubtedly abusive securities class actions as well. But \nthe key to reforming this area of the law, like all litigation reform, \nis to devise remedies that will weed out the frivolous lawsuits while \nallowing the meritorious ones to go forward.\n  The conference report under consideration contains a number of \nnecessary and well-crafted reforms. It requires that class members \nreceive intelligible notices explaining the terms of class action \nsettlements, prohibits secret settlement agreements, and promotes \nenforcement of rules sanctioning attorneys for unethical behavior.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report also contains provisions that \nwill prevent potentially meritorious cases from being pursued. In some \ninstances, those who knowingly and intentionally mislead investors will \nbe fully immunized from liability. Consequently, I will vote against \nthis conference bill as I did when it was first considered by the \nSenate.\n  I am especially concerned about the consequences that the bill will \nhave on \n\n[[Page S 17993]]\nthe elderly. The Special Committee on Aging, which I chair, has held a \nseries of hearings on fraud against small, unsophisticated investors.\n  The committee's investigation revealed that in an era of low interest \nrates, when retirees are seeking out higher yield investments, the \nelderly are particularly vulnerable to securities scams. Fraud against \nthe elderly is particularly odious because their savings cannot be \nreplaced by new earnings--losses resulting from fraud can affect \nmiddle-income seniors' standard of living for the rest of their lives.\n  The safe-harbor contained in the conference report shields issuers of \nsecurities, or those working on their behalf, from lawsuits based on \npredictive statements they make about the future performance of a \nstock. The immunity is absolute, so long as the predictions are \naccompanied with cautionary statements indicating that actual results \nmay differ from those predicted.\n  The effect of this safe harbor is that corporate officials are immune \nfrom suit even if they make factual statements that they know to be \nfalse and that are intended to mislead investors. At least under the \nSenate bill, knowing and intentionally misleading statements would have \nbeen actionable. I am disappointed that the conference committee chose \nto broaden, rather than narrow, this provision.\n  I am also concerned about the cumulative effect of some of the \nprocedural changes made to the bill.\n  The bill requires that before initiating a suit a plaintiff must be \nable to allege specific facts giving rise to a strong inference of the \ndefendants' state of mind. A Senate amendment clarifying how plaintiffs \ncould meet this burden was dropped by the conference. In addition, the \nbill prohibits plaintiffs from taking any discovery before it must \ndefend a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.\n  Together, the pleading standard and the bar on discovery will make it \nextraordinarily difficult to maintain a lawsuit because it is virtually \nimpossible to prove the state of mind of a party until you have an \nopportunity to conduct interviews and examine documents.\n  These and other provisions will not only deter frivolous lawsuits, \nbut will create roadblocks and obstacles to suits that seek recoveries \nfor genuine victims of fraud. For decades these private class action \nlawsuits have provided a necessary supplement to the enforcement \nefforts of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  Enforcement of the securities laws and the confidence in our markets \nthat these laws have engendered have contributed to making our stock \nmarkets the most robust in the world. The benefits this legislation is \nintended to achieve--the deterrence of abusive litigation--does not \njustify the potential costs of weakening an enforcement scheme that has \neffectively protected our markets for many years.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report.\n  I am proud to say that I served on the conference committee which \nproduced this report. As a freshman Senator, I was particularly honored \nto play a role in crafting legislation which will benefit so many \nAmericans who find themselves victimized by the social costs of \nfrivolous litigation.\n  The legislation before us today, H.R. 1058, is entitled the ``Private \nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.'' In my opinion, a better \ntitle would have been the ``Investors, Workers and Consumers Legal \nProtection Act.'' After all, this legislation is designed to protect \nthose very people--investors, workers and consumers--from the high cost \nof meritless and abusive litigation.\n  Today, we have an opportunity to make some modest and reasonable \nchanges which will help weed out the most abusive lawsuits in the field \nof securities litigation while at the same time, preserving the right \nof action for shareholders who are truly victimized by securities \nfraud.\n  I am particularly pleased with a number of the provisions in this \nbill, including:\n  Mandatory sanctions against attorneys who file abusive lawsuits;\n  Codification of the pleading standard adopted by the second circuit \ncourt of appeals;\n  Elimination of bounty payments to named plaintiff, plaintiff referral \nfees, and undeserved windfall damages;\n  A safe harbor for forward-looking statements to encourage companies \nto voluntarily disclose information to help investors make better \ndecisions; and\n  A reduction in the level of liability for secondary defendants who do \nnot knowingly engage in securities fraud.\n  In addition, I am pleased that this legislation does not extend the \ncurrent statute of limitations established by the U.S. Supreme Court in \nthe 1991 Lampf decision. That's one year from the date the plaintiff \nknew of the alleged violation and 3 years from the date the alleged \nviolation occurred.\n  While some critics of this legislation have seized upon the statute \nof limitations as a wedge to defeat this important bill, they have \nfailed to present a convincing case for why this period should be \nextended.\n  They have tried to suggest that the current statute of limitations \nhas curbed the number of meritorious cases filed in the courts, but the \nevidence proves otherwise.\n  According to the administrative office of the U.S. courts, during the \n4 years prior to the Lampf decision, the average number of cases filed \nwas 162 per year. In the 4-year period since Lampf, the average number \nof cases filed has risen to 278 per year, an increase of nearly 72 \npercent.\n  Contrary to the claims of the bill's opponents, securities litigation \nhas increased under Lampf, not decreased. This should not be \nsurprising, given the fact that many of these claims can now be filed \nwithin days, even hours, after a movement in the market.\n  There are a number of other reasons why the current statute of \nlimitations should be preserved.\n  A longer period would simply allow speculators too much time to wait \nand see how their decisions to buy or sell securities turned out, \npermitting them to abuse our legal system to cover their losses in the \nmarket.\n  In addition, a longer period of limitations would make it more \ndifficult for innocent defendants to protect themselves in court. \nForcing companies to keep track of every rise and fall of their stock \nvalue for 5 years and allowing strike suit attorneys to attack job \ncreators well after the memory of a reasonable person would have faded \nwould only lead to more frivolous litigation, more exorbitant \nsettlements, and more pain for investors, workers and consumers.\n  Under current law, plaintiffs with meritorious claims have more than \nenough time to file their suits; unfortunately, so too do strike suit \nattorneys. Even with the enactment of this bill, some meritless claims \nwill survive. If our intent is to reverse the current litigation \nexplosion, why would we want to invite more frivolous lawsuits by \nextending the statute of limitations?\n  In June, when this legislation was debated on the Senate floor, 52 of \nour colleagues wisely decided to retain the current statute of \nlimitations. That was the right decision in June and it is the right \ndecision today, and I am pleased that this conference report preserves \ncurrent law.\n  Finally, I'd like to say something about how this legislation will \nbenefit everyday Americans. Securities litigation reform is not a \nsubject discussed every morning around the kitchen table, but its \nresults will have a major and beneficial impact on most Americans.\n  It will protect the worker who worries about being laid off because \nhis employer had to pay attorneys' fees instead of his salary.\n  It will help the consumer who has to pay higher prices for products \ntoday because of the hidden cost of frivolous litigation.\n  It will pay off for the legitimate investors and pensioners whose \nlife savings are being jeopardized by strike suit attorneys.\n  And finally, it will benefit the thousands of honest, hard-working \nattorneys who have watched the public image of their profession being \ntarnished by a few greedy quick change artists.\n  It is for the sake of these Americans that we have put in long hours \nof hard work to craft this balanced and reasonable bill.\n  None of us are totally satisfied with this legislation. There are \nsome supporters who feel that certain provisions in the conference \nreport go too far. \n\n[[Page S 17994]]\n There are others like me who would like to see this legislation go \nfurther. But I think we can all agree that this conference report does \nwhat it's supposed to do: protect legitimate investors, save jobs, and \npreserve the right of actions for true victims of securities fraud.\n  When I think of this bill, I am reminded of a quote by one of the \nstrike suit attorneys who testified on this subject before the Senate \nBanking Committee. In a moment of honesty, this prominent and wealthy \nsecurities action lawsuit attorney said: ``I have the best practice of \nlaw in the world. I have no clients.''\n  In my opinion, these words best illustrate the problem that this \nlegislation is designed to address.\n  I commend the managers of the conference, Senator D'Amato and \nCongressman Bliley, for crafting this report, as well as our \ncolleagues, Senators Domenici and Dodd for pushing this issue for so \nmany years.\n  As a conferee, I am proud to have played a role in this legislation \nand urge my colleagues to adopt the conference report.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to use \na portion of the time of the senior Senator from Minnesota as he will \nnot be on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, if I may, there has been some discussion as \nto the position of the Securities and Exchange Commission on this piece \nof legislation. I have in my possession a letter dated November 22, \nsigned by Arthur Levitt, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, who has written to the Los Angeles Times, the editor, Mr. \nCoffey. I am just going to read a portion of his statement: ``I am \nconcerned and disappointed with several major points in today's Los \nAngeles Times article entitled `SEC Chief Shift on Investor Bill is \nLinked to Senate Pressure.' '' The Chairman goes on to say, ``The \narticle is wrong in reporting that I now support the litigation reform \nbill.''\n  I think that needs to be said. The Chairman of the SEC has not and \ndoes not support the legislation in the current form.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               U.S. Securities and\n\n\n                                          Exchange Commission,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 22, 1995.\n     Shelby Coffey III,\n     Editor, Los Angeles Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles, \n         CA.\n       Dear Mr. Coffey: I am concerned and disappointed with \n     several major points in today's Los Angeles Times article \n     entitled ``SEC Chief Shift on Investor Bill Is Linked to \n     Senate Pressure.''\n       The article is wrong in reporting that I now support the \n     litigation reform bill.\n       The article is wrong in reporting that I've reversed my \n     position.\n       The article is wrong in reporting that my position was \n     influenced by political pressure.\n       In the sub-heading and again in the lead sentence of the \n     article, I am represented to ``back'' and ``support'' the \n     proposed legislation. This is simply not the case. This point \n     was repeatedly stressed to the reporter.\n       Secondly, the position outlined in the SEC's letter in no \n     way can be construed as a reversal of the SEC's position. The \n     article fails to describe the significant changes that were \n     made in the most recent draft of the legislation that \n     precipitated our letter. To do so would have made it clear \n     that our letter did not represent any ``reversal.''\n       Finally, my staff repeatedly and unequivocally expressed to \n     Mr. Paltrow that it was simply not true to say that the SEC \n     responded to political pressure in issuing our letter. The \n     letter represents the Commission's position arrived at \n     thoughtfully, independently and deliberately. To suggest \n     anything less is an insult. To build an entire story about \n     political influence around one quote from one Senate staff \n     member opining about the motivations of the SEC is, at best, \n     unfair; especially when you consider that the two SEC \n     Commissioners who signed the letter--the only people in any \n     position to accurately describe the circumstances surrounding \n     it--unambiguously denied that they did so in response to \n     political pressures.\n       I hope you will correct these misstatements.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Arthur Levitt, Chairman.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I realize it is very easy to demonize \nlawyers. Some of my colleague who have taken the opportunity this \nafternoon and this morning to do so would not be the first to do that. \nDating back to the time of Shakespeare, ``The first thing we ought to \ndo,'' Shakespeare said, ``is kill all the lawyers.''\n  I believe this is not a warm, cuddly group that is easy to love. \nHaving once practiced law, I share some of that antipathy to lawyers, \nwhen lawyers get out of line, as they from time to time do.\n  As I indicated, I fully support the provisions that deal with the \nfrivolous lawsuits, and my colleague from Minnesota itemized a number \nof those.\n  Let me try to turn this to a broader perspective: Over 150 editorials \nand columns that have appeared in newspapers across the United States, \nin every region, newspapers whose philosophies are conservative, \nliberal, middle of the road. Overwhelmingly, the informed judgment and \nopinion by these editorial writers is in strong opposition to the \nbill--not because they do not recognize, as I, and I think all of my \ncolleagues do, that we need to make some changes with respect to the \nfrivolous lawsuits, but because this bill goes far beyond that.\n  It is really a Trojan horse in which those who seek to minimize or \nimmunize themselves from liability have entered into the courtyard \nunder this frivolous lawsuit flag, when in point of fact they are \ntrying to protect themselves from liability after their misconduct has \nbeen adjudicated.\n  Among those organizations that have expressed their opposition are \nthe National League of Cities, the National Association of Counties, \nthe Government Finance Officers Association, the U.S. Conference of \nMayors, the Municipal Treasurers Association. I do not know what the \npolitical affiliation is of all of these people, but I daresay if you \nexamine it you would find Republicans and Democrats alike that hold \nthese offices, all essentially reaching the same conclusion, that they \nand their constituent interests, namely, the people who live in these \nvarious communities, are at risk in terms of being protected in the \nevent that investor fraud causes them to lose money in any of the \nportfolios they hold in behalf of the public, as members of counties or \ncities, municipal officers, and others.\n\n  I suspect that this group is about as neutral and objective as any \nthat you might find. I think it is instructive that virtually all have \nexpressed their strong opposition. They are extremely concerned that \nthey might be the next Orange County. It could happen in their State, \nin their county, in their city to their university investment \nportfolio, and they know that they would be irreparably damaged if we \ndo not take corrective action to balance this piece of legislation.\n  In recent weeks, well over 1,000 State and local officials and \nopinion leaders have written the Congress and the President to express \ntheir strong opposition. Among those letters, Mr. President, is a \nletter signed by 99 California government officials, including the \nMayors of San Francisco and San Jose and officials in 43 of the State's \n58 counties; a letter signed by 34 county treasurers in Arkansas; a \nletter signed by 24 opinion leaders in Iowa, including the State's \nAttorney General Tom Miller; a letter signed by 51 public officials in \nGeorgia; a letter signed by 51 Maine opinion leaders, including State \nTreasurer Sam Shapiro and 9 State legislators; a letter signed by 60 \npublic officials in Massachusetts, including the Massachusetts \nAssociation of County Commissioners; a letter signed by 33 opinion \nleaders in Montana, including Attorney General Joseph Mazurek and State \nAuditor Mark O'Keefe; a letter signed by 39 officials in New Jersey, \nincluding the New Jersey Conference of Mayors and the New Jersey League \nof Municipalities; a letter signed by 27 Ohio public officials, \nincluding the mayor of Cincinnati and the Ohio County Treasurers \nAssociation; a letter signed by 27 Vermont opinion leaders.\n\n  My point is that this spans the continent, from east to west, from \nnorth to south. Whether one is liberal, conservative, or middle of the \nroad, virtually all have concluded that this legislation overreaches \nand clearly places those persons in their communities and their States \nat risk as a consequence of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I reserve whatever time I have remaining and note the \npresence on the floor of my distinguished friend and colleague, the \nSenator from Alabama, Senator Shelby.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has 7 minutes.\n\n[[Page S 17995]]\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am disappointed to say that the \nconference report before us today is not a balanced bill. It was not a \nbalanced bill when it left the Senate several months ago, and it has \nnot improved by any measure in conference.\n  Plain and simple, Mr. President, it remains unbalanced against the \ndefrauded investor.\n  I am disappointed, as I was when the Senate passed S. 240, because I \nbelieve that there are some worthy provisions in this bill that would \ngo far in reducing frivolous suits without compromising the rights of \nvictims of fraud.\n  These few, worthy provisions, however, are insufficient to overcome \nthe unbalanced nature of this bill.\n  While I support efforts to reduce frivolous litigation, I simply \ncannot support the approach taken here today.\n  This past year I have actively sought alternatives that would seek a \nmiddle ground between weeding out meritless litigation and preserving \nlegitimate claims.\n  I have actively sought alternatives that would seek a middle ground \nbetween eliminating economic incentives to pursue frivolous litigation \nand protecting the rights of the defrauded investor.\n  And, I have actively sought alternatives that would seek a middle \nground between opportunistic strike suits and preserving the powerful \ncheck of private litigation on professional misconduct.\n  Earlier this year, I joined Senator Bryan in introducing a securities \nlitigation reform bill that, I believe, struck the proper balance \nbetween protecting investors and reducing meritless litigation.\n  Our bill contained some of the same worthy provisions also \nincorporated in this conference report, like the ban on referral fees \nand the payment of attorney fees from the SEC disgorgement fund, \nincreasing fraud detection and enforcement and ensuring \nadequate disclosure of settlement terms.\n\n  In addition, however, our bill sought balance by including several \nprovisions to protect the rights of the defrauded investor.\n  It restored aiding and abetting liability; extended the statute of \nlimitations for private fraud actions to the earlier of 5 years after \nthe violation or 2 years after discovery, and ensured that the victim \nof fraud was made whole in the case of an insolvent joint and several \ndefendant.\n  When S. 240 came before the Senate I, again, sought to improve the \nbalance of the bill by offering an amendment on proportionate \nliability.\n  My amendment would have ensured that the insolvency of the defendant \ndoes not prevent the innocent victim from obtaining a full recovery by \nmaking proportionate defendants liable for the remaining uncollectible \namount of an insolvent joint and several defendant.\n  Again, this provision would have weighted in favor of the victim of \nthe fraud over the perpetrator of the fraud--a balance which is still \nmissing from the conference report before us today.\n  Mr. President, these provisions are crucial, in my view, to ensuring \nthat rights of defrauded investors are not unfairly impaired in an \neffort to reduce litigation--meritorious or meritless.\n  Mr. President, the conference report fails to do what S. 240 failed \nto do--and I, therefore, cannot support it.\n  The conference report, put simply, fails to ensure adequate \nprotection of the rights of the innocent victim of securities fraud, \nand, in fact, makes it harder for the small investor to gain access to \nthe courts and obtain a full recovery for securities fraud.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, let me express my appreciation to the \nSenator from Alabama for his comments and for his balance. I believe he \nwould agree with me that there are abuses that need to be corrected. \nNone of us who oppose this legislation are arguing the status quo is \nwhat we favor. Indeed, he is a cosponsor with me of the legislation \nthat would have dealt with a number of those things. The Senator will \nrecall that incorporated in that we had provisions to eliminate bonus \npayments being paid to brokers. That is dead wrong. He and I agree on \nthat.\n  The Senator would agree with me, I am sure, that payments that would \nbe made as bonus payments to certain plaintiffs are wrong as well. The \nreferral fees--we clearly agree that before a settlement should be \neffected, the lawyers on behalf of the plaintiffs need to make a full \ndisclosure as to what the terms of the settlement are to be. And we \nfully agreed that, if there are frivolous lawsuits, the courts need to \nbe very aggressive in imposing sanctions.\n  I note my friend wants to respond. I will not purport to speak for \nhim.\n  Mr. SHELBY. If the Senator from Nevada will yield just for a few \nbrief comments?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I believe in any piece of legislation we need balance. We \nneed balance for the people who are the issuers of stock in the public \ndomain. But, on the other hand, we need some safeguards for the \ninvestor. If you do not have balance in a situation, you are going to \nhave trouble later.\n  I believe this bill is not a panacea. This bill is fraught with \ndanger. I think it is a bad bill the way it is constructed today, but \nit could have been a good bill if we had stayed with the basics and if \nwe were able to work out a bipartisan approach to a very serious thing, \nand that is excessive litigation.\n  No one, I believe, in his right mind could do anything but agree that \na lot of litigation is out of control in America. But how do you \nbalance that? I believe we have that responsibility and obligation, to \nmake sure it is balanced, especially when you are dealing with people \nwho probably are not going to be as sophisticated about the marketplace \nas people who come to the marketplace, but will invest their life \nsavings and will invest everything they have. And what remedy will they \nhave in the future as victims? I think this is what some of this is \nabout.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I note the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico is on the floor, and he previously had some time. I would be \nwilling to offer him some time and ask unanimous consent that we split \nthe remainder of the time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time does the Senator have?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I think we have about 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not need that time. I will take 2 of the 5. It is \nvery generous of the Senator to split it with me.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Three.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not really need that much, but I will accept it.\n  Mr. President, I would have stopped the distinguished Senator from \nNevada had I had a chance and asked a question. I did not do that \nbecause I just did not get in the right position with reference to his \nspeech.\n  He mentioned a lot of organizations, institutions, and editorial \nwriters who are opposed to this bill. I guess if I had a chance to ask \nthose associations, institutions, and editorial writers a question, I \nwould just ask one. Let us assume in addressing them that I am saying, \n``Mr. Jones,''--that addresses all of them--``did you know that the \ninvestors' share of what is collected in a lawsuit of the type we are \nconcerned about, out of every dollar collected, that 14 cents goes to \nthe investor?'' That is that poor stockholder that everybody is talking \nabout being sorry for. Fourteen cents goes to that person, and the \nbalance, if my arithmetic is correct, 86 cents goes to the lawyers, \ncourt costs, deposition costs, and the other things.\n  That is why the program needs to be fixed. There is no doubt about \nit. This part of the American judicial system and litigation system is \nnot working. It is not worth the consequences to the enterprises being \naffected that normal litigation brings to the marketplace of American \ncapitalism. It is sort of part of the system that has gone eccentric, \nthat lawyers have found a bird's nest on the ground, and this is the \nresult--settlements all over the place, deep pocket lawsuits, and even \nwith all of that available to the lawyers of this country, 14 cents \ngoes to that little investor whom everybody is trying to protect.\n  I would like to close by saying I am very pleased that the oldest and \nlargest investment group around that takes care of small stockholders, \nthe National Association of Investors Corp., which has a letter to the \nPresident saying protect their stockholders, endorses this.\n  There is a long list here of investors who say to the President, ``We \nwant \n\n[[Page S 17996]]\nyour support.'' There is a huge list from the American Business \nConference to the public trading companies, maybe 30 of them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all of these be printed in the Record in \nsupport of the cause that this bill contains.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                        Investors Corporation,\n\n                                  Royal Oak, MI, October 25, 1995.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Mr. President: I am writing as chairman of America's oldest \n     and largest organization of small investors--the lifeblood of \n     our nation's capital markets. NAIC is a prime mover behind \n     the popular trend of investment clubs, where investors share \n     information and expertise while reducing risks. The number of \n     investment clubs affiliated with NAIC has grown to 17,000, \n     representing more than 325,000 individual investors.\n       Mr. President, America's small investors urgently want \n     reform of our broken system of securities litigation.\n       We pride ourselves in making our own investment decisions, \n     based on information in the marketplace. But because of the \n     current legal system, we have been getting less and less \n     access to voluntary information from publicly traded \n     companies. Companies balk at disclosing useful information \n     for fear of frivolous class-action securities lawsuits. To \n     make matters worse, meritless securities lawsuits unjustly \n     take money from the pockets of small investors by driving \n     down the value of growth companies in which we invest. In the \n     past four years alone, class-action securities suits have \n     milked more than $2.5 billion from American companies. \n     Plaintiff's lawyers have pocketed approximately one-third--\n     $825 million--of these funds that otherwise could have gone \n     to more productive use.\n       We want to be able to recover our investments in cases \n     where we have been defrauded. Just as important, we want \n     protection from unscrupulous ``strike suit'' attorneys who \n     file baseless suits that coerce companies into spending our \n     investment capital on settlement and defense costs.\n       That is why NAIC members support securities litigation \n     reform legislation that cracks down on frivolous securities \n     lawsuits while strengthening effective protection against \n     real fraud. The bill's strong new fraud prevention provision \n     would require public auditors to identify and report illegal \n     activities as soon as discovered. This reform bill stops the \n     abusive practice of using ``professional plaintiffs'' who buy \n     small amounts of stock in many companies simply to gain the \n     right to sue. It gives real investors more power to direct \n     securities lawsuits.\n       Mr. President, on behalf of small investors across the \n     nation, I urge you to work with Congress to enact securities \n     litigation reform into law this year.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Thomas E. O'Hara.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Investors and Those Who Protect Investors Have Spoken Out in Favor of \n                      Securities Litigation Reform\n\n       National Association of Investors Corporation, the largest \n     individual shareowners organization in the United States.\n       Managers of public and private pension funds, including: \n     New York City Pension Funds, Connecticut Retirement and Trust \n     Funds, Oregon Public Employees' Retirement System, State \n     Universities Retirement System of Illinois, Teachers \n     Retirement System of Texas, State of Wisconsin Investment \n     Board, Washington State Investment Board, Eastman Kodak \n     Retirement Plan.\n       State treasurers and state officials responsible for state \n     securities laws and pension funds, including: Treasurer, \n     Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Treasurer, State of Ohio, \n     Treasurer, State of Illinois, Commissioner of Corporations, \n     California, Treasurer, State of North Carolina, Treasurer, \n     State of South Carolina, Treasurer, State of Delaware, \n     Treasurer, State of Colorado.\n       Senior citizen investors spoke out in a recent poll in \n     favor of legal reforms to curb lawsuit abuse.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               Supporters of Securities Litigation Reform\n\n       American Business Conference.--Members of the American \n     Business Conference include 100 chief executive officers of \n     high-growth companies with revenues over $25 million.

I yield the floor.\n  I thank my friend for the time.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, let me compliment my friend from New \nMexico. I know he is sincere. He has been laboring in the vineyards for \na good many years on this legislation. Let me say by way of rebuttal \nthat, if this legislation was about how we could increase that 14 cents \nthat the investors currently receive according to the information \nprovided, I would like to work with him. In point of fact, the concern \nis that this legislation will, in many cases, reduce the recovery to \nzero and in no instance is there a provision in this bill that would \nenhance the recovery beyond the 14 cents even if recovery is possible.\n  Finally, let me say by way of winding it up, our friend, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Select Committee on Aging, has certainly \nprovided a number of insights in terms of who really gets hurt in this \nlegislation. He points out cogently and definitively that the seniors \nin America are going to be among its principal victims.\n  Mr. President, I note that our time is up. If there is any remainder \nof time, I yield it.\n  Have the yeas and nays been asked for?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). They have not.\n  Mr. BRYAN.

I know there are some people here who wish to speak, and \nthey are here because it is their understanding that we were moving to \nit immediately. Is there any reason in delaying going to this bill?\n  Mr. SMITH. Only that Senator Thomas asked me for time to give a \ntribute to Senator Simpson. That is the only reason.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized to speak as in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/05/senate-section/article/S17997-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17997-S17998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ALAN SIMPSON\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to come to \nthe floor to talk about a friend, to talk about a man whom I respect as \na friend, whom I respect as a public servant, a man--to quote a phrase \nhe uses--``who is a friend to his friends,'' Alan Simpson.\n  As you all know, Al Simpson indicated in Cody, WY, last Saturday that \nhe would not seek another term in the U.S. Senate and would end his \ncareer at 18 years. Alan Simpson is a special guy, a unique U.S. \nSenator. There are none other like him. He can be outspoken, very \ncandid, very frank, and very kind.\n  This Cody boy is an outstanding Senator and my lifelong friend, a \ngood and gracious man. I know that so many of you have known him well \nand also call him a friend. We are lucky in that way. Both he and Ann \nhave given grace and style in their personal relationships as well as \nin their political life. All of us in Wyoming have been very proud of \nhis representation in the Senate and his and Ann's representation as \nWyomingites in the Nation's Capital.\n\n  I have had the privilege to serve as a part of a team with Al on the \nWyoming delegation for 5 years, when I was in the House and he and \nMalcolm Wallop were here. This one very special year, Alan Simpson and \nI have had the opportunity to serve together. There will be more \naccolades, tributes, and reactions, of course, to their decision. Many \nare surprised, certainly, and many are saddened by Al Simpson's \ndecision not to run. I defend it because I know it was truly their \ndecision and they are at peace with it and look forward to life beyond \nthese Chambers, as we all know there is. I am sure that life will be \ncentered in Cody, WY.\n  I know that Al could have done anything he chose to. People in \nWyoming \n\n[[Page S 17998]]\nadore him, respect him, and he could have won the race easily. I have a \nselfish reaction to this. I wanted him to run again. We in Wyoming have \na unique relationship in this delegation--all Republicans, and we are \nall friends. I think it is especially unique that Al and I grew up in \nthe same little town, Cody, WY--which was about 6,000--across the alley \nfrom one another. We played sports together, grew up together. I can \ntell a few scandalous stories, but Al has told most of them already.\n  Few men in Washington have the gift of skill and the gift of humor \nthat Al Simpson has. He has always been that way. I can recall when I \nwas just a kid, Milward Simpson was probably the most famous man in our \nlittle town. I can remember being so astonished that he could stand up \nand extemporaneously speak, and it would just flow.\n  So now we are here serving the Wyoming people in the Senate, and here \nAlan Simpson is my political mentor, our senior Senator and, very \nselfishly, I wanted him to run again, to continue his excellent \nrepresentation and clear leadership. Many of you will have your own \ntestimony to Al Simpson during the coming year. But I can tell you from \none who has known the Simpson family, I know Milward and Lorna Simpson \nwould have been very proud of Al, both in the way he has served and \nwill serve throughout 1996, but also as proud as only a father and a \nmother can be in the way he has come to and announced his decision. He \nannounced it with courage, with class, and with a positive view for the \nfuture--the qualities that define Al and Ann Simpson.\n  He has 1 more year to go. No one should make a mistake or forget \nabout that. He will do many things in that year. He will achieve much. \nSo I will, at the end of that year, miss my good friend and mentor. All \nof us, I think, will miss his good western advice, little bits of \nwestern wisdom, such as ``don't squat with your spurs on'' and other \nlittle bits like that.\n  So I say to my friend, hats off to a true trail boss, good luck, and \nI hope you do as well as you have done in the past, my friend, Al \nSimpson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/05/senate-section/article/S17997-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO ALAN SIMPSON AND MARK HATFIELD\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I would like to remark at what a \ndiminished place this will be because of the loss of Senator Simpson \nand Senator Hatfield, both of whom announced over the weekend that they \nwould be leaving. There are no Senators in this body, any that I know \nof, who have served here who have been more distinguished than the \nSenator from Wyoming and the Senator from Oregon. I might say that \nthere are none for whom I have higher personal esteem and affection \nthan both of these Senators.\n  It was truly a historic weekend for both of them to announce that \nthey were leaving the Senate. I must say, had I not myself announced \nthat I was leaving, I would be much sadder than I am. Since I will be \nleaving, I will not miss them here. I despair, though, because of the \nvacuum that will be left in this Nation when these two very great \npublic servants will be leaving the Senate.\n  I did not come for that specific purpose, Mr. President. I will later \ntalk about my two friends. But I could not miss the opportunity when \nthe junior Senator from Wyoming brought up the subject to say how much \nI share his sentiments and how great I think the loss is for the \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/05/senate-section/article/S17998-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17998-S18002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE FARM PROVISIONS OF THE RECONCILIATION BILL\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, we knew that when the farm provisions of \nthe reconciliation bill were agreed to, they were bad for the State of \nLouisiana, but we had no idea how bad these provisions were for the \nState of Louisiana when they were passed.\n  The reason is, Mr. President, we had no opportunity to be involved in \nthis, no input into the provisions of it, no ability to evaluate it, no \nability to discuss it. It was in conference committee and the \nreconciliation bill. The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee \nmet with the Speaker of the House and, boom, ipso facto, it was created \nout of the ashes in whole part without any input from anybody.\n  Mr. President, now we have evaluated this bill. I can tell my \ncolleagues that the agricultural provisions of the reconciliation bill \nwill simply destroy the cotton industry and the rice industry in the \nState of Louisiana.\n  Let me repeat that: The agricultural provisions of the reconciliation \nbill will destroy the rice industry and the cotton industry in the \nState of Louisiana.\n  Mr. President, these are two of our largest crops. They contribute \nover $2 billion to the State of Louisiana, 7,000 direct jobs and 27,000 \nindirect agriculture jobs, according to Louisiana State University and \nthe Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service.\n  Mr. President, they have done an analysis of what the bill does for \nrice and cotton. They have taken a typical Louisiana rice tenant farm, \nwhich is 287 planted acres--and this takes up about 90 percent of our \ntenant farms in the State of Louisiana--and they have a whole series of \ncalculations as to what the economic effect on that rice farmer will \nbe.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the calculations which \nthey have done in great detail both as to the comparison of net returns \nfor cotton, net returns for rice under the conference committee, and \nrice gross returns under alternative farm program, that these figures \nbe printed in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         COMPARISON OF NET RETURNS FOR COTTON UNDER CONFERENCE COMMITTEE FARM PROPOSAL

Mr. President, when you boil the figures down, what it \nshows is that the average rice farmer in 1996 has a net income of minus \n$13,314. The average rice farmer in Louisiana for 1996 loses $13,314. \nIn 1997, it is $7,360.\n  You say, why would he lose twice as much in 1996 as he would lose in \n1997? The reason is, under this bill, incredibly, they have to pay back \nthe payment they received for the last quarter of calendar 1996. They \nhave to pay that back, so that you actually lose $13,314.\n  It gets worse from there. In 1998, $8,162; in 1999, $11,092; in the \nyear 2000, $15,157; in 2001, $21,070; and 2002, $23,991.\n  Mr. President, these are not rich farmers but the average rice farmer \nin Louisiana who has planted 287 acres. Mr. President, this is not some \nDemocratic Policy Committee who has come out with these figures; it is \nthe Louisiana State University Agriculture Department.\n  Mr. President, this is actually not going to happen. The reason is \nthat they are not going to plant the rice. With these kind of economic \nfigures shown to the bankers, no banker is going to lend any money to \nplant this crop. So you will not have these losses. You will not have a \nrice industry in the State of Louisiana because it shows a negative \ncash flow for each of these years through the year 2002.\n  Again, Mr. President, this is the Louisiana State University who has \ncome up with these figures.\n  Mr. President, it is only slightly less bad for cotton. Under \ncotton--and all of the figures under which we calculated each one of \nthese figures has now been put into the Record--for the average cotton \nfarmer, that is 300 planted acres, he makes $3,708 in 1996, begins to \nlose the next year, and by the year 2002 he is losing a net of $20,944.\n  This, again, Mr. President, is the average cotton farmer in the State \nof Louisiana.\n  You say, how in the world could they have done such folly in this \nbill? Mr. President, they did it without hearings, they did it without \nconsultation, they did it without input. The Speaker got together with \nthe head of the Agriculture Committee in the House and, bam, here it \ncame. Here is the result.\n  Mr. President, this is an emergency. I think sooner or later this is \ngoing to be straightened out, because, as George Bush said about the \ninvasion of Kuwait, this cannot stand. It just cannot be, Mr. \nPresident.\n  This Congress has done some dumb things, Mr. President, but we have \nnever that I know of intentionally wiped out an industry--the cotton \nindustry, the rice industry--in a State. If this is happening in the \nState of Louisiana, it is going to happen elsewhere across the country. \nWe cannot intentionally do this.\n  Mr. President, it is an emergency that needs to be corrected now \nbecause if we wait, we are going to miss this crop year. Typically, Mr. \nPresident, the preparations for the crop year begin in December. The \nfarmers decide what kind of money they are going to need to borrow, \nwhat kind of crops they want to plant, how much it is going to cost, et \ncetera, and they begin those negotiations with the bank, typically, in \nDecember. Certainly by the middle of January, they must have their bank \narrangements pretty well in line because they have to plant that crop \nin the spring.\n  They have to not only order the seed, insecticide, pesticide, and the \nother things they will need for that crop, but their suppliers need to \nknow sufficiently in advance how much they will need to order, how much \nseed to have on hand, how much insecticide.\n  Mr. President, you cannot pass a rule one week and expect the crop to \nbe planted the next week.\n  Mr. President, you might ask, without support, if the Louisiana rice \nindustry cannot survive, why is it that we plant rice in the United \nStates? Why not just let the whole thing move overseas?\n  The reason is, Mr. President, that the subsidy, the support which we \nhave for agriculture in the United States for rice, is a fraction of \nwhat it is in the European market, Japan, and our other foreign \ncompetitors. The fact of the matter is the EU, the European Union, \nsubsidizes their farmers three to five times more than they do in the \nUnited States. They place high tariffs on some U.S. agricultural \nproducts which create artificially high prices.\n  I am informed, Mr. President--and I will get the exact figure and \nsupply them for the Record later--I am informed that rice can fetch as \nhigh a price as $27 per 100-weight in Europe, compared to $6 in the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. President, if we intentionally wipe out the rice industry and the \ncotton industry in the State of Louisiana and elsewhere in our country, \nthen we will be subject to the manipulation of foreign suppliers who \nwill dominate and monopolize the whole market.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe there is time to legislate this year. \nRegulations must be put out under any new legislation that comes out, \nand regulations are going to take many weeks in order to determine how \nto interpret whatever law finally comes out. I believe it will be too \nlate for the planting season even assuming that there is a \n\n[[Page S 18002]]\nveto of the reconciliation bill, which surely there should be if these \nare representative of the kind of provisions that are in that bill. If \nthe Congress passes a new bill, I do not believe there is going to be \ntime to get the regs out to borrow the money, to make the preparations \nin order to get the crop out this year.\n  So, Mr. President, what I am saying is the Congress needs to act as \nin an emergency and to extend the present law. We need to extend that \npresent law so we can get the crop in the ground this year. If we do \nnot do that, and if we have the reconciliation bill as passed, then we \nare going to wipe out the cotton and rice industry in the State of \nLouisiana and elsewhere in this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/05/senate-section/article/S17998-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CHANGE OF VOTE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 1833\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, be allowed to speak until such time as \nthe majority leader comes to the floor and has a chance to discuss with \nthe manager of the bill how we are going to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as everyone knows, about a week ago \nthe Judiciary Committee held hearings on this so-called partial-birth \nabortion legislation. I wanted to speak today on what I learned from \nthe hearings and my reasons for opposing this bill. Let me summarize \nthose reasons up front, and then go into each one specifically.\n  First, I believe that this bill attempts to ban a specific medical \nprocedure which is called, in this bill, a ``partial-birth abortion,'' \nbut there is no medical definition for what a ``partial-birth \nabortion'' is.\n  Second, the language in the bill is so vague that I believe it will \naffect more than any one single medical procedure.\n  Third, the bill presumes guilt on the part of the doctor, so that \nevery physician may have to prove that in fact he did not perform this \nprocedure, or justify his reasons for so doing if he did.\n  This bill could be an unnecessary, I think an unconscionable \ncomplication to families who face many tragic circumstances involving \nseverely deformed fetuses. I also believe it is an unnecessary Federal \nregulation, since 41 States have already outlawed post-viability \nabortions, except to save a woman's life or health.\n  Finally, I hope to make a case that this bill is very carefully \ncrafted to provide a direct challenge to Roe versus Wade.\n  First and foremost, this legislation claims to outlaw a medical \nprocedure called a partial-birth abortion. As I said, this medical term \ndoes not, in fact, exist. It does not appear in medical textbooks. It \ndoes not appear in medical records. The medical doctors who testified \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee 2 weeks ago could not identify, \nwith any degree of certainty or consistency, what medical procedure \nthis legislation refers to.\n  I would like to read some of the responses to my question in the \ncommittee, when I asked these doctors what a partial birth abortion is.\n  Dr. Pamela Smith, director of ob/gyn medical education at Mt. Sinai \nHospital in Chicago, said it was ``* * * a perversion of a breech \nextraction.''\n  Dr. Nancy Romer, a practicing ob/gyn and assistant professor at \nWright State University School of Medicine, said it is ``a dilation and \nextraction, distinguished from dismemberment-type D''\n  Dr. Norig Ellison, President of the American Society of \nAnesthesiologists, who was at the hearing to represent \nanesthesiologists who supposedly participate in these procedures, said, \n``I pass on that one. I am as confused as you are.''\n  And, Dr. Mary Campbell, medical director of planned parenthood of \nWashington, defined it as ``* * * a procedure in which any part of the \nfetus emerges from the cervix before the fetus has been documented to \nbe dead.''\n  Others have said it is an ``intact dilation and evacuation,'' or a \n``total breech extraction.''\n  I asked Dr. David Grimes of the University of California at San \nFrancisco this same question, and he put it in writing.\n\n       First, the term being used by abortion opponents, \n     ``partial-birth abortion,'' is not a medical term. It is not \n     found in any medical dictionary or gynecology text. It was \n     coined to inflame, rather than to illuminate. It lacks a \n     definition.\n       As I understand the term, opponents of abortion are using \n     this phrase to describe one variant of the dilation and \n     evacuation procedure, known as a D, which is the dominant \n     method of second trimester abortion in the United States.\n       Second trimester abortion.\n       If one does not use the D, the alternative methods of \n     abortion after 12 weeks gestation are total birth abortion--\n     labor induction is more costly and painful--or hysterotomy, \n     which is the more costly, painful, and hazardous.\n       Given the enviable record of safety of all D methods as \n     documented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n     there is no public health justification for any regulation or \n     intervention in a physician's decisionmaking with the \n     patient.\n\n  Then I asked one of the professors who testified at the hearing about \nthis. I will get to what he said in a moment. But for just 1 minute let \nme read the exact language of the bill. We have heard testimony from \nthe authors that this refers to a breech extraction by stopping the \nhead from leaving the birth canal and injecting scissors into the base \nof the skull and draining fluid. But the definition of the bill is \nentirely different. The bill says, ``The term `partial-birth abortion' \nmeans an abortion in which the person performing the abortion partially \ndelivers a living fetus before killing the fetus and completing the \ndelivery.'' There is no reference to scissors in the bill. There is no \nreference to drawing fluid from the brain in this bill. In fact, many \npeople believe that the purpose of this bill is really to get at second \ntrimester abortions.\n  I believe that the language in this bill, Mr. President, is vague for \nvery deliberate reasons, because by making it vague every doctor that \nperforms even a second trimester abortion could face the possibility of \nprosecution in that he or she could be hauled before a court and have \nto defend their abortion. So this bill in effect could affect all \nabortions.\n  I asked the legal and medical experts who testified at the Judiciary \nCommittee hearing last week if this legislation could affect abortion--\nnot just late-term abortions but earlier abortions of nonviable fetuses \nas well. Dr. Louis Seidman, professor of law from Georgetown, gave the \nfollowing answer, and I quote:\n\n       . . . as I read the language, in a second trimester pre-\n     viability abortion where the fetus will in any event die, if \n     any portion of the fetus enters the birth canal prior to the \n     technical death of the fetus, then the physician is guilty of \n     a crime and goes to prison for 2 years.\n\n  That is a law professor's reading of the bill. He then continued his \ntestimony, and I quote:\n\n       If I were a lawyer advising a physician who performed \n     abortions, I would tell him to stop because there is just no \n     way to tell whether the procedure will eventuate in some \n     portion of the fetus entering the birth canal before the \n     fetus is technically dead, much less being able to \n     demonstrate that after the fact.\n\n\n[[Page S 18003]]\n\n  Dr. Richardson, associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at \nJohns Hopkins, in testimony before a House Committee said, ``[the \nlanguage] . . . is vague, not medically oriented, and just not correct. \nIn any normal second trimester abortion procedure by any method, you \nmay have a point at which a part, a one-inch piece of [umbilical] cord, \nfor example, of the fetus passes out of the cervical [opening] before \nfetal demise has occurred.\n  So contrary to proponents' claims, this bill could affect far more \nthan just the few abortions performed in the third trimester and far \nmore than just one procedure being described.\n  Another part of this bill which is very troubling to me is that an \naffirmative defense automatically presumes guilt. The legislation \nprovides what is known as the ``affirmative defense,'' whereby an \naccused physician could escape liability only by proving that he or she \n``reasonably believed'' that the so-called banned procedure--whatever \nthat procedure is proved to be--was necessary to save the woman's life \nand that no other procedure would have sufficed. I think it also opens \nthe door to the prosecution of any doctor who performs a second or \nthird trimester abortion for any purpose whatsoever.\n  As has been said, there is no health exception in this bill at this \npoint. With that, it offers a direct challenge to both Roe versus Wade \nand Planned Parenthood versus Casey, both of which provide a health \nexception.\n  So, if this legislation were law, a pregnant woman seriously ill with \ndiabetes, cardiovascular problems, cancer, stroke, or any other health-\nthreatening illness would be forced to carry the pregnancy to term or \nrun the risk that her physician could be challenged and have to prove \nin court, A, what procedure he actually used, and B, whether or not the \nabortion partially, vaginally delivered a living fetus before the death \nof that fetus.\n  One of the things that also came forward very clearly in this and is \nimportant to point out is that any third trimester abortion is \nvirtually always used in the case of severe fetal abnormality, and the \nfact is that not always is this fetal abnormality able to be detected \nearly in the pregnancy. Many women undergo sonograms and other routine \nmedical procedures in the early weeks of pregnancy to monitor fetal \ndevelopment. If a woman is over 35 years of age, she may also undergo \namniocentesis. These tests are not routine in women under 35. \nUltrasound could also provide early detection of fetal anomalies. But \nthese tests also add considerable expense and are not routinely used \nuntil late in pregnancy.\n  As a result, some women carry fetuses with severe birth defects late \ninto pregnancy without knowing it. For example, fetal deformities that \nare not easy to spot early on in the pregnancy include: cases where the \nbrain forms outside the skull, or the stomach and intestines form \noutside the body, or do not form at all; or fetuses with no eyes, ears, \nmouths, legs, or kidneys--sometimes tragically unrecognizable as human \nat all.\n  But even with advanced technology, many serious birth defects can \nonly be identified later, often in the third trimester when the fetus \nreaches a certain size. Among those is hydrocephaly. Another \nabnormality is polyhydramnios--too much amniotic fluid.\n  So families that face these unexpected tragedies are often only \ndiagnosed late in their pregnancy. In fact, both Senator Smith, I \nbelieve, and Senator Hatch said none of the women who came before the \ncommittee and talked about their third trimester abortion--all of which \nwere the product of major fetal deformities--would be affected by that \nlegislation, but every one of them testified after reading the bill and \nbelieving that they would have been affected by this legislation.\n  I think that only points out the vagueness and the flaws in the \ndrafting of this legislation. In fact, no one knows who would really be \naffected by this legislation.\n  The next point I would like to make is that Roe already allows States \nto ban late-term abortions. It clearly allows States to ban all post-\nviability abortions unless necessary to protect a woman's life or \nhealth. And 41 States have already done that. So all I can believe is \nthat the purpose of this bill is to invade a guarantee provided by Roe \nversus Wade, and that is to protect the health of the mother or the \nlife of the mother.\n  As a matter of fact, my colleagues have made much of a statement made \nby an obstetrician/gynecologist, Dr. Martin Haskell, of Dayton, OH, who \nindicated that 80 percent of the late-term abortions he performed were \nso-called elective. I would like to point out that just this year Ohio \nbecame the 41st State to ban all post-viability abortions. So, clearly \nthat State has taken care of whatever it was that Dr. Haskell was doing \nby banning all third-trimester abortions. As I said, 40 other States \nhave done this. So this legislation is effectively unnecessary.\n  The whole focus of this Congress has been to remove the Federal \nGovernment where it is within the rights of the State to legislate. Yet \nthis is the first time I can remember in this Congress, when the State \nhas a clear right and ability to legislate and, in fact, has done so in \n41 States, that the Federal Government is now saying, no, that is not \nenough. We want to legislate federally.\n  Let me touch for a moment on the commerce clause. I believe, and \nothers do as well, that this legislation is meaningless under the \ncommerce clause because it would only apply to patients or doctors who \ncross State lines in order to perform an abortion under these specific \ncircumstances, whatever they may eventually be adjudicated to be. So \nwhat is the point?\n  The point is, that this legislation, I believe, has little or nothing \nto do with stopping the use of some horrific and unnecessary medical \nprocedure performed by evil or inhumane doctors. If that were simply \nthe case, we would all be opposed. I believe this legislation's major \npurpose is the camel's nose under the tent to get at second-trimester \nabortions and to put a fear over all legitimate physicians, \nobstetricians who do perform an abortion when an abortion is \nnecessary--a fear that they could be hauled into court and have to \ndefend themselves and prove that they did not perform whatever a \npartial-birth abortion is eventually adjudicated to be.\n  So the legislation is vague, it is flawed, and it presumes guilt on \nthe part of the doctor. It ignores the vital health interest of women. \nI believe these are strong reasons to vote against this bill.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is H.R. 1833.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3080\n\n          (Purpose: To provide a life-of-the-mother exception)\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3080.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, at the end of line 9, insert the following:\n       ``This paragraph does not apply to a partial-birth abortion \n     that is necessary to save the life of a mother whose life is \n     endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or injury, \n     provided that no other medical procedure would suffice for \n     that purpose.''\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3081 to Amendment No. 3080\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I send a second-degree amendment to the Smith amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Dole] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3081 to amendment No. 3080.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       In the pending amendment, strike all after the word \n     ``This'' and insert in lieu thereof \n\n[[Page S 18004]]\n     the following: ``paragraph shall not apply to a partial-birth abortion \n     that is necessary to save the life of a mother whose life is \n     endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or injury, \n     provided that no other medical procedure would suffice for \n     that purpose.\n       This paragraph shall become effective one day after \n     enactment.''\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we now return to important legislation to \nban a reprehensible procedure that has no place in a civilized society. \nThe ban on the so-called partial-birth abortions passed the House by a \nvote of 288 to 139 on November 1. The Senate called for a hearing on \nthe legislation before the Committee on the Judiciary which was held on \nNovember 17.\n  The testimony before the Judiciary Committee reinforced what we \nalready knew--this is a straightforward and narrowly crafted bill that \nbears no similarity to the caricature offered by those who oppose the \nbill.\n  Thus, for example, the hearing highlighted what medical authorities \nhave already made clear--there is no situation where the life of a \nmother is at risk that calls for a partial-birth abortion. After all, \nthis is a procedure that takes place over several days. In short, \narguments about protecting the life of the mother are merely an attempt \nto scare people and avoid defending the indefensible.\n  Nonetheless, since there is no situation where the life of the mother \ncalls for a partial-birth abortion, there is no reason not to make \nclear with explicit language that this legislation would not apply in \nany situation where the life of the mother is endangered. I therefore \nsupport the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Smith, in taking this \nissue off the table.\n  Mr. President, this is a bill that deserves overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport. This is our opportunity to show the American people that we \ncan rise above the argument that says that compassion must give way to \na rigid ideology that refuses to recognize any constraints of decency.\n  I therefore urge my colleagues to support Senator Smith's amendment \nand to support the bill on final passage.\n  I now understand the Senator from Arkansas is going to set these \namendments aside and offer a different amendment.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, with that understanding, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from \nNew Hampshire, second-degreed by the majority leader from Kansas, be \nset aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SMITH. Reserving the right to object. Just to clarify, that is \namendment No. 3080 and amendment No. 3081 to amendment No. 3080, is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the Chair's understanding.\n  Mr. SMITH. No objection.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3082\n\n  (Purpose: To clarify certain provisions of law with respect to the \n         approval and marketing of certain prescription drugs)\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I have an amendment that I send to the desk \nat this time and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor], for himself, Mr. \n     Chafee, and Mr. Brown, proposes an amendment numbered 3082.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . APPROVAL AND MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.\n\n       (a) Approval of Applications of Generic Drugs.--For \n     purposes of acceptance and consideration by the Secretary of \n     an application under subsections (b), (c), and (j) of section \n     505, and subsections (b), (c), and (n) of section 512, of the \n     Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355 (b), (c), \n     and (j), and 360b (b), (c), and (n)), the expiration date of \n     a patent that is the subject of a certification under section \n     505(b)(2)(A) (ii), (iii), or (iv), section 505(j)(2)(A)(vii) \n     (II), (III), or (IV), or section 512(n)(1)(H) (ii), (iii), or \n     (iv) of such Act, respectively, made in an application \n     submitted prior to June 8, 1995, or in an application \n     submitted on or after that date in which the applicant \n     certifies that substantial investment was made prior to June \n     8, 1995, shall be deemed to be the date on which such patent \n     would have expired under the law in effect on the day \n     preceding December 8, 1994.\n       (b) Marketing Generic Drugs.--The remedies of section \n     271(e)(4) of title 35, United States Code, shall not apply to \n     acts--\n       (1) that were commenced, or for which a substantial \n     investment was made, prior to June 8, 1995; and\n       (2) that became infringing by reason of section 154(c)(1) \n     of such title, as amended by section 532 of the Uruguay Round \n     Agreements Act (Public Law 103-465; 108 Stat. 4983).\n       (c) Equitable Remuneration.--For acts described in \n     subsection (b), equitable remuneration of the type described \n     in section 154(c)(3) of title 35, United States Code, as \n     amended by section 532 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act \n     (Public Law 103-465; 108 Stat. 4983) shall be awarded to a \n     patentee only if there has been--\n       (1) the commercial manufacture, use, offer to sell, or \n     sale, within the United States of an approved drug that is \n     the subject of an application described in subsection (a); or\n       (2) the importation by the applicant into the United States \n     of an approved drug or of active ingredient used in an \n     approved drug that is the subject of an application described \n     in subsection (a).\n       (c) Applicability.--The provisions of this section shall \n     govern--\n       (1) the approval or the effective date of approval of \n     applications under section 505(b)(2), 505(j), 507, or 512(n), \n     or the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355 \n     (b)(2) and (j), 357, and 360b(n)) submitted on or after the \n     date of enactment of this Act; and\n       (2) the approval or effective date of approval of all \n     pending applications that have not received final approval as \n     of the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3083 to Amendment No. 3082\n\n(Purpose: To clarify the application of certain provisions with respect \n  to abortions where necessary to preserve the life or health of the \n                                 woman)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3083 to amendment No. 3082.\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following new \n     sentence: ``The prohibition in section 1531 (a) of Title 18, \n     United States Code, shall not apply to any abortion performed \n     prior to the viability of the fetus, or after viability \n     where, in the medical judgment of the attending physician, \n     the abortion is necessary to preserve the life of the woman \n     or avert serious adverse health consequences to the woman.''.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. First, I would like to just take a very, very few moments \nof the Senate's time this evening to explain basically what my \namendment does. I know there will be no vote on this amendment this \nevening, Mr. President. I realize that. I know that to accommodate some \nschedules tomorrow, it is likely that we will come back to this \nlegislation late in the afternoon.\n  But having said that, Mr. President, I would like to state that this \namendment relates to the issue of GATT and prescription drugs. I have \nspoken on this issue on several occasions on the floor of the Senate. \nAnd I would like, if I might, to just take a very few moments to \nexplain basically what we have done and what I plan to speak about \ntomorrow.\n  When Congress voted on the GATT treaty, Mr. President, we did two \nthings. First, we extended all patents from 17 to 20 years in duration. \nSecond, we said in the GATT treaty that a generic drug company could \nmarket their product on a 17-year expiration date if they had already \nmade a substantial investment and were willing to pay a royalty to the \nparticular drug company that they were going in competition with.\n  We all considered and all agreed that this was a fair balance of \ninterests. The treaty, Mr. President, applies in our country to every \nperson, to every product, to every company and every industry in our \ncountry. We thought it was fair. We thought it was universal. But we \nwere wrong. We simply made a mistake.\n  We accidentally left the prescription drug industry out of the \npicture. Today there are certain prescription drug companies that get \nthe patent extension, but the GATT loophole shields them from any \ngeneric competition. Why is this, Mr. President? \n\n[[Page S 18005]]\n\n  First, because we by our own mistake--and we should admit that \nmistake; and, by the way, we have the opportunity to correct that \nmistake--we failed to have the food, drug and cosmetic law of our \ncountry comply to the GATT treaty language.\n  Second, the Food and Drug Administration tried in vain to correct \nthis mistake. The U.S. Patent Office tried in vain to correct this \nmistake, but to no avail because the law was written and we failed to \nconform the food, drug, and cosmetic law to the specific GATT treaty \nlanguage.\n  The drug industry is the only industry which enjoys this special \nprotection under GATT. The American consumers are going to be paying, \ntherefore, much more for their drugs as a result, as much, as a matter \nof fact, $2 to $6 billion a year more.\n  If we take Zantac, for example, Mr. President, the world's best \nselling drug for uclers, we will have to pay a price twice as much as \nwe would be paying for a generic competitor. As a matter of fact, Mr. \nPresident, tomorrow, on Wednesday, we will see the drug company that \nmanufactures Zantac--we will see that particular company taking in \nprofits that they did not expect of $2 to $6 billion a year, unless we \ncorrect this outrageous loophole.\n  There is no conceivable reason why we should allow this loophole to \nremain uncorrected. Mickey Kantor, our own U.S. Trade Representative, \nthe Patent Office, and the FDA all agree that it should be fixed. Even \nthe drug companies admit that it was all a mistake.\n  Mr. President, we think that our cause is correct, and on behalf of \nSenator Chafee of Rhode Island and Senator Brown of Colorado, I submit \nthis amendment this evening. We will be talking about this amendment \nand what it does tomorrow. But I urge my colleagues to remember: \nCongress made a mistake. It led to consumers being forced to subsidize \nan unjustified multibillion-dollar windfall to a few undeserving \ncompanies. And tomorrow, we will have our sole opportunity to do the \nright thing and correct this mistake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, yesterday I spoke, I thought, at great \nlength about this bill. For the first time, it would criminalize a \nmedical procedure that saves lives. The important part, I thought, of \nthe Judiciary hearing was that we had testimony from physicians who \nsaid clearly it is sometimes extremely risky to use other procedures. \nCesarean sections or induced labor could cause the woman to bleed to \ndeath, to have serious health consequences even if she pulled through, \nand sometimes those consequences impact on her ability to have children \nat a later date.\n  What I did last night, and what I intend to do throughout the course \nof this debate--I will not go on at length tonight--is to try and put \nthe woman's face on this issue. We see many times my colleague from New \nHampshire bring out the diagram, and it shows the lower part of a \nwoman's body. It is almost as if a woman's body is a vessel. It does \nnot show the woman's face. It does not show her anguish when she learns \nthat her baby is in serious trouble and could even die if she went \nforward with birth. So it is my intention to put that face on.\n  The women who came forward at that hearing were magnificent in their \ncourage. I received many other letters from other women who said, \n``Please, Senator Boxer, don't let them talk about this as if it \ndoesn't affect real, living moms and dads and families who desperately \nwant these children but who come upon these horrible outcomes of \npregnancies.''\n  We deal here with situations in life that we hope never happen to any \nof us or our loved ones or anyone at all. We do not wish these things \non anyone: When a woman, who is so excited about this pending birth of \na child, goes to the physician in the late stages of her pregnancy and \nsuddenly is told the most horrible news that the baby's brain is \ngrowing outside the skull, that there are no eyes. My colleague, \nSenator Feinstein, talked about that. These anomalies go along with a \ngreat threat to the woman's life if the fetus is carried to term.\n  My colleagues say nobody ever talks about baby. Yes, I want to talk \nabout baby. This is a baby. This is a late-term abortion. This is an \nemergency medical procedure, and I hope that the Senate will not go \ndown the slippery slope of outlawing a procedure.\n  Where do we stop? Senator Simon said yesterday he has heard about \nsome procedures that are used for brain tumors and he has questions \nabout them. We are not a medical school here. As Senator Kennedy said, \nwe should not be Senators practicing medicine without a license. We \nshould leave that to physicians. And physicians are split. The \nphysicians that came before the Judiciary Committee, some said this is \na necessary procedure, we need it to save the life of a mother, protect \nher health and her fertility. Others said it is not.\n  I say, let us be conservative. Even if several physicians--and their \nqualifications were never questioned by the committee--say it could \nmean a woman's life, let us not take away her option to have a safe \nconclusion to a very tragic event because of some political agenda. We \nhave a lot of work to do around here. We have a lot of debate to do \naround here with the budget, where we are seeing looming ahead on \nDecember 15 another shutdown, another crisis, while we are taking up a \nbill to tell physicians what they cannot do.\n  It seems to me a very dangerous course for Government, particularly a \nRepublican Congress that says we should not interfere in local \ndecisions, we should not interfere with States. States already control \nthese abortions in the late term.\n  I have to say, the amendment that my friend has offered, I think, is \nquite interesting, because all through this debate the Senator from \nCalifornia was saying there is no exception, there is no exception if \nthere is really a problem. And now here we have it. Here we have it, an \nexception now for life of the mother.\n  I think that is progress. I think that is progress, because when we \nstarted, there was no exception. It was an affirmative defense. My \nfriend kept saying, ``Oh, no, you don't need an exception, you don't \nneed an exception.'' We went on television and debated this, and I \nsaid, ``You do not even have an exception here.''\n  He said, ``It is already in the bill.''\n  It was not in the bill. We knew it; that is why we slowed this train \ndown, that is why we had hearings.\n  I have offered a second-degree amendment to the amendment of my \nfriend, Senator Pryor. He is trying to protect the consumers of this \ncountry, and I offered an amendment that essentially says that, yes, if \nwe are going to outlaw this procedure--and by the way, I do not think \nwe should get into that slippery slope--but if we are going to do that, \nit should apply only to the late-term abortion, which is what it is \nsupposed to do, and it clears it up and says, in the medical judgment \nof the attending physician, the abortion is necessary for the life of \nthe woman or to prevent serious adverse health consequences to the \nwoman.\n  I feel these amendments are moving in the right direction, but the \nwhole issue of telling doctors what to do, of interfering in an \nemergency medical procedure has no place in the U.S. Senate. To quote a \nwoman whose testimony I read yesterday, Coreen Costello, she said so \nbeautifully the last thing she wants to see happen when a family is in \ncrisis like this is for the Government to be involved.\n  It is such a tragedy, and these women who have gone through this were \nso eloquent. No matter what your view on a woman's right to choose, if \nyou will simply read the testimony--and I handed it out today to my \ncolleagues for them to read her words--it seems to me outrageous that \npoliticians would insert themselves into matters that impact a family, \nmatters like this.\n  As we get back to this bill, and I understand we will be back to it \ntomorrow evening about 5, I am going to bring out those photos of those \nwomen who have shared their stories with the Senate and want to share \nit with the American people and let us get this issue out there.\n  Let us not outlaw a medical procedure that doctors have testified is \nnecessary to save the life of a mother and, in fact, if it is outlawed, \ncould lead to her family losing her. A lot of these women have other \nhealthy children. Let us think about those babies as well. \n\n[[Page S 18006]]\n\n  So, Mr. President, I shall not go on much longer at all tonight \nbecause, again, it looks like we are delaying this debate, and that is \nfine with me, because, as far as I am concerned, we do not need this \nlaw. This is an intrusion into the hospital room. This is a \ncriminalization of a procedure, and, as far as I am concerned, it has \nno place here at all. We are not doctors, and we are not God. We are \nU.S. Senators. We should leave medical decisions up to medical doctors, \nand we should leave these tragic matters to the families and let them \nface it with their God and with each other.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that four members \nof my staff, Steven R. Valentine, Tom Hodson, Ed Corrigan, and Noah \nSilverman, be granted the privilege of the floor simultaneously during \nthe consideration of H.R. 1333, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to pass \nthe partial-birth abortion ban. I have looked at the testimony \npresented before the Judiciary Committee, I have gotten letters and \nphone calls, and I have come to the conclusion that this is not about \nbeing pro-life or pro-abortion. It is not even about a woman's choice. \nLaws have already established that they have that choice.\n  This is about a procedure--a procedure that I do not know how anyone \ncan perform or even condone, once you know what it is. We are talking \nabout the practice of late-term abortion, but a specific procedure in \nwhich the fetus is turned around so that it is delivered feet first. \nAnd before the head is delivered, while it is still in the birth canal, \nthe physician makes a hole with scissors in the base of the skull and \nsuctions out the brains. And the majority of the time, the baby is \nalive when this procedure is performed. The heart is beating, the limbs \nare functioning, they feel, they react, they may even have a good \nchance of living if they had been allowed to be fully born.\n  To me this just sounds repulsive, absolutely inhumane. And it makes \nme wonder, if they were doing this to dogs or horses, whether we would \nhave more support to ban this procedure. My daughter, who is a third \nyear medical student, assures me that I would probably find most \nsurgeries pretty hard to stomach. But even she agrees that this \nprocedure is intolerable.\n  And I find it interesting that the American Medical Association's \nCouncil on Legislation has unanimously supported this bill. The \nargument is made that these procedures are done to save the life of the \nmother. Yet, even some physicians who specialize in this procedure \nclaim otherwise. Dr. Martin Haskell conceded that 80 percent of his \nlate-term abortions were elective.\n  Dr. Pamela Smith, up at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Chicago, recently wrote \nthat ``There are absolutely no obstetrical situations encountered in \nthis country which require a partially delivered human fetus to be \ndestroyed to preserve the life of the mother.'' And that is what I \nwould think. If you are going to put the mother through delivery of a \n24- or 26-week-old or even a full-term fetus, and the fetus is almost \ncompletely delivered, except for the head, why not just finish the \nbirth?\n  I will tell you why. Because once the head is out, it is a child, a \nhuman being by legal standards, with all the constitutional rights that \ncome with being alive and then it cannot be killed. But by common \nsense, not just conservative sense, that fetus is not any less human \njust because the head is still in the birth canal. And I found it \nironic that, if the head does slip out and a live baby is born, the \nphysician calls this a complication.\n  I realize that, for parents who have been told their long-anticipated \nchild will be deformed or has little chance of living, this is a \nhorrendous decision. And some may decide to abort. This bill does not \nrestrict late-term abortions--only this method of doing it.\n  I have read some of the personal experiences of families who have \nchosen this option, and in the cases where the fetus developed organs \noutside the body, the recurring sentiment is that that baby would never \nhave survived outside the mother's womb. If that is the case, why then \nshould the fetus be killed while the head is still in the uterus?\n  Some say this is the safest procedure for the mother. But even the \ndoctor who wrote ``Abortion Practices,'' the Nation's most widely used \ntextbook on abortion standards and procedures, disputes this. Dr. Hern \nstates that he could not imagine a circumstance in which the partial-\nbirth abortion procedure would be the safest. And after all, I think \nthat is what we should be aiming for.\n  I am not doubting for an instant that carrying to term or delivering \na baby that has little to no chance of survival would be difficult. And \nthat's an understatement. You would need the mental fortitude of \nJeannie French, whose testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee \nwas inspiring. She delivered by C-section twins, one of which she knew \nwould not live. Against her doctor's recommendation to abort, she opted \nto go ahead with delivery and here little Mary's vital organs were used \nto save the lives of two children. Some may not think that is heroic, \nbut I would bet you those two children are glad that Jeannie chose to \ndeliver Mary.\n  Mr. President, our debate here today is not a debate on choice. It is \nnot even a debate on abortion. Let no one convince you of that. The \ndebate is whether or not this procedure, a procedure that most \nphysicians do not approve of, and that most agree is not safe for the \nmother--certainly not safe for the fetus--should be legal. I believe it \nshould be banned. For the health of the mothers and the health or our \nNation, we should pass the partial-birth abortion ban bill.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, some of the debate and comments made on the \nfloor on this issue never cease to amaze me. The distinguished Senator \nfrom California, Senator Feinstein, a few moments ago on the floor of \nthe Senate, made the statement that the doctors, in the medical \ntestimony that she had seen or heard, said that partial-birth abortion \nprocedures do not exist. If they do not exist, then why is there a \nproblem in banning it? Maybe the Senator from California, Senator \nFeinstein, could come back and explain that to me. If the procedure \ndoes not exist, as she says, then there ought not to be any problem \nbanning something that does not exist.\n  Again, these things never cease to amaze me. Also, Senator Boxer of \nCalifornia, a few moments ago again referred to the case of Coreen \nCostello, who spoke very passionately--and it was a very compelling \nstory--before the committee of her terrible tragedy of losing a child. \nAnd, again, Mr. President, let me repeat that Miss Costello's abortion \nwas not a partial-birth abortion. So that is not what we are talking \nabout here today.\n  We are talking about partial-birth abortions, when a child is allowed \nto come through the birth canal, with the exception of the head, and \nthen is killed with the use of scissors and a catheter. That is what we \nare talking about--no other type of abortion.\n  I have made it very clear, and I think most of my colleagues know, \nthat I oppose abortion. I believe abortion takes an innocent human \nlife, no matter what stage of life it is in, whether the day after \nconception or the day of birth. But that is not the issue today. The \nissue here is partial-birth abortion.\n  Yesterday, we learned on the floor of the Senate, even though \ninformation was presented to the contrary, that when the witnesses came \nto testify before Senator Hatch's Judiciary Committee on this matter, \nthere were no doctors called to testify, or no doctors who testified \nthat had ever performed a partial-birth abortion, and there were no \nwomen who ever had one who testified. And we asked Dr. Haskell, who \nperformed a thousand of them, partial-birth abortions, to come, and he \nrefused. No women who had partial-birth abortions came. So it is \ninteresting that Senator Feinstein says that partial-birth abortion \nprocedures do not exist when Dr. Haskell has performed 1,000 of them. \nMaybe somebody can explain that to me with some logic. But it beats me, \nMr. President. You have a doctor who is an abortion doctor, who has \nperformed 1,000 partial-birth abortions, and then the Senator from \nCalifornia comes to the floor and says it does not exist. I will leave \nthat to my colleagues to decide what the facts are.\n\n  Mr. President, the amendment that I submitted a short time ago, which \nwas \n\n[[Page S 18007]]\nsecond-degreed by the majority leader, Senator Dole, would make a very \nexplicit exception to the ban on partial-birth abortions for cases in \nwhich the life of the mother is in danger. It is very specific. The \nlanguage could not be clearer.\n  To be perfectly candid about it, Mr. President, I do not believe that \nthis amendment is really necessary. In the first place, there was no \nmedical evidence--no medical evidence--presented at the November 17 \nJudiciary Committee hearing that the partial-birth abortion procedure, \nthat brutal procedure that has been described a number of times here on \nthe floor, which is banned by this bill, is ever necessary to save the \nlife of the mother. There was no testimony to that effect.\n  In the second place, Mr. President, the bill already includes an \naffirmative defense for cases in which the doctor reasonably believes \nthe mother's life is in danger. For all intents and purposes, this \naffirmative defense provision, found in subsection (e) of the bill, is \na life-of-the-mother exception.\n  But that did not satisfy a number of my colleagues because they \nexpressed to me their discomfort with the affirmative defense approach \nand asked me to consider placing a more explicit, more clear, if you \nwill, life-of-the-mother exception in the bill, because I support a \nlife-of-the-mother exception. Even though we cannot find any testimony \nanywhere in the record that I know of--no one has produced it yet--that \nit is necessary to do it to save the life of the mother, I am still \nwilling to put that exception there. That is what I have done with the \namendment that I have offered.\n  I do not believe it is necessary because the affirmative defense \nprovision provides for that exception, and the amendment now before the \nSenate would place an explicit life-of-the-mother exception into \nsubsection (a) of the bill. I am more than happy to do that. I am more \nthan happy to clarify for my colleagues. The issue is the life-of-the-\nmother exception here, even though there was no evidence presented at \nthe hearing that a mother's life was threatened. No one testified to \nthat effect. But I am willing to do that because I think it is fair, \nand colleagues of mine have expressed the concern that we clarify the \nlanguage, and that is what I have done.\n  So the language of this life-of-the-mother exception amendment is \nclear, Mr. President. It states, ``The ban on partial-birth abortions \nshall not apply to a partial-birth abortion that is necessary to save \nthe life of a mother whose life is in danger by a physical disorder, \nillness, or injury, provided that no other procedure would suffice for \nthat purpose.''\n\n  That is very clear and explicit. Even though Senator Feinstein says \nthere are no such procedures as partial-birth abortions, it is \ninteresting that they also want an exception to a procedure that does \nnot exist, and they ignore the testimony of a doctor who has performed \n1,000 of them.\n  So the first part of the amendment is designed to make it very clear \nand certain that the exception only applies to cases where the mother's \nlife is genuinely physically threatened by some physical disorder, \nillness, or injury.\n  Let me also state that, yesterday, when we discussed this process, \nthis brutal procedure, we discussed the fact that this baby--this is a \nlate-term baby, Mr. President, as you know, anywhere from the fifth \nmonth of gestation to the ninth--is prevented, physically restrained, \nfrom completely exiting the birth canal. The baby is turned in the \nuterus with forceps so that it comes out feet first, and the baby is \nthen restrained and not allowed to be completely born, if you will, \nwhere it is then killed by using an incision with scissors and a \ncatheter which sucks the brains from the child.\n  We heard very compelling testimony at the hearing. We recited it here \non the floor. There was testimony of a nurse who had witnessed this and \nhad become so upset by it that she left the clinic because, as she \nstated it, after looking into the ``angelic face'' of this child that \nwas aborted in this fashion, it was more than she could bear. She was \nhorrified. We have heard a lot about the life of the mother and the \neyes of the mother. We looked into this young woman's eyes, too, this \nmother of two daughters, and she was horrified by what she saw, that \nthis child, contrary to what has been stated again on the floor of the \nSenate over and over again, this child's life was terminated for one \nreason--one reason, Mr. President. This child had Down's syndrome, so \nsomebody made a decision to take the life of this child who had Down's \nsyndrome.\n\n  I remind my colleagues, not that they need reminding, there are a lot \nof very productive people in our society today who happen to have \nDown's syndrome. There is a television show involving people with \nDown's syndrome.\n  The point I made yesterday, I guess we really did not need the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act if we are going to terminate all the \npeople who are going to be born disabled. I guess we could have it for \nthose people who might be injured during the course of their lifetime. \nIf anybody is going to be born disabled or in any way not normal, if \nyou will, we would not need to have any coverage for them because we \ncould just elect to terminate the pregnancy.\n  I was accused--because I was horrified by that--I was accused of \nplaying God. I do not know where that comes from. It would seem to me \nsomeone who chooses to terminate a pregnancy simply because a child has \nDown's syndrome, perhaps they may be playing God.\n  Again, the issue here is 80 percent of the cases--not 20, not 10, not \n5, not 1, in 80 percent of the cases--this is an elective procedure for \nno other reason other than that particular woman decides to have that \nabortion because--for whatever. ``I do not want a child, I do not want \na child with Down's syndrome,'' or whatever. Mr. President, 80 percent \nof the cases are elective, not some horrible threat to the life or the \nhealth of the mother at all.\n  The second part of this amendment is intended to ensure that in such \ndire emergencies, a partial-birth abortion could only be performed if \nit were the medical procedure, the only medical procedure available to \nsave the life of the mother. I support that. I have no problem \nsupporting it because I have no problem in understanding the fact that \nthere is not any need, absolutely no medical need that anyone has ever \ntestified to, that says that this is necessary to protect the life of \nthe mother.\n  Let me say why. How would restraining a child from coming through the \nbirth canal, that could come through the birth canal, enhance the life \nor the health of the mother? I do not understand that. I do not think \nany reasonable person could understand it. We have had testimony that \nin the case of the hydrocephalic children, where the head is enlarged \nwith fluids, that that can be drained so that the head can be a normal \nsize and can be allowed to come through the birth canal.\n\n  So we are talking about a brutal practice here, in 80 percent of the \ncases elective, and nothing to do with the life of the mother.\n  Be that as it may, I agree with my colleagues. I agree with the \nSenator from California that a life-of-the-mother exception should be \nthere, even though I disagree with her that there is a threat to the \nlife of the mother. At least I have not seen any evidence to that in \nterms of testimony, but even that does not mean it cannot happen in the \nfuture. I am willing, certainly willing to protect the life of the \nmother.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would my friend yield about timeframe? I would be \nappreciative, if my friend would yield 5 minutes, I will finish my \nremarks for the evening and leave him the rest of the evening if we \ncould agree not to take any other action or lay down any other \namendments.\n  Mr. SMITH. I know of no other amendments on my side. I certainly will \nnot be offering any, and I do not intend to go very long.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I know my friend and I have different things pulling on \nus.\n  Mr. SMITH. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I just want to say that we are going to have a very \ninteresting debate about the competing amendments that will come before \nthe Senate on this issue. One is Senator Smith's and Senator Dole's \namendment, which they call a life-of-the-mother exception. The other is \nthe Boxer amendment, which makes a life-of-the-mother exception and a \nserious adverse health consequences exception to the woman. \n\n[[Page S 18008]]\n\n  I have to just say to my colleagues if they may be watching, and I \nwill discuss this with them at great length, that the Smith-Dole \namendment which is stated as if it is, in fact, an exception, I have \nnow had an opportunity to read it. I want everyone to know that it is \nreally not an exception for the life of the mother because what it says \nis, essentially, that this procedure will be banned, except it will not \napply to partial-birth abortion that is necessary to save the life of a \nmother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or \ninjury.\n  I say to my friend, that is not a life-of-the-mother exception. That \nis a preexisting situation. So, yes, if a woman had diabetes or some \nother disease, there would be an exception, but if, in fact, the birth \nendangered her life there would be no exception.\n  So this so-called exception, life-of-the-mother exception that has \nbeen offered by my friend from New Hampshire with Senator Dole, is \nnot--let me repeat, is not--in any way a life-of-the-mother exception.\n  We have life-of-the-mother exceptions in many other bills that deal \nwith Medicaid funding, and they never use this language. It just simply \nsays ``except if the life of the mother is threatened.'' No such thing \nas ``if she is endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or injury.''\n  Let me repeat, most of the women would not fall in this category.\n  The first fight we had, or argument or debate, was over the issue of \nthe life-of-the-mother exception in the bill as it was referred here to \nthe Senate. My colleague from New Hampshire said there is a life-of-\nthe-mother exception, and he insisted on it. We debated it over and \nover again. I said there was not; he said there was.\n  Now, today, he and the majority leader say, oh, you were right, there \nwas not a life-of-the-mother exception. Here it is. And this one is not \na life-of-the-mother exception; it is only an exception for a woman who \ncomes to the birth with a preexisting condition or injury.\n  So we will make that debate clear, I hope tomorrow, or we can get \nmore into this issue.\n  My goodness, let us not endanger a woman who has no preexisting \ncondition such as diabetes. Let us not take away an option for her to \nhave a safe outcome of a tragic situation.\n  I hope that Members will, in fact, vote for the Boxer amendment and \nnot for the Smith-Dole. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I might just respond briefly. It is amazing \nwhat you can do with semantics. This language is as clear as it can \npossibly be. This paragraph is exactly the line--referring back to the \nparagraph in terms of the issue of whether or not you can have a \npartial-birth abortion--this paragraph does not apply to a partial-\nbirth abortion.\n  Here is the language: ``That is necessary to save the life of a \nmother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or \ninjury, provided that no other medical procedure would suffice.''\n  The focus of the remarks of Senator Boxer is physical disorder, a \ncomplication resulting from a pregnancy; if it is not a physical \ndisorder, what is it? What is it? Of course it covers that. The Senator \nknows it. You cannot make it any clearer. We could play word games, but \nit is very, very clear.\n  Again, the argument is so unbelievable here because, A, they use the \nline that the partial-birth abortion procedure does not exist, yet they \nstill say we should not have to ban it.\n  If it does not exist, what are they worried about the life-of-the-\nmother exception for? The truth of the matter is, of course, it exists. \nThere are 1,000 that have been performed by Dr. Haskell alone. There \nare at least one or two that we know of, roughly, per day, that are \nstill being performed in this country. Some people say that is not very \nmany. Well, that is somewhere between 365 and 700 or 750. How many \nphysicians who might cure cancer are in that group? How many future \nPresidents are in that group? Future Senators--perhaps from California \nor New Hampshire? Who knows, maybe even from Minnesota? Who knows who \nis in that group?\n  It is interesting. We have heard on the floor here that President \nClinton will veto this horrible bill as soon as he gets to it, this \nbill to ban partial-birth abortions that execute innocent children, \nthree-quarters of the way out of the womb, but we heard it proudly \nstated on the floor that the President is going to veto this bill.\n  I might say to the President of the United States--I know he is not \nlistening tonight, probably--but, if he is, I would like to have the \nopportunity to have 15 minutes in the Oval Office to discuss this bill \nwith him, because I do not believe, if he looked at the facts, that he \nwould veto it because this process is so horrible that I think we have \nmore important things to do in America than do that.\n  Let me just conclude on this point this evening, again, on the \namendment. This amendment is designed to assure that no baby will be \nsubjected to this brutal procedure unless this partial-birth abortion \nprocedure is the only way to save the mother, in other words, in a true \ncase of self-defense. Everyone has the right to self-defense.\n  In sum, I believe this is very carefully crafted language. It is \nfully adequate to provide the explicit life-of-the-mother exception to \nthe bill's ban on partial-birth abortions. And those people who are now \ntaking the words and fiddling with the words a little bit, trying to \nmake things out of the words that are not there--do you know what the \nreal issue is here, Mr. President? It is not that they object to this \nlife-of-the-mother exception. No, it is not that. Their real problem is \nthey do not want any exceptions. They do not want any exceptions. They \nwant abortion on demand for whatever reason, mongoloid child, Down's \nsyndrome child, a child with a cleft palate, a female child, a child \nwith blue eyes, whatever.\n  I call on any one of my colleagues who is opposed to me on this issue \nto come down to the floor and say to me, ``I will not support an \nabortion, partial-birth or otherwise, because it was a female child.'' \nCome down to the floor and state that right now. I think you will find \nthe silence is quite deafening, because it is abortion on demand. But, \nand this is the key, it is abortion on demand in the most horrible way \nthat any abortion could ever be performed.\n  In spite of the fact that all of us have different opinions about \nwhen life begins--and everyone knows my position on that--that is not \nthe issue here, my position on when life begins. That is not relevant \ntoday. What is relevant today in this discussion is whether or not we \nhave the right, morally or otherwise, to kill an unborn child who is \nheld in the hands of this doctor with the exception of the head. Three \nor four more inches and that doctor could place that tiny little head \ninto his hand and cradle it. But, instead, he turns that baby over and \nexecutes him, with no novocaine, no anesthetic, nothing-- with a pair \nof scissors and a catheter, a child.\n\n  That is what this is about. That is why, when this bill came to the \nfloor for a vote, even without the language that I have now crafted for \nthe life-of-the-mother exception--but with language that perhaps was \nnot as clear but did have the life-of-the-mother exception--even with \nthe old language, it passed overwhelmingly in the House. Why? Why did a \npro-choice Republican woman like Susan Molinari vote for it? Why did a \nliberal Democrat like Patrick Kennedy, son of Senator Ted Kennedy, vote \nfor it? Because it is reasonable. Because it is sickening to think of \nthe fact that we would do this to our children here in America. That is \nthe reason. This is not a radical, extremist position. The radicals and \nthe extremists are the people who do this.\n  So, I urge my colleagues to oppose Senator Boxer's amendment whenever \nwe vote on it, tomorrow or whenever. Because basically it provides the \nopportunity to drive a truck through this whole process. It is a killer \namendment. It might as well be called the partial-birth abortion-on-\ndemand amendment, because it is designed to gut the bill.\n  When you say ``health,'' you say anything. What is health? A sore \ntoenail? A sore knee? I mean, it is a totally gutting amendment. If you \nwant to gut the bill, then you would vote for Boxer. If you want \nabortion on demand, if you want to abort a perfectly normal, healthy \nchild at 9 months because that child has blue eyes, or is a female, or \na male, or whatever, then vote for Boxer. That decision is quite easy.\n  But, again, the health-of-the-mother issue is a phony issue. It is \nnot the \n\n[[Page S 18009]]\nissue at all. Everyone knows it. We have had this debate here before. \nWe have had the votes before. It has always been voted down. So the \nissue is, if you want to truly protect the life of the mother, then you \nwould vote for the Smith-Dole amendment because that is exactly what it \ndoes, it protects the life of the mother.\n  Mr. President, Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National \nRight to Life Committee, has prepared an outstanding, comprehensive \nanalysis of H.R. 1833. It is entitled ``The Facts On Partial-Birth \nAbortions.'' For the benefit of my colleagues, I ask unanimous consent \nthat this document be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  The Facts On Partial-Birth Abortions\n\n                          (By Douglas Johnson)\n\n       The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (HR 1833) was introduced \n     in Congress on June 15, 1995. From that day on, many \n     opponents of the bill--including the National Abortion and \n     Reproductive Rights Action League (NARAL), Planned \n     Parenthood, and the National Abortion Federation--have \n     manufactured and disseminated blatant misinformation \n     regarding partial-birth abortions and about the bill. Some of \n     this misinformation has been adopted and widely disseminated \n     by some journalists, columnists, editorialists, and \n     lawmakers. This feature summarizes key facts on partial-birth \n     abortions and on HR 1833. For additional documentation, \n     contact the NRLC Federal Legislative Office at (202) 626-\n     8820.\n       What is the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (HR 1833)?\n       The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (HR 1833) is a proposal \n     currently under consideration in Congress, which would place \n     a national ban on use of the partial-birth abortion procedure \n     (except when a doctor could show that he ``reasonably \n     believed'' that the procedure would prevent the death of a \n     pregnant woman, and that no other medical procedure would \n     suffice).\n       The bill would ban abortions that are performed by an \n     abortionist (1) delivering a living fetus/baby into the \n     vagina, and then (2) killing him or her. The bill \n     specifically defines a ``partial-birth abortion'' as ``an \n     abortion in which the person performing the abortion \n     partially vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing \n     the fetus and completing the delivery.'' Abortionists who \n     violate the law would be subject to both criminal and civil \n     penalties, but no penalty could be applied to the woman who \n     obtained such abortion.\n       What is the Status of the Bill?\n       The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (HR 1833) was passed by \n     the House of Representatives on November 1 by a vote of 288 \n     to 139. As of November 28, the bill is awaiting action by the \n     full U.S. Senate, which could occur as early as December 4.\n       The bill strongly opposed by pro-abortion advocacy groups \n     and by their Senate allies, who will attempt to amend it to \n     death--for example, by a proposed amendment to allow partial-\n     birth abortions to be performed for ``health'' reasons. \n     Legally, with reference to abortion, ``health'' is a term \n     that covers emotional ``well-being.'' Thus, addition of a \n     ``health exception'' would in practice allow unrestricted use \n     of the partial-birth abortion procedure.\n       President Clinton opposes the bill.\n       How is a Partial-Birth Abortion Performed?\n       The bill is aimed at the basic method practiced by Dr. \n     Martin Haskell of Dayton, Ohio, and by the late Dr. James \n     McMahon of Los Angeles, among others. The Los Angeles Times \n     accurately described this abortion method in a June 16 news \n     story:\n       ``The procedure requires a physician to extract a fetus, \n     feet first, from the womb and through the birth canal until \n     all but its head is exposed. Then the tips of surgical \n     scissors are thrust into the base of the fetus' skull, and a \n     suction catheter is inserted through the openings and the \n     brain is removed.''\n       In 1992, Dr. Haskell wrote a paper on this abortion method. \n     The paper (``Dilation and Extraction for Late Second \n     Trimester Abortion'') describes in detail, step-by-step, how \n     to perform the procedure.\n       Dr. Haskell wrote that he ``routinely performs this \n     procedure on all patients 20 through 24 weeks LMP [i.e., from \n     last menstrual period] with certain exceptions'' [4\\1/2\\ to \n     5\\1/2\\ months]. He also wrote that he used the procedure \n     through 26 weeks [six months] ``on selected patients.'' Dr. \n     McMahon used essentially the same procedure to a much later \n     point--even into the ninth month. (Dr. McMahon died of cancer \n     on Oct. 28).\n       How many partial-birth abortions are performed?\n       Nobody knows. Pro-abortion groups claim that ``only'' 450 \n     such procedures are performed every year. But the practices \n     of Dr. Martin Haskell and the late Dr. James McMahon alone \n     would approximate that figure, and press reports indicate \n     that other abortionists also utilize the procedure.\n       Both Haskell and McMahon have spent years trying to \n     convince other abortionists of the merits of the procedure. \n     That is why Haskell wrote his 1992 instructional paper. For \n     years, McMahon was director of abortion instruction at the \n     Cedar Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. It is impossible \n     to know how many other abortionists have adopted the \n     procedure, without choosing to write articles or grant \n     interviews on the subject. The New York Times reported in a \n     Nov. 6, 1995 news story about the bill:\n       ```Of course I use it, and I've taught it for the last 10 \n     years,' said a gynecologist at a New York teaching hospital, \n     who spoke on the condition of anonymity. `So do doctors in \n     other cities.'''\n       There are 164,000 abortions a year performed after the \n     first three months of pregnancy, and 13,000 abortions \n     annually after 4\\1/2\\ months, according to the Alan \n     Guttmacher Institute (New York Times, July 5 and November 6, \n     1995), which should be regarded as conservative estimates.\n       For what reasons are partial-birth abortions performed?\n       The Planned Parenthood Federation of America recently \n     issued a press release that asserted that the procedure is \n     ``done only in cases when the woman's life is in danger or in \n     cases of extreme fetal abnormality.'' Many reporters, \n     commentators, and members of Congress have accepted such \n     assertions uncritically and publicly disseminated them as \n     ``facts.''\n       Yet, the claim that partial-birth abortion procedures are \n     done only (or mostly) in life-endangerment or grave-fetal-\n     disorder cases cannot be reconciled with many documents and \n     reliable reports that are readily available.\n       In Dr. Haskell's 1992 instructional paper, he wrote that he \n     ``routinely performs this procedure on all patients 20 \n     through 24 weeks'' (4\\1/2\\ to 5\\1/2\\ months). In 1993, after \n     NRLC's publicizing of Dr. Haskell's paper engendered \n     considerable controversy, the American Medical News--the \n     official newspaper of the AMA--conducted a tape-recorded \n     interview with Dr. Haskell concerning this specific abortion \n     method, in which he said:\n       ``And I'll be quite frank: most of my abortions are \n     elective in that 20-24 week range. . . . In my particular \n     case, probably 20% [of this procedure] are for genetic \n     reasons. And the other 80% are purely elective.''\n       Recently, during testimony in a lawsuit in Ohio, Dr. \n     Haskell was asked to list some of the medical problems of \n     women on which he'd performed second-trimester abortions. \n     Among the conditions he listed was ``agoraphobia'' (fear of \n     open places).\n       Moreover, in testimony presented to the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee on November 17, ob/gyn Dr. Nancy Romer of Dayton \n     (the city in which Dr. Haskell operates one of his abortion \n     clinics) testified that three of her own patients had gone to \n     Haskell's clinics for abortions ``well beyond'' 4\\1/2\\ months \n     into pregnancy, and that ``none of these women had any \n     medical illness, and all three had normal fetuses.''\n       Dr. James McMahon voluntarily submitted to the House \n     Judiciary Constitution Subcommittee a breakdown of a self-\n     selected sample of 175 partial-birth abortions that he \n     performed for what he called ``maternal indications.'' Of \n     these, the largest single category of ``maternal \n     indications''--39 cases, or 22% of the total sample--were for \n     ``depression.''\n       Dr. McMahon's self-selected sample of ``fetal indications'' \n     cases showed he had performed nine of these procedures for \n     ``cleft palate.''\n       Even though this data is cited in the official report of \n     the committee, when NARAL President Kate Michelman was asked \n     at a November 7 press conference about ``arguments . . . that \n     these procedures . . . are given for depression or cleft \n     palate,'' Ms. Michelman responded, ``That is . . . not only a \n     myth, it's a lie.''\n       Reporter Karen Tumulty wrote an article about late-term \n     abortions, based in large part on extensive interviews with \n     Dr. McMahon and on direct observation of his practice, which \n     appeared in the Los Angeles Times Magazine (January 7, 1990). \n     She concluded:\n       ``If there is any other single factor that inflates the \n     number of late abortions, it is youth. Often, teen-agers do \n     not recognize the first signs of pregnancy. Just as \n     frequently, they put off telling anyone as long as they \n     can.''\n       (Dr. McMahon used the term ``pediatric indications'' to \n     refer to abortions performed on these young mothers.)\n       In 1993, the then-executive director of the National \n     Abortion Federation (NAF) distributed an internal memorandum \n     to the members of that organization which acknowledged that \n     such abortions are performed for ``many reasons'';\n       ``There are many reasons why women have late abortions: \n     life endangerment, fetal indications, lack of money or health \n     insurance, social-psychological crisis, lack of knowledge \n     about human reproduction, etc.'' [emphasis added]\n       Likewise, a June 12, 1995, letter from NAF to members of \n     the House of Representatives noted that late abortions are \n     sought by, among other, ``very young teenagers . . . who have \n     not recognized the signs of their pregnancies until too \n     late,'' and by ``women in poverty, who have tried desperately \n     to act responsibly and to end an unplanned pregnancy in the \n     early stages, only to face insurmountable financial \n     barriers.''\n       True, some partial-birth abortions involve babies who have \n     grave disorders that will result in death soon after birth. \n     But these unfortunate members of the human family deserve \n     compassion and the best comfort-care that medical science can \n     offer--not a scissors in the back of the head. In some such \n     situations there are good medical reasons to deliver such a \n     child early, after which natural death will follow quickly.\n\n[[Page S 18010]]\n\n       Is the baby already dead before she is pulled feet-first \n     into the vagina?\n       In his 1992 paper explaining step-by-step how to perform \n     this type of abortion, Dr. Martin Haskell wrote that he \n     performs the procedure ``under local anesthesia'' [emphasis \n     added], which would have no effect on the baby/fetus. \n     Nevertheless, since HR 1833 was introduced in June, many \n     critics of the bill have insisted that the unborn babies are \n     killed by anesthesia given to the mother, prior to being \n     ``extracted'' from the womb.\n       For example, syndicated columnist Ellen Goodman wrote in \n     November that, based on her review of statements by \n     supporters of the bill, ``You wouldn't even know that \n     anesthesia ends the life of such a fetus before it comes \n     down the birth canal.''\n       Likewise, Kate Michelman, president of the National \n     Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League (NARAL), said \n     at a Nov. 7 press conference, ``These experts have made it \n     very clear that the fetus undergoes demise before the \n     procedure begins. And because of the anesthesia, which is, \n     you know, something like 50 to 100 times what a fetus can \n     withstand, because it's given according to the weight of the \n     woman.''\n       However, according to testimony presented to the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee (Nov. 17) by the American Society of \n     Anesthesiologists, such claims have ``absolutely no basis in \n     scientific fact.'' The ASA says that regional anesthesia \n     (used in many partial-birth abortions and most normal \n     deliveries) has no effect on the fetus. General anesthesia \n     has some sedating effect on the fetus, but much less than on \n     the mother; even pain relief for the fetus is doubtful, and \n     certainly anesthesia would not kill the baby, the ASA \n     testified.\n       Dissemination of the false claim that anesthesia kills the \n     baby is endangering the health and lives of pregnant women \n     and their unborn children, because such erroneous information \n     may frighten pregnant women away from obtaining medically \n     necessary surgical procedures while they are pregnant, for \n     fear of harming their unborn children, the ASA said.\n       Moreover, American Medical News reported in 1993, after \n     conducting interviews with Drs. Haskell and McMahon, that the \n     doctors ``told AM News that the majority of fetuses aborted \n     this way are alive until the end of the procedure.'' On July \n     11, 1995, American Medical News submitted the transcript of \n     the tape-recorded interview with Haskell to the House \n     Judiciary Committee. The transcript contains the following \n     exchange:\n       ``American Medical News. Let's talk first about whether or \n     not the fetus is dead beforehand.\n       ``Dr. Haskell. No, it's not. No, it's really not. A \n     percentage are for various numbers of reasons. Some just \n     because of the stress--intrauterine stress during, you know, \n     the two days that the cervix is being dilated [to permit \n     extraction of the fetus]. Sometimes the membranes rupture and \n     it takes a very small superficial infection to kill a fetus \n     in utero when the membranes are broken. And so in my case, I \n     would think probably about a third of those are definitely \n     are [sic] dead before I actually start to remove the fetus. \n     And probably the other two-thirds are not.''\n       In another interview, quoted in the Dec. 10, 1989 Dayton \n     News, Dr. Haskell again conveyed that the scissors thrust is \n     usually the lethal act: ``When I do the instrumentation on \n     the skull...it destroys the brain tissue sufficiently so \n     that even if it (the fetus) falls out at that point, it's \n     definitely not alive,'' Dr. Haskell said.\n       Brenda Pratt Shafer, a registered nurse from Dayton, Ohio, \n     stood at Haskell's side while he performed three partial-\n     birth abortions in 1993. In testimony before the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee (Nov. 17), Mrs. Shafer described in \n     detail the first of the three procedures--which involved, she \n     said, a baby boy at 26\\1/2\\ weeks (over 6 months). According \n     to Mrs. Shafer, the abortionist.\n       ``...delivered the baby's body and the arms--everything but \n     the head. The doctor kept the baby's head just inside the \n     uterus. The baby's little fingers were clasping and \n     unclasping, and his feet were kicking. Then the doctor stuck \n     the scissors through the back of his head, and the baby's \n     arms jerked out in a flinch, a startle reaction, like a baby \n     does when he thinks that he might fall. The doctor opened up \n     the scissors, stuck a high-powered suction tube into the \n     opening and sucked the baby's brains out. Now the baby was \n     completely limp.''\n       Since the baby is usually not dead before being removed \n     from the womb, does the baby experience pain? Yes, according \n     to experts such as Professor Robert White, Director of the \n     Division of Neurosurgery and Brain Research Laboratory at \n     Case Western Reserve School of Medicine, who testified before \n     the House Judiciary Constitution Subcommittee: ``The fetus \n     within this time frame of gestation, 20 weeks and beyond, is \n     fully capable of experiencing pain.'' After analyzing the \n     partial-birth procedure step-by-step for the subcommittee, \n     Prof. White concluded: ``Without question, all of this is a \n     dreadfully painful experience for any infant subjected to \n     such a surgical procedure.''\n       Dr. Harlan R. Giles, a professor of ``high-risk'' \n     obstetrics and perinatology at the Medical College of \n     Pennsylvania, performs abortions by a variety of procedures \n     up until ``viability,'' but he does not perform partial-birth \n     abortions. In sworn testimony in the U.S. Federal District \n     Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Nov. 13, 1995), \n     Prof. Giles said:\n       ``In my own personal opinion, particularly when there are \n     other techniques available, that the introduction of a sharp \n     instrument into the brain and sucking out the brain \n     constitutes cruel and unusual fetal punishment.''\n\n\n is the term ``partial-birth abortion'' misleading, or is it accurate?\n\n       In his 1992 paper, Dr. Haskell referred to the method as \n     ``dilation and extraction'' or ``D''--noting that he \n     ``coined the term.'' However, that nomenclature was \n     rejected by Dr. McMahon, who refers to the method as \n     ``intact dilation and evacuation'' and (in an interview in \n     the Los Angeles Times Magazine in 1990) as ``intrauterine \n     cranial decompression.'' There are also some variations in \n     the procedure as performed by the two doctors.\n       None of the terms that the abortion practitioners prefer \n     would be workable as a legal definition. The bill creates a \n     legal definition of ``partial-birth abortion,'' and would ban \n     any variation of that method--no matter what new \n     idiosyncratic name any abortionist may invent to refer to \n     it--so long as it is ``an abortion in which the person \n     performing the abortion partially vaginally delivers a living \n     fetus before killing the fetus and completing the delivery.''\n       Beyond the legal point, the term ``partial-birth abortion'' \n     is accurate and in no way misleading. In explaining how to \n     perform the procedure in his 1992 instruction paper, Dr. \n     Martin Haskell wrote:\n       ``With a lower [fetal] extremity in the vagina, the surgeon \n     uses his fingers to deliver the opposite lower extremity, \n     then the torso, the shoulders and the upper extremities.'' \n     [Haskell paper, page 30, emphasis added]\n       In sworn testimony in a lawsuit pending in U.S. District \n     Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Nov. 8, 1995), Dr. \n     Haskell said that he first learned of the method when a \n     colleague\n       . . . described very briefly over the phone to me a \n     technique that I later learned came from Dr. McMahon where \n     they internally grab the fetus and rotate if and accomplish--\n     be somewhat equivalent to a breach type of delivery.''\n       Are the drawings of the procedure circulated by NRLC \n     accurate, or are they misleading?\n       At a June 15, 1995, public hearing before the House \n     Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Dr. J. Courtland \n     Robinson, a self-described ``abortionist'' who testified on \n     behalf of the National Abortion Federation, was questioned \n     about the drawings by Congressman Charles Canady (R-Fl.). Mr. \n     Canady directed Dr. Robinson's attention to the drawings, \n     which were displayed in poster size next to the witness \n     table. Dr. Robinson agreed with Mr. Canady's statement that \n     they were ``technically accurate,'' and added:\n       ``That is exactly probably what is occurring at the hands \n     of the two physicians involved.'' [Transcript, page 80.]\n       Moreover, American Medical News (July 5, 1993) reported: \n     ``Dr. [Martin] Haskell said the drawings were accurate `from \n     a technical point of view.' But he took issue with the \n     implication that the fetuses were `aware and resisting.' ''\n       Professor Watson Bowes of the University of North Carolina \n     at Chapel Hill, co-editor of the Obstetrical and \n     Gynecological Survey, wrote in a letter to Congressman \n     Canady: ``Having read Dr. Haskell's paper, I can assure you \n     that these drawings accurately represent the procedure \n     described therein. . . . Firsthand renditions by a \n     professional medical illustrator, or photographs or a video \n     recording of the procedure would no doubt be more vivid, but \n     not necessarily more instructive for a non-medical person who \n     is trying to understand how the procedure is performed.''\n       On Nov. 1, 1995, Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder and her \n     allies actually tried to prevent Congressman Canady from \n     displaying the line drawings during the debate on HR 1833 on \n     the floor of the House of Representatives. But the House \n     voted by nearly a 4-to-1 margin (332 to 86) to permit the \n     drawings to be used.\n\n\n    Does the bill permit the partial-birth abortion procedure to be \n utilized to save the life of the mother? Are partial-birth abortions \n                relatively safe for the pregnant woman?\n\n       Under the bill, a doctor is not subject to penalty if he \n     shows that he ``reasonably believed'' that the mother's life \n     was in jeopardy and that no other medical procedure will save \n     her life. However, many medical authorities, both pro-life \n     and pro-abortion, say that this procedure would never be \n     necessary to save a woman's life.\n       Moreover, some medical experts--on both sides of the \n     abortion issue--say that the procedure itself carries special \n     risks for the pregnant woman. American Medical News, the \n     official newspaper of the American Medical Association, \n     reported in its November 20, 1996 edition: `` `I have very \n     serious reservations about this procedure'' said Colorado \n     physician Warren Hern, MD. The author of Abortion Practice, \n     the nation's most widely used textbook on abortion standards \n     and procedures, Dr. Hern specializes in late-term procedures. \n     . . . [O]f the procedure in question he says, ``You really \n     can't defend it. I'm not going to tell somebody else that \n     they should not do this procedure. But I'm not going to do \n     it.' ''\n       ``Dr. Hern's concerns center on claims that the procedure \n     in late-term pregnancy can be safest for the pregnant woman, \n     and that \n\n[[Page S 18011]]\n     without this procedure women would have died. `I would dispute any \n     statement that this is the safest procedure to use,' he said. \n     Turning the fetus to a breech position is `potentially \n     dangerous,' he added. `You have to be concerned about causing \n     amniotic fluid embolism or placental abruption if you do \n     that.'\n       ``Dr. Hern said he could not imagine a circumstance in \n     which this procedure would be safest. He did acknowledge that \n     some doctors use skull-decompression techniques, but he added \n     that is those cases fetal death has been induced and the \n     fetus would not purposely be rotated into a breech \n     position.''\n       Dr. Harlan R. Giles, a professor of ``high-risk'' \n     obstetrics and perinatology at the Medical College of \n     Pennsylvania, performs abortions by a variety of procedures \n     up until ``viability.'' In sworn testimony in the U.S. \n     Federal District Court for the Southern District of Ohio \n     (Nov. 13, 1995), Prof. Giles said:\n       ``[After 23 weeks] I do not think there are any maternal \n     conditions that I'm aware of that mandate ending the \n     pregnancy that also require that the fetus be dead or that \n     the fetal life be terminated. In my experience for 20 years, \n     one can deliver these fetuses either vaginally, or by \n     Cesarean section for that matter, depending on the choice of \n     the parents with informed consent. * * * But there's no \n     reason these fetuses cannot be delivered intact vaginally \n     after a miniature labor, if you will, and be at least \n     assessed at birth and given the benefit of the doubt. \n     [transcript, page 240]\n       ``I cannot think of a fetal condition or malformation, no \n     matter how severe, that actually causes harm or risk to the \n     mother of continuing the pregnancy. I guess one extremely \n     rare example might be a partial hydatidiform mole. But that's \n     a one-in-a-million situation. In most cases, mothers carrying \n     an abnormal fetus, such as with Down's syndrome, anencephaly, \n     the absence of a brain itself, dwarfism, other severe, even \n     lethal chromosome abnormalities--those mothers, if you follow \n     their pregnancy, have no higher risk of pregnancy \n     complications than for any other mother who's progressing to \n     term for a delivery. [court transcript, pp. 241-42]\n       ``There is no need to perform a D and X [`dilation and \n     extraction,' i.e., partial-birth] procedure. That is not part \n     of the required teaching of the D and E [`dilation and \n     evacuation,' the technique of dismembering the baby inside \n     the uterus]. [court transcript, p. 260.]''\n       Dr. Pamela Smith, Director of Medical Education in the \n     Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mt. Sinai Hospital, \n     Chicago, told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the \n     partial-birth abortion procedure is an adaptation of the \n     ``internal podalic version'' procedure that obstetricians \n     occasionally use to purposely deliver a baby breech (feet \n     first)--but that this procedure is risky to the mother, and \n     its use is recommended only to deliver a second twin. ``Why, \n     if it's dangerous to the mother's health to do this when your \n     intent is to deliver the baby alive, that this should \n     suddenly become . . . the safe method when your intention is \n     to kill the baby?'' Dr. Smith said.\n       Dr. Smith also gave the Judiciary Committee her analysis of \n     a sample of 175 cases, selected by Dr. McMahon himself, in \n     which he claimed that he had used the procedure because of \n     maternal health indications. Of this sample, the largest \n     group, 39 cases (22%) were for maternal ``depression,'' while \n     another 16% were ``for conditions consistent with the birth \n     of a normal child (e.g., sickle cell trait, prolapsed uterus, \n     small pelvis),'' Dr. Smith noted. She added that in one-third \n     of the cases, the conditions listed as ``maternal \n     indications'' by Dr. McMahon really indicated that the \n     procedure itself would be seriously dangerous to the mother.\n       What would be the effect of adding to the bill an exception \n     to allow partial-birth abortions for ``health'' reasons, as \n     proposed by pro-abortion Senator Barbara Boxer (D-Ca.) and \n     others?\n       In the context of abortion-related law, ``health'' is a \n     legal term of art. In Doe v. Bolton (the companion case to \n     Roe v. Wade), the Supreme Court defined ``health'' to include \n     ``all factors--physical, emotional, psychological, familial, \n     and the woman's age--relevant to the well-being of the \n     patient.'' Thus, the bill with a ``health'' exception would \n     permit abortionists to perform partial-birth abortions at \n     will--even for ``depression,'' as Dr. James McMahon did (see \n     page 4). Adding the word ``serious'' before ``health'' \n     changes nothing, because it is the abortionist who would \n     determine whether the ``depression'' or other distress was \n     ``serious.''\n       Does the bill contradict U.S. Supreme Court decisions?\n       In its official report on HR 1833, the House Judiciary \n     Committee makes the very plausible argument that HR 1833 is \n     not an ``assault'' on Roe v. Wade, but rather, could be \n     upheld by the Supreme Court without disturbing Roe. In Roe, \n     the Supreme Court said that ``the unborn fetus is not a \n     person'' under the Constitution (even during the final months \n     of pregnancy). So, in the Supreme Court's doctrine, a human \n     being becomes a legal ``person'' upon emerging from the \n     uterus. But a partial-birth abortion kills a human being who \n     is four-fifths across the `line-of-personhood' established \n     by the Supreme Court. Thus, the Supreme Court could very \n     well decide that the killing of a mostly born baby, even \n     if done by a physician, is not protected by Roe v. Wade.\n       What position has the American Medical Association taken on \n     H.R. 1833?\n       On September 23, the national Council on Legislation of the \n     American Medical Association (AMA) voted unanimously to \n     recommend AMA endorsement of H.R. 1833. (Congress Daily, Oct. \n     10.) The Council on Legislation is made up of about 12 \n     physicians of different specialities, who are charged with \n     studying proposed federal legislation with respect to its \n     impact on the practice of medicine. A member of the Council \n     told Congress Daily that ``this was not a recognized medical \n     technique'' and that ``this procedure is basically \n     repulsive.''\n       However, meeting in October, the AMA Board of Trustees was \n     divided on this recommendation, and therefore took no \n     position either for or against the bill. According to an \n     October 23 letter from AMA headquarters in Chicago, ``The AMA \n     Board of Trustees has determined that it will not take a \n     position on H.R. 1833 at this time.''\n       From the perspective of those who believe that unborn \n     children should be protected from all methods of abortion, \n     what is the point of supporting a bill that would ban only \n     one method?\n       Each human being is a unique individual with immeasurable \n     worth. Pro-abortion advocates often try to dismiss the \n     significance of partial-birth abortions by observing that \n     they appear to account for ``only'' less than one percent of \n     all abortions. But for each and every human individual who \n     ends up at the pointed end of the surgical scissors, the \n     procedure is a 100 percent proposition.\n       Should Congress be in the business of banning specific \n     surgical procedures?\n       Some prominent congressional opponents of the bill to ban \n     partial-birth abortions, including Rep. Schroeder (D-Co.), \n     argue that Congress should not attempt to ban a specific \n     surgical procedure. But Rep. Schroeder is the prime sponsor \n     of HR 941, the ``Federal Prohibition of Female Genital \n     Mutilation Act.'' (The Senate companion bill is S. 1030.)\n       This bill generally would ban anyone (including a licensed \n     physician from performing the procedure known medically as \n     ``infibulation,'' or ``female circumcision,'' which is \n     practiced by some immigrants from certain countries. The \n     bill provides a penalty of up to five years in federal \n     prison. Supporters of this bill argue, persuasively, that \n     subjecting a little girl to infibulation is a form of \n     child abuse. But then, so too is subjecting a baby to the \n     partial-birth abortion procedure.\n\n\nwhy did the bill pass the house of representatives by a more than 2-to-\n                               1 margin?\n\n       In the House, the bill won support from more than a few \n     lawmakers who generally favor legal abortion. Once they had \n     the facts, a significant number of those self-described \n     ``pro-choice'' lawmakers experienced an authentic moral \n     revulsion regarding the procedure. In certain other cases, \n     the revulsion was probably more political than moral. For \n     whatever combination of these reasons, HR 1833 won support \n     from a broad spectrum of House members, including: 73 \n     Democrats and 215 Republicans (37% of voting Democrats, 93% \n     of Republicans); nearly one-third of the women in the House \n     (15 of 47), Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt (Mo.); \n     Democratic Whip David Bonior (Mi.); Rep. John Dingell (Mi.), \n     ranking Democrat on the Commerce Committee; Rep. Lee Hamilton \n     (D-In.), ranking on the International Relations Committee; \n     Rep. Dave Obey (D-Wi.), and Congressman Patrick Kennedy (D-\n     RI), the son of Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/05/senate-section/article/S18002-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18011-S18013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE ARCTIC WILDLIFE REFUGE\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I come to the floor once again to talk \nabout the appearance that I had on ``Nightline'' with the Secretary of \nthe Interior, Mr. Babbitt. In that program, which I call a debate, on \n``Nightline,'' the Secretary claimed that the development of the \ncoastal plain of our arctic for its oil potential would mean the end of \nthat wildlife refuge.\n  He referred to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which is some 19 \nmillion acres of our northern part of Alaska. It is above the Arctic \nCircle, as indicated. As a matter of fact, there are 21.2 million acres \nof wilderness in this whole area, and that area is larger than Vermont, \nNew Hampshire, Connecticut, and Rhode Island put together.\n  Of this area, in 1980, 1.5 million acres of the arctic plain was set \naside for development for oil and gas exploration, subject only to an \nenvironmental review to determine whether that type of development \nwould result in irreparable harm to our arctic plain. That is what we \ncall section 1002 of ANILCA, the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act. That 1.5 million acres was the only area in the 1980 \nbill, that dealt with over 100 million acres, that provided for any \ndevelopment in our State. The Secretary says that proceeding as was \nintended in 1980 would be the end of that wildlife refuge. That is what \nI am here to talk about today.\n  If we proceed with oil and gas exploration, as is intended by the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1995, this area will be \n\n[[Page S 18012]]\nleased. There will be bonus bids that will bring in some $2.8 billion, \nwe estimate. It will be at least that because one small area offshore \nhere, the Mukluk, brought in over $1 billion--$1 billion--in a very \nsmall area. It was a dry hole.\n  But this leasing will take place. As the exploration takes place, the \ntotal area that will be used out of that 1.5 million acres is about \n12,000 acres. That is about the size of Dulles Airport. And, after that \nexploration takes place, the actual area of development, for the roads, \nthe buildings, the rigs that will be in place for the period of \ndevelopment, will be about 2,000 acres; 2,000 acres of the 1.5 million \nwhich is part of 19 million acres total in that refuge.\n  I come to speak about this rhetoric because the administration is \ntrying to leave the impression with the American public that, if this \nleasing takes place, it is the end of this whole refuge. As a matter of \nfact, Mr. President, the wilderness area selected by the Interior \nDepartment is in the area south of the arctic coastal plain and just at \nthe slope of the Brooks Range. We call it the North Slope of the Brooks \nRange. It is not in the arctic plain.\n  You know, Mr. President, it is a very difficult thing for people to \nunderstand that this is an arctic desert. The oil exploration will take \nplace in an area which is an arctic desert. The problem comes that the \nporcupine caribou herd, which lives approximately 9 months of the year \nin Canada on the Porcupine River area, migrates into Alaska and goes \n150 miles up onto the North Slope. It is present on the plain maybe 6 \nto 8 weeks when it decides to go up there. Some years it does not go at \nall, as I will mention. But when we were debating the oil pipeline--\nthis is the area of the oil pipeline up to the Prudhoe Bay. This is the \nPrudhoe Bay development right there. It is on State land. The land \nbelongs to the State of Alaska. The claim was made 20 years ago that \napproval of that pipeline would lead to the destruction of the caribou \nherd. We call it the central arctic caribou herd. One person actually \nstood on the floor here and said that, if we got the approval to build \nthe Alaska oil pipeline, all of the caribou would die, that it would be \nthe end of the central arctic herd that lives near Prudhoe Bay.\n  Did the caribou disappear? Did the pipeline, this tremendous pipeline \nthat has brought us 11 billion barrels of oil so far--cause the caribou \nto disappear? Have they been injured? As a matter of fact, at the time \nwe debated that pipeline, the caribou herd was about 6,000 animals. It \nwent up to 23,400 animals by 1992. As we came to 1992, the development \nwas over, and really man's presence started to be reduced in this area. \nThe caribou have actually reduced in number as the number of people \ninvolved in the Prudhoe Bay area has been reduced. They are down to \nabout 18,100 this year. But that is still more than three times the \nsize of the caribou herd at the time the prediction was made that they \nwould all die if the oil pipeline was put in place.\n  The health of the caribou has very little to do with man's presence. \nAs a matter of fact, that caribou herd is a very healthy herd. I have \nbeen up there. I would be glad to one of these days bring some \nphotographs showing the caribou standing next to oil rigs, caribou \nrubbing up against the pipeline to scratch their backs, caribou coming \nup on top of the crosswalks to go over the pipeline because they are \ntrying to get away from the mosquitoes. They are trying to get in a \nbreeze, get high enough to get rid of the mosquitoes.\n  That is a very flat area--the arctic plain. It is an area that has so \nmany mosquitoes that very few animals or people spend much time there. \nIf they do, they are very heavily loaded down with mosquito dope. I \nmean real, real mosquito dope.\n  But technology is different now than 20 years ago when that pipeline \nwas developed. There is no question, as I said, that the size of the \nactual development in the arctic plain will be quite small. We are \nlooking now at the problem of what will human activity in this area do \nthat might affect the caribou that might be different from this area \naround Prudhoe Bay. The answer is nothing.\n  This will not be the end of the wildlife refuge. That assertion \ncannot be supported by any facts. It really is not only misleading; it \nis wrong. It is not truthful.\n  This herd, as I said, does not stay there permanently. The central \narctic herd stays there--in Prudhoe Bay--permanently. The central \narctic herd is a very migrating herd. Sometimes it does not go up \nthere. Our records show that in 1973, 1974, 1982, and 1988 the caribou \ndid not come into this area at all. The caribou wander around in terms \nof this whole area.\n  It is the fact that the caribou sometimes actually come over and go \nback into Canada into the area where there is substantial presence of \nthe oil and gas industry over by the Beaufort Sea.\n  Our arctic plain is, as I said, a desert. It is almost perfectly \nflat. It is treeless. That might surprise people because they see the \nphotographs that are in the brochures of all of these extreme \nenvironmental organizations saying ``save this place from \ndevelopment.'' They show you beautiful lakes and hills, trees, bear, \nand caribou, and even, one time, an elk. There has never been any elk \nup there. It is a frozen desert.\n  It has about 5 to 7 inches total of precipitation, snow and rain, in \na 12-month period. Think of that--5 to 7 inches. This ground is \npermanently frozen. Water will not even penetrate it. Whatever melts \nfrom the snow gathers in small pools. They become shallow and stagnant. \nThat is where we get the mosquitoes. It is probably the best breeding \nground for mosquitoes in the whole United States. There is no question \nthat the animals that are there, particularly the caribou, are driven \nnuts by the mosquitoes. They are very vicious. As I said, the \nmosquitoes drive these caribou so that they go under and on top of the \npipeline. They try to get away from them by getting into the breeze \nthat may be caused by wind blowing under the pipeline or over the \npipeline.\n  The wilderness area that we have is here. It is south of the 1002 \narea. When you listen to the Secretary of the Interior, it sounds like \nwe are trying to lease a wilderness area. That again is not true. It \nhas never been true.\n  This area once was the Arctic Wildlife Range. It was created by a \nsecretarial order, and that order specifically stated that oil and gas \nleasing could take place on the range subject to stipulations to \nprotect the fish and wildlife.\n  At the time we considered this enormous act that withdrew all of \nthese areas that are outlined in either blue or green or red, the \nCongress looked at all of them. And this is the only area, as I said, \nwhere the natural resources were so significant that the area was set \naside, specifically stating that it would be subject to oil and gas \nleasing. The only thing that had to happen was that there had to be an \nenvironmental study made.\n  It came to Congress not for the purpose of trying to open it. It has \nalways been open. The question is, Should Congress approve the finding \nof the Secretary of the Interior that there would not be irreparable \nharm to this area if oil and gas development took place?\n  It is 1\\1/2\\ million acres. Out of all of this area, as I said, of \nthe whole area that belongs to the Federal Government up here, some \n21.2 million acres of the arctic is set aside as wilderness. As a \nmatter of fact, Mr. President, 65 percent of all wilderness in the \nUnited States is in our State. Sixty-five percent of all the wilderness \nin the United States is in our State. Fifty-six million acres total \nhave already been set aside as wilderness.\n  In addition to that, we have 70 percent of the national parklands. We \nhave 85 percent of all the national wildlife refuges in Alaska.\n  That is the only area that Congress has ever designated as being set \naside for oil and gas development. The Secretary tries to let the \nAmerican public believe that this Senator is trying to authorize \ndrilling in a wilderness area. It is not a wilderness area. It never \nwas a wilderness area. It has never been withdrawn from oil and gas \nleasing. Oil and gas leasing was subject to this environmental impact \nstatement that was made and has been presented to Congress. Two \nSecretaries of the Interior have recognized that and recommended to \nCongress that the oil and gas leasing proceed as was intended by my \ngood friend, the late Scoop Jackson, in 1980.\n  Mr. President, I am going to come back again and again and talk about \n\n\n[[Page S 18013]]\nall the statements the Secretary made that night on ``Nightline'' that \nwere not true. I think the American public should know. And I intend to \nfind some way to be sure that cabinet officers that discuss pending \nlegislation speak the truth.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, today I take great pride in recognizing Boy \nScout Troop 7 from Topeka, KS, for 75 years of honorable Scouting \nservice.\n  If ever a troop has exemplified the high ideals of Scouting, Troop 7 \nhas. These young men have not only been of great service to their \ncommunity since 1920, but 147 of them have risen to a rank few achieve, \nthat of Eagle Scout.\n  The young men of Troop 7 have dedicated themselves to becoming \nconscientious and responsible citizens with the help of their adult \nvolunteers. The Scout oath and law instill moral uprightness and the \nprecious selflessness of duty to others, while the motto, ``Be \nPrepared,'' entreats them to never rest on their laurels. This untiring \nendeavor to personal fulfillment and service to others is a standard of \nexcellence that will challenge them throughout their lives.\n  Mr. President, it is only fitting that we honor the young men and the \nadult leaders of Troop 7 on the occasion of their diamond anniversary. \nAfter all, Scouting has only been in the United States for 85 years, \nwhich makes Troop 7 one of the oldest in the country.\n  With their record of excellence, I am confident that Troop 7 will \ncontinue to embody the spirit of Scouting for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/05/senate-section/article/S18013-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSWOMAN JAN MEYERS\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, anyone who has been to the Kansas City and \nJohnson County area during any of the last 6 election years could not \ngo far without seeing campaign signs that said ``Jan Can.''\n  The signs were referring to Jan Meyers, who, since 1985, has \nrepresented the Third District of Kansas in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives with great ability.\n  Congresswoman Meyers announced this week in Overland Park that this \nwill be her final term in Congress, and I wanted to take a moment to \npay tribute to my friend and colleague.\n  Jan Meyers' dedication to public service extends nearly 30 years. \nBefore her election to Congress, she served 5 years as an Overland Park \nCity councilwoman, and 12 years as a Kansas State senator.\n  Throughout her years in the political arena, Jan Meyers has earned a \nreputation as a public servant of great competence, compassion, and \ncommon sense.\n  During her years here in Washington, she has devoted a great deal of \ntime to fighting the scourge of illegal drugs. She successfully fought \nto ensure that operators of common carriers involved in accidents that \ncause death and injury while under the influence of drugs and alcohol \nwould face tough criminal penalties.\n\n  Congresswoman Meyers also spoke out on the need to reform welfare and \nto return power to the States well before those causes gained favor \nhere in Washington.\n  But perhaps Congresswoman Meyers' greatest sphere of influence \ninvolved issues affecting small business. Kansas is a small business \nState, and as ranking member, and now chairman of the House Small \nBusiness Committee, Jan Meyers never stopped fighting to reduce the \nregulatory and tax burdens on America's small businessmen and women.\n  I look forward to working with Congresswoman Meyers in the year \nahead, and wish her, her husband Dutch, and their family many years of \nhealth and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/05/senate-section/article/S18013-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR MARK HATFIELD\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, 45 years ago a young political science \nprofessor went to Silverton, OR, to announce his candidacy for the \nOregon State House of Representatives.\n  In the years that followed, Mark Hatfield would return to Silverton \nto announce his candidacy for the Oregon State Senate, for secretary of \nstate, for Governor, and for U.S. Senator. And each and every time Mark \nHatfield put his name on the ballot, Oregonians responded by voting for \nhim in overwhelming numbers.\n  Not only did Mark Hatfield never lose an election, he never lost the \ntotal trust and respect or Oregonians.\n  Last Friday, Senator Hatfield returned again to Silverton.\n  Only this time, he did not announce his candidacy for a sixth term in \nthis Chamber--even though he would easily have been reelected.\n  Instead, Senator Hatfield announced that he will retire from the \nSenate at the end of the 104th Congress so that he can return to \nOregon. And I might say, I had the pleasure of watching much of his \nretirement speech on C-SPAN.\n  And when Senator Hatfield leaves this Chamber for the final time, he \nwill leave behind an enduring legacy of statesmanship, leadership, \ndignity, and integrity.\n  No matter if any Senator agreed or disagreed with Mark Hatfield, no \none could ever doubt that he was standing up for what the he believed \nwas right for Oregon and for America.\n  And just as Oregonians have grown to count on Senator Hatfield's \nleadership, many Senators have also grown to count on his friendship.\n  Many of us will never forget the day when our late colleague Senator \nStennis was shot in a burglary attempt, and how Senator Hatfield raced \nto the hospital to be with Senator Stennis, and how he personally \nmanned the telephone lines, responding to inquiries about the condition \nof Senator Stennis.\n  Senator Hatfield also served his country during World War II, where \nhe saw battle at Iwo Jima and Okinawa, and was among the first U.S. \nservicemen to enter Hiroshima following the atomic explosion.\n  With Senator Hatfield's retirement, the Senate will also be losing \none of the Nation's leading scholars of the life of Abraham Lincoln. \nAnd those colleagues who have not seen Senator Hatfield's Lincoln \ncollection are now on notice that they have about a year to do so.\n  In one of the last letters that Lincoln wrote, he said that his goal \nwas not just that America be a Union of States, but also a ``Union of \nhearts and hands.''\n  That goal has also been the life's work of Mark Hatfield, and the \nSenate, Oregon, and America, are all better because of him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/05/senate-section/article/S18013-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18013-S18014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR AL SIMPSON\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, finally Saturday night another of our \ncolleagues announced his retirement.\n  Mr. President, 40 years ago, then-Senator John Kennedy wrote a best-\nselling book called ``Profiles in Courage.'' It consisted of \nbiographies of a number of U.S. Senators who took courageous positions \nin their time.\n  If a similar book was written today, I have no doubt that it would \ninclude a biography of our colleague, Senator Alan Simpson.\n  As my colleagues know, Senator Simpson returned to his home town of \nCody, WY, this weekend to announce that he would not be a candidate for \na fourth term in the U.S. Senate.\n  Again, I had the pleasure of watching about 45 minutes of his \nretirement speech to the Cody Chamber of Commerce on C-SPAN.\n  In his announcement, however, Senator Simpson left no doubt that his \nfinal year in the Senate would be no different from the first 17--from \nimmigration to entitlement reform, he will continue to courageously \ntackle the toughest and most controversial of issues, calling them as \nhe sees them, and letting the cards fall where they may.\n  Al Simpson is a man of strong opinions, but he also is someone who \nknows \n\n[[Page S 18014]]\nhow to count votes and how to get things done. As Republican whip for \n10 years, Al was a trusted member of our leadership team.\n  He made being Republican leader a much easier job--and all Senators \nwill attest to the fact that with his unique sense of humor, Al has \nmade serving in the Senate much more enjoyable.\n  Senator Simpson has served in Washington for 17 years, and although \nhe and his wife, Ann, have devoted themselves to many cultural and \ncharitable causes here in the Nation's capital. Al Simpson never forgot \nthat Wyoming was home.\n  The great Alf Landon once said that ``there are some intelligent \npeople in Washington. But there are more of them in Kansas.'' Al \nSimpson never forgot that there are also more of them in Wyoming, and \nhe has never tired of fighting for returning power to where it \nbelongs--to the people of Wyoming and our other 49 States.\n  I have long thought that Al embodies the ``American spirit'' that \nmany Americans associate with Wyoming and with the American cowboy. He \nis honest, independent, and judges people not by money or position--but \nby character.\n  Al's father also represented Wyoming here in this Chamber. And when \nMilward Simpson passed away in 1993, Al delivered a very moving eulogy \non the Senate floor.\n  I re-read that eulogy the other day, and it struck me that the words \nspoken about a father, could also be applied to the son.\n  Al Simpson said:\n\n       My father was a man who did not just take little \n     philosophies and paste them on the wall and then ignore them \n     and yet say, ``I live by that.'' No, he did live by those \n     things that he told us . . . . and one of those things he \n     told us was ``I cannot tell you how to succeed, but I can \n     sure tell you how to fail--and that is to try and please \n     everybody.''\n\n  Mr. President, Al Simpson is retiring from the Senate, but he is not \nretiring from life. He will continue to make a difference. He will \ncontinue to live by his philosophies. And he will continue to succeed, \nbecause no matter what, Al Simpson won't try to please everybody--and \nWyoming and America would want it no other way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/05/senate-section/article/S18013-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, Lady Clio Crawford was a personal friend \nof mine. I recall many great conversations with her when I was a \nstudent at Oxford. I remember in particular a wonderful dinner at \nElizabeth's Restaurant, at which we discussed all of Africa and the \nproblems of the emerging states of the continent. Having spent much of \nher life there, she was an expert on Africa. Later, when I was a \nlieutenant in the U.S. Army in Vietnam, serving in the Mekong Delta, \nshe sent me some audio tapes on which she spoke to me, expressed \nconcern about my safety, and wished me well. Her son, Tony, was a good \nfriend of mine at Oxford University.\n  Lady Clio Crawford passed away in Geneva, Switzerland, on October 25, \n1995, after a short illness.\n  Lady Clio Crawford was born Clio Colocotronis on February 2, 1925. \nHer mother came from the island of Crete and her father from the \nPeloponnese. Her family were direct descendants of Gen. Theodore \nColocotronis, who was instrumental in liberating Greece from Turkish \noccupation 150 years ago, and whose statue and name adorn present-day \nAthens. At the age of 17, Clio Colocotronis, whose family were living \nin Alexandria, Egypt at the time (her father was a banker), was courted \nby and married Vassos Georgiadis, who was a highly successful Greek \nindustrialist in East Africa and some 20 years her senior. Clio \nGeorgiadis bore two sons in Kampala, Alexander and Antony, but she \nbecame a widow at the tender age of 27 in 1952.\n  With all the energy, courage and determination which were hallmarks \nof this remarkable lady, she took over responsibility of her late \nhusband's multi-faceted business empire: This included the East Africa \nTobacco Co. which was one of Africa's dominant corporations. She \nlearned the complexities of the businesses, expanded them, and even \ndiversified in Europe to become a major shipowner. But what she \nconsidered her major achievement was bringing up her two sons on her \nown, ensuring they had the best education at Oxford and U.S. business \nschools, watching with pride as they succeeded in life.\n  In 1961, she married Sir Frederick Crawford, who was then British \nGovernor and Commander-in-Chief in Uganda. After he handed Uganda over \nto majority rule in 1961, he moved to Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where he \nbecame the head of the British South Africa Co. and was on the boards \nof many Anglo-American companies in southern Africa. Sir Frederick \nCrawford sadly died in 1978.\n  Lady Clio Crawford resided in Geneva since that time. She travelled \nextensively throughout her life. She was one of the most energetic, \ncharming, imposing and kind-hearted persons I have ever met. From her \nearly days and throughout her life, she was also very actively involved \nin all sorts of charities. She became the honorary consul for Greece in \nUganda, which was the first time a woman held this post. She was head \nof the Red Cross, and was instrumental in establishing the Greek \nOrthodox Church in Uganda. In Switzerland, she and her sister were very \nmuch the pillars of the Greek community. Lady Crawford had a close \nconnection with Oxford University in that her husband, Sir Fredrick, \nwas a graduate of Balliol College. Her sons and stepsons all attended \nSt. Edmund Hall (one of Oxford's oldest colleges), with which she \nmaintained a close association over the years. She and her family were \ngenerous sponsors of many college developments and an area of St. \nEdmund Hall bears her name. She left behind two sons, Alec and Tony \nGeorgiadis, who have charming wives--Ann and Elita--and six \ngrandchildren, three from Tony and Elita (Clio, Vassos John and \nIleana), and three from Alec (Vassos, Nicholas and Philip).\n  In tribute to this grand lady, I quote the comments sent to her \nfamily by a former vice chancellor of Oxford University:\n\n       ``I remember her as one of the most cheerful, energetic, \n     independent and altogether delightful women I have every met. \n     I always found her confident good humour and marvellous `joie \n     de vivre' infectious. . . . She never seemed to lack the \n     vigour and vitality and warm understanding which were her \n     hallmark. She was a wonderful, gracious lady who enriched the \n     life of a friend like myself. The thought that I shall not \n     see her again is a sad wrench. May she rest in peace--no one \n     better deserves to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/05/senate-section/article/S18014-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18014-S18015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO THE REVEREND DR. RICHARD C. HALVERSON\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay my respects to the \nRev. Richard Halverson, whose recent passing saddened all of us in this \nChamber. He was, for us, a spiritual Rock of Gibraltar, always present \nas a reminder of eternal values, in the midst of even the most temporal \nof debates.\n  One of the remarkable things about the life of this faith-filled man \nis the fact that he became the Chaplain of the \n\n[[Page S 18015]]\nU.S. Senate at a time when most people his age retire and go fishing or \nplay golf. At 65, Reverend Halverson undertook the most significant, \nperhaps the most difficult, task of his life--ministering to the \nspiritual needs of 100 U.S. Senators, their staffs, employees of the \nSenate and countless others who came to him for counsel and prayer. He \nfulfilled that mission with great honor.\n  I will always remember Reverend Halverson as a gracious man, a man of \nconsiderable intellect, and especially a scholar of the Old Testament \nand the Jewish religion, about which we had memorable conversations.\n  We will miss Reverend Halverson, especially in a time when partisan \nrancor seems so sharp and divisive here in Capitol Hill, and in a \nsociety where bedrock values like belief in God and respect for one \nanother seem to be at such risk. His warm presence always stood in \nstrong contrast to the trials of the moment. We have faith that he is \nin the embrace of a loving God.\n  Yet, I am confident he is praying for us still. May God bless \nReverend Halverson, and may He grant his family and many friends solace \nfrom the grief we share at his passing, and confidence that life \neternal is the reward for those who live to His will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/05/senate-section/article/S18014-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEMORIAL TRIBUTE TO DR.

All of us mourn the death of Dr. \nRichard Halverson, who served here for 14 years as Senate Chaplain \nbefore retiring last February.\n  As shepherd of his Senate flock, Dr. Halverson always brought \nstrength of faith and a wealth of patience in his actions to all, \nwhether on the floor of the Senate or to the broader national audience. \nFor 14 years, his prayers began each of our working days and did so \nwith spiritual substance, expecting from all of us the very best \nstandards of conduct, understanding and commitment.\n  I valued his friendship as well as his spiritual leadership. I will \nhold a special memory of his committed caring and the twinkle in his \neye.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/05/senate-section/article/S18015-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO THE REVEREND DR. RICHARD HALVERSON\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, in one of his books, Dr. Halverson \nwrote, ``It is foolish to say there is no God. But it is infinitely \nmore foolish to say there is and to live as though there were not.'' \nDr. Halverson's special grace was in his way of helping us to bridge \nthe gap between faith and practice. As a preacher, Chaplain Halverson \nfought against unbelief but, as a pastor, he was equally concerned \nabout hypocrisy.\n  Dick, as he was known to all of us in the Senate, loved his country, \nloved the Senate as an institution, but more importantly he loved us as \nindividual Members of the Senate. His deep caring spirit was evident in \nhis availability at all times to attend to the needs of Senators and \nour families. He knew us all and, even so, managed to love us whatever \nour backgrounds may have been. And, not only the Senators, Dick loved \nthe staffers, the elevator operators, the police officers, and everyone \nhe met in the course of a day on the Hill. No one knew more people than \ndid Dick.\n  His daily prayers in the Senate acted as a reality check for each of \nus. One morning his prayers began:\n\n       Gracious Father in Heaven, help us to keep our priorities \n     straight. In this center of power, secondary matters have a \n     way of preoccupying our attention and preempting our time. \n     Help us not to take ourselves too seriously, forgetting that \n     we are fallible human beings with many needs. Deliver us from \n     VIP syndrome which expects or demands preferential treatment.\n\n  It is these actions and thoughts which live on in our hearts and \nminds as we think of Dick. His words and love taught us much and each \nof us is the better for having known him. He was a special gift to us \nand we shall remember him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/05/senate-section/article/S18015-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-1659.

A bill to authorize appropriations for the National Science \nFoundation, and for other purposes.\n\n\n       THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today, as chairman of the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation, I am introducing the National \nScience Foundation Authorization Act of 1995. The bill provides a 3-\nyear authorization for the science and education programs of the \nNational Science Foundation [NSF]. Our economy, our quality of life, \nand our national security are increasingly dependent on our leadership \nin science and technology. Since its beginnings in 1950, the NSF has \nplayed a central role in maintaining that leadership through its \nresearch programs. In fact, NSF remains the principal source of funding \nfor fundamental research at our Nation's academic institutions.\n  While America is still doing well in science and technology, our \nleadership position is slipping. For example, while the U.S. leads the \nworld in total dollars spent on research and development, both Japan \nand Germany currently outspend the United States as a percentage of \nGNP. Similarly, a recent study by the White House Office of Science and \nTechnology Policy revealed the U.S. leads in 27 critical technologies, \nbut Europe and Japan are catching up in many of those areas.\n  There is little question that meeting these challenges in science and \ntechnology requires a strong and robust NSF. To that end, the \nlegislation I am introducing today provides $3.2 billion for each of \nfiscal years 1996, 1997, and 1998 to allow NSF to continue its efforts \nto keep America at the forefront of basic research. In a fiscal \nenvironmental in which we are looking to eliminate entire agencies, \nthis authorization bill reflects a strong commitment to basic science. \nThe annual funding is only slightly below NSF's fiscal year 1995 \nfunding level. Moreover, the bill's funding authorizations for both the \noverall agency and its \n\n[[Page S 18017]]\nmajor individual accounts correspond to the appropriations levels \napproved for NSF by the Senate in September.\n  Mr. President, of the total NSF authorization, the bill authorizes \n$2.3 billion for the research and related activities account, the main \nsource of NSF's research grants. This is roughly the same as the fiscal \nyear 1995 funding level. NSF's research programs support important work \nin advanced materials, biotechnology, global climate studies, general \nscience and math, and high performance computing. Many of the products \nand services we take for granted are the direct result of research \nfunded by NSF grants.\n\n  Within the Research Account, let me make special mention of one \nprogram: the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research \n[EPSCoR] at NSF. This program has been particularly helpful in \nstrengthening the research capabilities of colleges in States that \nhistorically have been unable to effectively compete for Federal \nresearch opportunities. EPSCoR has been so successful at NSF that it \nhas also been adopted at five other Federal science agencies, including \nNASA.\n  To allow EPSCoR to continue its important work in our rural States, \nmy bill provides an annual authorization of $46 million for the \nprogram. This is a 24-percent increase over its fiscal year 1995 level \nof $37 million. Unfortunately, when it comes to many Federal science \nprograms, my home State of South Dakota and other rural States have had \nlittle, if any, involvement--either as participants or beneficiaries. \nThese States, too, must be part of the technological revolution. In \nthat regard, the National Science Foundation, through EPSCoR and other \nprograms, has done a tremendous job of including rural States in that \nrevolution.\n  I should mention the bill funds EPSCoR out of the Research Account \nrather than its current funding source, the Education Account. This \nchange is intended to encourage greater coordination and interaction \nbetween EPSCoR and the larger research programs.\n  To further build on the successful EPSCoR concept, my bill authorizes \n$10 million a year for a new pilot program to provide research grants \nto partnerships formed by EPSCoR institutions and large research \nuniversities. This program will enable small schools participating in \nEPSCoR to graduate from the smaller EPSCoR science projects into larger \nmainstream programs by joining with a big brother research university \nlike MIT. The large schools participating in the program stand to gain \nas well. The program would enable large schools to become more \ncompetitive by combining their talent, experience, and resources with \nthose of their rural counterparts. In short, Mr. President, if \napproved, this program will help broaden and strengthen America's \nscience and technology base.\n  My bill also provides $599 million for the education account at NSF \nto help develop a new generation of scientists and engineers to tackle \nfuture scientific challenges and to ensure a technologically literate \nNation. NSF's programs support educational activities reaching students \nat all levels in South Dakota and all across the Nation. Science \neducation must be a national priority if we are to remain competitive \nin our increasingly global and technologically oriented marketplace. My \nbill's full funding for NSF's education programs indicates the high \npriority I place on science education.\n  Finally, I note that my bill authorizes $100 million for the \nfacilities program at NSF. Good science requires good research \nfacilities. The NSF facilities program provides funding to enable our \nresearch institutions to renovate old facilities and buy up-to-date lab \nequipment so our scientists will have the proper tools and environment \nto conduct their studies.\n  Mr. President, we in South Dakota are especially grateful for the \nwork of NSF. Currently, NSF is supporting more than 50 research and \neducation projects in South Dakota educational institutions ranging \nfrom elementary school to graduate school. These activities have been \ncrafted to reflect the special expertise of those schools and \nuniversities as well as the particular needs of our region.\n  For instance, NSF is supporting research at the South Dakota School \nof Mines and Technology designed to better understand and predict \nweather and climate to help our agriculture community. NSF also is \nfunding several projects in South Dakota to improve the teaching of \nmath and science at our schools. In September, for example, NSF began \nfunding for a project designed to create degree programs in science, \nengineering, and mathematics at our tribal colleges. This important \nwork must be allowed to continue.\n  Mr. President, my bill will enable these and other NSF projects to \nmove forward and to keep America strong in science and technology. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to get this important \nlegislation enacted.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I stand with Senator Pressler as a \ncosponsor of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 1995 \n(S. 1445). The National Science Foundation is an independent Federal \nagency that provides grants for basic research to colleges, \nuniversities, and nonprofit organizations. NSF supports research in the \nbasic science and mathematic areas in addition to supporting \nprecollege, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as post-\ndoctoral associates. The foundation's support for basic research and \nscience education is one major reason for our world leadership in \nscience and technology.\n  The bill authorizes the National Science Foundation to spend $3.2 \nbillion in fiscal years 1996, 1997, and 1998, which is 95 percent of \nthe administration's budget request. The bill authorizes the \nFoundation's research and related activities at $2.3 billion and its \neducation and human resources activities at $599 million each year.\n  Our authorization includes a total of $56 million for the \nExperimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research [EPSCoR] and \nrelated activities that have provided needed assistance for \nuniversities in rural States such as my State of Montana. The primary \npurpose of EPSCoR is to serve as a change agent and catalyst to develop \na competitive research base in our rural areas. The development of this \nstrong research base will in turn improve the quality of education we \nprovide to our citizens at all levels, and generate spin-off \ntechnologies.\n  The Bill also authorizes the National Science Foundation to spend \n$100 million each year for Academic Research Infrastructure. This \nactivity provides grants to universities to upgrade and improve \nresearch and lab equipment and renovate facilities. Good research \nrequires good facilities and good lab equipment. Full funding for this \naccount will help to rebuild the U.S. academic institutions to \nfacilitate the conduct of leading-edge research.\n  Finally, this bill supports the Foundation's science education \nprograms. Strengthening the math and science literacy of our young \npeople is the only way to insure their involvement in our increasingly \ntechnological world. I am especially interested in activities aimed at \nK through 12 education. I also think it is important to take advantage \nof communications technology to make our educational system more \neffective, such as the distance learning/teacher enhancement projects \nat Montana State University developed to improve the skills of teachers \nin remote areas of the Northwest. In that connection, I sponsored \nlanguage in the bill which establishes a pilot program at the \nFoundation to provide, in a competitive basis, financial support for \nStates with two or more tribally-controlled community colleges. This \nassistance will establish interactive telecommunication systems at \nthese colleges to enhance and improve their educational programs and \ncurricula. These are the kinds of activities that we need to stress if \nour Nation is to remain competitive.\n  Again, I would like to state my support for the National Science \nFoundation Authorization Act of 1995 and look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to enact this legislation during this Congress.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 1446. A bill to amend the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. \nApp.) to establish an inspector general of the Administrative Office of \nthe United States Courts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\nthe inspector general of the administrative office of the united states \n                           courts act of 1995\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto establish \n\n[[Page S 18018]]\nan inspector general within the Administrative Office of the United \nStates Courts.\n  The Administrative Office, commonly referred to as the AO, was \nestablished in 1939 to provide the Federal courts with administrative \nsupport. The office is in charge of the day-to-day operations of the \nFederal judiciary, including budgets, automation, security, and office \nspace. The AO operates on a budget of $44 million and a staff of 900 \nbut coordinates the judiciary's budget of $2.7 billion and a staff of \nover 27,000 employees.\n  While the AO employs a significant number of people and manages a \nsizable budget, it has no inspector general to promote efficiency \nwithin its programs. Many agencies within the executive branch, \nincluding those similar in size to the AO--such as the Smithsonian \nInstitution, the Corporation of Public Broadcasting, the Corporation \nfor National and Community Service, the EEOC, the OPM, the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, the Railroad Retirement Board, and the U.S. \nInformation Agency--have inspector generals which provide the American \npublic with a valuable service by conducting objective and independent \noversight of agency activity.\n  In the past, the Congress has been hesitant to require the AO, a \njudicial agency, to have an inspector general like executive agencies, \nin the effort to avoid even the appearance of encroaching on the \nseparation of powers. However, I trust my colleagues will agree that \nthe efficient and cost-effective use of taxpayer dollars is as \nimportant in the administration of the judiciary as it is in the \nexecutive branch. The establishment of an IG within the AO will help \nensure the appropriate and efficient use of taxpayer dollars without \nunduly burdening or diminishing in any way the independence of the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is not intended to be a harsh \ncriticism of the AO. Certainly, the Administrative Office, like many \nother governmental agencies, has had its share of waste and \ninefficiency. My colleagues are aware of concerns I have expressed \nabout the National Fine Center, which the AO is taking steps to \nrectify, and the Federal Courthouse Construction Program. I simply \nbelieve any bureaucracy with a large budget and many employees can \nbenefit from independent oversight. However, I am certainly open to any \nsuggestions about how this bill could be improved.\n  I want to make clear that the inspector general at the AO would have \nno authority to review and report on matters involving the Federal \ncourts' judicial decisions. Jurisdiction would be limited strictly to \nthe administrative functions performed by the AO.\n  Again, I believe this is a common sense, good Government piece of \nlegislation which will enhance the cost-effective use of the taxpayer \nresources utilized to administer our Federal courts.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 1447. A bill to amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 to provide \nfor Federal-State performance partnerships, to consolidate all \nnutrition programs under the Act in the Department of Health and Human \nServices, to extend authorizations of appropriations for programs under \nthe Act through fiscal year 1998, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n               the older americans act amendments of 1995\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I introduce the Older Americans \nAct Amendments of 1995, which is the Clinton administration's proposal \nfor the reauthorization of this critical legislative initiative.\n  The Older Americans Act [OAA] celebrated its 30th anniversary this \nyear and with it, a great number of accomplishments. The Older \nAmericans Act, enacted in 1965, was the first program to focus on the \ncommunity-based services for seniors. It articulates a comprehensive \nset of services, designed to meet the diverse needs of older persons. \nImplemented at state and local levels, these programs are critical to \nthe health and well-being of millions of senior Americans in Maryland \nand throughout the United States.\n  Now, the Congress is beginning the process of reauthorizing the Older \nAmericans Act for another 3 to 5 years. As we seek a vision for the \nOlder Americans Act in the 21st century, I believe we must assess all \naspects of the program and look to the future needs of seniors and \ntheir families. This includes examination of the core elements of the \nact, being more realistic to streamlining the scope of services that \nthe act provides, and allowing service providers to focus on improving \nthe quality of those services.\n  In an effort to expand the debate on the reauthorization of the Older \nAmericans Act, I am introducing today the administration's proposal. \nThis legislation combines consolidation of programs while encouraging \ngreater flexibility in the delivery of services to seniors. While I am \nnot in agreement with every aspect of this proposal, I do believe that \nit will contribute to the debate of this very important program.\n  I look forward to collaborating with Senator Judd Gregg, our chairman \nof the Subcommittee on Aging and Senator Nancy Kassebaum, our chair of \nthe Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, as we work together \nwith out Senate colleagues in reauthorizing the Older Americans Act. I \nam dedicated to seeing that the best of the Older Americans Act remains \nand thrives. I ask my colleagues to join me in this important effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1447\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the National Commission on Gay and \nLesbian Youth Suicide Prevention, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n            the gay and lesbian youth suicide prevention act\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Gay and \nLesbian Youth Suicide Prevention Act.\n  Mr. President, my bill is a companion to legislation introduced in \nthe House of Representatives by my friend, Congressman Martin Meehan of \nMassachusetts. This bill is a modest beginning to address a pernicious \ncrisis among our teenagers. The bill establishes a Federal commission \nseeks to identify the root causes and report on possible methods to \nprevent suicide among gay and lesbian adolescents.\n  In 1989, then Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices, Dr. Louis Sullivan, issued a report on youth suicide. The \nreport's most dramatic findings included a particularly alarming \nstatistic--nearly one-third of all teen suicide occurred among gay and \nlesbian youth.\n  This is a disturbing trend. Instead of ignoring this epidemic as past \nadministrations have chosen to do, the Commission my bill would \nestablish will devise ways to address effectively the situations of gay \nyouth in existing suicide prevention programs. It will make \nrecommendations to the Secretary of HHS on methods to curb suicide \namong gay teens. And it will expand existing research on youth suicide \nto include gay and lesbian adolescents. A full and appropriate airing \nof these issues will mean the beginning of the end of the tragic waste \nof young life in our country that the suicides of gay teens represent.\n  Although the benefits from the Commission will be great, its cost \nwill not. The Commission will use the existing resources of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. The members of the Commission \nwill not be paid. And the Commission will not be another of the \nGovernment bodies that, once established, endures to eternity. It will \nsunset 6 months after its initial meeting.\n  Too often, Mr. President, we hear stories of harassment and abuse \nwhich lead to depression, emotional problems and suicide. We cannot \nignore the obvious fact that gay and lesbian youth are subjected to \nenormous societal pressure and we certainly cannot turn our back on the \nchilling evidence that gay and lesbian youth are three times more \nlikely to commit suicide than other young people.\n  Current official youth suicide prevention programs do not address \nthis issue, and it is high time they did. We need to get serious about \nputting an end to this preventable epidemic. That is what this bill \ndoes. I urge my colleagues to support this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1448\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Gay and Lesbian Youth \n     Suicide Prevention Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       There is established a commission to be known as the \n     National Commission on Gay and Lesbian Youth Suicide \n     Prevention (referred to in this Act as the ``Commission'').\n\n     SEC. 3.

The Commission shall advise the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services and heads of other Federal and State youth \n     service agencies concerning how to include the concerns of \n     gay and lesbian youth in suicide prevention policies, \n     programs, and research.\n       (b) Goals of Commission.--The goals of the Commission shall \n     be to--\n       (1) work to include the concerns of gay and lesbian youth \n     in suicide prevention programs at the national and State \n     level;\n       (2) develop and make specific recommendations to the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services and heads of other \n     relevant Federal and State agencies about how to stem the \n     epidemic of gay and lesbian youth suicide;\n       (3) work to expand research on youth suicide to include \n     research on gay and lesbian youth suicide; and\n       (4) work to amend existing youth suicide policies, \n     guidelines, and programs to include policies, guidelines, and \n     programs appropriate for gay and lesbian youth.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to make agricultural promotion boards and councils \nmore responsive to producers whose mandatory assessments support the \nactivities of such boards and councils, to improve the representation \nand participation of such producers of such boards and councils, to \nensure the appropriate use of promotion funds, to prevent legislatively \nauthorized promotion and research boards from using mandatory \nassessments to directly or indirectly influence legislation or \ngovernmental action or policy, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n             THE AGRICULTURAL PROMOTION ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I introduce legislation \naddressing existing and future agricultural promotion programs. \nFundamentally, Mr. President, my legislation, the Agricultural \nPromotion and Accountability Act, makes some modest and common sense \nreforms to all of the existing agricultural promotion programs in order \nto make them more accountable to, and representative of, the farmers \nwho pay for the programs. These congressionally authorized programs \ncreate boards and councils, made up of agricultural producers, which \nhave the authority to assess a mandatory fee on producers to pay for \nthe costs of board or council sponsored self-help promotion activities.\n  Agricultural promotion programs are designed to allow producers to \nengage in self-help initiatives to promote their products to the \nconsumer, to enhance demand and ultimately improve the economic \nsecurity of farmers paying the assessment. It is hard to argue with \nthat basic goal, Mr. President. These programs are fully funded and \nmanaged by farmers, with oversight conducted by the Department of \nAgriculture. The boards or councils authorized by Congress collect the \nproducer funds and then conduct generic promotion activities for the \nspecific commodity by contracting out the specific advertising and \nresearch projects to private entities.\n  While some of these programs have existed for nearly 30 years, the \nmajority were created and implemented in the last 10 years. In fact, \nsince 1982, when national promotion programs collected just $45 million \nannually, the amount of money collected under mandatory promotion \nprograms has increased ten-fold.\n  These programs currently cover about 16 agricultural commodities \nincluding milk, beef, pork, eggs, soybeans, cotton as well as many \nspecialty commodities. All totalled these programs collect roughly $500 \nmillion annually from producers and processors of commodities. \nAccording to USDA, 90 percent of all U.S. producers contribute money \nfor promotion programs, either State or federally authorized. The \ngrowth in the number of these programs in the last decade is not \nsurprising. As Federal dollars to support agriculture dwindle due to \nbudget constraints, Congress has stood ready to allow producers to \nengage in these self-help efforts. I understand that when the Congress \naddresses omnibus farm legislation either this year or next year, that \nmy colleagues and I will be asked to approve additional commodity \npromotion programs for popcorn, canola and rapeseed and perhaps other \ncommodities as well.\n  But Mr. President, while the goals of these programs are truly \nadmirable, I am concerned that some of the issues raised by some \nfarmers with respect to these programs have been swept away in the \nCongressional tide to approve more and more producer-supported checkoff \nprograms. Congress has approved so many of these programs in such a \nshort period of time that we have not taken a step back to look at \noverall principles guiding these programs and whether or not the \nprograms are operating as they should be.\n  These programs are typically referred to as checkoff programs since \nthe funds that producers must pay to the promotion boards and councils \nare automatically deducted from the producer's check received for \ncommodities sold. In many cases, the checkoff is a fixed amount, such \nas 15 cents per hundred pounds of milk sold, or $1 per head of beef or \ndairy cattle sold. In other cases, the amount deducted is a percentage \nof the market value of the commodity sold. The checkoff payment is \nmandatory and essentially permanent once a majority of producers \napprove of the overall program in an initial referendum.\n  To give my colleagues an idea of the scope of producer contributions, \nconsider the annual investment of a small Wisconsin dairy farm. A milk \nproducer with a 50 cow herd, averaging 18,000 pounds per cow per year, \nwould pay about $1,350 annually for State, regional, and Federal milk \npromotion activities. Mr. President, that is a large contribution for \nsuch a small farm. Consider that a large dairy with 1,000 cows, such as \nthose in the southwest and western regions of the country, averaging \n18,000 pounds of milk per cow, contributes about $27,000 annually for \nmandatory milk promotion. Consider also that a dairyman who also raises \nhogs, replacement heifers, and soybeans would contribute to the pork, \nbeef, and soybean promotion program. Mr. President, these mandatory \ncontributions represent a sizable investment by the individuals \nrequired to pay them.\n  On the surface, these programs appear well-supported by farmers and \nothers paying the mandatory assessments. However, as I have travelled \nthe \n\n[[Page S 18030]]\ncountryside of Wisconsin, holding listening sessions in each of \nWisconsin's 72 counties each year, I have learned that, in fact, these \nprograms tend to be controversial among farmers in Wisconsin. In my \nhome State, where some counties are home to more cows than people, the \nmost controversial of the boards are the National Dairy Promotion and \nResearch Board and the Cattlemen's Beef Promotion and Research Board.\n  In the 103d Congress, when I served as a member of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, I had the opportunity to be involved in the \ncreation of new promotion programs as well as the modification of \nexisting programs. I learned, Mr. President, that the controversy \nstemming from these programs goes well beyond the beef and dairy \nprograms. In each case, Mr. President, when the Committee addressed \npromotion programs from eggs to sheep to beef, the controversy among \nthe producers footing the bill for the program was significant. In \nresponse to some of the concerns raised by farmers, the Senate \nSubcommittee on Domestic and Foreign Marketing and Promotion held a \nhearing on the beef and dairy promotion programs. The House Agriculture \nCommittee held a similar hearing on the beef, pork, eggs and dairy \ncheckoff programs in the 103d Congress. The bill I am introducing today \naddresses the concerns that have been voiced in these hearings during \nmy tenure on the Committee and since that time.\n  The concerns checkoff paying farmers have raised include:\n  The promotion programs do not provide for adequate input by,or \nrepresentation of, the producers paying for the program.\n  The programs once authorized continue into perpetuity with little \nopportunity for producer review or reauthorization. All but one of the \nexisting programs are permanently authorized by Congress.\n  In most cases concerned producers must expend their own time and \nresources to gather enough names on a petition--usually 10 percent of \nall eligible producers--in order to call for another approval \nreferendum.\n  In the case of the dairy promotion program, cooperatives are allowed \nto vote on behalf of their producers, which some farmers contend biases \nthe referendum by drowning out the voices of dissenting producers.\n  The promotion programs require all producers to pay for a program \nregardless of whether they agree with the program, whether they think \nthe program is working, and whether they spend their own money on \nindividual promotion efforts.\n  The programs far too often engage in activities well beyond those \nintended by the producers who approved the program at its initiation. \nSome producers complain that broad-scale public relations work funded \nby checkoff dollars does little to enhance demand and far more to \nadvance the political objectives of certain contracting organizations. \nSuch activities may violate the prohibition on the use of checkoff \nfunds to influence government action or policy. Last August, during the \nSenate subcommittee hearing mentioned previously, staff of USDA pointed \nout one specific promotion effort that may have entered the grey area \nof prohibited activities.\n  The programs provide preferential treatment to certain industry-\ngoverned farmer organization to the exclusion of others. Some farmers \ncontend that the ties between some promotion boards and the industry-\nlobbying organization are too tight and may create a conflict of \ninterest for those boards.\n  The programs that do provide contracts or grants to specific lobbying \norganizations may be indirectly supporting or subsidizing the \nlegislative activities of that organization. This concern has been \nvoiced by a number of members of the Senate and the House with respect \nto the use of Federal funds and grants provided to lobbying \norganizations. In fact, much time and effort has been expended in the \nSenate to ensure that Congressionally authorized funding is not \nultimately used for lobbying activities. The concerns that farmers have \nraised with respect to the use of checkoff dollars are consistent with \nthese concerns.\n  The mandatory nature of the programs and the contractual relationship \nmaintained by some of the boards implicate the First Amendment rights \nof producers who should not be required to associate with a group with \nwhom they do not agree. In fact, some state-wide promotion programs \nsimilar to the individual promotion programs addressed in my \nlegislation, have been successfully challenged on First Amendment \ngrounds.\n  Mr. President, I think these are serious concerns. The fact that \nthese programs impose an additional targeted tax on producers \npurportedly for their own good, should compel the Congress to take \nthese complaints seriously, as well. Producers initially approved all \nof these promotion programs based on very specific goals and with a \nnumber of requirements and constraints. As members of the body that \nauthorized these programs, we must ensure that the initial goals of \nthese programs are being met and that those farmers required to pay for \nthem have assurances that the programs are operated fairly and \ndemocratically within the bounds of the statute and without bias \ntowards or against specific segments of the taxed industry.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will help accomplish those \ngoals without restricting the ability of the promotion boards to \naccomplish their objectives of enhancing consumer demand for the \ncommodity. The Agricultural Promotion and Accountability Act provides \nguidelines to promotion boards and councils on the prohibited \nactivities with respect to lobbying and other activities intended to \ninfluence government action or policy. It makes some conforming changes \nto existing statutes to ensure that all promotion programs are subject \nto the same restrictions.\n  The bill addresses the concern that too much money is spent on broad \nscale public relations work and not enough on direct promotion of the \nproduct, by limiting the types of public relations works that can be \nconducted. In fairness to all producers in arguably heterogenous \nagricultural sectors, industry image enhancement activities are \nprohibited. What might be a desirable image for one segment of an \nagricultural sector, might not be desirable for other segments of the \nindustry. Since the checkoff assessments are levied equally on all \nproducers, in most cases, general public relations work with checkoff \nfunds is not an appropriate or equitable use of promotion dollars. \nInstead, all boards will be allowed to promote the image of the generic \nproduct itself, which is consistent with the goal of enhancing consumer \ndemand.\n  The bill also improves the democratic nature of promotion boards and \ncouncils by providing producers with an opportunity to reauthorize \ntheir program, on average, every 5 years. Referenda on approval or \ntermination of the mandatory promotion programs would be held \nperiodically to assure that producers continue to support the program \nin which they make substantial annual investments. During that \nreferendum, producers will also be allowed to decide whether or not \nthey favor instituting refunds of assessments to producers who request \nthem. These provisions will provide the checkoff paying producer with \nmore control over the promotion boards they fund. Additionally, \nproducers argue that if they are allowed a regular review of their \nprograms, the boards will be more accountable to the farmers who foot \nthe bill.\n  The concern about the fungibility of checkoff dollars paid in \ncontracts to industry-governed lobbying organizations is perhaps one of \nthe most difficult issues to address. It is, of course, not a new \nissue. In fact, just 3 years ago, Secretary of Agriculture Dan \nGlickman, then a member of Congress, stated in a promotion program \noversight hearing that ``Congress should not be in the business of \nenacting programs which will result in the collection of funds from all \nfarmers for the benefit of lobbying groups which may represent the view \nof just a fraction of the farmers.'' As I stated earlier, that is \nexactly what some producers contend is happening under some of the \nagricultural promotion programs.\n  To address those concerns the Agricultural Promotion Accountability \nAct creates a number of safeguards to ensure the independence of the \nboards from their contractors, to avoid conflicts of interest between \nthe board and any contractor or grantee, to ensure \n\n[[Page S 18031]]\nthat contracts are let on both an equitable and efficient basis \nproviding a voice for all check-off paying producers, and to safeguard \nagainst any checkoff dollars being used for prohibited activities.\n  Mr. President, I think the modest changes this legislation makes to \npromotion programs will go a long way to ensure the continued \nproductivity and success of these promotion boards while providing \nproducers a greater voice in how their money is spent. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support for the Agricultural \nPromotion Accountability Act from the National Farmers Union be \nincluded in the Record. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1449\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Russ Feingold,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: On behalf of the nearly 300,000 farm \n     families of the National Farmers Union, I write to express \n     our strong support of the Agricultural Promotion \n     Accountability Act of 1995. Many of our members pay multiple \n     mandatory assessments for promotion funding, amounting to \n     thousands of dollars per year, per producer. Our 1995 \n     national policy statement calls for legislative safeguards to \n     insure the use of promotion funds is controlled by the \n     producers who pay the assessments, and that dollars are used \n     to enhance producer profitability. Your proposed legislation \n     will help address several items of concern.\n       (1) It is essential that mandatory assessments are not used \n     for lobbying. Although lobbying is prohibited under current \n     law, your bill makes the prohibition meaningful by clearly \n     defining the prohibited activities.\n       (2) It is essential that producers control how their \n     dollars are spent. Your legislation ensures that decisions \n     are made by independent, accountable boards. Your legislation \n     also helps ensure that all producers have a voice, not just \n     those who belong to a specific trade association. Your \n     legislation further promotes producer control by prohibiting \n     bloc voting.\n       (3) It is essential that an independent review of funding \n     be conducted annually. We support naming the Inspector \n     General of USDA to conduct this review.\n       (4) It is essential that periodic referenda are held to \n     provide producers the opportunity to review whether the \n     promotion program is worth continuing. Your legislation \n     achieves this by specifying a referendum every five years, \n     including a referendum on refunds.\n       (5) It is essential that assessments are used for \n     activities to enhance producer price. The proposed \n     legislation meets this goal by prohibiting use of funding for \n     influencing regulatory bodies, and other purposes not \n     specifically linked to product promotion.\n       Thank you for your work on behalf of family farmers. \n     Promotion assessments affect nearly every farmer and the \n     topic always produces much debate whenever discussed by \n     producers. Your legislation is a positive step in addressing \n     many concerns.

Mr. President, I want to applaud a dramatic new \ncommitment by Glaxo Wellcome, a North Carolina-based pioneer \npharmaceutical research company whose contributions to medicine and \nbiotechnology have helped to make the American health care industry the \nmost innovative and productive in the world.\n  Glaxo Wellcome has just received approval from the Food and Drug \nAdministration for its latest drug, Epivir, an aggressive new treatment \nfor AIDS. Epivir received FDA approval in less than 5 months, but the \nadvent of this new treatment is the result of years of hard work and \nmillions of dollars invested by Glaxo Wellcome.\n  The firm also announced that it has set itself the goal of bringing \nan unprecedented three new medicines to market each year by the \nbeginning of the next century. This is an enormous endeavor. It will \nrequire threefold increase in Glaxo Wellcome's research and development \nproductivity.\n  The merger of Glaxo and Burroughs Wellcome produced an enormous \nportfolio of research and development projects. The ensure the most \nefficient integration of the two firms, the entire portfolio was \nreviewed according to rigorous standards. The resulting R portfolio \nnow includes 50 major research projects and 93 development projects. \nThese projects run the gamut from cardiovascular disease and cancer to \nthe neurosciences. Significant resources are being committed to \nprojects involving the respiratory system: anti-viral infection: the \ncentral nervous system and other areas. Together, Glaxo Wellcome's \ntotal R spending for 1996 will exceed $1.9 billion.\n  That's good news for the millions of Americans who suffer from life \nthreatening diseases for which there is currently no known treatment. \nGood news also for their families, their employers, and their \nneighbors. This massive investment in the future of American health \ncare is good news for all of us.\n  Pioneering the next ``miracle drug'' is not easy. It costs, on \naverage, 12 years and $350 million to develop just one new \npharmaceutical. Only one in 5,000 compounds tested in a laboratory ever \nfinds its way onto pharmacy shelves. And only a third of those ever \nearns full return on the vast investment of time, money, and thought \nmade to discover it.\n  Because of the costly pioneering research of pharmaceutical companies \nlike Glaxo Wellcome, American consumers have access to the next \ngeneration of pharmaceuticals and state-of-the-art medical treatments. \nTaxpayers also benefit because of the savings to be realized in future \nhealth care costs. Pioneers like Glaxo Wellcome hold our best hope for \nthe discovery of breakthrough medicines in the future. I salute Glaxo \nWellcome for deepening its commitment to the future of American \nmedicine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/05/senate-section/article/S18034-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18034-S18035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY SYSTEM DESIGNATION ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, on November 28, 1995, President \nClinton \n\n[[Page S 18035]]\nsigned into law the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 \nwhich will make a number of desperately needed changes to our Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure. I am pleased to have had the opportunity \nto work with my colleagues to pass this legislation. More importantly, \nI want to take special notice of a particular section of this law and \nthe Louisiana citizens who did their civic duty in bringing a serious \nproblem to the attention of their representatives in Washington.\n  The National Highway System Designation Act contains numerous \nspecific projects that will benefit society and commerce and, as with \nall of the legislation we concern ourselves with in the U.S. Senate, \nproves the worth of our democratic process. Included in this law is a \nprovision which I think most clearly demonstrates how important our \nsystem of representative democracy is and, hopefully, will help to \nrenew our sense of civic duty and alleviate the apathetic attitude \ntoward government that is so common today.\n  In one of the fastest growing areas in Louisiana, Ascension Parish, \nthere is a section of State Highway 42 known commonly as ``Dead Man's \nCurve.'' Unfortunately, this name truly reflects the road's history. On \nthis section of the two lane highway which curves drastically and \ncannot accommodate its growing traffic load, nearly 50 serious \nautomobile accidents have occurred in the last 4 years. When the road \nbecomes wet, as roads often do in south Louisiana, this poorly designed \nroad becomes a death trap causing numerous multiple car sideswipes and \nhead-on collisions. One particularly tragic accident last year took the \nlives of three young people and galvanized public support for the \neffort to make LA 42 safe.\n  On August 20, 1994, in a head-on collision on this dangerous S-curve, \nMandy Acosta age 18, her cousin Brett Leggette age 13, and his friend \nBrett Frederic also age 13 died. In one horrible accident two sisters \nhad lost their teen-aged children. An extended family and an entire \ncommunity were devastated.\n  When the grieving period had run its course, these sisters decided \nthat they would not simply stand by and watch history repeat itself, \nbut would become involved to make sure that this road would not take \nmore of our sons and daughters. Ms. Templet and Ms. Leggette organized \nthe community through public marches and petition drives. They \ncontacted Parish President Tommy Martinez who immediately mobilized his \nresources. Engineers Mr. Glenn Shaheen and Mr. Mark DeBossier were \ncalled in to find out what needed to be done. Mr. David Young \ncoordinated their message and worked with the Louisiana congressional \ndelegation to find the surest way to get the Government to fulfill its \nduty in protecting the lives of its citizens.\n  Mr. President, the dedicated and passionate work of these two \nsisters, Parish President Martinez, and their community did make a \ndifference. As a result of their involvement, the Federal Government \nhas now dedicated itself to finding the best way to fix Dead Man's \nCurve. I am pleased that the National Highway System Designation Act of \n1995 includes $250,000 for this problem. I am most pleased, however, \nthat Congress and the President have proven that our system works and \nthat civic duty has not lost its meaning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/05/senate-section/article/S18034-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO PAUL O. BOFINGER\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure today to \nrise to pay tribute to Paul O. Bofinger, president of the Society for \nthe Protection of New Hampshire Forests, upon his retirement. Paul has \nserved the New Hampshire conservation community loyally for 30 years as \nan intelligent and clear voice of reason and stubborn common sense. \nUpon graduation from Cornell University in 1953 and the University of \nMichigan in 1955, Paul has been actively involved in the New Hampshire \nconservation debate. Paul's profound insight and powerful influence on \nNew Hampshire environmental policy has helped to create the special \ntradition of balance and consensus building that we are proud of in New \nHampshire.\n  Over the past three decades Paul Bofinger has received numerous \nawards and honors including the American Foresters John Artson Warder \nMedal, the Nature Conservancy's Conservation Achievement Award, the \nUniversity of New Hampshire Granite State Award, and the Audubon \nSociety of New Hampshire Tudor Richards Award. Paul received a 1982 \nGovernor's Award of Distinction and was named 1994 Forester of the Year \nby the Granite State Division of the Society of American Foresters. He \nis a Franklin Pierce College Honorary Doctor of Human Letters, and a \nrecipient of the Chevron Conservation Award. Paul Bofinger served in \n1984 and 1985 at Harvard University as a C. Bullard Fellow.\n  Paul's leadership assured the success of the New Hampshire Land \nConservation Investment Program and the creation of the majestic Lake \nUmbagog National Fish and Wildlife Refuge. Under his presidency, the \nNew Hampshire Forest Society has become one of the premier land trusts \nin the Nation. During the past several years Mr. Bofinger and the New \nHampshire Forest Society have contributed greatly to the work of the \nNorthern Forest Lands Council. He has positioned New Hampshire as a \nleader in the regional effort to protect the traditional land use \npatterns of the great Northern Forest for the benefit of future \ngenerations. Through Paul's stewardship of New Hampshire conservation \npolicy, his strong commitment to the development of broad consensus-\nbased groups, and his disciplined approach to conservation policy \nthrough respectful dialog, New Hampshire's forest conservation and land \nuse process has become a model for the rest of the country to learn and \nbenefit from.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating \nPaul Bofinger on an exemplary career as a leader of New Hampshire \nforest conservation and a voice of wise moderation. I wish him good \nfortune and Godspeed as, upon retirement, he pursues new life \nchallenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/05/senate-section/article/S18035-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, it will be the majority leader's intention \nto move to proceed to House Joint Resolution 79, the constitutional \namendment regarding flag desecration, at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, December \n6. I hope between now and then we will have consent to go to that. We \nwould like to complete action on this bill on December 7.\n  I know there has been an objection raised as to consideration. I hope \nwe do not have to file cloture to proceed to this very important piece \nof legislation and that my colleagues may cooperate with us. If it \ntakes that, we will proceed on that basis. I know we have at least 60 \nvotes to proceed and I hope we have 60 votes if cloture is needed on \nthe amendment itself.\n  We can expect votes to occur possibly on the constitutional amendment \nand can expect amendments to the partial-birth abortions bill.\n  Also, for the information of all my colleagues, the schedule for the \nnext few days is as follows: As I said, tomorrow we will start at 10 \na.m. on flag burning, or debate a motion to proceed to that measure; at \n5 p.m., resume the partial-birth abortions bill. Therefore, late \nsessions can be anticipated.\n  On Thursday and Friday, complete action on partial-birth abortions if \nnot previously disposed of; resume and, hopefully, complete action on \nthe constitutional amendment regarding flag desecration.\n  Also, the Senate could be asked to consider any available \nappropriations conference reports once received from the House. We \nexpect to receive State, Justice, Commerce from the House on Wednesday \nafternoon.\n\n  And then the following week, the State Department reorganization \nbill, S. 1441, if agreement cannot be reached to activate the original \nconsent agreement of September 29, 1995, we will start on that bill on \nMonday.\n  Other items next week: Available appropriations conference reports; \nH.R. 660, fair housing exemption bill, hopefully under a time agreement \nof 1 hour. It may be that we can dispose of that this week.\n  There will be a Bosnia resolution next week. We are still in the \nprocess of drafting that resolution. We have had meetings today, and we \nhope to have additional discussions tomorrow and the next day. It is my \nhope that we can have some resolution that can be supported by a \nmajority of our colleagues. I am not certain what day next week that \nwill come up.\n  It is very likely next week there will also be a conference report on \nwelfare reform. I think we have about concluded the conference. I just \nask my colleagues, the original bill passed in the Senate by a vote of \n87 to 12. We believe we have retained most of the Senate provisions in \nthe conference, and I ask my colleagues on both sides--this bill had \nstrong bipartisan support--to take a close look.\n  Eighty-eight percent of the American people want welfare reform. We \nwill have it on the floor, we hope, next week. We hope the President of \nthe United States will sign it. In my view, it is a good resolution of \ndifferences between the House and the Senate. We still have one or two \nminor--well not minor--issues in disagreement we hope to resolve \ntomorrow, and then we hope to bring it up by midweek next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/05/senate-section/article/S18036-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
