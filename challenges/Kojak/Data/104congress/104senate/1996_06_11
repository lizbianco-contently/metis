Mr. President, there will be a period for morning business \nthis morning from 9 o'clock until 10 o'clock. I ask unanimous consent \nthat from 9:45 a.m. until 10 o'clock, I might have that 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. From 10 o'clock to 12 noon, the time will be under the \ncontrol, I think, of Senator Nickles. At 12 o'clock or thereabouts, I \nwill make a brief statement. Then there will be recess until 2:15 for \nthe weekly policy luncheons. At 2:15, the Senate will swear in Sheila \nFrahm, as a U.S. Senator, as my successor.\n\n  Following the swearing in, it is my understanding we will begin \ndebate on the budget resolution, the conference report, 10 hours, and \nvotes, therefore, are possible on the budget resolution conference \nreport or any other items that may be cleared for action.\n  We are still trying to break the logjam on nominations. I am not \ncertain we can get that done before noon today. I know we have cleared \nsome nominations. We will take those up, hopefully, between 9:15 and 10 \no'clock. I repeat what I have said many times: I do not like holding \nnominations and have not made it a practice personally. Hopefully, \nthose who have the problems can work them out either today or after I \nam gone, because there are many families here trying to make plans. \nHolding up their nominations makes it difficult.\n  Of course, personally, I am still hopeful we can clear the World \nTrade Organization legislation. At one time it was cleared in the U.S. \nSenate. All it does is to give Congress a role in the event there are \narbitrary decisions made by faceless, nameless bureaucrats in Geneva \nwhere we can exit from the World Trade Organization. It seems to me it \nis something we would want to do. It is supported by the President, \nsupported by Mickey Kantor, the former U.S. Trade Representative. In \nfact, it was part of an agreement when I agreed to support it, standing \nwith the President on the White House lawn--the GATT agreement which \nwas part of that agreement. I hope the administration would be helpful.\n  As I understand, all the holds are on the other side of the aisle. I \nwould like to complete action on that before noon today. If it is not \npossible, it is not possible. Senator Daschle had indicated on Thursday \nhe would be pleased to help. I am certain he will over the next few \nhours. If anybody has any problems with that legislation, I think if \nthey understood it--and it is not very complicated--it simply says that \nCongress should have a role, too.\n  There is a great deal of concern by people all over America who may \nhave lost their jobs to foreign competition--at least they believe they \nhave lost their jobs to foreign competition-- they are concerned about \nall these, whether it is GATT or NAFTA, all\n\n[[Page S6022]]\n\nthese trade agreements where we are exporting jobs. This gives Congress \nthe responsibility and a role in determining whether or not we should \nwithdraw from the World Trade Organization.\n  In my view, it is legislation that should have been passed sometime \nago. I understand it is acceptable to the House if we can free it from \nthe Senate. Senator Byrd has had an interest in it. He has improved it \nsome. He has an amendment, I think, that strengthens it more. It is not \na partisan issue. I hope we can clear it this morning. If not, I know \nsometimes things do not work in this place.\n  I also thank Chaplain Ogilvie for his thoughts and his prayers.\n  Between now and 9:45, I assume the time will be equally divided.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6021-5", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to join all of those in the Senate \ntoday to wish Godspeed to our distinguished majority leader and \ncolleague, Bob Dole, as he departs the Senate and embarks upon his \ncampaign for the Presidency of the United States. I do not know of any \nother event that is more important to all of us or to the country this \nyear than his election as President. I am really glad in one sense to \nsee him concentrate his full energies and attention on that objective.\n  When I think about Bob Dole's leaving the Senate, I think about when \nI came to the Senate he was already established as one of the true \nlegislative leaders of the Senate, although he occupied no elected \nposition of leadership in the Senate. It was my good fortune to serve \non two committees with him as a freshman Member of this body--the \nAgriculture Committee and the Judiciary Committee. He was not intending \nto serve on the Judiciary Committee that year either, but he was \ndrafted to serve. We did not have enough Members to fill out the ranks \non the Republican side. Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts just assumed \nthe chairmanship of that committee. It was a very highly visible \ncommittee.\n  I recall Senator Dole coming on the committee. Of course, he had been \na lawyer, a county attorney in Kansas. He brought to that committee \ngood judgment and experience on a number of issues. I can recall what I \nwould think would be referred to as an obscure bill that year that the \ncommittee worked on, which was bankruptcy reform. After a lot of \nhearings, a lot of effort to resolve issues and to get a bill reported \nout, it was Senator Dole who, when it appeared there was not going to \nbe any action on that issue, came up with a proposal that turned out to \nbe the centerpiece of bankruptcy reform.\n  It was that way on the Agriculture Committee. We would be locked in \ntough debate, arguments, differences of views based on regional \nconsiderations, sometimes party differences. The chairman from Georgia, \nSenator Talmadge, was trying to get everybody together. Time after time \nafter time it was Bob Dole who ended up being the force and the \ncatalyst that brought the committee to a point where it agreed and \nreported out legislation. That legislation would ultimately become law.\n  Senator Dole, as a member of the Finance Committee--I did not have \nthe good fortune to be a member there--but as chairman of that \ncommittee, I can recall his handling legislation on the floor of the \nSenate into the late hours of the evening with the patience and the \ncalm determination to see the bill through, dealing with the competing \ninterests, the offering of amendments, Democrats and Republicans alike, \ngetting a fair hearing on their proposals of what should be in the bill \nand what should not be in the bill. And finally, after sometimes days, \nbringing that bill to a point where it would pass the Senate and then \nultimately be enacted into law.\n  A legislative leader, in the truest sense of the word, on a wide \nrange of issues, some issues that other Senators did not want to work \non, like in the Agriculture Committee, the nutrition issues, working \nout the difficulties in determining eligibility for food stamps, for \nSchool Lunch Program participation, how much would the Federal \nGovernment contribute, how much would State and local governments \ncontribute, how much would individuals have to pay for these benefits, \nand on and on, the minutia, the tough, hard decisions. He was there to \nhelp make those decisions and to help shape a consensus of support for \nlegislation on those issues when others could not do it, did not bring \nthe skill and the determination and the capacity to do it that Bob Dole \nbrought to the challenge.\n  It was no wonder, when Howard Baker left the Senate in 1984, \nfollowing the elections that year, the Senate turned to Bob Dole and \nelected him leader. He has proven himself over and over again to be a \nconfident, fair, courageous, decisive leader, driven by character, \nintegrity, and the notion of what is good for the public interest, not \njust what is good for the party interest or partisan consideration, but \nthe general interests that serve the people of our great country. It is \nwith that kind of leadership that we have come to appreciate the genius \nof Bob Dole and the outstanding way in which he has discharged the \nresponsibilities of leader.\n\n  We are going to have a tough job. I know that some people are talking \nabout the succession, and who is going to replace Bob Dole. The fact is \nthat nobody is going to replace Bob Dole. Nobody has the capacity to do \nall the things that he has done in the U.S. Senate. It has really been \nan honor--a great honor--and a wonderful opportunity to have had the \nprivilege of serving on some of the committees he has served on, some \nhe has chaired, and to be a part of this Senate that has been led by \nBob Dole, the Senator from Kansas.\n  So we wish him all the best and know that he will enjoy many more \nsuccesses and many more triumphs in the years ahead. We are confident \nof that, and we bid him a fond farewell.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6022-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BOB DOLE\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Those of us who are partisan Republicans can only hope that \na majority of American citizens can get to know Bob Dole as well as we \nknow him.

Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes this \nmorning about a recommendation that has been made to the distinguished \nmajority leader by a group of economists. I am talking about the \nproposal to cut income tax rates by 15 percent across-the-board. I know \nthat some people will criticize this as political, but, frankly, in a \nrepresentative democracy, the whole idea is to do things that the \npeople want. I submit that if the people respond positively to this \nidea, clearly, it will have been the right thing to do. I believe \npeople will respond positively because they have been asking for tax \nrelief.\n  The point of an across-the-board cut in tax rates is that it helps to \nstimulate the economy. Therefore, it is the most productive in terms of \nproviding for economic growth, which helps all people.\n  This is the kind of rate cut that produced more revenues to the \nTreasury under the administrations of John F.\n\n[[Page S6023]]\n\nKennedy and Ronald Reagan. This is the kind of tax rate cut that has \nbeen proposed and that I submit Majority Leader Dole would be wise to \ncall for in his Presidential campaign. John F. Kennedy, of course, said \nback in 1962, ``A rising tide lifts all boats,'' to illustrate the \npoint that across-the-board tax rate cuts help everybody. It helps the \neconomy grow. Therefore, it does not matter what place you are on the \nladder of economic progress, whether in the middle, or at the high end, \nor even at the lower end of the ladder; a growing economy helps \neveryone because it provides for more job opportunities, it provides \nfor more payment to workers, more opportunities for savings and \ninvestment and expansion of the economy, which, as a result, helps \neveryone.\n  But the point that I want to briefly make this morning is that it \nalso helps us in dealing with the problem of reducing the Federal \nbudget deficit and providing for the needs of Government. There is a \nparadox in economics that provides that, up to a certain point, \nactually reducing tax rates can provide more revenues to the Treasury. \nIn the brief minute or two I have this morning, let me address that a \nlittle bit more.\n  Obviously, there are two tax rates that produce no tax revenues to \nthe Treasury. One is 0 and the other is 100. The point of mentioning \n100 is to make the point that you can tax people too much--to the point \nthat they will stop doing the things that produce the revenue that \nwould then come into the Treasury. When you have tax rates of 90 \npercent or 80 percent or 70 percent, even, people find other things to \ndo with their money. Either they do not work as hard and generate the \nincome, or they find ways to shelter that income or defer it so that \nthey do not have to pay taxes. The result is that tax increases do not \nproduce the revenues they are projected to produce. That fact is true \nof the 1993 Clinton tax increase. People just changed their behavior as \na result of the increased taxes.\n  The same thing is true when tax rates are cut. When John F. Kennedy \ndid it and when Ronald Reagan did it, revenues to the Treasury \nincreased dramatically. It is like having a weekend sale. The merchant \ndoes not do this to lose money when he reduces the price on his goods. \nHe reduces the price on the goods in order to attract more people to \nbuy more goods so that even though he is making less per item, he makes \nfar more in gross terms. That is exactly what happens when the \nGovernment reduces marginal tax rates, and what economists predict \nwould happen if there were an across-the-board 15-percent tax reduction \nin our income tax rate.\n  Under the Reagan administration, Mr. President, not only did interest \nrates fall as a result of the tax rate cut, but our economy grew for \nthe longest sustained period in the peacetime history of the United \nStates and, importantly, revenues to the Treasury increased between $60 \nbillion and $80 billion a year. In the John F. Kennedy administration, \nincome tax rates were reduced from a range of 20 to 91 percent to a \nrange of 14 to 70 percent. Revenues to the Treasury rose 66 percent by \n1969. In the States it was the same thing. During former Governor \nDuPont's administration in Delaware, in 1979, the top rate was cut from \n19.8 percent to 7.1 percent. By 1993, State revenues had doubled and \nemployment increased by 36 percent. Welfare caseloads fell by 40 \npercent.\n  The point I am trying to make here is really very simple. In this \ntime when we are all focused on deficit reduction, there are a lot of \npeople who are deathly afraid of reducing tax rates on the assumption \nthat it will reduce revenues to the Treasury. In fact, they even \npropose increasing tax rates. But the fact of the matter is that at \nleast certain kinds of rate reductions--and this certainly includes \nacross-the-board marginal income tax rate reductions--have resulted in \nincreased revenues to the Treasury every time they have been \naccomplished.\n  Those who say that we cannot afford a tax cut if we are serious about \nbalancing the budget seem to view the economy as a zero-sum game. It \nis, in my view, a very cynical view that seeks to divide people, \nbaiting them with envy and greed; no one can ever do better unless \nsomeone else does worse. It is like trying to divide a pie into ever \nmore slices, satisfying no one in the process.\n  Some of us think that we should try to make every American better \noff. We want to grow the economy--bake a bigger pie--so that all \nAmericans can do better. That is what happened during the Reagan years. \nI noted some of the benefits of the Reagan tax cuts earlier in my \nremarks, but other good things happened as well. Real median family \nincome grew every year but one between 1982 and 1989, rising $4,564 or \n12.6 percent. Inflation virtually disappeared by 1986, protecting all \nAmericans, particularly senior citizens on fixed incomes.\n  And for those who suggest that it was the wealthiest who benefited \nmost from tax cuts, I would point out that from 1981 through 1988, the \nshare of all income taxes paid by the top 1 percent of all taxpayers \nrose each and every year from a low of 17.89 percent to a high of 27.58 \npercent.\n  The high-tax policies of the 1990's have had just the opposite \neffect. Real median family income has declined $2,108 or 5.2 percent. \nSince the beginning of 1995, the economy has only grown at a yearly \nrate of 1.6 percent. More than a third of the new jobs created have \ngone, not to people just entering the work force or getting off of \nwelfare, but to people who are taking an extra job just to make ends \nmeet. Interest rates, which declined during most of 1995, are rising \nagain after President Clinton vetoed the balanced budget and tax relief \npackage that Congress sent him.\n  Until Congress forced President Clinton to get serious about limiting \nFederal spending last year, deficits were forecast at $200 billion a \nyear for the foreseeable future--despite record high taxes. What that \nproves is that sluggish economic growth and overspending, not a lack of \nrevenue, are the real causes of the Nation's deficit problem.\n  Mr. President, I would note that revenues as a percentage of gross \ndomestic product [GDP] have actually fluctuated around a relatively \nnarrow band--18 to 20 percent of GDP--for the last 40 years. Revenues \namounted to about 19 percent of GDP when the top marginal income tax \nrate was in the 90 percent range in the 1950's. They amounted to just \nunder 19 percent when the top marginal rate was in the 28 percent range \nin the 1980's. Why the consistency? Because tax rate changes have a \ngreater effect on how well or how poorly the economy performs than on \nthe amount of revenue that flows to the Treasury relative to GDP.\n  In other words, how Congress taxes is more important than how much it \ncan tax. The key is whether tax policy fosters economic growth and \nopportunity, measured in terms of GDP, or results in a smaller and \nweaker economy. Nineteen percent of a larger GDP represents more \nrevenue to the Treasury and is, therefore, preferable to 19 percent of \na smaller GDP.\n  Mr. President, I want to conclude by contrasting the proposed across-\nthe-board income tax rate cut with some of the other tax cut proposals \nthat have been offered. As Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform \nsaid recently, paraphrasing Mae West, ``All tax cuts are good tax cuts, \nand even bad tax cuts are good tax cuts.'' In other words, just about \nanything we do to leave more money in people's pockets is a good thing.\n  I very strongly supported the $500-per-child tax credit that was in \nthe Balanced Budget Act last year. I cosponsored the proposal with \nCongressman Frank Wolf of Virginia when I served in the House of \nRepresentatives with him in 1994. I would also support President \nClinton's proposed education credit. But the $500-per-child credit and \nthe education credit, unlike the proposed 15-percent across-the-board \nrate cut, would help only families with children or those in pursuit of \na college education.\n  The benefit of the across-the-board approach is that it reaches out \nto all Americans. Everyone would benefit. It says to the American \npeople that we trust them to spend their money in ways that are best \nfor themselves and their families. It would allow people to keep more \nof every dollar earned from their extra effort in the work place--no \nmatter what kind of work they do--and from their extra investment--no \nmatter what kind of investment they make. The broad nature of the tax \ncut,\n\n[[Page S6024]]\n\napplying to all forms of work and investment, ensures that effort and \ncapital are steered to the most productive activities in the economy \ninstead of those activities that the Government deems most important \nthrough targeted tax credits or deductions.\n  It is also the fairest way to provide tax relief. Everyone would be \ntreated the same; tax rates would be cut 15 percent across the board, \nboosting take-home pay and relieving a major source of anxiety among \npeople with middle and low incomes.\n  Notably, a 15-percent rate cut would take revenues as a share of GDP \nback to where they were before Clinton took office--to 19.2 percent \nfrom the current 20.4 percent--effectively repealing the Clinton tax \nincrease.\n  Therefore, I think it would be a very wise thing for Majority Leader \nBob Dole in his quest for the Presidency--and, frankly, for President \nBill Clinton, as he seeks reelection--to embrace the concept that the \nAmerican people could not only do well individually as a result of a \nreduction in income tax rates, but also that this would help to \nstimulate the economy and, ironically, or paradoxically, as I said, end \nup providing more revenues to the Treasury to help us with deficit \nreduction and the financing of all of the important things that we want \nto finance as a result of the Federal Government's efforts.\n  Mr. President, I hope that as this debate continues, we will be able \nto discuss the concept of tax rate reductions. I hope to cosponsor \nlegislation to that effect, and I hope we can begin the debate with the \nAmerican people so that a consensus can be developed and, as a result \nof this election, we will have a mandate to reduce marginal income tax \nrates across the board.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6022-4", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REPUBLICAN PROPOSAL ON MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS AND THE HEALTH \n                         INSURANCE REFORM BILL\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, yesterday, House and Senate Republicans \nannounced a compromise on medical savings accounts. In reality, this \ncompromise is a capitulation to House Republicans who are more \ninterested in creating an issue and serving a special interest \nconstituency than in passing a bill.\n  Medical savings accounts have become the Trojan horse that could \ndestroy health insurance reform.

But the House Republican leadership has \nsaid that it will be their way or no way. As Majority Leader Armey said \non Sunday, ``I will not give up medical savings accounts,'' and he \ndared the President to veto the bill. The latest proposal clearly \nreflects this partisan strategy.\n  The Republican leadership pretends their proposal is a fair attempt \nto deal with concerns about medical savings accounts. But it is nothing \nof the kind. Under their proposal, medical savings accounts could be \nsold to all small businesses and the self-employed immediately. This \nopens MSA's to a massive market consisting of more than 40 million \nworkers--one-third of the Nation's entire labor force. This is hardly a \ncontrolled, limited test.\n  Even more serious, experts agree that the small business sector of \nthe health insurance market is the most vulnerable to the disruption \nthat medical savings accounts would cause. The Joint Tax Committee \nconcluded that sales of medical savings accounts would be concentrated \nin small- and medium-sized firms.\n  The proposal would clearly go beyond the bounds of what is \nacceptable, even if it stopped there. But it does not. After 3 years in \nwhich medical savings accounts are sold to this vast market, the \naccounts would be expanded to everyone. Only if both the House and \nSenate voted to stop the expansion would it be prevented. This is not a \ntest. It is a travesty.\n  The great danger of medical savings accounts is that they are likely \nto raise health insurance premiums through the roof and make insurance \nunaffordable for large numbers of citizens. They will discourage \npreventive care and raise health care costs. They are a multibillion-\ndollar tax giveaway to the wealthy at the expense of working families \nand the sick. Their cost could balloon the deficit by tens of billions \nof dollars.\n  The most troubling aspect of medical savings accounts is the risk \nthat they will destroy the health insurance pool, and price \nconventional insurance out of the reach of most American families. \nMedical savings accounts will raise premiums for the vast majority of \nAmericans--especially those who are sick and need coverage the most--by \nsiphoning the healthiest people out of the insurance pool. As premiums \nrise for everyone else, more and more working families will be forced \nto drop comprehensive coverage. In the words of the Congressional \nBudget Office, medical savings accounts ``could threaten the existence \nof standard health insurance.'' Mary Nell Lenhardt, senior vice \npresident of Blue Cross and Blue Shield concluded that MSA's destroy \n``the whole principle of insurance.''\n  The leading proponents of medical savings accounts are insurance \ncompanies like the Golden Rule Co., which have been the worst abusers \nof the current system. The strongest opponents of medical savings \naccounts are organizations representing working families, senior \ncitizens, consumers, and the disabled, who have the most to lose if the \ncurrent system of comprehensive insurance is destroyed. We know whose \nvoice should be heard when Congress decides this issue--not the voices \nof greedy special interests, but the voices of those who depend on \nadequate insurance to get the care they need at a price they can \nafford.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill passed the Senate by a bipartisan vote of \n100 to 0, without medical savings accounts. It passed unanimously, \nbecause it contained the noncontroversial, important insurance reforms \nthat everyone agreed on. The American people deserve to see those \nreforms enacted, not jeopardized by the last-minute addition of a \npartisan poison pill.\n  House Republicans should not turn a bipartisan bill that could be \npassed by both Houses today and signed by the President tomorrow into \njust another election year issue. The American people deserve a fair \ncompromise on this highly controversial issue, and I continue to be \nhopeful that we can find a satisfactory compromise to save this needed \nbill.\n  To those who genuinely believe that medical savings accounts offer an \nimprovement in the health care system, I say let us work together to \ndevise a fair test of the concept that will not put millions of \nAmerican families at risk. The American people's hopes for insurance \nreform should not be held hostage to a partisan, special interest \nagenda.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is difficult, if not impossible, to \nadequately address the congressional career of our departing majority \nleader in a 5-minute floor statement. His accomplishments in his 35 \nyears as a Congressman and Senator--his successes achieved while \nserving 11 years as Republican leader--could fill volumes.\n  Indeed, hours could be spent rehearsing Bob Dole's impressive record: \nHis heroism in World War II; his early political career in the Kansas \nHouse of Representatives, followed by his successes here in Washington; \nhis efforts\n\n[[Page S6025]]\n\nin 1964 to secure passage of the Civil Rights Act; his historic work \nwith Senator Moynihan in 1983 to save the Social Security trust fund; \nhis engineering the vote in 1991 to authorize U.S. forces to turn back \nSaddam Hussein's tyranny in the Middle East; his support for Kemp-Roth \nand the 22-percent reduction in income taxes that ushered America into \nthe longest peacetime economic expansion in history; his staunch stand \nagainst President Clinton's 1993 record-setting $241 billion tax \nincrease.\n  These are only a few of the milestones in Bob Dole's journey from \nmodest beginnings in America's heartland to his noble objective today. \nTime will not permit us to go beyond a few random milestones. But then \nagain, Mr. President, the truth is that the greatest leaders need the \nleast amount of praise. They have written their stories in the hearts \nand minds of the people they serve.\n  Senator Bob Dole has done just that.\n  His story is one of courage, persistence, character, discipline, and \ndetermination--the determination to overcome odds that would have \nvanquished a lesser individual. He is a man of deep convictions and \nproven abilities. And everyone who has had the opportunity to serve \nwith him understands that just as solid as his past record, is his \nvision for the future. He has outlined that vision in absolute terms. \nAnd with Bob Dole there are no surprises. As long as I have known him, \nhis words have been exceeded by his deeds.\n  I believe that at the center of Bob Dole's vision is his economic \nmessage, that we ``deal with the deficit, and * * * couple that with \ntax cuts.'' Toward this end, Senator Dole is both tenacious and \npragmatic. He knows the correlation between low taxes and economic \ngrowth, and he has proposed serious tax cuts.\n  Bob Dole has been an effective leader during a time when this body \naddressed some of the most critical issues in history: The need for a \nbalanced budget amendment; the need to strengthen and preserve \nMedicare; the need to provide effective, portable, and affordable \nhealth care coverage for Americans; the need to guarantee the future of \nSocial Security; the need to keep a strong defense--a defense marked by \nhigh morale and the best, most effective materiel available. He \nunderstands these issues intimately--as well as anyone--and he knows \nwhat must be done to see that these need are met.\n  Mr. President, I will miss Bob Dole. And though I wish him all the \nbest in his new endeavors, I will miss his daily leadership here on the \nSenate floor. I will miss his quick wit; his sense of humor. I will \nmiss his deliberate style, and his uncanny ability to turn assertive \nand aggressively intellectual into a cohesive team.\n  On a personal note, I am grateful for the chance I have had to serve \nwith Bob Dole. I am grateful for our friendship, for our years working \ntogether on this floor. Like other great majority leaders who have gone \nbefore, Senator Dole leaves his mark on this institution. As the \nCongressional Quarterly recently pointed out, `` * * * as majority \nleader, [Bob Dole] proved a point that badly needed proving * * *. The \nSenate could be led.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6024-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6025-S6026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITIES\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to urge action to foster \npublic/private partnerships for wastewater treatment facilities. Today, \nFederal regulations and the tax code inhibit the ability of State and \nlocal governments to create public/private partnerships. By getting \nWashington out of the way, local governments can acquire the much \nneeded freedom to better manage competing demands for scarce \ngovernmental resources, and to make infrastructure and servicing \ndecisions that are best for their citizens and the environment.\n  What, my colleagues might ask, are public/private partnerships, and \nwhy do they make good sense for wastewater treatment?\n  The answer is that public/private partnerships are voluntary, \ncooperative arrangements between a State or local government and a \nprivate sector entity whereby that private sector entity agrees to \nperform a public purpose service that would otherwise require the \ngovernment to perform as well as pay for the service. In the wastewater \ntreatment context, for example, it involves a private entity building, \nimproving, maintaining, and operating, under long-term lease or as \nowner, sewage treatment plants. The private entity invests private \nsector capital to build or upgrade a plant to meet Clean Water Act \nstandards and other legal requirements. The State or local government \nand the Federal Government are spared the need to spend scarce public \nfunds on these plants, while retaining the ability and authority to \nensure compliance with all laws and reliable, fairly priced service to \ntheir citizens.\n  Such public/private partnerships cut costs and improve services. The \nprivate owner/operator is held accountable by local government to the \ncitizens it services, to ensure that it maintains quality service and \ncompetitive pricing. Studies have shown that private operation of \npublic purpose facilities can result in a savings to State and local \ntaxpayers of between 16 and 77 percent because of the superior \nexpertise and specialization of private firms as well as the built-in \nincentives that are created through competition. As EPA has recognized, \nprivate companies often can also construct, improve, and maintain \nfacilities more cost effectively than can the government by taking \nadvantage of economies of scale and cost-reducing advances in \ntechnology long before their public counterparts. Transferring a \nwastewater treatment facility to a private entity can also generate \ncash for local governments to use to finance other necessary \nimprovement projects. Furthermore, if impediments to these and other \npublic/private partnerships were removed, it is estimated that as much \nas $7.7 billion per year in new revenues could be generated through \nFederal income taxes paid by the private owners of facilities that \nwould be exempt under public ownership.\n  In addition to these fiscal considerations, public/private \npartnerships in the wastewater treatment area also further \nenvironmental goals that might otherwise be indefinitely delayed. EPA \nestimates that existing and additional publicly owned treatment works \nand other wastewater infrastructure needs will require approximately \n$137 billion in capital investment over the next 20 years to comply \nwith Clean Water Act requirements. Even the most optimistic scenarios \ngive no reason for blithe confidence that such enormous sums will be \nreadily available from Federal or State and local treasuries. Given \nthat qualified, experienced private companies can finance, build, own \nand operate wastewater treatment facilities in a cost-effective and \nreliable manner, we should take advantage of this opportunity to \nencourage State and local governments to look to the private sector to \nmeet the needs of their communities, use scarce dollars to meet other \npressing needs, and simultaneously achieve the environmental goals of \nthe Clean Water Act.\n  In light of these benefits of public/private partnerships for \nwastewater, one might ask: What's the problem; why have they not gone \nforward in more of the many communities that see them as desirable; and \nwhy is legislation needed?\n  Federal legislation is needed because three aspects of current law \neither impede or fail to provide adequate incentives and certainty for \nthese partnerships.\n  First, Federal regulations discriminate against private entities \nowning public purpose wastewater treatment works by denying them the \ndomestic sewage exemption available to a public owned treatment work \n[POTW] under the Clean Water Act. It is impossible for a private entity \nto own and operate a plant under a partnership agreement unless that \nplant is considered a POTW.\n  Second, there is no Federal statutory assurance that local \ngovernments may transfer existing treatment plants to private firms \nwithout having to pay back to the Federal Government the Federal grant \nmoney originally used to build or improve the plant. The Clean Water \nAct contains no such requirement, but Federal regulations require total \nrepayment for transfers of wastewater and other infrastructure to a \nprivate entity. Recognizing the counterproductive effects of those \nrequirements, Presidents Bush and Clinton issued Executive order \nrequiring only\n\n[[Page S6026]]\n\npartial payback for certain wastewater plant transfers. Legislation is \nneeded to address this issue in law and provide certainty to \ncommunities for planning.\n  Finally, the Tax Code also hinders private investments in wastewater \ntreatment facilities. In order to stimulate public/private partnerships \nfor wastewater treatment, it is essential to ensure that Federal tax \nprovisions do  not  discourage  private  sector  in-vestment and long-\nterm operation of treatment plants. The changes to the Tax Code I have \nin mind are appropriate for wastewater treatment facility public/\nprivate partnerships because these transactions will not alter the \noriginal public purposes served by wastewater treatment facilities--\nproviding wastewater services to communities. I would be delighted to \nprovide my colleagues with details of these important changes.\n  Legislative initiatives seeking to address some of these problems \nhave been undertaken, but they are either trapped in a more \ncomprehensive bill or address a broad array of public/private \npartnerships extending well beyond wastewater treatment. Moreover, none \nof the initiatives thus far addresses the significant disincentives \ncreated by provisions of the Tax Code.\n  The House has taken steps to address some of these points. The Clean \nWater Act Amendments of 1995, H.R. 961, passed by the House a year ago, \nincludes provisions that statutorily define public owned treatment \nworks so that regulations are based on the purpose and actual \noperations of a wastewater treatment facility rather than the identity \nof its owner. It would provide the legal certainty necessary for State \nand local governments to transfer wastewater treatment facilities to \nqualified private sector companies. In addition, it provides for a \ngrant repayment approach whereby the State and local governments are \nable to recover their investment in the wastewater treatment facility, \nand then are only required to repay the undepreciated portion of any \nFederal grants. While the House provision on grant repayment is a step \nin the right direction, I believe that the Federal-aid Facility \nPrivatization Act, S. 1063, of which I am a cosponsor, takes a better \napproach to the difficult problem faced by municipalities that are \nconfronted with deteriorating infrastructure of all kinds, obsolete \ntechnology, tougher regulatory requirements, and a shortage of funds to \nfinance and operate the wide variety of essential infrastructure \nprojects that need improvement. S. 1063 improves on the House grant \nrepayment provision by allowing total forgiveness of those grants. The \nlocal governments are really the best ones to decide how to use the \nmoney the Federal Government has given them for public purposes.\n  Mr. President, I would hope that my colleagues will consider this \nmatter carefully, and that we can get together and do it soon. It \nshould be a win-win for everyone. Removing the Federal obstacles to \npublic/private partnerships for wastewater treatment does not cut \ngovernment service, it only cuts government restrictions and burdens--\nsomething we in America need to be doing. Doing so will also save \nmoney, yield environmental benefits, and serve as a pilot for similar \nchallenges by fostering an innovative, market-based approach without \nincreasing the burden on State and local governments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6025-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FISCAL YEAR 1997 BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, soon the Senate will act on the conference \nreport on the fiscal year 1997 budget resolution. I had hoped that the \nSenate could have passed this conference report by today, but final \naction will occur soon.\n  When the Senate passes the fiscal year 1997 budget resolution, it \nwill be doing important work because no policy is more important to the \neconomic future of all Americans, and particularly to the future of our \nchildren, than a balanced budget.\n  We will also be fulfilling our promise to the American people to \nbalance the budget by the year 2002. I am proud of our achievement in \nkeeping our promise to the American people and I am proud of this \nbudget.\n  The fiscal year 1997 budget resolution balances the Federal budget in \n6 years.\n  It reduces overall Federal spending by more than $700 billion over \nthe next 6 years.\n  It provides family tax relief of $122 billion for a $500-per-child \ntax credit to help America's working families.\n  It provides for real welfare reform.\n  And it would prevent the Medicare program from pending bankruptcy. \nThe Medicare trustees reported last week that Medicare is going broke \nmore quickly and in this budget we save Medicare from bankruptcy in the \nyear 2001.\n  That's why this is a good conference agreement. It represents some \ncompromises between the House and the Senate. No one got everything \nthey wanted. But it's the right budget for now and for putting us on \nstrong course for the next century.\n  Mr. President, it is no small accomplishment that all of us now agree \nthat the budget should be balanced by the year 2002. That's a big \nchange from this time last year when we were debating the budget. Now \nit's not just Republicans saying it, but all of us, from Republicans to \nblue dog Democrats to the President. That in itself is good news for \nAmerica.\n  But we're not there yet. Last year we passed the first balanced \nbudget in a generation. But President Clinton vetoed it.\n  I hope all Senators will support this budget resolution to finally \nget the job done. This budget will help define for the American people \nwhich of us are for more Washington spending and which of us are for \nless Washington spending; which of us are for more taxes and which of \nus are for less taxes. And most importantly, which of us are willing to \ndo what's necessary to stop the stranglehold that the deficit places on \nour economic future.\n  Some say deficits don't matter. But the fact is that the Federal \nbudget deficit is like a tax hike on working families.\n  The deficit drives up interest rates--and not by a little but by a \nlot. It is a stealth tax that every family with a home, every father \nand mother with a child in college, every young person who buys a car \nmust pay, and pay, and pay.\n  What does this stealth tax cost in dollars? Over $36,000 on a typical \nhome mortgage. More than $1,400 on an ordinary student loan. Nearly \n$700 on a typical car loan.\n  Remember that in 1994, the Federal Government spent $203 billion in \ninterest on the Federal debt--more than it spent on education, job \ntraining, public works, and child nutrition combined. In 1994, \nAmericans paid an average of $800 per person in taxes just to service \ninterest on the debt--again, not to pay off the debt or even to reduce \nthe debt, just to pay the interest on the debt.\n  We simply cannot continue to mortgage America's future. If we \ncontinue current tax and spending policies, future generations will be \nsaddled with effective tax rates of more than 80 percent.\n  Mr. President, let's do what's right. Let's pass the fiscal year 1997 \nbudget resolution. Let's do everything we can this year to preserve the \nAmerican dream of economic security for future generations of \nAmericans. Our children and our grandchildren deserve no less from us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Audrey Tayse Haynes, a fellow Kentuckian, is a distinguished \ncommunity and business leader. She currently serves as the executive \ndirector of Business and Professional Women U.S.A. and the National \nFederation of Business and Professional Women's Foundation.\n  Audrey's credentials are outstanding and her background in education \nis exemplary. Aside from receiving her bachelors degree and her masters \ndegree in social work from two of Kentucky's finest institutions of \nhigher education, Spalding University and the University of Kentucky, \nAudrey served as the executive director of the Kentucky Literacy \nCommission from 1989 to 1993. In addition, she has served as a member \nof both the Kentucky State Board for Elementary and Secondary Education \nand the National Association of Literacy Directors. She has also \nreceived the honor of being a distinguished recipient of the Martha \nWilkinson Education Award.\n\n[[Page S6028]]\n\n  Audrey Tayse Haynes has made significant contributions to the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky through her tenure as director of human \nresource development for the Kentucky Department of Mental Health and \nRetardation, as director of prevention and training programs at \ntraining and development resources and as a chemical dependency \ncounselor. The combination of Audrey's background in education and \nhuman services with her excellent leadership ability make her an ideal \ncandidate for the National Institute of Literacy Advisory Board. I \nwholeheartedly support this nomination and urge my colleagues to vote \nto confirm this deserving nominee. I thank the Chair and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6026-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will not make a unanimous-consent request, \nbut I will just say, again, a word about the WTO modification, the \nWorld Trade Organization.\n  As I indicated earlier this morning, it seems to me it is not a \npartisan measure. It just gives Congress some input, some authority and \nsome responsibility. We know the American people are concerned about \njob loss, about exporting jobs and about all these international \nfaceless, nameless bureaucrats who make decisions that might impact on \ntheir job. So it occurred to me the Congress should have some say, and \nwe should be able to initiate withdrawal from the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  I think if we go back and look at the past, we will find that most \nPresidents are reluctant to do that, regardless of party. So this would \ngive Congress, Democrats and Republicans--probably working together--a \nright to initiate withdrawal from the World Trade Organization. To me, \nthose who voted against NAFTA or GATT--this pertains only to GATT, the \nWorld Trade Organization--but this would be sending a very strong \nsignal.\n  It would also, I think, be helpful; it might send a strong enough \nsignal that some of our unfair competitors in foreign countries \nunderstand that we are serious about this. We are concerned about \nAmerican jobs, whether they be in Georgia or Kansas, wherever, and that \nwe in Congress are accountable. We are on the ballot every 6 years or \nevery 2 years.\n  So I hope sometime before--let us just pick a number, say 2 o'clock--\nwe can clear this and pass it. If not, I will leave it up to my friend \nfrom Georgia to take care of it after I am gone.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6028-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IDEA\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, on April 14, 1969, I gave my first speech on \nthe Senate floor. I spoke about people with disabilities--the \nchallenges they face in their daily lives and how appropriate services \ncan make a big difference by giving them a shot at opportunities others \ntake for granted. Thus, as I leave the Senate today, it is with a sense \nof symmetry and continuing mission that I am pleased today to rise in \nsupport of the Individual with Disabilities Education Act.\n  I might say, we hoped to have that cleared. There is some problem.\n  IDEA, as it is often called, gives States important financial help to \neducate students with disabilities and, in turn, provides students with \ndisabilities with the guarantee of a free and appropriate public \neducation.\n  Mr. President, there are some issues that transcend politics, foster \na bipartisan spirit, and result in legislation that makes a real and \nlasting difference. In my view, disability has always been one of those \nissues.\n  Perhaps no legislation has been more important in improving \nopportunity for young people with disabilities than IDEA. In 1975, I \nwas honored to help craft the first IDEA legislation.\n  At that time, as unbelievable some may find it today, millions of \nyoung people were not allowed into school, simply because they had a \ndisability.\n  IDEA has helped change that, and IDEA is as important today as it was \n21 years ago. But the world has changed, and so, too, must IDEA.\n  This latest reauthorization bill cuts administrative redtape, \nprovides States more flexibility in spending Federal funds, demands \ngreater accountability for educational results and helps educators \nmaintain safe schools--without sacrificing any of the important \nprotections IDEA gives students with disabilities.\n  I want to acknowledge the hard work of Senators Frist and Harkin. \nTheir efforts have paid off in a good bill, and I congratulate them.\n  Mr. President, I do not know what judgments historians of the future \nwill make of my record in the Senate. But, for me, I can think of no \nmore important issue in a personal sense than disability, one that I \nhave pursued with more constancy or greater pride, or has made a \ngreater difference in people's lives. I hope others will reflect that \nwhat I did was right, not merely convenient.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dole pertaining to the introduction of S. 1856 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6028-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, later today I will introduce a bipartisan \ncommission bill on campaign finance reform, something I talked about in \n1990--not last week or last year, and it is in the Record. In fact, \nSenator Mitchell and I even experimented with our own limits \ncommission. The problem was there was not any enforcement there, so \nCongress did not do anything.\n  I am no rocket scientist, and I have been here long enough to know \nthat if Republicans were in charge, we will try to have a bill better \nfor us, and if the Democrats are in charge, they will want a bill that \nis better for them. I will introduce a bill later, along with a \nstatement calling for a bipartisan commission which would have some \nteeth in it so, if they made recommendations, Congress would act up or \ndown. I hope it is something we could get our arms around. It will not \nhappen soon, but I think we need to focus on it.\n  We are into another election cycle. I know there is a lot of \ncriticism by a lot of people about fundraising. None of us likes to do \nit. I do not. I believe we can address this in a responsible, objective \nway by finding people outside of politics who understand the problem \nand can deal with it and treat all of us fairly, whether we are, again, \nRepublicans or Democrats. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair advises that under a \nprevious order, the time between 10 o'clock and 12 noon is under the \ncontrol of the Senator from Oklahoma. The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6028-4", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6028-S6043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BOB DOLE\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield to the Senator from \nKansas, Senator Kassebaum, 5 minutes.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I think it is appropriate that Senator \nDole, in one of his last acts of the Senate, introduced legislation to \nprovide for security of the Medicare trust fund. It was his strong \nendorsement and leadership at the beginning of the 1980's that \naddressed the solvency of the Social Security system. Just yesterday, \nhe was instrumental in bringing a number of us together to address the \nconcerns of health insurance reform. It is my hope we can reach across \nthe aisle and forge with the administration a lasting piece of \nlegislation addressing many of the concerns regarding health insurance \nreform.\n  For nearly 18 years, Mr. President, Senator Dole and I have served as \npartners in representing Kansas in the U.S. Senate and in working on \nmany other issues. We have not always agreed, but far more often we \nhave agreed. More importantly, Mr. President, we have respected each \nother's dedication. Today, that partnership ends, at least in its \ncurrent form.\n\n[[Page S6029]]\n\n  This day creates many mixed emotions. Like others in this Chamber, I \nwill miss Bob Dole's steady presentation and his can-do attitude that \nhas helped the Senate through so many rough times. I know Kansans also \nview his departure with some trepidation.\n  At the same time, I believe that Senator Dole has made the right \nchoice by deciding to focus all of his time, energy, and skill on the \nPresidential campaign. It is a mark of his dedication and commitment \nthat he would give up so much in order to bring his very best to the \nchallenge at hand. It also, I think, marks his confidence.\n  In our years together here, Bob Dole and I have created a spirit of \ncooperation and teamwork in representing our State. There is no one who \nunderstands middle America and grassroots sentiment better than Bob \nDole. That is where his roots are. We have joined forces many times to \nsee the needs of Kansans were addressed and that the concerns of \nKansans were voiced clearly and forcefully. I could not have asked for \na better partner in helping me. I hope my support for him in those \nefforts has been worthwhile as well.\n  Our work together has ranged across the spectrum of issues and \nproblems. Countless hours were spent helping farmers get through the \ncredit crunch of the 1980's. No one understood that better than Bob \nDole. Today, there are family farms across our State and our Nation who \nstill work their own lands due to Bob Dole's leadership.\n  We have gone to bat repeatedly to assist our aviation manufacturers \nto get fair treatment in world markets. Today, there are thousands of \naircraft workers producing airplanes that might never have been sold \nwithout Bob Dole's firm hand and persistent efforts. Senator Dole took \nthe lead in the effort to rebuild McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita, \nKS, after a devastating tornado swept through the outskirts of Wichita. \nHe saw to it that every small town in Kansas had a tornado warning \nsiren to protect its citizens.\n  Mr. President, through all of these years, no challenge has been too \nlarge and no concern has been too small for Senator Dole. Our State \nmotto is ad astra per aspera, ``to the stars through difficulties.'' I \nhave never known Senator Dole to not look at a challenge and find a way \nto address it. He has been a tireless champion for our State in every \nfarm bill, every tax bill, every bill of any kind that touched Kansas \nand, more importantly then, by extension, the Nation. As a direct \nresult of his efforts, our State is a better place to live, to work, \nand to go for school. His legacy is written not merely in laws but in a \nbetter life for every Kansan.\n  It is with a mixture of regret and pride that I say goodbye to \nSenator Dole today. We will miss him deeply. I will miss him most of \nall. I know that there is other work for him to do now, other \nchallenges to be met, and I have no doubt at all that he will do that \njob and meet that challenge. Bob Dole is a remarkable man with an \nextraordinary life story, yet on this day all I can offer him is a \nheartfelt thank you for all that he has done for me and for Kansas and \nthe Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for her \neloquent remarks. She has known Senator Dole and worked with Senator \nDole maybe closer than any of us over the last several years. She, \nlikewise, will be retiring this year and certainly will be missed by \nall of us in this body. She has brought a certain degree of civility \nthat is certainly needed in this body. I compliment Senator Kassebaum \nfor her statement.\n  Next, I call on Senator Grams from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute \nto a man who, for 20 some years, while in the broadcast news industry, \nI used for sound bites and sources of information. I have now had the \npleasure, over the last 2 years, to work with him in the Senate and am \nnow able to call him a friend.\n  Bob Dole's name alone stirs up many images among the American people. \nBob Dole--war hero, Congressman, Senator, party chairman, majority \nleader, Presidential candidate.\n  Yet, when I think of Bob Dole, other words come to mind: \nmidwesterner, mentor, colleague, and most of all, friend. I'm sure that \nall of us in this Chamber feel the same way, and today, we honor Bob \nDole, our leader, our distinguished colleague from Kansas, our friend.\n  As Bob leaves Washington to return home back to the heartland of our \ngreat Nation, I wanted to share some of my thoughts about this man \nwhose life story and distinguished career reflects the very values we \ncherish most as Americans.\n  Bob was born and raised in Russell, KS--living the small town \nAmerican life about which legends are made. His family was not wealthy; \nin fact, during the Depression, the Doles, like many families, had to \nput together just to make ends meet, moving into the basement of their \nhome in order to rent out the rest of their house.\n  As a young man, Bob worked as a popular soda jerk at a local drug \nstore, learning early on the lessons of hard work, fiscal \nresponsibility and the value of a hard-earned dollar.\n  Growing up in Kansas taught Bob the importance of patriotism and \nsacrifice. It's not surprising that at the age of 19, Bob answered the \ncall to serve his country by joining the Army to fight in World War II.\n  And by now, everyone should be familiar with the story of Bob \ncrawling out of his foxhole during heavy shelling in the hills of Italy \nto save a wounded colleague, only to be hit by Nazi machinegun fire.\n  There are some for whom love of country and self-sacrifice are just \nphrases--words to be used for a holiday speech. For Bob Dole, it is the \nstandard under which he has led his life--a badge of honor he wears \neven today.\n  The 3 years and nine operations it took for Bob to rehabilitate \nrequired strength and perseverance, a burden too great for some to \ncarry. But Bob Dole was never one to give up--not even under the most \ndifficult of circumstances.\n  His determination to recover and get back on his feet was backed up \nby the now-legendary support of his friends, family and community, when \nthe people of Russell passed around a cigar box to raise the $1,800 \nneeded to pay Bob's medical bills.\n  Bob has never forgotten their generosity. He still keeps that cigar \nbox, the receipts and the love and support they represent in his \noffice, and recalling those days still overwhelms him with heartfelt \nemotion.\n  Upon recovering from his war injuries, Bob wanted to give something \nback to his community--he chose public service. Since receiving his law \ndegree in 1952, public service has been exactly what Bob Dole's life \nhas been about. Public service has led him all the way to the U.S. \nSenate, and now, the White House.\n  The character traits that Bob Dole learned since his humble \nbeginnings in small town America have been reflected in his everyday \nwork as a Senator.\n  Bob has consistently worked for a Government that serves the people \nbut is a accountable to the taxpayers who pay for it, and a society \nthat is based on people helping people without creating a permanent \ndependency on Government.\n  These principles have been apparent in his efforts to balance the \nFederal budget, return hard-earned tax dollars to the middle class, \noverhaul the welfare system, and preserve programs like Medicare for \ngenerations to come.\n  I am proud to say that I had the opportunity to stand at Bob Dole's \nside during these debates, to have worked with him in making our Nation \na better place for our children and grandchildren.\n  But Bob has been more than just a colleague--he's been my friend. \nWhen I campaigned for my seat in the Senate, Bob came into Minnesota \nfive times. As a fellow Midwesterner, Bob knows my State, its people, \nand our heritage. Minnesotans like Bob Dole; he is one of us.\n  Bob's friendship extends beyond the 1994 campaign. Shortly after \narriving in the Senate, I got caught up in one of last year's biggest \nfights over national policy: whether or not to include tax cuts in the \nbudget. I promised the people of Minnesota that I would not support a \nbudget that did not include tax relief for the middle class.\n  Bob understood my pledge, and though he could not, as Senate majority \nleader, take public sides on the debate, he privately encouraged me to\n\n[[Page S6030]]\n\nstick to my guns, telling me not to give way on my principles. Sure \nenough, when the final budget came out, tax cuts were included, thanks \nin no small part to Bob Dole's support.\n  On May 15, I had the opportunity to join many of my colleagues in \nstanding with Bob again as he announced his resignation from the \nSenate. Like many of those who heard the speech, I was moved by his \nwords, particularly when he said to the American people: ``I will stand \nbefore you without office or authority, a private citizen, a Kansan, an \nAmerican, just a man.''\n  I thought to myself about this man--a man who has served his Nation \nin times of war and peace with honor and integrity, who carries through \nwhen he gives his word, who has sacrificed so much of himself for the \ncountry he loves so dearly.\n  Bob is not a man who learned his political philosophy from a book, \nbut instead, developed it as the result of his life experiences, from \nthe people whose lives he has touched and whose lives touch him, and \nthe commonsense wisdom one can only expect from a son of the Midwest.\n  It is with this wisdom and the good feelings of all of us who have \nknown and grown to respect Bob that he closes this chapter of his \nincredible life story, only to open a new one--full of the promises and \nhope that have marked his life. And while I am saddened to see him go, \nI am comforted by the fact that the Senate's loss is the American \npeople's gain.\n  I look forward to traveling with Bob across this great country, a \ncountry he has served with distinction throughout his life, and \nintroducing to the American people, a man I am honored to call my \nfriend, Bob Dole.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nhis comments. I call upon Senator Bennett from Utah for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, we here in the \ngreater Washington area have been celebrating the remarkable baseball \ncareer of Cal Ripken. I sometimes do not like sports analogies, but I \nwould like to draw on one relating to Cal Ripken, and other sports \nheroes, to give you my take on the majority leader, the Senator from \nKansas, Bob Dole.\n  We have sports heroes in the various sports that we follow in this \ncountry, who will have a brilliant season, and as a result of that \nbrilliant season, be all over the papers as a tremendous performer. And \nthen something happens and they fade from our consciousness.\n  If I can switch from the Orioles for just a moment and go back to the \nNew York Yankees, I would like to talk about Roger Maris, who set a \nrecord for the most home runs in a single season. When you think of the \nprimary home run hitter of the Yankees, you do not think of Roger \nMaris, you think of Babe Ruth, or of the modern counterpart to Babe \nRuth, Hank Aaron. Babe Ruth had a brilliant season, with 60 home runs. \nBut the reason we remember him is because he endured over a long period \nof time and set the record for the most home runs in an entire career, \nwhich stood until Hank Aaron came along and did more over an entire \ncareer.\n  We must judge Senators, public leaders, not on the basis of a \nbrilliant season, or a brilliant speech, or a brilliant campaign, but \nby what they do over a long career.\n  Bob Dole came to the U.S. Senate in 1969, the year Richard Nixon \nassumed the Presidency. I was in Washington at the time and had the \nprivilege of serving in the Nixon administration. It was known around \ntown that Bob Dole was the ``rookie of the year.'' Bob Dole was the \nbrightest star of the new Senators taking office as a result of the \n1968 campaign. Now, did he have a single brilliant season? Fast-forward \nthe tape. In 1976, Bob Dole was chosen as the party's Vice Presidential \nnominee. It was not a flash in the pan in his first experience in the \nSenate. He was a national figure chosen to be number two on the ticket. \nThat ticket failed. Did Bob Dole fade? In 1985, after Howard Baker \nretired from the Senate, Bob Dole was chosen by his colleagues to be \nthe majority leader, and then he went on to serve longer in that \nposition than any other Republican in history.\n  When we look at this man, we can pick out the brilliant seasons here \nand there, but the real legacy of Bob Dole is the long career, putting \ntogether a string of brilliant seasons and a long legacy of service.\n  I remember, as a new Senator, listening to the then majority leader, \nGeorge Mitchell, talk about service in the Senate. He said that it is a \ngreat honor to serve in the Senate of the United States, and that very \nfew people have had that honor. And then he went on to say, with some \ntruthfulness and a little wry smile, that many of those people \ndisappear and are forgotten after they have left the Senate and leave \nbehind no legacy whatsoever. He said that only a few make a serious \ndifference by virtue of their service in the Senate. And then he said \nthat one of those that we serve with, whom we know will be remembered \nfor his towering contribution--and these are not his exact words, but I \nam not doing violence to them--will be Bob Dole.\n  I thought that was a particularly generous tribute for George \nMitchell to pay to his adversary across the aisle. That comes to mind \nnow as we contemplate Senator Dole leaving this arena in order to \ncompete in another. It is not the brilliant season, it is not one \nparticular campaign, or one particular legislative accomplishment that \nwe remember. We honor the fact that this man has been at the center of \nAmerican politics for longer than any of the rest of us, in a serious \nway, in the serious debates, addressing the serious issues.\n  So we wish him all the best, regardless of party, on a personal \nbasis, and as a personal tribute to the fact that we have been \nprivileged to serve with one of the great Americans of our history, the \nSenator from Kansas, the majority leader, our friend, Bob Dole.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his \nexcellent speech. I appreciate his comments very much. Next, I will \nyield 5 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the U.S. Senate today \nto bid farewell to a friend, a leader, a colleague, and an authentic \nAmerican hero. Bob Dole embodies what is right about America. Seasoned \nby the values and humble atmosphere of small-town America, the \nexperience of war, and perseverance through physical trials, Bob Dole \nhas earned the respect and admiration of us all.\n  He is a legendary legislator who is known for his honesty, integrity, \nand fair-mindedness. Bob Dole is an authentic war hero who stood on the \nfront lines in the fight against tyranny and sacrificed so that others \nmay live in freedom. He understands the commitment and sacrifice \nnecessary to protect and preserve freedom.\n  I would like to share a couple of stories with my colleagues, one \nhaving to do with a trip to France back in the mid-1980's. I had an \nopportunity to respond to questions from a French audience for almost 2 \nhours and at the end of that, had the opportunity to ask them a \nquestion. I told them I was going to be returning to America in a few \ndays, and I wanted to know what they would tell me to tell the people \nof Florida about what they thought of our Nation. The first several \npeople who came and stood up said that we think of America as a great, \ndynamic, growing country, and one that is providing opportunities for \nmillions of Americans.\n  The third person that stood up was a fellow who was probably his late \nseventies or early eighties, a little bit wobbly, steadying himself \nwith a cane, and looked me square in the eye, and he said, ``When you \ngo back to America, you tell the people of your country that we will \nnever forget that it was the American GI that liberated our little \ntown.''\n  The second story is the opportunity that I had, along with some of my \nother colleagues here on the floor of the U.S. Senate, to be in Italy \nwith Bob Dole at the time he returned to the battlefield where he was \nwounded and stood on the road as he looked over to the area in which he \nlaid for 9 hours before being rescued. Later, we walked down the street \nof this little town where Bob Dole laid a wreath at a monument in \nmemory of those individuals who gave their lives in defense of freedom \nand liberation of Italy. As I stood by his side that day, I truly \nunderstood that this was a man who understood the importance of \nfreedom; that freedom is the core of all human\n\n[[Page S6031]]\n\nprogress, and while the price of freedom may be great, there is no \nprice so great as the loss of freedom.\n  We can see the mettle of the man in his decision to leave behind \nleadership of the U.S. Senate to pursue the Presidency. He is doing it \nbecause it is simply the right thing to do.\n  Bob Dole has so much to give America through his experience and his \nwisdom. While this is a day of reflection, it is also a day of \nanticipation. I am confident that Bob Dole is not done serving his \ncountry, and America will be better for it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank our colleague from Florida.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. President, today we are saying farewell to our leader in the \nSenate so that he can become the leader of our Nation and of the free \nworld. This is a remarkable man who can shoulder this great burden. \nThis is a man who has shown that he is worthy of our trust. He has kept \nhis promises to the American people, starting with balancing the \nbudget. For the first time we are on a track to balancing the budget in \n7 years due to the leadership of Bob Dole. It is the first time in 40 \nyears that Congress has made the decision that we must not burden our \nchildren and grandchildren with the kind of debt that has been built up \nby Congresses of the past.\n\n  This is a man who can be Commander in Chief of our country. He has \nrespect for our military. He respects the people who have chosen to \nprotect the freedom of America. He understands the need for peace--not \nthrough unilateral disarmament, but through strength. And he will not \nsend our troops into harm's way unless there is a U.S. security \ninterest. He has shown that through his leadership on the Senate floor \nto make sure that we do not commit American lives unless there was a \nU.S. security interest.\n  He has fought for the working American family. He grew up in Russell, \nKS. He knew poverty. He knew what it was like to struggle to make ends \nmeet. That is why his priority was tax relief for the hard-working \nfamilies of this country such as the $500-per-child tax credit and \nhomemaker IRA's. It was Senator Dole who led the way for the homemaker \nto have retirement security, just like those who work outside the home \ndo. And it was Senator Dole who passed that bill in Congress only to \nhave it vetoed by President Clinton. He fought to lower the marriage \npenalty because he wants the American family to stay strong.\n  He has been a leader in the fight for women's health issues. During \nhis time as majority leader, we have increased the spending for \nresearch on women's health care concerns. He is trying to make sure \nthat we have a strong health care system--a strong Medicare system that \nwill be there for those who will need it in the future.\n  He is fighting for the spirit of entrepreneurship to be kept in this \ncountry because he knows it is the small business people that make the \neconomy grow and prosper in America and takes the new people into our \nsystem for jobs. He knows that, and that is why he is trying to provide \nregulatory relief.\n  We have passed the free trade agreements, so our small businesses are \ngoing to be able to compete for those jobs. Senator Dole knows, and he \nhas led the way for regulatory relief for our small business people so \nthat they will be able to grow.\n  He has been a defender of private property rights because he believes \nin the fifth amendment to the Constitution.\n  Finally, Mr. President, he has been good for our border concerns. He \nis trying to help us deal with the severe problem of illegal \nimmigration. He is doing that by trying to make sure that we have the \nhelp we need in the border States to meet these terrible issues that \nare of such concern to our country right now.\n  So we are saying goodbye today to our Senate leader, a man who has \nproven his mettle time and time and time again; a man who understands \nwhat America is all about and who has voluntarily said that he would \nrather be going out across this great country talking to the people who \nare working, who know what the problems and concerns are for the \nheartland of America. He would rather be out there talking to them one \non one, listening to their concerns and telling them what he would like \nto do to make their lives better. He has chosen that over the traffic \nof Washington, DC.\n  He has his priorities straight. He wants to keep the American dream--\nhis dream that every child in this country will have the same \nopportunities that he did to reach his or her full potential, and he \nmeans to make America a place that will allow that to happen.\n  So we are saying farewell to a Senate leader today, but we are saying \nfarewell to a leader of this group so that he can take on the greater \nchallenge with his spirit and his integrity of leading our great Nation \nin the free world.\n  We wish him farewell, and we will be with him out in the heartland of \nAmerica talking to the concerns of the people of this country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank our colleague from Texas for a \nbeautiful statement.\n  I now yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Colorado, Senator Campbell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, it is a great honor for me today to join my colleagues \nin recognizing the outstanding accomplishments of one of the greatest \nSenators in this great institution: Bob Dole.\n  This is a special day in history for those of us gathered here in \nthis Senate Chamber. For on this day in 1775, the Continental Congress \ndid something this body has been doing ever since--it appointed a \ncommittee. We have come a long way since then. But this committee's job \nwas to write the Declaration of Independence which has protected our \nfreedom and liberty ever since. The committee was composed of Thomas \nJefferson, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Robert Livingston, and Roger \nSherman. While no congressional committee has ever done a more \nimportant job, Bob Dole's service of 36 years in Congress as \nlegislator, Finance Committee chairman, and majority leader has had a \nprofound impact on the course of our Nation.\n  Although he has worked on behalf of countless individuals, families \nand communities, Bob Dole has stood out as a champion of veterans in \nCongress. Therefore, as a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I \nrise today and join with veterans from across the country and \nthroughout this Congress in honoring a lifetime of achievement by my \nfriend--a warrior, a leader, a hero.\n  In modern times, the word ``hero'' is often bandied around a great \ndeal. But after much reflection, perhaps Ralph Waldo Emerson's \nperception of heroism best describes how so many of us feel about Bob \nDole. Emerson said: ``The characteristic of heroism is its persistency. \nThe heroic cannot be the common, nor the common heroic.''\n  Bob Dole is a man who has risen to uncommon and heroic heights. And, \nas it is with most heroes, he seldom speaks of his accomplishments.\n  He represents, I guess, the best of our country's warriors and \nheroes. The story of what he went through in 1943 while attending \nKansas University and joining the U.S. Army is legendary. As a second \nlieutenant platoon leader, he went into training with the 10th Mountain \nDivision, which was based in my State of Colorado. Perhaps his only \nmistake at that time was not buying the land around the training site, \nbecause that has become what we know as Aspen today. But certainly it \nwas that highly trained infantry of the 10th Mountain Division that \nbegan the final attack April 14, 1945, which led to his wounds of World \nWar II. He went off to war to defend the Nation and our freedoms. And, \nas a result of that wound, of course, he went through nine operations, \nwhich several other Senators have told about, and 2 years of recovery.\n  I guess, just to talk about wounds and recovery is one thing, but the \nGermans have a saying. They say, ``He who laughs at scars has suffered \nno wounds.''\n\n[[Page S6032]]\n\n  When we think of the time it cost and the terrible pain Senator Dole \nmust have gone through, through that recovery time, we know there is a \ndifference between talking about it and actually going through it.\n  Bob Dole's legacy as a warrior, hero, and statesman reminds us of \nanother outstanding American leader, President Dwight D. Eisenhower. \nSenator Dole, then a member of the Kansas House of Representatives, \nfirst met General Eisenhower on a rain-soaked day in the spring of 1952 \nwhen the General returned home to Abilene, KS, to officially launch his \nPresidential campaign. It was most fitting, therefore, when Senator \nDole was awarded the Eisenhower Leadership Prize in 1995 by the \nEisenhower World Affairs Institute for lifetime accomplishments which \nreflect Eisenhower's legacy of integrity and leadership.\n  As President Eisenhower said 41 years ago:\n\n       Of the nations of today the future will say that there were \n     two kinds: Those that were intelligent, courageous, decisive \n     and tireless in their support of high principles--and those \n     that disappeared from the earth. The true patriots give their \n     best to assure that our country will also be found in the \n     first of these categories.\n\n  Bob Dole clearly stands among the true patriots.\n  As a decorated World War II veteran, his service on behalf of our \nNation's veterans can be seen in four major areas: benefits, POW/MIA \nissues, education, and health care.\n  Veterans who have served their country deserve and have earned \nquality benefits. Toward this end, the Dole GI bill, introduced in \n1995, revamps the veterans benefit program and brings it up to date and \nin line with the needs of veterans today.\n  He also authored legislation in 1996 to create the Veterans \nTransition Benefit Commission. Its purpose is to ensure that veterans \nleaving the military due to downsizing have access to the necessary \nassistance to return to civilian life in the most productive manner.\n  On the difficult POW/MIA issue, Bob Dole has been in the forefront, \nseeking answers and helping families who do not know the fate of their \nloved ones. Bob Dole is considered the 1970 founder of the POW/MIA \nLeague of Families. Since then, he has continued to assist families to \nget a full accounting and disclosure of the fate of their loved ones.\n  This past Memorial Day over 100,000 veterans converged in D.C. on The \nMall, as they do every Memorial Day, angry in their belief that many \npeople in government have abandoned them. Bob Dole has not abandoned \nthem, nor will he ever abandon the veterans of the United States.\n  In the area of veterans health, Bob Dole has a special and deeply \npersonal understanding of the importance of quality health care and the \npower of rehabilitation. He has worked to provide a service-connected \npresumption for certain diseases, expand the number of disorders for \nwhich former POW's could receive disability compensation.\n  Although we served in different wars, Senator Dole in World War II \nand myself in Korea, we share with all veterans a unique perspective on \nlife and country. If war teaches you anything, it is that the world is \na mixture of vulnerability and enduring strength, and that it is the \njob of the human spirit to strike the balance we call peace. Bob Dole \nhas never wavered from the pursuit of peace.\n  This courageous leader understands so much about the price of \nfreedom, and as he goes forth from this Chamber, let him know that our \nhearts, our prayers, and the hopes of all America's veterans go with \nhim.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank Senator Campbell for his \noutstanding statement.\n  Next, I yield to Senator Thomas, from Wyoming, 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to join in the tribute to \nSenator Bob Dole. Certainly, his accomplishments extend over many \nareas, but I want to limit my remarks specifically to health care.\n  His record is one that truly demonstrates compassion, dedication and \nselflessness. This is not a man who simply talks about quality health \ncare. He knows the importance of it firsthand.\n  Of course, we all know the story, Bob Dole's valiant service in World \nWar II. He spent 4 agonizing years in a hospital bed. It was this \nexperience that led to his commitment to give each and every American \nthe security of knowing health care is there today and will be there \ntomorrow.\n  Proof of such dedication is reflected, not just in the way he votes \non major issues, but also in smaller efforts like helping to keep a 12-\nbed hospital in rural Kansas open, or creating employment opportunities \nfor persons with disabilities. These are little things that do not \nalways receive a lot of fanfare, but over the course of 35 years, they \nbuild a solid legislative record.\n  As the Wyoming State chair for the Senator's 1988 Presidential bid, I \ncame to know and understand the person who has so willingly fought the \ngood fight to make insurance more affordable and accessible to all. For \ninstance, during the 1970's, when many policymakers were advocating a \nnationalized health care system, it was Bob Dole who recognized the \nflaws of such an approach. Rather than let the Federal Government be in \ncontrol of individual medical decisions, he coauthored a more simple, \npractical piece of legislation, the 1979 Dole-Danforth-Domenici health \ninsurance bill. The initiative aimed to improve access to health care, \nbut in a manner that did not turn the reins over to Washington, DC. He \nhad the foresight back then to keep reform affordable and free of \nFederal mandates. This same philosophy continues.\n  A few years ago when the Congress considered the Clinton health care \nplan, it was Bob Dole who warned against the ill effects of \nfederalizing our health care system. As an experienced legislator, he \nreminded Congress that increased taxes and price controls are not the \nway to improve coverage for the uninsured.\n  But, before I reflect on the Senator's more recent accomplishments, I \nwant to highlight an issue near and dear to the hearts of Wyoming \npeople--rural health care. In the 1980's, hospital closures were \nplaguing rural America and providers were vacating these communities \nfor urban practices. To be exact, 237 rural hospitals closed during the \ndecade. There would have been more if not for Bob Dole's commitment to \na notable package of rural health care reforms. Reforms that improved \nMedicare reimbursement rates to small hospitals, created primary care \ncenters, and recruited vital family practitioners. These solutions \nhelped to revitalize our communities and gave rural families the same \naccess to quality medical care as their urban counterparts.\n  As someone who hails from a town of 500-people, I know the importance \nof such measures. If a rural hospitals closes, it often devastates a \ncommunity. Jobs are lost and individuals are left without care during \ntimes of a medical emergency.\n  Establishing a successful rural health care delivery system can be \nvery difficult. Yet Senator Dole and his staff have helped make that \ngoal more plausible.\n  I am sure I speak for many members of the Rural Health Care Caucus \nwhen I say, ``Thank you.''\n  Mr. President, Bob Dole's commitment to quality health care extends \nto senior citizens as well. Last year, when Medicare was projected to \nbe bankrupt in 2002, it was our leader who fought to preserve the \nprogram well into the next century. His plan provided thoughtful \nsolutions to complex problems while still maintaining spending \nincreases for every senior citizen. Unfortunately, the President \nrejected the proposal, not because it did not do enough, but because it \nwas politically expedient thing to do.\n  Despite the administration's refusal to save Medicare \nfrom insolvency, Bob Dole continues to work on behalf of the elderly. \nJust 1 month ago, before he announced his intention to leave the \nSenate, he steered passage of an amendment to the Health Insurance \nReform Act. The measure helps alleviate the burden of long-term care \ncosts, which is becoming all the more important as nursing home \nexpenses rise.\n\n  Mr. President, these are a few of the many accomplishments of Bob \nDole. Unfortunately, time does not permit\n\n[[Page S6033]]\n\nme to list them all. But the purpose of reciting his achievements is \nnot to boast about our longest serving Republican leader. Rather, it is \nto provide insight into the man who represents the State of Kansas.\n  He has served his State and his country well. He is one of the most \neffective and wise legislators of our time.\n  Great legislators should be measured by their actions, not by their \nwords. Bob Dole's actions on health care clearly state where his \npriorities are. So my friend, Bob Dole, good luck. It has been a \npleasure serving with you and I know you will continue to serve our \ncountry in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank Senator Thomas, from Wyoming, for \nhis remarks.\n  I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I wish to comment briefly today upon Bob \nDole's record in an area where I have devoted a considerable amount of \ntime, namely the environment. Under Bob Dole's leadership, we have been \nable to continue the proud tradition, the Republican tradition, of \nprotecting our environment. That is a tradition that dates back to \nTeddy Roosevelt. It is interesting to note that Bob Dole came to the \nSenate in 1969. Shortly thereafter the modern era of environmental law \nbegan to take shape.\n  In 1970, he supported President Nixon's creation of the Environmental \nProtection Agency, and he has supported every major environmental law \nsince he arrived in the Senate; all of which have come about in the \npast 25 years.\n  What are some of these laws? The National Environmental Policy Act, \nthe Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, \nthe Endangered Species Act, Superfund, the Resource Conservation and \nRecovery Act to control hazardous waste, and on the list goes.\n  Mr. President, those bipartisan efforts have brought about an \nextraordinary, tangible change in our Nation. The successful protection \nof the environment has been called the greatest social achievement of \nthe United States of the past quarter century. Let us consider briefly \nthe successes we have had under the laws that were enacted with the \nhelp and support of Bob Dole.\n  In the 15 years 1975 to 1990, automobile miles traveled in the United \nStates increased by 70 percent. They went to 2.2 trillion vehicle miles \nper year in those 5 years--increased by 70 percent. But in the same \nperiod, hydrocarbon emissions were cut in half. Lead in the air, for \nexample, has a terrible effect on the mental development of children, \nespecially in congested inner cities. Because in the mid-1970's we \nmandated the use of unleaded gasoline, lead in the air has declined by \n98 percent. That is an extraordinary achievement.\n\n  EPA has just completed a study showing that the positive effects of \nair pollution controls have been enormous. The study found that, in \n1990, Americans received roughly $20 of value in reduced risks of death \nand illness and other adverse effects, $20 of value for every $1 of \nexpenditure spent on air pollution control.\n  What about clean water? In 1970, only one-third of the lakes, rivers \nand streams in the United States of America were considered fishable \nand swimmable. Now, not one-third but two-thirds of the lakes, rivers \nand streams in America are considered fishable and swimmable, and the \npercentage continues to rise every year.\n  Since its enactment in 1973 by a vote of 99 to nothing, the \nEndangered Species Act has achieved remarkable results. Populations of \nwhooping cranes, brown pelicans, peregrine falcons and many other \nformerly endangered species have come back from near extinction. So \nthere is a lot of good news out there, and much of that success is due \nto Bob Dole's leadership in this Senate.\n  Senator Dole recognized early on the importance of dealing with the \nthreats to our global environment. Under his leadership, the Senate \napproved, in 1987, the Montreal protocol, dealing with substances that \ndeplete the ozone layer. Then that was followed by the 1990 London \namendments to eliminate the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons, \nCFC's, and other chemicals that destroy our protective ozone layer.\n  Last year, Bob Dole cosponsored a bill that was developed by the \nCommittee on Environment to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act. The \nresult was approval by the Senate in a recorded vote of 99 to nothing, \nand that is a tribute to Bob Dole's leadership.\n  He was a key architect of this year's farm bill which demonstrated \nhis interest and commitment to protecting the environment. The 1996 \nfarm bill produced one of the most significant conservation packages \never enacted into law, and Bob Dole was a key player in every step of \nthat farm bill.\n  Bob was a champion of the free-market approach to controlling acid \nrain in the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments, and that free-market \napproach is working.\n  With his support, we are exploring similar approaches to protecting \nwetlands through mitigation banking and to create incentives for \nprivate landowners to protect endangered species--use the free-market \napproach.\n  Eighty-six years ago, the first of the great environmental \nPresidents, Teddy Roosevelt, said the following:\n\n       Of all the questions which can come before this Nation, \n     short of the actual preservation of its existence in a great \n     war, there is none which compares in importance with the \n     central task of leaving this land even a better land for our \n     descendants than it is for us.\n\n  We have seen from his work in the Senate that those are sentiments \nthat Bob Dole heartily agrees with.\n  On a personal note, may I say it has been a joyful experience for me \nto have been associated with Bob Dole for the past 20 years here in the \nSenate.\n  May success and happiness be in his future, and we wish him Godspeed. \nI thank the Chair.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Rhode Island \nfor his excellent remarks.\n  I now yield 5 minutes to Senator Gramm from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, by his skill and courage, Bob Dole has \nearned a place in history, alongside the modern giants like Lyndon \nJohnson and Bob Taft, as one of the greatest leaders in the history of \nthe Senate.\n  I think it is fair to say that of all the people who I have worked \nwith in my service in the House and the Senate, Bob Dole is the \ngreatest legislator, and I am very proud to have served with Bob Dole \nin a period which inevitably will be called in the history books the \n``Dole era.''\n  Bob Dole has my strong support and my deep affection as he leaves the \nSenate he loves to fight for the leadership of a nation that he loves \neven more. I think for many of us here today, this is a sad moment. Bob \nDole has been the leader of the Republicans in the Senate every day \nthat I have served in the Senate. My first vote that I cast 12 years \nago when I came to the Senate was a vote to make Bob Dole the majority \nleader.\n  I have known him as an ally and an adversary. I think I can say I \nknow Bob Dole pretty well. I know that he is a good and great man. I \nknow that as Americans get to know him in the coming months that they \nare going to conclude that he has the leadership and the convictions \nthat we need to change America.\n  So as he leaves us in the Senate, I am delighted that he is leaving \nus to seek higher service, and I am confident that he is going to get \nan opportunity to provide that service. I am very proud to join his \ncolleagues today in paying tribute to him, the greatest legislator of \nhis era, as he serves his last day in the Senate.\n  I yield the time that is remaining back to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment Senator Gramm for an \noutstanding and very strong statement.\n  I now yield to Senator Snowe from Maine 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nyielding this time.\n\n[[Page S6034]]\n\n  I rise today to join my colleagues in honoring the preeminent \nRepublican leader in the history of the U.S. Senate, Senator Bob Dole. \nThroughout his distinguished career, Senator Dole has served the people \nof Kansas, as well as this Nation, with honor, distinction, and \nintegrity.\n  We gather on this bittersweet occasion to pay tribute to a remarkable \nman for his lifelong commitment to America, as well as his unparalleled \nleadership in this august institution. As President Reagan said so \neloquently in describing Senator Dole as a leader, ``It's not just a \njob description, it's a description of the man.''\n  His leadership has touched virtually every aspect of public policy, \nbut I would like to speak specifically on a topic that has been of \nparamount importance to me throughout my career--an area where Senator \nDole has been a champion, an area where he has made a difference, and \nthat is on behalf of America's women.\n  Mr. President, Senator Dole's commitment to ensuring fairness and \nopportunity for America's women is not a newfound phenomenon. In fact, \nit has always been an integral part of who Bob Dole is. Throughout his \ncareer, Senator Dole has fought to make America what Susan B. Anthony \ncalled the ``true Republic: men, their rights and nothing more; women, \ntheir rights and nothing less.''\n\n  In his personal and professional life, Bob Dole has been guided by a \nsingular belief that every individual--regardless of gender--has the \nright to fulfill his or her God-given potential.\n  Bob Dole has always known that we cannot have a truly representative \ndemocracy unless women are represented at every level of government and \nsociety. Not content just to rely on words, he has taken action.\n  As chairman of the Republican Party, over two decades ago, he \nappointed the first woman in the history of the party as deputy chair. \nAs Senate majority leader, he appointed the first woman as Secretary of \nthe Senate. And he was the first Senate leader in history, Republican \nor Democrat, to select a woman, whom we all have known, the \nextraordinarily capable and talented Sheila Burke, as his chief of \nstaff.\n  It is not just women on the Hill who have benefited from Senator \nDole's efforts. The lives of women in small towns, big cities, and \neverywhere in between in America have been improved as a result of \nSenator Dole's leadership.\n  From his Retirement Equity Act of 1983, which protected women from an \narbitrary pension system that left them without a pension after their \nhusbands died before retirement age, to his Sexual Assault Prevention \nAct, which finally expanded the rights of women after years of taking a \nback seat to criminals in our justice system, Bob Dole was at the \nforefront of the fight to guarantee economic opportunity and personal \nsafety.\n  Bob Dole recognized that 2.5 million women are battered annually, the \nsingle greatest cause of injury to American women, and he saw that as \nbeing unconscionable. It was under his leadership that the Violence \nAgainst Women Act was fully funded for the first time ever.\n  But his leadership did not end there. Senator Dole also recognized \nthat the highest echelons of corporate America did not reflect the true \nlandscape of this Nation. Where others did not or would not, Bob Dole \nsaw barriers which are rarely penetrated by women, and he believed \nthose lines were made for crossing. As Senator Dole himself has said, \n``The issues boil down to equal access and equal opportunity.'' Bob \nDole knows there is something wrong when women are not represented in \nthe upper levels of management in corporate America, and that is why he \nauthored the Glass Ceiling Commission, the first ever Federal \ncommission that created the most comprehensive report on how business \ncould make full use of our Nation's human capital.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Maine an \nadditional 2 minutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, Senator Dole's commitment to women goes \nbeyond the workplace. Under his leadership, the Senate passed \nlegislation to provide Medicare coverage of a drug that was proven \neffective in the fight against breast cancer. He created a tax credit \nfor expenses associated with the long-term care of elderly spouses who \nare sick or family members, especially important for women because they \nrepresent 78 percent of our Nation's primary caregivers.\n  For those who found themselves in need of a helping hand, Bob Dole \nhas been the driving force behind meaningful, compassionate welfare \nreform, to transfer welfare into workfare and move people from the \nwelfare rolls to the payrolls. He made sure it was not done on the \nbacks of children by ensuring that we inserted $3 billion in additional \nchild care funding, and this bill passed the Senate with 87 votes.\n\n  In another commitment to women and families, he joined with me in \nproviding for tough child support enforcement provisions to send a \nmessage to deadbeat parents that the days of parental irresponsibility \nare over.\n  The bottom line is, Mr. President, the record goes on and on. The \nrecord shows that when it comes to America's women, you can count on \nBob Dole.\n  Finally, on a personal level, I would like to express my deepest \nappreciation for Senator Dole's friendship and wise counsel over the \nyears, not only here in the U.S. Senate but throughout my years in the \nHouse of Representatives. As he takes leave of this institution he \nloves so much, he and Elizabeth take with them our profound respect, \nour great admiration, our heartfelt friendship, our deep gratitude and \nour prayers for Godspeed as he and Elizabeth embark on an exciting and \nhistoric new chapter in their lives.\n  I am reminded of what Winston Churchill said when the tide had turned \nin favor of the allies. He said this:\n\n       This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the \n     end. But it is, rather, the end of the beginning.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank Senator Snowe for her outstanding \ncomments.\n  I now yield 5 minutes to the senior Senator from Wyoming, Senator \nSimpson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to comment about \nmy friend Bob Dole. We have heard all of the facts and the \nextraordinary history of the man's life and his life in the Senate, and \nit indeed is extraordinary. We all have known that. He is the very \nbest--the very, very best.\n  I will be saying much about this man in the next months, for this is \na leader, a real leader, not just in the title he held but way down \ninside, and that is a gift. That is the ability to lead, to engender \ntrust and loyalty and the admiration--even grudging sometimes--of your \ntoughest adversaries, and he has had that and it will serve him well.\n  One of the great and singular honors in my life was to serve as his \nassistant for 10 years. I was his first lieutenant. He was the captain. \nWe had a pretty good platoon, a good company, too, and a good \nbattalion. It was one wonderful run. I must say that some joy of it was \nlost, was sometimes when we took our work too seriously--but we never \ntook ourselves too seriously. When you have a couple of gentlemen with \na rather spirited sense of humor, it does spark up and brighten the \nday. I love those types.\n  I learned much from this man. I learned not to judge, to try to make \nthings work, to have ultimate patience. That is what I really have not \nlearned yet. It is out there though. He gave me some good tips. In \nthose times, I found this man to be true, honest, and so natural, a \nvery remarkable gentleman. By taking leave from here in this honorable \nway, the American people will come to see him as we do, as I do--fair, \nstrong, firm, a man of great resolve.\n  With this extraordinary woman Elizabeth at his side, Elizabeth \nHanford Dole, they will surely captivate and unite this country in \ntheir quest, for she is a person of great personal faith and an \ninspiration to many of us. And his daughter Robin too, what a fine \nwoman, making a fine impression all over America, as she is deeply \ninvolved in the campaign activities. Those are the things we will see \nthe Bob Dole family doing in these months to come.\n  A legislator, a listener, a loyalist. No one served President George \nBush with\n\n[[Page S6035]]\n\nmore loyalty than Bob Dole. He was always supporting the man who \ndefeated him, supporting him to the hilt. That is class.\n  I have no sadness. No, I am excited to know that this man will be out \nthere in America, and that the people of America will see what we here \nhave always seen in this man, a man of deep, personal conviction, a man \nof deep moral fortitude, guts, always telling the truth, and the strong \nleadership--a man who can make a decision and stick with it. Bold and \ncourageous are other examples of his leadership--purposeful, direct, \nand decisive.\n  So here we go. He will seek this job in the same way he has sought \neverything in his life, with that great energy, from that spirit. He \nhas great capability, so very competent, and we will all see this man \nas a deeply sensitive man, a decent--very decent--and caring man. I \nthink America is longing for that.\n  I wish him well, with this magnificent woman of charm and grace at \nhis side. God bless them both for, indeed--he is all the man there is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank Senator Simpson for his comments \nand for the excellent working relationship that he has enjoyed with \nSenator Dole over the years. As all of us know, he is retiring as well. \nCertainly, he will be missed. His wit and wisdom will be missed in this \nbody, as well.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate loses its leader, but \nour Nation and its people gain a leader. What this country needs at \nthis time is to see a good example coming from its political leaders. \nWhat this country needs is moral leadership. It is truly lacking, of \ncourse, in the current White House. I have been speaking out on this \nsubject of lack of moral leadership, with several specific examples of \nthat failed leadership by the President and First Lady, since March 19.\n  It is not enough to call Bob Dole a friend, a steady presence in the \nSenate, an ally. It is more important to know his qualities. These \nqualities are what make Bob Dole a leader. Above all else, Bob Dole has \nearned respect. You gain respect, Mr. President, by first showing \nrespect for others. He has done so. He has shown respect for his fellow \nKansans, for working men and women of America, for America's farmers, \nfor the small business entrepreneur, to his colleagues, for his party, \nbut, most of all, respect for America.\n  When you get Bob Dole, you get someone who will do what he says he \nwill do. That means you get a man of integrity. You get a person of \naccountability. He does not point the finger. The buck stops with Bob \nDole. He takes responsibility for his actions. That is important, Mr. \nPresident, because this is what America needs and needs right now. At a \ntime when public cynicism is riding a crest, fueled by the actions from \ncurrent leaders in the White House, we need Bob Dole's tie of \nleadership, because historically, the best leaders are those who have \nintegrity, who demonstrate fairness, and who have compassion.\n  If I have learned nothing else about Bob Dole in my 16 years serving \nwith him in the U.S. Senate, it is that he is a person of integrity, a \nperson who treats people fairly, and a person who has and demonstrates \ncompassion. One of the best experiences I have had with Bob Dole was \ncampaigning with him in my State of Iowa. The first time was in 1988. \nThe next time was this year. Whenever I introduced Bob Dole to the \npeople of Iowa, I introduced him as one of us. Iowans knew right away \nexactly what I meant. It meant that Bob Dole has the same roots as we \nhave--Midwestern, small town, rural, traditional values. He never \nforgot where he came from and how he got there. That is the mark of a \nhumble public servant. That is what our country so desperately needs \ntoday.\n  Yes, I will miss Bob Dole as a friend and a political ally. I will \nmiss him more as a leader. I take comfort in the fact that in losing a \nleader, the country is gaining one. For that, I can only be truly \ngrateful.\n  I say to citizen Dole, your new journey of a thousand miles begins \nwith this first step that you are taking today of leaving the Senate, \nsaying goodbye to the people's branch of Government, and going out \namong the people themselves. I wish you, Bob Dole, great success as our \nfuture leader.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Grassley from \nIowa for an outstanding statement.\n  I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, while I was presiding, I listened to the \naccolades and the very warm remarks that have been aimed toward our \nleader, Bob Dole, and so richly deserved by Senator Dole. I could think \nof only two characteristics that have not been brought up yet. They \ncame from two experiences that I had.\n  One was back when I was a very fresh, new, freshman Senator. I \nhappened to have been supporting Phil Gramm for President of the United \nStates, who was a primary opponent of Bob Dole's, only to find that he \nand I had a trip to take together from Washington out to Independence, \nKS, since we had been active in getting a very significant product \nliability bill passed that put America back into making airplanes \nagain. I got to thinking of traveling all the way with a guy when I was \nactually opposing him. I was very uncomfortable about it. I can tell \nyou during the entire trip, you would have thought I was his, Bob \nDole's, chairman. I have never seen a person so absolute in his \nforgiveness and understanding.\n\n  Second, a couple of years ago I can remember when Bob Dole was coming \nin to do a fundraiser for me at 7:30 in the morning in Tulsa, OK. By \ncoincidence, it happened to be the morning after the night they \nconsidered President Clinton's soft-on-crime bill. Bob Dole was really \nwrapped up in that. That was one of the disappointments he had. He lost \nit by one vote.\n  He got on a plane, it had to be sometime after midnight, came all the \nway to Oklahoma in a driving rainstorm, and was there at 7:30 in the \nmorning. His staff was exhausted. He looked like he was just showing up \nfor his first prom.\n  I have never seen a guy with energy like he has. The two \ncharacteristics, boundless energy and compassionate forgiveness, are \ntwo characteristics that will serve America in a grander way. What a \nguy.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank Senator Inhofe, my colleague, for his statement.\n  I now yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, nothing I can say here today can add to \nthe richness or the depth of the picture that has already been \npresented over the course of the last 2 weeks or so by other Members of \nthis body and by those outside of this body with respect to our \ncandidate for President and our retiring majority leader, Senator Bob \nDole. All I can do is to take that photograph from a very slightly \ndifferent angle and, I hope, make it at least a slightly deeper \nphotograph of a great man.\n\n  This is important, however, because the Bob Dole we, who have worked \nwith him for a year or for a decade, know is not the Bob Dole as he has \nbeen pictured to our fellow citizens all across the United States. It \nis exactly for that reason, of course, that he is leaving us and his \nmagnificent and, I believe, rewarding career in this body to share his \nreal character, his real personality with all of the people of the \nUnited States in his quest for the Presidency.\n  Bob Dole is, I think, first of all, a man of extraordinary patience--\nperhaps the single most significant requirement for a leader of a body \nof 99 other Members, all of whom most of the time feel that they are in \npossession of absolute truth or the precise way in which the Senate \nshould conduct its business.\n  Bob Dole seems never to have lost a sunny equanimity, even under the \nmost difficult circumstances. His wit seems never to have deserted him. \nHis willingness to listen to advice and counsel--almost always \nunsolicited--seems to have been infinite, and at the same time that he \nhas been willing to listen and been willing to consider the views from \ndisparate sectors, he has been possessed by a deep dedication to \nprinciple, to direction, and to love of country.\n  On the one hand, people in politics are criticized for being too \nrigid and not understanding and, on the other\n\n[[Page S6036]]\n\nhand, for being too compromising. Bob Dole is neither. He has that rare \ncombination of a dedication to principle and a willingness to listen \nand to accommodate the principles and ideas of others, which has made \nhim a great success, has caused him to be the longest-serving leader of \nthis party in the history of the U.S. Senate.\n  And so because of those winning traits of personality and those \ndeeper traits of character and principle, each of us who remain here in \nthe Senate will be slightly the lesser by reason of his leaving. He, on \nthe other hand, will be the better for it--for this surprising and \nprincipled decision, for his willingness to present himself to the \nAmerican people without the protection of any office on which to fall \nback.\n  I believe, Mr. President--and I believe firmly--that this open risk-\ntaking, courageous Bob Dole, whom we have known for as long as each of \nus has been in the Senate, and whom his friends, neighbors, and family \nhave known from his youth, will become increasingly known by, respected \nby, and loved by the people of the United States as he presents these \ntraits of character and personality to them during the balance of this \ncampaign.\n  So we wish him bon voyage, the best of good luck, and we wish to the \nAmerican people a new President with all of these wonderful \ncharacteristics for leadership and for making our country a better and \nstronger place in which to live.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gorton from Washington \nfor an outstanding statement.\n  I yield 5 minutes to Senator Ashcroft from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, when Abraham Lincoln walked onto the \nbattlefield at Gettysburg to commemorate what had been done there, he \nsuccinctly encapsulated the understanding that deeds far surpass words \nin terms of value. He said, ``The world will little note nor long \nremember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did \nhere.''\n\n  We are not talking this morning just to be talking, to be saying \nthings, but it is a way of helping people understand what Bob Dole has \ndone, who he has been, the depth of his care, and the breadth of his \nknowledge of how we need to proceed in America. It has been properly \nsaid that the world does not care how much you know until they know how \nmuch you care. And because Bob Dole has not been a person to sound his \nown trumpet, to tell people about himself, I think people have mistaken \nhim. They have not understood how much he cared, because Bob Dole has \nbeen a person who has answered the call every time the call has come. \nHe has not only answered the call, he has answered the call with \neverything--everything--at his disposal, the entirety of his existence.\n  In 1945, Bob Dole nearly gave up his life--and there would have been \nthose who said it was gone--to the call of duty. And, today, he \nrelinquishes the power and prerogatives of policy development in the \nSenate because he, similarly, will pursue a call from his country, a \ncall that we are pleased that he hears, a call to shape the tomorrows \nin which we live, a call to reestablish the fundamental values of \nAmerican greatness, to align himself with the virtues of the American \npeople, rather than the vices of a system that has really guided us \ndown the wrong path.\n  In 1945, Lt. Bob Dole volunteered to lead his company to take out a \nGerman machinegun nest. He scrambled out of a shell hole in order to \nrescue a fallen comrade. The Germans sighted Dole and blew apart the \nright side of his back. Few people would have had the courage to live \nas he has lived. He willed himself to recovery, with God's help, and \nwith the help of his neighbors. He willed himself to law school, and he \nwilled himself to run for office.\n  Many of the medical experts at the time had given up on Bob Dole. A \ndoctor from Chicago decided to try some things that were virtually \nexperimental and gave his services. The people of Russell, KS, donated \ntheir nickels, dimes, quarters, and dollars in the cigar box at the \npharmacy down on the corner to cover the expenses.\n  Bob Dole made a commitment that he would be an individual of service. \nWe need that kind of determination. We need that kind of grit. We need \nindividuals who have looked the very most serious of all circumstances \nin the face and have said, ``With God's help, we can overcome, we can \nprevail.'' And that is Bob Dole.\n  Well, America needed Bob Dole when, in 1945, he was willing to give \nhimself totally. They needed him when he went to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, they needed him when he became a Senator, and it needs \nhim today.\n  All of us know the statistics. A child born today will end up paying \n$187,000 in interest on the national debt if we do not do something \nabout it. Bob Dole has devoted himself not just to a balanced budget--\nsure, he sent two balanced budgets to the President this year--but to \nthe structure of a balanced budget; that is a balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution.\n  Bob Dole knows that American families spent about 3 percent of their \nincome on taxes in the 1950's, and now we spend almost 40 percent. He \nunderstands that Americans have an ability to spend on themselves and \nto do for themselves, if Government will stand aside. He understands \nthat, for a long time, Washington has acted as if Government were the \nanswer--faith in Government, governmentalism. He knows that is not the \nsolution, that Washington's one-size-fits-all solution is not the way \nto solve this Nation's problems. He knows that when we placed that \nfaith in Government, instead of ourselves, we injured ourselves.\n\n  Bob Dole really is going to go to the American people and say: You \nhave the quality, the character, and the capacity to do those things \nthat are necessary to shape the next century constructively. I am \ndelighted that he has so much commitment to this responsibility that he \nwould say, ``I walk away from the U.S. Senate in order to offer myself \nto the American people.''\n  When the American people learn about Bob Dole and get to know him the \nway we in the Senate know him, they will ask and demand that he be \nPresident of the United States. It will be a pleasure, as a Member of \nthe U.S. Senate, to remember his outstanding service to the people, not \njust in the military, in the House and the Senate, but as the leader of \nthis Republic. I am grateful for the opportunity to make these remarks \nregarding our majority leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Missouri. \nThat was a truly outstanding statement. I want to announce to my \ncolleagues that I have several colleagues seeking a lot more time than \nwe have available. I hate to disappoint colleagues because I know many \nwanted to speak prior to Senator Dole's speech at noon. We may not be \nable to accommodate everybody. I cannot accommodate everybody on the \nfloor, and that disappoints me greatly. If I stay on the order of \nrequests, the Senator from New Mexico actually has been here for some \ntime, and I know the Senator from Arizona has also. We actually have a \nunanimous-consent request that would allow Senator Byrd to speak at \n11:30. And the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from New Jersey \nwould like to speak. That makes it very difficult.\n\n  I would call on the Senator from New Mexico. I yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  If my colleagues could not spend all of that time it would be greatly \nappreciated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, fellow Senators, I think what I will do is start with \nwit. I think everybody remembers Bob Dole for a lot of things. I am \ngoing to mention five or six that make him my great friend. But I want \nto hearken back to a budget debate in 1990 that was a brief moment when \nwe were going to have a shutdown even back then for a very short period \nof time. And the tourists in the community were all kind of in turmoil \nbecause of various things that were going to be closed. And Senator \nDole said the following: ``If you are hanging around with nothing to do \nand the zoo is closed, come over to the Senate. You will get the same \nkind of feeling, and you will not have to pay for it.''\n  Mr. President, nobody should think that a statement like that in any \nway denigrates this great man.\n  I am really at a loss to say goodbye to him. But I am quite convinced \nthat\n\n[[Page S6037]]\n\nhe is leaving as a legend. He leaves a legacy of leadership second to \nnone in the entire history of the U.S. Senate. He leaves a legacy of \nlaws and concerns that are so broad and so deep that I am doubtful \nwhether his story ends in looking over the entire panorama of Senators \nfrom the beginning. I am very doubtful that they will find a Senator \nwith such a legacy.\n  Let me start with senior citizens. In 1983, Social Security was going \nbankrupt. Who took the lead in the Senate to make it solvent for 30 to \n40 years? Senator Bob Dole. When it comes to the young people of \nAmerica, some people choose to talk about programs. I choose to say Bob \nDole's deep and abiding concern for our young people is epitomized by \nhis constant fight to live within our means so that we do not have to \nhave our children and grandchildren pay our bills. Everything, from \nseniors to children and everything in between, has received the \nattention of this great man.\n  In fact, I will find it difficult. I think my feet will find me \nwalking down that hall and my feet will find me going into that office \nbecause I have done that so many times when we needed leadership.\n  The legacy of leadership that he leaves will be sorely missed, and \nonly history will indicate its true depth. Besides having wit, without \nwhich it is tough to run the Senate, he had courage. Can anyone forget \nthe night when we wheeled Pete Wilson in? He had an appendectomy. We \nbrought him in here from the hospital bed so we could get the vote, and \nso that Vice President Bush voting from the Chair could assure us of \nwhat would have been a balanced budget long before today that failed \nnot because of Bob Dole's leadership but because of something else.\n  So anybody following him better know that they better be honest; they \nbetter tell the Senate the truth for he knew no other way.\n  As he leaves, there is a bit of sorrow and even sadness, at least in \nmy heart. But in a very real sense I am very, very happy because I \nthink the American people now have a chance to meet, to know, and to \nunderstand the Bob Dole that we know. If they get that chance, he will \nbe the next President. He will be the next President of this great land \nwhere the same leadership that he gave to us will be there for \neveryone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I join my many colleagues in expressing \nmy congratulations to Senator Dole for a historic career in the \nCongress of the United States, which ended with his resignation today, \nand I also express my regrets that we will no longer have Robert J. \nDole as our majority leader and as our Republican leader.\n  I speak for both the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which I represent, \nand in a sense, also for Russell, KS, because Senator Dole and I both \ngrew up in Russell, KS. I moved to Russell from Wichita when I was 12 \nyears old, so I have known Senator Dole for a good many years. My \nfather, Harry Specter, was a friend of his father, Doran Dole. My dad \nwas in the junk business, and the only scale big enough at the time to \nweigh the junk yard truck was the Dole scale and elevator run by Bob \nDole's father. Our brothers, Kenny Dole and Morton Specter, both passed \naway at the same time, approximately 3 years ago.\n  Senator Dole's story is a story like Horatio Alger, except that Bob \nDole's story, compared to Horatio Alger, looks like Horatio Alger was \nborn with a silver spoon in his mouth. Both the Doles and the Specters, \nfiguratively, lived on the wrong side of the tracks. It is a true story \nthat the Dole family, during the depression, moved out of the first \nfloor of their home to live in the basement to help defray expenses at \na very tough time when Kansas was a dust bowl. Bob Dole grew up and \nworked at Dawson Drugs at the soda fountain. There is sort of a \nlegendary and famous story about how he would flip the ice cream and \ncatch it behind his back. I recounted that story not long ago on a \ncampaign appearance for the Presidency in Delaware County. Bob added \nthat sometimes when the ice cream fell to the floor, it became a \nchocolate shake. He went to college--a tough thing to do in the early \n1940's. Russell High School had the State debating championship, but \nBob Dole chose not to be a debater. He was a renowned high school \nathlete. And then we all know of his heroics during World War II, and \nof his injuries and how he laid his life on the line. He did not suffer \nloss of life but did suffer loss of limb, and came back with a \nphenomenal rehabilitation. So he has a real understanding of what it is \nlike to pull yourself up by your bootstraps when you have neither \nbootstraps nor arms to pull yourself up by; and has a real feeling for \nthe disabled; and a real understanding of the need for medical care; \nand a real understanding of what it is like to be an underdog. That \nhistoric, monumental rehabilitation has been recounted on many \noccasions.\n\n  Then he became a State legislator while going to law school. He came \nback and was county attorney, in Russell, KS. He told the story today \nabout how his parents had been Democrats and how he became a \nRepublican, checking the local registrations. I originally heard the \nstory in Russell, about how he was courted by both parties to become \ntheir nominee for county attorney and then checked the registration in \nRussell County and found it was 2 to 1 Republican. And as Senator Dole \nhas said previously, as a matter of conscience he instantly became a \nRepublican. And then so much of the rest is history: Elected to the \nHouse of Representatives in 1960 serving four terms, and then to the \nU.S. Senate in 1969.\n  I have had the privilege of serving with him in this body for the \nlast 15\\1/2\\ years. I watched him, as the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, and he did a really extraordinary job in that capacity. It \nwas in that capacity that I think Senator Dole earned the confidence of \nhis colleagues for the leadership position that he sought in 1984.\n  I recall the 1982 tax bill, when Senator Baker, then the majority \nleader, stood at the leadership position, and at 11:45 p.m. on that \ncomplex bill said that there were 63 amendments pending, amendments \nlike mushrooms grew overnight, and that we were going to plow ahead. \nStanding beside him was Senator Dole, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee. Senator Baker said Senator Dole thought we ought to \npersevere. We worked through the night, as it was Senator Baker's \ncustom to do on occasion. There were, perhaps, half a dozen rollcall \nvotes, many more voice votes, many amendments dropped. At 6:30 a.m. we \nwalked out of the Chamber having finished an extraordinary bill, which \nshowed Bob Dole's leadership.\n  Then we had the extraordinary election for majority leader in 1984, \ncontested by Senator Ted Stevens and Senator Pete Domenici and Senator \nDick Lugar and Senator Jim McClure. We had to have a series of ballots. \nFirst one dropped and then the next and then the next. And finally--and \nI happened to be sitting next to Senator Dole on the left-hand side of \nthe Chamber in the rear of the whole Senate when Senator Dole won by a \nnarrow margin of 28 to 25; two votes changed and Senator Dole went on \nto be the leader. I was in the photo in the scene when Senator Dole \nshook hands.\n  He was an extraordinary leader in many, many ways. Always a \nconciliator, always with a velvet touch. Some of us were not too easy \nto lead, in terms of the votes. But never a demand, never a ruffled \nfeeling, never a sense of pressure or, certainly, not undue pressure.\n  I recall legislation changing the Grove City decision by the Supreme \nCourt of the United States, as illustrative of what Senator Dole would \ndo. Senator Packwood and Senator Hatch were on opposite ends of the \nissue. Suddenly Senator Dole came up with compromise language. In \nunison, Bob Packwood and Orrin Hatch said, ``But that is unsatisfactory \nbecause it will leave the issue open to controversy as to what it \nmeans.'' Senator Dole smiled and said, ``That's the perfect solution.'' \nIt wasn't quite that language, but Senator Dole got it worked out.\n  Today's speech by Senator Dole, I think, was historic. I hope he can \ncontinue to speak with the same easygoing manner, the same light touch, \nthe same sense of substance, and at the same time, the same sense of \nhumor. Because I think if Senator Dole does that, he will really \nestablish a rapport with the American people for his next challenge.\n\n  In a sense, Senator Dole's farewell address to the Senate has \nsignificant similarity to George Washington's\n\n[[Page S6038]]\n\nfarewell address. It was a different time, a different tempo, different \ntenor, but I think it was a historic farewell address. This Chamber was \nfilled with respect and admiration, and, really, love.\n  I do not know, if on prior Senate occasions, there has been a \nrecording of the time sequence for the length of applause, but that \nevent speaks for itself as Senator Dole moved from one part of the \nChamber to the other, surrounded by his colleagues, both Democrats and \nRepublicans; many of the colleagues expressing themselves on more than \none occasion.\n  Then a few of us who were privileged to be his fellow Republicans in \nthe Republican caucus had an opportunity to hear Senator Dole's last \nspeech in the Mansfield Room. The balcony, now named for Senator Dole, \nas we have paid tribute to a few of our colleagues by memorializing \ntheir presence, became that accolade.\n  Then, at 3 or a little after 3, a number of us were waiting outside \nin the boiling Sun to watch him walk down the Senate steps for the last \ntime, at least the last time on the day of his resignation. The steps \nwere filled with well-wishers, staff, and citizens from all walks of \nlife. He came down and it was a symbolic transition from the U.S. \nSenate, where he had achieved such heights, walking out as citizen \nDole, to see the people of America.\n  When he finished saying goodbye to his colleagues on the steps, he \nmoved across the yard to greet Americans who were waiting to see him, \nsmell him, touch him. From there he moved over to the large crowd that \nwas assembled between the two chambers. I think it was a very, very \nsignificant and a symbolic move, as he has left the U.S. Senate in his \nquest for the Presidency of the United States.\n  It was obviously not an easy decision for Robert J. Dole to make, to \nleave the embellishments and accouterments of office, as majority \nleader, one of the loftiest positions in the Government of the United \nStates or in the world. But he did so in his quest for what he saw as a \nhigher calling.\n  In the contemporaneous time period with his departure, he addressed \none of the toughest issues in America, the issue of abortion, which has \nbeen the most divisive issue facing America since the Civil War, with \nhis characteristic and traditional Solomon-like judgment. It is a \npolitical issue, but worthy of a moment or two, leaving the Republican \nplatform intact to accommodate one segment of the party and offering \nthe olive branch, the spirit of tolerance and the big tent to another \nsegment of the party. Almost, in a sense, squaring the circle and \naccommodating almost seemingly irreconcilable differences. But that has \nbeen the life of Senator Dole. That has been his tradition as a young \nman growing up on the plains of Kansas where he learned, really, \nfundamental American values--accountability, integrity, honor, and \ntrust, serving his Nation so well in war and serving his Nation so well \nin peace.\n  Seeing him go is a tough thing for all of us who have known him, in \nmany ways over the years. We wish him the very best as he continues in \nhis quest to serve America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my comments appear in the Congressional \nRecord in advance of Senator Dole's statements. All of us could not be \nrecognized in the limited time before he spoke today, and although it \nis obvious on the face of my comments that they were made after he \nspoke, I would ask they appear in advance of his text, including my \nunanimous-consent request, so the sequence makes some semblance of \nsense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today we pay tribute to a man who has served \nhis country ably and well for well over 50 years, and who will be \nremembered for his leadership of an institution that is not easily led.\n  From his humble beginnings in the town of Russell, KS, Bob Dole has \ntaken seriously, and has exercised responsibly, his call to serve. \nWhile those of us who have served with him in this institution are \ndisappointed to see him go, and will miss him, he has greater \nchallenges and rewards ahead. I believe Bob Dole will go on to engage \nthis Nation in a critical debate over the next few months about where \nAmerica is headed as we approach the turn of the century. The United \nStates, and the office of the Presidency, need Bob Dole's leadership \ndesperately. The words ``noble'' and ``man of integrity'' are not often \nused to describe the current occupant of the White House. Yet they are \nwords that come to mind immediately to describe Bob Dole.\n  Bob Dole did not shirk his responsibility to fight for his country \nduring World War II. He accepted it, fought bravely in Italy, and \nnearly paid the ultimate price--his life, for his country. Bob Dole is \nnow willing to sacrifice his political career in order to meet the \nchallenge of defeating Bill Clinton, restoring fiscal sanity to \nAmerican Government, and restoring honor to the office of the \nPresidency.\n  Bob Dole has been well prepared through 27 years of Senate service to \nassume the Presidency. He has led Republicans through long years in the \nminority, and has more recently led us to some significant \naccomplishments in our effort to roll back Government and ever-\nincreasing Government spending.\n  Bob Dole's skills are not well known to most Americans, because many \nAmericans are unfamiliar with what it takes to make this side of \nCongress work. The Founding Fathers set up the U.S. Senate as an \ninstitution to protect the rights of the minority. This is a place \nwhere, in fact, a Senator adhering to minority viewpoint has much \ngreater power in many ways than a Senator whose view reflects the will \nof the majority party. One Senator can hold up landmark legislation \nsimply by taking to the floor and refusing to relinquish it. A \nsignificant minority, 41 Senators of 100, can thwart the will of the \nmajority party simply by refusing to cut off debate.\n  Bob Dole understands these challenges. As minority leader for many of \nthe 9 years I have been in the Senate, he used the rules effectively to \nprotect the rights of a significant minority. This was referred to in \nthe media as gridlock, but it is really the way the institution was \ndesigned, to protect the Nation from the passions of the moment and to \nprovide for reasoned, reflective debate.\n  Since assuming the role of majority leader, he has managed to \novercome challenges raised by the Democratic minority, and hold his \ntroops together to pass significant legislation. Under his watch, the \nSenate has passed and sent to the President the first balanced budget \nin a generation, meaningful welfare reform, the Congressional \nAccountability Act, legislation preventing unfunded mandates on State \nand local entities, and regulatory relief. The President has vetoed the \ntwo most significant of these initiatives: namely a balanced budget and \nwelfare reform.\n  The speeches we give today in honor of Bob Dole sound a lot like \neulogies, but they are in reality reminiscences of a stage in Bob \nDole's life. He will go on to do even greater things. He will continue \nhis long and distinguished career of service to country by holding its \nhighest office, and will restore to that office the respect and honor \nof the American people.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, as we all know, Bob Dole will resign \nfrom the Senate to run for the Presidency today.\n  It was a courageous decision--but also a sad one for the Senate.\n  I am personally proud of Senator Dole. I think it is the right \ndecision.\n  I strongly believe that when the American people are given the chance \nto know Senator Dole and his wife Elizabeth better--the polls will \nchange dramatically--and he will be elected President.\n  Senator Dole was raised in an era in America when hard work and \nstrong values were rewarded. This is an era that we can have once again \nin America, if Bob Dole is elected President.\n  When Senator Dole's country called on him to serve--he went, and \nalmost gave his life. He didn't flee the country and protest against it \nfrom overseas.\n  When his family struggled in the depression--they didn't seek a \nGovernment handout--instead they rented their own home and lived in the \nbasement to get by.\n  He didn't allow his war injuries to sideline him in a hospital for \nthe remainder of his life--instead he picked himself up and rose to one \nof the highest positions in the Government and became a candidate for \nVice President and now a candidate for President.\n\n[[Page S6039]]\n\n  Bob Dole will bring to the Office of President the values of his \nupbringing. He will not spend the taxpayers' money irresponsibly. He \nwill not put this country further into debt. He will not coddle \ncriminals that threaten our communities. He will not tolerate drug use \nin the White House or tolerate a disrespect for our Armed Forces.\n  This is the Bob Dole that has been our majority leader. And, I am \nconfident this is the man that American people will want to be their \nPresident.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to echo my colleagues' gratitude \nto a remarkable Senator and majority leader, Bob Dole. Few Members of \nCongress can boast similar years of commitment to our country. In fact, \nSenator Dole's entire life has been dedicated to public service; from \nhis brave service in World War II, to his service in the Kansas State \nLegislature, the U.S. House, and for the past 27 years our U.S. Senate. \nHe has devoted his life to serving the people of Kansas and our \ncountry. I truly admire his agility in handling the people's business \nin this body, the U.S. Senate.\n  It will be difficult to imagine the Senate floor without Bob Dole. We \nhave always had a cordial and collegial working relationship. I have \nadmired his wily way of moving legislation. He often commented on my \nway with a quip.\n  I think it's fair to say that members of both parties have learned \nfrom Bob Dole. His mastery of Senate procedure, and his skill at moving \nlegislation, are matched by few in this Chamber.\n  I thank Senator Dole for his service in the Senate. In an age when \nover half of married couples can't stay dedicated to each other for 10 \nyears, it's remarkable for someone to stay dedicated to an institution \nas tempestuous as the U.S. Senate for 27 years.\n  With deep admiration and respect for a trusted colleague, I wish \nSenator Dole all the best.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, Bob Dole first came to Congress at a \ntime when the world--and he himself--was still recovering from the \nwounds of war, and America, catapulted into world leadership, was about \nto enter one of the most difficult periods in our young history as our \nNation became bitterly divided over the Vietnam conflict.\n  These events shaped the man who came to Washington to represent his \nhome State of Kansas back in 1960. And, from my experience in working \nwith him over the last few years in the U.S. Senate, it is clear that \nBob Dole never forgot the values those experiences taught him. He has \nleft an imprint on this body that deserves our recognition and our \nthanks.\n  Having nearly given his life for his country in the battle for \nfreedom, Bob Dole brought strong convictions about honor and public \nservice with him to the U.S. Congress.\n  And, having seen this Nation spill blood in battling its own \nconscience, he understood that--even in the rough and tumble world of \npolitics--we can not afford to forget the warnings of our predecessors: \nUnited we stand; divided we fall. Bob Dole's tenure as majority leader \nreflected these convictions.\n  He leaves the Senate having made an indelible mark on this body with \nhis ability as a leader, his skill as a statesman, and his commitment \nto the service of his country.\n  I have not always agreed with Bob Dole, but I have never found his \ndoor closed. That, to me, says more about the man than anything else. \nIn my view, the mark of a true statesman is his willingness to listen \nto all sides of an issue in a search for common ground. But the mark of \na leader is the ability to move people forward in spite of our \ndifferences in search of progress.\n  Although I have not known Bob Dole for very long--I came to this body \nin 1993 and worked with him, first as minority leader, then as majority \nleader--I have come to hold high respect for him, and think of him \nfondly. These are very tumultous times, and his was no easy task.\n  I have been particularly struck, time and again, by his willingness \nto seek solutions by forging agreements--even in circumstances where he \nhad the votes to win on an issue and did not need to regotiate.\n  I remember when the issue of moving the United States Embassy in \nIsrael to Jerusalem arose last year in Congress. Senator Dole had all \nthe votes he needed to pass a resolution supporting the move. And yet, \nhe listened to those of us who had concerns about the impact the \nwording of this resolution would have on what, at the time, was a very \ndelicate phase of the peace negotiations in the Middle East.\n  He did not have to listen. He chose to listen, and he chose to \naddress our concerns. And we passed better legislation as a result. \nThat is leadership.\n  I have been struck by his forthrightness as majority leader--his word \nwas his commitment, and his commitment was a matter of honor. These \nhave been difficult times. But, although he and I did not always end up \non the same side of an issue, I knew Bob Dole cared more about the \nintegrity of the democratic process than he cared about short term \npolitical gain, and that he respected each and every Senator's place in \nthat process--because we represent the America people.\n  No, we did not always agree. But even on issues where we disagreed, I \nalways knew where I stood, and I knew I could trust his word.\n  Robert Dole will be remembered for his lifetime of service to the \nAmerican people, and for helping to shape the course of our Nation \nduring some of the most pivotal times.\n  He deserves our praise and our thanks, and we wish him and Elizabeth \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, next in order for appearance, I know on \nthe unanimous consent request Senator Byrd had this time. He is not \nhere right now. I yield to the Senator from Arizona 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, when Americans came home from World War \nTwo the time reserved for celebrating their hard won victory was of \nnecessity brief. Joyous though those celebrations were, they had to \ngive way quickly to the hard work of repairing the damage done to \nfamilies and communities by the long separations and tragic losses \nwhich war visits on the victors as well as the vanquished.\n  But Americans, having defeated the Axis Powers, were upon the moment \nof that success obliged to assume the new responsibility of leading the \nfree world's resistance to the imperial ambitions of our former ally, \nthe Soviet Union. By so doing, they undertook a mission of immense \nproportions and difficulty, but great historic significance and \nnobility.\n  For it was the Americans who fought so valiantly from Guadalcanal to \nNormandy who would then devote their lives to ensuring that the second \nhalf of this century not collapse into the bloody calamities or succumb \nto the aggression of freedom's adversaries that made this century one \nof the most violent and tragic times in recorded human history. At both \nthe mid point and the end of the 20th century, these Americans ranked \namong the greatest generations of our countrymen. They are accorded \nthat distinction for their dedication to their country's cause and \nhumanity's hope, and for the dimensions of the victories won by their \ndevotion, selflessness, ingenuity and courage.\n  Even in this distinguished company, Bob Dole stands out. When he \nreturned from war he could not, as many of his comrades could, \nimmediately pursue the veteran's dream of building a peaceful and \nprosperous life. He had to first rebuild himself. The exemplary courage \nand determination he brought to his own recovery is the stuff legends \nare made of. And they are also America's good fortune for they are the \nsame virtues he offered in his subsequent years of service to the \nadvancement of our country.\n  In these days when more and more young Americans are attracted to the \nmores of the detached and indifferent cynic, to the affectations of \nHollywood anti-heroes, Bob Dole's life is a rebuke to those corrupting \ninfluences on our popular culture. When I am asked by anxious parents: \nwhere are today's American heroes by whose example I can instruct my \nchildren?; the list of such Americans I can offer in response is still \na long one. But I can identify no better example than the man to whom \nwe wish good luck today. Bob Dole is what an American hero is supposed \nto be.\n  His sacrifice in war and his hard road to recovery earned Bob Dole \nthe peace\n\n[[Page S6040]]\n\nand quiet to live a life of personal pursuits, of individual attainment \nand success. But he chose instead to chase his country's dreams. And in \nAmerica's historical mission to contain and defeat Soviet imperialism \nand to wrench from this violent century some greater hope for \nhumanity's progress in the next. Bob Dole brought the patriotic \noptimism of the young soldier off to war, but he brought also the \nveteran's appreciation for the dimension and seriousness of the task \nbefore us. He enlisted again in the war against totalitarians, and \nagain he is in the front ranks of those who earned the victory.\n  Bob Dole's Senate leadership was essential to the efforts of \nPresidents Reagan and Bush to win the cold war. He built majority \ncoalitions for the defense build up of the 1980's, helping to restore \nthe readiness and modernization of our Armed Forces which had been so \nbadly neglected in the previous decade.\n  He has been a consistent and skillful advocate for ballistic missile \ndefense beginning in 1973 with his support for the Sam-D, the \npredecessor to the Patriot missile, continuing with his support for SDI \nand ending most recently with his sponsorship of the Defend America \nAct. In his determination to provide Americans with an affordable and \nadequate defense from the greatest danger facing our country, Bob Dole \nhas shown the vision and the will required to meet the security threats \nthat will confront policymakers in the 21st century.\n  Senator Dole organized congressional support for Reagan Doctrine \npolicies which gave critical assistance to freedom fighters confronting \nSoviet aggression from Nicaragua to Afghanistan. Together with his \nsupport for our defense build up and a strategic defense system, \nSenator Dole's commitment to sustaining the front line resistance to \nSoviet imperialism hastened the collapse of the Soviet Union, and made \npossible the liberation of millions whose rights had long been denied \nthem as citizens of captive nations.\n  As cracks in the Soviet empire became the breech that brought down \nthe Berlin Wall, Bob Dole hastened the final dissolution of the Soviet \nUnion by sponsoring the Direct Aid to the Republics Act which provided \ndirect assistance and trade relations to the Soviet Republics, \nbypassing Moscow, and further weakening the Kremlin's control over its \nsubject peoples.\n  In the first crisis of the post-cold-war world, Iraq's invasion of \nKuwait, Bob Dole cautioned President Bush to seek congressional \nauthority for Operation Desert Storm, and then employed his peerless \nlegislative skills to win majority support for authorization over a \nvery determined opposition, sending a message of American unity to \nSaddam Hussein.\n  More recently, Bob Dole's consistent, principled support for the \nlegitimate Government of Bosnia and the strong Senate majority he built \nfor his position forced our own Government and our allies to replace \ntheir previous indecision and indifference with the resolve to enable \nthe Bosnian people to resist aggression, and determine for themselves \ntheir nation's fate.\n  Mr. President, my time is nearly up, and the brevity of this tribute \nhis required me to offer only an abbreviated, very incomplete list of \nBob Dole's many important contributions to the security of the United \nStates. Suffice it to say, that Bob Dole is a statesman who has worked \ntirelessly and effectively to protect other Americans from having to \npay as a high a price for love of country as he was once asked to pay.\n  Before I close, Mr. President, I would like to offer a personal \nexpression of gratitude to my leader.\n  I have had the honor in my life of being commanded by a great many \nbrave, resourceful, and decent leaders, but none more so than our \nfriend, Bob Dole. A long time ago, in another walk of life, I lived for \na period of time without liberty. I and a great many men whose courage \nand honor enabled me to endure that experience wanted nothing more than \nto keep faith with our country and for our country to keep faith with \nus. When well-intentioned Members of this institution unwittingly \nattempted to break faith with us by denying support for the war \nnecessary to ensure our eventual liberation, Bob Dole led the \nopposition to that effort. For 7 weeks he forcefully debated a cutoff \nof funding while so many of America's sons remained the prisoners of \nour enemies. All the while he waged that debate, Bob Dole wore a \nbracelet that bore my name. I have never properly thanked him for the \ngreat honor he did me. I wish to do so now. For myself, for my comrades \nwho came home with me, and for the many thousands who did not, thank \nyou, Bob, for the honor of your concern and support for us. We fought \nin different wars, but we kept the same faith.\n  Bob Dole leaves the Senate now, and all of us, Democrat and \nRepublican alike, know in our hearts we will not soon see his like \nagain in our ranks. But he leaves only to continue his service to \nAmerica from another office. I take considerable comfort from that. For \nI know that the tasks that confront us as we consolidate our cold war \nvictories and make for our children and our children's children \nanother, better world than the one in which we lived most of our lives \nrequire the service of an American who appreciates from his experience \nand from his heart the indispensability of American leadership. This is \na daunting responsibility, which is shared by all of us. But I am \nreassured that we will not be found wanting in our assignment by my \nconfidence that Bob Dole will soon be our leader again and that our \nNation will still benefit from the service of this honorable man.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I compliment Senator McCain for an outstanding, moving, \ninspirational speech that I hope my colleagues will have a chance to \nreview.\n  I ask unanimous consent to postpone the time allocated to Senator \nByrd and Senator Daschle to 11:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield to the Senator from New Jersey, 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, today Bob Dole will leave the Senate. I \nhave served with him for nearly 18 years, during which time, at \ndifferent times, he has been the ranking member and chairman of the \nFinance Committee, minority leader, and majority leader.\n  Over the years I have disagreed with him often, but I have also \nworked with him on many things, from one of my first amendments in the \nSenate on the strategic petroleum reserve to closing tax loopholes in \n1982 to tax reform in 1986 to maternal and child health care issues to \nGATT agreements to aid to the Bosnian Moslems and countless other \nissues.\n  Bob Dole is a good man and an extraordinary legislator. Although he \nis personally shy, he knows how to build a political consensus, use \npower, make things happen. He keeps his word, which is an essential \ningredient in building trust. He listens well, a trait of the very best \nlegislators.\n  Any time you are trying to build a bipartisan majority, which is more \nthe way it used to be in the Senate than the way it is now, you have to \nbe able to listen. You have to understand intuitively where someone's \nbottom line is. And when an agreement will not be reached, you cannot \nview the other person as flawed, corrupt, and stupid, and expect that \ntomorrow they will forget your attitude. I do not remember Bob Dole \never acting out of a grudge or perhaps even harboring one. He never \nburned his bridges.\n  One afternoon in my office more than a few years ago, Senator Dole \nand I visited with a Russian politician named Boris Yeltsin whose visit \nI was sponsoring. Yeltsin had been over an hour late and we were 25 \nminutes into our discussion when one of his aides informed him he was \nan hour late for a meeting with Secretary of State Baker, to which \nYeltsin responded by saying, ``Humph, who cares about an appointed \nminister when I am meeting with those who are elected by the people.''\n\n  To which Dole responded, ``He's got his priorities right.''\n  That was the voice of Bob Dole, the democrat, the man who has a deep \nand abiding respect for the will of the people. Time and time again the \npeople of Kansas gave him their votes. Although Senator Dole has given \nhis life to public service, I sense he would be one of the first in \nthis body to admit that a legislator's accomplishments are like sand \ncastles built at the edge of the ocean surf--short-lived and often \nforgotten.\n  Therefore, the only thing that any of us as Senators have is whether \nthose\n\n[[Page S6041]]\n\nwho worked with us gave us their respect, and those who elected us felt \nwell-served. In Senator Dole's case, I think the answer to each is yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last year I indicated to my colleague from \nWest Virginia, Senator Byrd, that one of the real privileges of my \nbeing able to serve in the U.S. Senate was to serve here while he \nserved in the U.S. Senate. I told Senator Byrd that. I was thinking \nlast evening that I feel the same way about Senator Dole. It has been \nan enormous privilege to serve in the Senate at the same time that \nSenator Dole has served in this Senate. He has demonstrated an enduring \ncommitment to public service that represents the kind of public service \nthat we owe a substantial debt for in our country. He is truly the Cal \nRipken of public service in the Senate year after year after year, \ndoing his job and doing it the way the American people hope public \nservants will do their jobs.\n  I am here today only to say I wish Senator Robert Dole well. The \nSenate will miss him. Those of us who have had the privilege of working \nwith him honor his commitment to public service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleague from North Dakota, and I yield 2 \nminutes to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, from his earliest days on the sports \nfields through his military career to his days in the Senate, Bob \nDole's destiny was and is leadership. How greatly has he enriched the \nlives of all of us here in the U.S. Senate. Like my good friend, \nSenator Bradley, I was there on the Yeltsin trip. I remember that. I \nalso remember accompanying Senator Dole to a hilltop in Italy, near the \nsmall village where he was struck down by enemy fire. But the hand of \ndestiny reached down, the hand of Providence, and brought him back to \nserve this great Nation, to serve the world, and to become a great \nleader.\n  He will take his place--modestly, he might not acknowledge this--but \nhe will take his place with Everett Dirksen, with whom our \ndistinguished senior colleague, Mr. Byrd, served; with Howard Baker and \nwith Hugh Scott. In that row of great Republican leaders, he has earned \nhis spot.\n  Commander in Chief, a position to which he aspires, and a position in \nthe Constitution of the United States he has fought to preserve on the \nfloor of this Senate from the first day that he stepped entered this \nChamber, irrespective of who has been in that office. He has been a \nstaunch defender of the prerogatives of the Commander in Chief. I was \nproud to join with him on January 12, 1991, when we stood together for \nthe Persian Gulf resolution, to give the Commander in Chief the \nauthority to use force in the gulf. That was a hard-fought battle, a \ndebate ending in a vote of 52 to 47.\n  Most recently, in my own endeavors, he stood beside me. He did not \nhave to do it. He stood beside one of his colleagues in the name of \nfriendship and he said, ``It's not all politics. It's friendship.''\n  Mr. President, I close by reading a brief quotation that I carry with \nme at all times. It relates to Bob Dole. Thomas Jefferson once said:\n\n       I had laid it down as law to myself, to take no notice of \n     the thousands of insults issued against me but to trust my \n     character to my own conduct and to the good sense and candor \n     of my fellow citizens.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Virginia \nand now recognize the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise to say farewell to my friend and \nlongstanding colleague, the able Senator from Kansas, the Senate \nmajority leader, Bob Dole. Bob Dole has responded to the call of duty \nthroughout all of his adult life, and we are all the richer for his \ndedication and his work. His life and his service have made a \ndifference.\n  American politics is a rough and tumble occupation, and we in this \nChamber are all too familiar with the savagery, the criticism, the \nnegativity that have so infected political life in our day. But there \nare times when politics must be put aside, and the honest, heartfelt \ncontributions that we each and all make as servants of the people must \nbe acknowledged.\n  I congratulate the majority leader on his long and distinguished \nservice in the Senate, and before that in the House of Representatives, \nand before that, in the Kansas Legislature, to which he was elected at \nthe young age of 26. As one of his fellow Americans, I thank him for \nhis service and his bravery during World War II.\n  It has been a privilege and it has been a pleasure to work with \nSenator Dole in the leadership positions given to both of us by our \ncolleagues, first when he was majority leader and I was minority \nleader, and then when our roles were reversed.\n  Senator Dole and I are the only floor leaders in Senate history to \nmove from majority leader to minority leader and then back again to \nmajority leader. I guess it is a classic case of what comes around goes \naround; or what goes around, comes around. Often, I have pondered this \nturning of the Senate wheel, a continuing rotation of individuals of \ndifferent temperaments and talents, of opposing beliefs and varied \nbackgrounds.\n  I have been honored to serve in the Congress of the United States for \nalmost 44 years. I have witnessed the comings and I have witnessed the \ngoings of many fine men and women. Some were extraordinary leaders, \nlike Joe Martin, of Massachusetts; Sam Rayburn, of Texas; Lyndon \nJohnson, of Texas; Everett Dirksen, of Illinois; Hugh Scott, of \nPennsylvania; and Howard Baker, of Tennessee; and Mike Mansfield, of \nMontana; who served as Senate majority leader for 16 years. Many made \noutstanding contributions to their country and were considered \nirreplaceable in their time. And yet our brief appearance upon the \nSenate stage is only temporary. It is applauded, remarked upon and then \nforgotten, washed away like footprints in the sand by the next turn of \nthe wheel and the next wave of events.\n\n  But through it all, the Senate endures and goes on like Tennyson's \nbrook--forever. It is far, far greater than the sum of its 100 parts.\n  Senator Dole, in his four terms in the House and five in the Senate, \nhas been a serious and successful legislator. He was the 1,645th person \nto have taken the oath of U.S. Senator. He has served as leader of his \nparty in the Senate longer than any other Republican--10 years, 11 \nmonths and 20 days, today. Bob Dole has served longer as a Republican \nin Congress--35 years, 5 months and 8 days--than any other current \nRepublican Member of the Senate and House. Additionally, he is the only \nKansas Senator to have chaired the Senate Finance Committee.\n  He has earned the respect of his colleagues. He has been a hands-on \nleader, often working personally with other Senators and staff to craft \nlegislative compromises and solutions to difficult national questions.\n  As Republican leader, both when he served as majority leader and as \nminority leader, he was always available to work on solutions to \nproblems of both a national and international nature. He gave his time, \nincluding the hours spent away from the Chamber and the Hill, wrestling \nwith those solutions.\n  I have fond memories of the time that we worked together in the 100th \nCongress, when I served as majority leader and he was the minority \nleader, and we succeeded in crafting important legislation, including \nthe landmark Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. Together, \nwe developed a new trade tool for the United States called ``the super \n301 law,'' which required annual reviews of foreign trade practices, \nthe identification of priority foreign country practices against \nAmerican products, and the triggering of automatic investigations \nagainst such countries' practices.\n  Senator Dole has been particularly attentive and active in the \nforeign policy and national security areas. While we have not always \nagreed on specific policies, he has been a major contributor to our \nNation's policies regarding the Soviet Union before its collapse,\n\n[[Page S6042]]\n\narms control, Bosnia, and the Gulf war with Iraq, to name a few \nimportant examples.\n  When he was majority leader in 1985 and I was minority leader, \ntogether we created the arms control observer group to monitor arms \ncontrol negotiations and treaties with the Soviet Union. Together, we \nled a Senate delegation to the opening of United States-Soviet arms \ncontrol negotiations in Geneva that year. We also traveled together at \nthe request of President Reagan to Moscow to celebrate the historic \nexchange of instruments by Presidents Reagan and Gorbachev ratifying \nthe INF treaty.\n  In the order of domestic policy, Senator Dole has been a long-time \ncentral figure on farm legislation. He has amassed an impressive record \nof service on behalf of the disabled and the handicapped. He has \nparticularly advanced the cause of handicapped children.\n  While I have enjoyed working together with Bob Dole, and sometimes \nhave equally enjoyed working at odds with him on various issues, I am \nsaddened that he is leaving the Senate. He will cast a long shadow as \nhe goes.\n\n     It isn't enough to say in our hearts\n     That we like a man for his ways;\n     It isn't enough that we fill our minds\n     With psalms of silent praise;\n     Nor is it enough that we honor a man\n     As our confidence upward mounts;\n     It's going right up to the man himself\n     And telling him so that counts.\n\n     So when a man does a deed that you really admire,\n     Don't leave a kind word unsaid.\n     In fear to do so will make him vain\n     And cause him to lose his head.\n     But reach out your hand and tell him, ``Well done,''\n     And see how his gratitude swells.\n     It isn't the flowers we strew on the grave,\n     It's the word to the living that tells.\n\n  And so I say to my friend, Bob Dole, ``Well done.''\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me begin by complimenting the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia for his eloquence. Following \nhis words is a very difficult task.\n  Senator Dole has said that he wants to be judged now as just a man. \nBut I think history will judge him as something more--a good leader, a \ngood Senator, a good American. When you are from a small State in the \nMidwest, there seems to be a sense of pride in someone who makes it to \nthe top the hard way, with hard work, with fairness, with adherence to \nprinciple.\n  Regardless of politics, religion or education, when someone starts at \nthe lower rung and makes it all the way up, there is a pervasive \nfeeling of ownership, of affinity that he is one of our own, a \nMidwestern sense of self-respect that he is like us, and now just look \nat where he is, what he has done and how he has done it. That is \nespecially true when adversity hits. When someone rises above adversity \nto make it against the odds, the admiration grows greater. The greater \nthe adversity, the greater the adherence to principle and decency, the \ngreater the admiration.\n  Maybe that is why someone from South Dakota, someone of different \npolitics, different religion, different education can reflect on the \nadmiration that I hold for Bob Dole with the sincerity that I do now.\n  I have had the good fortune to work closely with the majority leader \nnow for 18 months. The conditions for a good working relationship could \nnot have been much worse. We had just lost the majority. He was the \nlikely nominee to run against a Democratic President, and the House \nRepublican leadership, now also in the majority, had proposed a \nContract With America. Of course, the events over the past year and a \nhalf could easily have led to bitterness and personal animosity of \nmajor consequence. I have no doubt that in virtually any other set of \ncircumstances, there would have been no other result.\n  The fact that it did not occur, and in spite of it all we remained \nfriendly, is due to Bob Dole and who he is. His civility, his \npragmatism, his quick wit, his self-effacing humor have not only served \nhim well these past 45 years of public life, but have served his \ncolleagues and his country well, too. His sense of fairness and decency \nis a standard by which all people in public life should be held. He \nbelieves in the institutions of democracy and has helped guide his \nparty and this body in a way that has enhanced them, too.\n  While our philosophical differences are great, his willingness to do \nwhat is difficult has been a source of admiration and respect for us \nall. His courage in standing for principle has been evident from the \nstart.\n  It was there when he broke ranks with his party to support the \nlandmark civil rights measures of the 1960's, most notably the Civil \nRights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Acts of 1965 and 1982.\n  It was there when he championed landmark nutrition programs with a \nvisionary leader and a giant from South Dakota whose name was George \nMcGovern.\n  It was there in 1991 when he and our colleague, Tom Harkin, arguably \ndid more for the disabled than anyone in our Nation's history.\n  And it was there in this Congress when, against all political advice, \nhe fashioned a resolution on Bosnia that led to broad support for our \ntroops being stationed there.\n  I am grateful to Senator Dole for that leadership, for the decency \nand fairness he has demonstrated to me over these past 18 months. I \nhave learned from him. It has been an invaluable education.\n  It has always impressed me that Bob Dole would come to my office for \na meeting--the seasoned leader coming to the newcomer, the majority \nleader, coming to the minority leader's office. I thought it was yet \nanother demonstration of Bob Dole's grace and demeanor. I know now that \nit was. I also learned that in doing so, this man, with the experience \nof thousands of such meetings, could always be the one to determine \nwhen the meeting was over.\n  I regret that we did not accomplish more together in these last 2 \nyears. Obviously, bad timing was a factor. Our accomplishments have \nbeen eclipsed by our partisanship in the eyes of the American people. \nStill, nothing should cloud America's view of just a man from Kansas \nwho began with little, who in fighting for this country lost almost all \nthat he had, who came back to help lead his party and his country with \ncourage and civility, who leaves this place with the gratitude of us \nall.\n  While I cannot wish him ultimate success at his next political \nventure, Linda and I wish Elizabeth and Bob Dole well in their new life \nahead. May it be filled with good health and much happiness. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The able Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of all my colleagues in \nthe Senate, Democrat and Republican, to say thank you to Senator Dole \nfor his years of service in Congress, House and Senate, but especially \nthe Senate, especially for his leadership, for his willingness to \nreally embody what leadership is all about.\n  The man from Russell, KS, has indeed done very well. The man from \nRussell, KS, has overcome a lot of difficulties, and truly been a \nnational hero. I was with Senator Warner, Senator Mack, and Senator \nDole in Italy where Senator Dole nearly lost his life in Castel Diano, \nand I realized what real leadership was all about, that a young man \nfrom Russell, KS, risked his life, almost gave his life, to reestablish \nfreedom in a faraway land. I saw the love and respect that the people \nhad in northern Italy for Senator Dole, and my respect and admiration \nfor him only grew. It has grown as we have shared many fine years in \nserving together, and I thought about this, most of our colleagues here \nhave only known Senator Dole as the leader or minority leader. Some \nhave had the pleasure of serving with Senator Baker and Senator Byrd, \nas majority leader, but to our leader, we want to say thank you for \nyour service not only to Kansas but to our country, for reaching out in \nbipartisan fashion and making great changes for this country.\n  I remember when you were elected chairman of the Finance Committee,\n\n[[Page S6043]]\n\ntax rates were 70 percent. When you were finished, they were 28 \npercent. The economy really grew. You forged bipartisan working \nrelationships with everyone. You are well liked by every Member in this \nbody.\n\n  I want to apologize to my friends and colleagues that have been \ncoming to me for the last hours, saying, ``I want to speak,'' because \nwe could not accommodate all the requests. I ask unanimous consent \nfollowing the swearing in of Senator Frahm, that we will keep the \nRecord open for the remainder of the day so that remarks can be added \nto the remarks made earlier this morning.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. To our leader, I say that you embody what we think is \ngreat about a leader. That is character. That is integrity. That is \nloyalty. You have earned the respect not only of your colleagues, you \nhave earned the respect of all Americans.\n  To our leader, again, a man from Russell, KS, you are our friend. You \nwill always be our friend. We wish you and Elizabeth every success this \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6028-5", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE ROBERT J.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 258 that I now \nsend to the desk.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The Assistant Secretary of the Senate read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 258) to designate the balcony \n     adjacent to rooms S-230 and S-231 of the United States \n     Capitol Building as the ``Robert J. Dole Balcony.''\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the resolution that I now send to the \ndesk on behalf of myself and Senator Daschle is a resolution that \nfollows a great tradition in the Senate where we name rooms, sometimes \nbuildings, after our colleagues. We have buildings--the Russell \nBuilding, Hart, and Dirksen, all named after outstanding Senators.\n  On the first floor of this building we have the Hugh Scott Room named \nafter a former Republican leader, and down the hall the Mansfield Room, \nanother great leader who served the longest as Senate majority leader, \nand we also have the Howard Baker Room that is now the Office of \nSenator Dole. All these honors were a very fine and noble tribute.\n  But the tribute we name today, or the one we are making today is \nnaming the balcony adjacent to the Office of the Republican Leader as \nthe Robert J. Dole Balcony. It was Senator Dole who asked this balcony \nbe made accessible to legislators and to the leaders. I can tell you \nthat there has been a lot of good legislative work done on that \nbalcony. I can also tell you that sometimes the balcony is called ``the \nDole Beach.''\n  To our leader, we wanted to have a lasting remembrance, because you \nare part of this Capitol. You are part of this institution. You are one \nof the reasons why this institution is greatly respected, because of \nthe respect we have for you.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 258) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 258\n\n       Resolved, That the balcony adjacent to rooms S-230 and S-\n     231 of the United States Capitol Building is hereby \n     designated as, and shall hereafter be known as, the ``Robert \n     J. Dole Balcony''.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The able majority leader, Senator Dole of \nKansas, is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. I appreciate very much the resolution just passed. Will it \nbe in big letters or neon? I know it cannot have any political \nadvertising on it. Just have the name out there in lights the next few \nmonths. I thank all of my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6043-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6043-S6046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               FAREWELL ADDRESS OF SENATOR ROBERT J. DOLE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I want to go back 136 years ago this summer. \nA committee arrived in Springfield, IL--Senator Simon probably knows \nthe story--and it formally notified Abraham Lincoln that the Republican \nParty had nominated him to run for President. History records that \nLincoln's formal reply to the news was just two sentences long. And \nthen as he surveyed the crowd of friends gathered outside his home, as \nI survey the crowd of friends here in the galleries and on the floor, \nhe said, ``Now I will no longer defer the pleasure of taking each of \nyou by the hand.'' So I guess, as Lincoln said then, 136 years ago, if \nall of us who are leaving this year--and I am only one, and I know we \nhave the same thoughts and the same emotions--if we can all go out and \nshake hands with all the people who were responsible for us being here, \nit would take a long time.\n  You begin with your family. You, obviously, begin with your parents, \nyour brothers, your sisters, and you think about all the support they \nhave provided and all the good things that happened. And you think \nabout the Senate. You think about your family, your remarkable, \nwonderful wife and daughter, who have seen victories and seen defeats \nand have put up with, as all our spouses and children do around here, \nwith late hours, not being home on weekends, and all the demands that \ngo with serving in the Senate.\n  So I am very honored to have my wife Elizabeth and my daughter Robin \nin the gallery today.\n  [Applause.]\n  I know they join me in expressing our deep appreciation to everyone \nhere and the people of Kansas. As all of us go back who are leaving \nthis year, thinking about leaving in a couple of years, or whatever, \nyou think about the people who sent you here and the people who tried \nnot to send you here--once you are here, you forget about those. \n[Laughter.]\n\n  And they are all your constituents, whether Democrats, Republicans, \nor Independents. And four times, my friends in Kansas, Republicans and \nDemocrats and Independents, I believe, gave me their votes for the \nHouse of Representatives and five times they have given me their votes \nto the U.S. Senate. I think to all of us, such trust is perhaps the \ngreatest gift that can come to any citizen in our democracy, and I know \nI will be forever grateful, as everyone here will be forever grateful, \nto our friends and our supporters who never gave up on us, who never \nlost their confidence in us. Maybe they did not like some of our votes, \nor maybe they did not like other things, but when the chips were down, \nthey were there. We all think of all the phone calls and all the \nletters and all the visits of people who come to your office with big \nproblems and small. Or you think about the town meetings you have \nattended. I have attended, as have some others here, town meetings all \nover America. They are pretty much the same. They are good people, they \nhave real questions, and they like real answers.\n  I always thought that differences were a healthy thing and that is \nwhy we are all so healthy, because we have a lot of differences in this \nChamber. I have never seen a healthier group in my life. [Laughter.]\n  And then there are those on our staff. Sometimes we forget to say \nthank you. I have had one member of my staff for 30 years, and others \nfor 19, and so on. They have been great, and they have been loyal, and \nthey have been enthusiastic. Their idealism and intelligence and \nloyalty have certainly meant a lot to me, and I think a lot to other \npeople in this body, and other staff members, and the people they work \nwith on a daily basis. Many are on the Senate floor or in the gallery \ntoday. I just say, thank you very much. We have had a little fun along \nthe way, too. It gets kind of dull around here from time to time, so \nyou have to have a little fun. When you really want to have fun to get \naway, you can go out to the beach--which is now my ``beach,'' and I \nwill try to pack it up this afternoon. All of those who served in the \nSenate--and I see some of my former colleagues here today--and all \nthose who serve the Senate, whether the Parliamentarian or the page, I \nthank you for all of us for your tireless service.\n  I do not want my friends in the press gallery to fall out of their \nseats in shock. But let me add in acknowledgment of those who have \nworked here in\n\n[[Page S6044]]\n\nthis building I also salute you. I think it is fair to say that we do \nnot always agree with everything you said or wrote, but I know that \nwhat you do off this floor is as vital to American democracy as \nanything we do on it. And we have to keep that in mind.\n  So I say that it has been a great ride. There have been a few bumps \nalong the way. I have learned a lot from people in this room. I have \neven gone to Senator Byrd when I was the majority leader to ask his \nadvice on how to defeat him on an issue. If you know Robert Byrd as I \ndo, he gave me the answer. But it was not easy. I mean, this man is \ndetermined. I know that in his first book, his great works about the \nSenate, he writes about when I became the majority leader. He very \ncandidly writes in his book that he had his doubts about this Bob Dole \nbecause I might be too partisan, or I might not work with the minority \nleader. But I have heard him say a number of times since that I \ndemonstrated that I was not that partisan. And if I understood one \nthing, as my successor will understand, it is that unless the two \nleaders are working together, nothing is going to happen in this place. \nWe have to trust each other, as Senator Daschle and I have, as Senator \nMitchell and I have, as Senator Byrd and I have. And I also have great \nrespect for Senator Mansfield and Senator Baker, though I did not have \nthe privilege of being in the leadership at that time.\n\n  I say to all those who have been in the leadership positions, it is a \ndifficult life. After 2 o'clock today when somebody calls me about \nbringing up their amendment, I will say that it is all right with me; \nbring it up any time you want, and I will not stand in your way. \n[Laughter and Applause.]\n  I am looking at one of the giants in the Senate right now, Senator \nThurmond. And I looked at others on the way in, like Senator Byrd. I \nthought about Senators Baker, Dirksen, Russell, and many, many more, \nDemocrats and Republicans, who love this place, who have made it work. \nI repeat frequently the statement of Senator Dirksen--and I do not know \nwhether he made it on the floor--who said, ``A billion here, a billion \nthere, and soon it will add up to real money.'' If only he could come \nback today, it would be ``a trillion here and a trillion there.''\n  Then there was Hubert Humphrey. Nobody ever understood how Bob Dole \nand Hubert Humphrey could be such good friends. We did not have a \nproblem at all. And he used to say of his own speeches, ``I never \nthought they were too long. I enjoyed every minute.'' [Laughter.]\n  I remember we were in the hallway one day talking about the talk \nshows. And, of course, I was only watching them in those days, but he \nwas on one every Sunday. It used to be issues and answers for the \nnormal guest. But for Hubert it was issue and answer--then the time was \nup.\n  And then there was Senator Mansfield in just the reverse. When he was \non a Sunday talk show, it was ``yep,'' ``nope,'' ``maybe.'' Ten minutes \ninto the program, they were out of questions. [Laughter.]\n  I remember Russell Long. I remember during the Reagan landslide, I \nwas going to be chairman of the Finance Committee. I did not know how \nto tell Russell--and I did not. I said, ``Who is going to tell \nRussell?'' Nobody was going to tell Russell. Dave Durenberger was \nthere, and I remember the first vote we had. I got to sit in the chair, \nbut when they called the roll, they called the minority side first and \nthen the other side. They said, ``Mr. Chairman,''--this was my first \ntime--and he voted ``aye.''\n  It is a true story. Then there is Phil Hart and Dan Inouye. We all \nmet in Battle Creek, MI, at the Percy Jones General Hospital--\nLieutenant Colonel Hart, Lieutenant Inouye, and Lieutenant Dole. We \nwere all patriots. The best bridge player at Percy Jones Hospital was \nDan Inouye. Probably one of the best men I ever knew was Phil Hart. He \nhad a flesh wound in his right elbow area, and from morning to night he \nspent his time running errands or getting tickets for patients to the \nDetroit Tigers games. His wife was Jane Briggs. It was Briggs Stadium--\nBriggs owned the Tigers at that time. There was not anything that Phil \nHart would not do--not only there but when he came to the U.S. Senate. \nSo I left my proxy with the last of the Percy Jones General Hospital \ncaucus, with Dan Inouye. I wrote him a letter today, I said you've got \nmy proxy. If anything comes up regarding Percy Jones General Hospital, \nwhich is closed----\n  [Laughter.]\nvote me present.\n  [Laughter.]\n  I could go on and on. I am not like Senator Byrd because nobody can \ndo it the way Senator Byrd does it.\n  But I think of all of these people who have come and gone and of all \nof the new bright stars that are here today on both sides of the aisle, \nand there is one thing that you do know for certain. This is a great \ninstitution.\n  I have learned another thing that we have all learned in this Chamber \nand this town. Your word is your bond. If you do not keep your word \naround here, it does not make much difference what your amendment may \nbe, or whatever it may be. And it is important to all of us. As far as \nI know everybody that I know on either side observed that rule. It is \ntrue in any business or in any profession. It is more true in politics \nbecause the American people are looking at us, and they want us to tell \nthe truth. It does not mean that we have to agree. It does not mean we \ncannot have different motivations. I learned that leadership is a \ncombination of background and backbone. I learned a lot about that from \nthe likes of Senator Byrd and others that I watched and watched.\n  I know that Senator Warner is the first person to ever mention to \nme--one day we were at the same place having lunch. He said, ``You \nought to think about running for leader.'' I said, ``Me?'' So I thought \nabout it. [Laughter.]\n  I thought Ted Stevens was going to be the leader. Where is Ted? \nSomething happened on the way to the vote. [Laughter.]\n  I walked out of there surprised. When Howard Greene held up his hand, \nI knew that I must be the leader.\n  So I would just say that we all know how the political process works. \nSome people are cynical. Some people think it is awful. Some people do \nnot trust us. But the people who watch this thing day in and day out \nhave a better understanding.\n  Some people ask me. I remember the Speaker--the Speaker is present--\ntelling me just 10 minutes ago, he really understands now more about \nthe Senate. We have different rules. I love the House of \nRepresentatives. I never wanted to be in the House of Representatives. \nI wanted to be in the Senate. I wanted to be in the Senate where you \ncan have unlimited debate, where any Senator on either side on any \nissue can stand up and talk until they drop.\n  The record is held by the Presiding Officer, Senator Thurmond.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twenty-four hours and eighteen minutes. \n[Laughter and Applause.]\n  Mr. DOLE. That is why you are seldom asked to be an after dinner \nspeaker. [Laughter.]\n  Mr. President, I think sometimes around here we think we have to have \neverything. ``We have to have total victory. I will not settle for \nless. It has to be my way, or no way.'' Well, Ronald Reagan said once, \n``If I can get 90 percent of what I want, I would call that a pretty \ngood deal.'' Ninety percent is not bad. You can get the other 10 \npercent later. It is a small amendment then. [Laughter.]\n  Better understand that--take the 90 and then work on the 10.\n  I want to say, too, that I read that my resignation and my decision \nto leave caused astonishment in some quarters, and I do not begrudge \nanyone their surprise. But I would just want to disabuse anybody about \nthe Senate. This is the great opportunity, and there are hundreds and \nhundreds and thousands and thousands of people who would give anything \nthey had to be a Member of this body. That is the way it should be. It \nis very competitive.\n  So I have said the truth is that I would no more distance myself from \nthe Senate than I would from the United States itself. This is a body \nthat is the reflection of America. It is what America is all about. We \ncome from different States and different backgrounds with different \nopportunities and different challenges in our lives. And, yes, the \ninstitution has its imperfections and occasional inefficiencies. We are \nlike America; we are still a work in progress in the U.S. Senate.\n  So I would say to my colleagues that I remember way back when I ran \nfor\n\n[[Page S6045]]\n\nthe Kansas Legislature. We had a Democratic law librarian who thought \nyoung people ought to get involved in politics. She found two \nRepublicans and two Democrats, and talked us into running for the State \nlegislature. We did not know anything about politics. We did not know \nwhat party we were in. We were students; veterans going to school under \nthe GI bill. I thought about which party to belong to. I have said in \njest, from time to time I went back to my hometown and went up to the \ncourthouse and found out there were more Republicans than Democrats. \nAnd I became a committed Republican. [Laughter.]\n  It is not quite accurate. But my parents were Democrats.\n  I remember the first time I was ever approached by a reporter. Here I \nwas a brandnew law student, a brand new legislator. I did not know \nanything about anything. They said, ``Well, what are you going to do \nnow for your district?'' Or something of that case. I said, ``I am \ngoing to sit around and watch for a couple of days, and then stand up \nfor what is right.''\n  Well, that is what we all do around here. I hope I have done it over \nthe years.\n  I will take a minute or two to indulge in some of the things that we \nall have different interests in. I have been deeply involved in \nagriculture, as many of you have here, because Kansas is a farm State. \nWhen I came to Congress, I was on the House Agriculture Committee. I \nhave been on the Senate Agriculture Committee ever since. So I am proud \nof having served the farm families of Kansas and around America who \nmake a lot of sacrifices.\n\n  This year we did not have a wheat crop, hardly at all, in Kansas \nbecause of the drought. I am advised by Senator Dorgan that they are \nnot going to have much of one because of the rains and the water.\n  So farmers make a lot of sacrifices. I remember back during the \nVietnam debate. Some of us were here. Some were on each side of the \nissue. The so-called Cooper-Church amendment that went on and on and \non, week after week after week on whether we ought to withdraw our \ntroops, or shut off funding, which I thought was wrong. As I look back \non it, I think I was right because we had courageous men like Bob \nKerrey, John McCain, and others in this Chamber who were risking their \nlives, and they deserved our support. That was a big debate at the \ntime.\n  I have also been proud to be involved in nutrition programs. Somebody \nmentioned that earlier today. I remember working with Senator McGovern \non that, and there was a conservative article saying I cannot be a \nconservative because I know George McGovern. I think George McGovern is \na gentleman and has always been a gentleman. But we worked together on \nfood stamps. I will confess, when I made my first tour with George \nMcGovern, I said, ``This guy is running for President.'' I was not \nconvinced. There were a lot of skeptics in this Chamber; probably some \non each side. You cannot have truer motives. It is always something \npolitical. But after being on that trip about 2 or 3 days, I changed my \nmind. Senator Hollings from South Carolina was in the forefront of that \neffort. He remembers how bad it was.\n  So we worked together on food stamps, the WIC Program, and the School \nLunch Program, particularly when it affected poorer Americans. I think, \nas I look at it, that no first-class democracy would treat its people \nlike second-class citizens.\n  I remember standing on this floor managing the Martin Luther King \nholiday bill. We had the majority. It was a proud day for me. It is now \na national holiday.\n  The first speech I ever made on the floor was April 14, 1969, about \ndisabled Americans. There are a lot of people in this room who have \nworked on this program. I know Senator Kennedy and Senator Harkin and \nSenator Durenberger, when he was here, and Senator Jennings Randolph \nbefore--maybe before many of you came--was in the forefront. We stood \nwith many who could not stand on their own, and the highlight was \npassing the Americans With Disabilities Act. Forty-three million \nAmericans--they are not all seriously disabled, but there are many in \nwheelchairs, many who cannot even sit up. It was a very impressive \nsight to be at the White House the day that bill was signed by \nPresident Bush, and I am forever grateful. I know Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Harkin are. Have you ever seen so many wheelchairs at the White \nHouse at a signing ceremony? Never. And now more and more Americans \nwith disabilities are full participants in the process. They are in the \nmainstream.\n\n  So, I remember in 1983--I know Pat Moynihan remembers--we were \nstanding right over in this aisle. We had a bipartisan commission on \nSocial Security. We had met week after week, month after month. It was \nabout to go down the drain. We had about given up. Everybody was \ndisgusted. We were getting short-tempered. We were Democrats and \nRepublicans. At the time the late John Heinz was a member of the \ncommission. As member of the Finance Committee, I was a member. Senator \nMoynihan was a member. And Senator Moynihan--I think just by chance or \nfate or whatever--and I happened to meet in this aisle on my right. We \nsaid we have to try one more time to rescue Social Security--one more \ntime.\n  It was not a partisan issue. And we did. That afternoon we convened \nthree more people, we had five of the commission, and it was not long \nuntil we were back on track. We finally made it happen, and 37 million \npeople have gotten their checks on time.\n  I think I read in the Washington Post just this weekend, Social \nSecurity is going to be in pretty good shape until the year 2029. So \nthat is a pretty good fix. Maybe, as I said earlier in the day, that is \na pattern we can follow for Medicare for the long-term solution: Take \nit out of politics as we did on Social Security, make it work, make it \nsolvent. And the people who get the credit are the people who get the \nchecks--37 million of them. So, we reached across partisan lines.\n  So, I worry a little about the future. I worry about our defenses. I \nknow there are a lot of very talented people here who are going to \ncontinue to do that. I am not here to make a partisan speech or even a \npartisan reference, but I would hope that we would keep in mind there \nare still threats around the world and also keep in mind that we are \nthe envy of the world.\n  I learned, meeting with a lot of leaders, foreign leaders, as leaders \nget to do in this business--the chairmen of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senators Helms and Pell and others, Senator Lugar when he \nwas chairman--I remember when the Berlin Wall came down and the Soviet \nempire collapsed, a lot of people started coming to America. They were \nleaders. They were young and they were old and they were men and they \nwere women, and they did not come for foreign aid. The cynics said, \n``Oh, they are coming after more of our money.'' They knew we did not \nhave any. But for the first time in 70 years, in some cases, they had a \nright to travel. They could get on an airplane without checking with \nthe government and waiting for a year or 2 years or 3 years. They could \ngo to church, they could vote--all these basic rights that we take for \ngranted. And they came to America.\n  Some are now Presidents, like Lech Walesa, some are leaders of their \nparty. As they came to our offices, and I am certain it was true in \nevery other office, they did not ask for money. They wanted to come to \nAmerica to see America. They wanted to take a look at America. And I \ncan recall almost everyone who left my office, sometimes with tears \nstreaming down their cheeks, saying, ``We want to be like America.''\n  We are the envy of the world. That is why so many people want to be \nlike we are.\n  So, we have lit Liberty's torch with a glow that can truly light the \nworld. That is what America is all about. We are much more than a place \non a map. We are the United States, and we are a beacon of hope. We are \na magnet for the oppressed and a shield against those who would put the \nsoul itself in bondage.\n  I think we did that in Kuwait, and we may be called on to do it \nagain. But I would guess one thing. I would hope, when they catalog all \nthe amendments and all the bills and do all the commentaries, whenever \nit is all over for us here, that we have left our children something \nother than a legacy of debt. Our children are important. None of us \nhave a perfect solution, but there has to be some solution here where \nwe can\n\n[[Page S6046]]\n\ncome together, Republicans and Democrats, because everybody loves their \nchildren. Everybody loves their grandchildren. We have all these young \npages here. We have an example every day of young people who want to \nget ahead, who are willing to work. They just want the opportunity.\n  I think, if I could hope that anything might happen, it probably will \nnot happen today, but this year or next year--I felt strongly about the \nbalanced budget, but not enough people did. But that will be around.\n  So I would close with, again, thanking all of my colleagues. I do not \nbelieve--I am just trying to think back--I do not believe we have ever \nhad any real disagreements. I remember one time, I remind the \nDemocratic leader, that I offered an amendment that you thought you \nwere going to offer, and I made a mistake. I was not trying to one-up \nthe Senator from South Dakota. So I withdraw my amendment. Then he \noffered the amendment. I think that is called civility.\n  So, I would close with the words of my hero, Dwight Eisenhower, \nbecause he was our supreme commander. He also came from Abilene, KS; \nborn in Texas but quickly moved to Kansas. He was only 2 years old. It \ntook a while. But, in any event--this is his quote.\n\n       As we peer into society's future, we--you and I--and our \n     Government--must avoid the impulse to live only for today, \n     plundering, for our own ease and convenience, the precious \n     resources of tomorrow.\n       We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren \n     without risking the loss of their political and spiritual \n     heritage. We want democracy to survive for all generations to \n     come, not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow.\n\n  I think those words are just as good today as they were 35 years ago \nwhen President Eisenhower spoke them. We can lead or we can mislead as \nthe people's Representatives, but whatever we do, we will be held \nresponsible. We are going to be held responsible and accountable. I am \nnot talking about 1996. I am talking about any time over the next \ncentury.\n\n  So the Bible tells us that to everything there is a season, and I \nthink my season in the Senate is about to come to an end. But the new \nseason makes this moment far less the closing of one chapter than the \nopening of another. We all take pride in the past, but we all live for \nthe future.\n  I agree with prairie poet Carl Sandburg, who told us:\n\n     Yesterday is wind gone down,\n     a sun dropped in the West.\n     I tell you that there is nothing in the world,\n     Only an ocean of tomorrows,\n     A sky of tomorrows.\n\n  Like everybody here, I am an optimist. I believe our best tomorrows \nare yet to be lived. So I, again, thank you.\n  God bless America, and God bless the U.S. Senate.\n  [Applause, Senators rising.]\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6043-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, there is no question that some of the most \neloquent speeches I have heard since I have been in the Senate were \npresented this morning by Senators on both sides of the aisle as a \ntribute to our good friend and majority leader, Bob Dole. They really \nwere very impressive in terms of the relationship that Senators have \nhad with Senator Dole and their love for him and for this institution. \nMany Senators have enjoyed working with Senator Dole and have learned a \ngreat deal from him. Certainly, I am one of those that has been \nstudying at the feet of Bob Dole. It has been something to behold. He \nis truly a master of how to get things done. We can all learn from \nthat. I hope that I am one that has learned and will remember those \nlessons.\n  I served in the House for a number of years after having worked for a \nDemocratic Congressman named Bill Colmer, the chairman of the Rules \nCommittee. Until this very day, when I remember the lessons I should \nhave learned from that old gentleman, I do well. When I forget those \nlessons, I usually get in trouble. So I think that as we go through \nlife and as we go through political life, as we work in Government, and \nas we go through our daily activities in the Senate, there are certain \ngiants like Bob Dole that we can and should all learn from.\n  Madam President, there is a little known custom, I guess, in the \nSenate for Members to carve their names in the drawers of their desks. \nIn fact, when constituents come on the floor when we are not in \nsession, that is one of the things they find most interesting. They \npull the drawers out and see who signed these desks.\n  When you look into some of these desks, you find the great--and \nsometimes not so great--names of the past. They are a veritable \nrollcall of our country's history.\n  In 28 years in the Senate, Bob Dole did more than make his mark upon \na congressional desk. He made his mark upon this institution, not just \nits legislation, but more importantly, its character.\n  He devoted most of his career to the Senate, but not because this \nChamber and its business were an end in itself. For Bob Dole, serving \nthe Senate was serving his country.\n  That service took precedence over most other considerations in his \nlife.\n  Indeed, it took precedence over his Presidential campaign--until \ntoday.\n  The reason Bob Dole will not be with us on the Senate floor after \ntoday is no great secret.\n  The reason is that he was convinced he would better serve his country \nby restoring leadership to its Presidency than by handling the day to \nday affairs of the Congress.\n  We all know it was hard for him to leave, and it was hard for us to \nsee him leave. It affected us all, and it reminded us once again who we \nare and what we are about in this institution. Those who really know \nBob Dole know that he is leaving not out of ambition for higher rank, \nbut out of determination to finish the fight and be in a position to do \nall that he can do for his country.\n  That fight, in terms of his country's future, is every bit as \nimportant as the fight which gravely injured the young Bob Dole in \n1944.\n  There are some who think of duty as a burden, heavy to bear and best \nshrugged off onto someone else.\n  There are others who embrace duty, and carry it proudly, and do not \nput it down until the journey is done.\n  In walking out of this Chamber today, Bob Dole carries with him a \nlifetime of duty.\n  As we saw him exit this door, we all felt an emotional surge, and \nevery Member of this Senate knows he will not put that responsibility \nand duty down.\n  No one would understand better than Bob that not every Senator wants \nhim to succeed in his present mission. Indeed, a goodly part of this \nbody will move Heaven and Earth to prevent that success.\n  That is not perfidy. It is democracy.\n  It is something Bob Dole went to war to defend, and something he \nstill can appreciate more than most of us.\n  But I dare say, despite the political and partisan divisions on this \nSenate floor, as we quite often experience, all of us understand \nsomething historic is happening here today.\n  Something none of us will soon forget.\n  It brings to my mind two other reluctant departures in our Nation's \npast.\n  The first would be Washington's reluctant leaving of Mount Vernon to \nassume a position he did not seek, but which his countrymen insisted he \ntake.\n  The second would be Lee's agonized departure from his post of \nmilitary honor to fulfill what he considered a higher duty.\n  Were he here, Bob Dole would modestly dismiss any comparison with \nWashington or Lee--or any other of American's great statesmen of the \npast.\n  He would rather let the future judge such things, and so should we.\n  Whatever the outcome of this year, whatever the course of its \nconflicts and controversies, the future holds a place for Bob Dole as a \ngiant of the Senate, a man set apart from most by a quiet passion for \nhis country that we are only now beginning to understand.\n  But Lord willing, we will benefit from it for years to come.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I wish to associate \nmyself with the remarks by the distinguished Senator from Mississippi.\n  I just want to say a few words about my friend Bob Dole. I suspect my \nfeelings are not significantly different by what has been thought and \nwhat has been said by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. So \naside from the Bob Dole that we all know so very, very well, I just \nwant to say that I was pleased to be here and to hear that excellent \nspeech that Senator Dole gave as his farewell address in the U.S. \nSenate. It was sad in lots of ways, and yet it was so reassuring to see \nsomeone of the integrity, the ability, the character, and the good \nnature of Bob Dole spelled out in that speech so very, very well. I \nhope that many, many people in the United States heard that speech by \nmy friend and colleague, the man from Kansas.\n  I have worked with him so very, very long on so many issues. Many \ntimes we have been on the same side, but on many of the items we have \nbeen on opposite sides. But never, as Senator Dole mentioned in his \nspeech this morning, has he ever, to my knowledge, violated that \ncardinal rule of the U.S. Senate--unwritten, which is just as \neffective: A man's word or a woman's word is their bond. In all of \nthese nearly 18 years that I have had the pleasure of my association \nwith Bob Dole, I have never known Bob even to give a hint of breaking \nhis word, because if there was ever a man in the U.S. Senate for whom \nwe all know his word is his bond, that is Bob Dole.\n  On a personal note, I just want to say when I saw Bob walk out after \nhis address, it took me back to times in all of our lives when there \nhave been breakups. I suppose the first was when we graduated from \ngrade school and that old gang of ours broke up and went on through our \neducational process. And certainly it is true. When you left the \nservice of the United States of America, that old gang was broken up. \nThat old gang that Bob Dole was with was suddenly broken up when he \nnearly gave his life in combat, in defense of the national security \ninterests of the United States of America and the free world. But I \nthought of that breakup when I saw Bob walk out that door an hour or so \nago.\n  Bob Dole meant so much to me because, despite our differences from \ntime to time, we always had an excellent personal working relationship. \nHe came into Nebraska on two or three occasions to support my opponent \nin one of my races. But never did Bob Dole say anything bad about Jim \nExon, even though he could have probably found some legitimate things \nthat he could and maybe should have said. But that was not Bob's way. \nBob came into Nebraska, and he campaigned for my Republican opponent--\nnot against Jim Exon. I think that is the mark of not only a great \nstatesman but a very effective leader, which he was of his party as \nmajority leader on that side, but also someone that you could be truly \nproud of and call your friend.\n  Little known outside the Senate, I suspect, was Bob's strongest \ncharacteristic, and that was his sense of\n\n[[Page S6048]]\n\nhumor. I am not sure that the public at large has understood that. But \nI have had an ongoing relationship--very friendly--with Bob Dole on \nmany, many occasions. In fact, this year when he was running for \nPresident of the United States, I suggested to him--and he knew it was \nfacetious--that I might consider a draft to be his Vice Presidential \nrunning mate, if he was interested in that. Bob knows that I am a \nDemocrat--always have been and always will be, and we had lots of jokes \nabout that. But over the years of friendship, over the years of serving \non very tough issues, sometimes we were maybe at sword's point, one \nwould think, when we were debating a measure of some importance on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate. Bob Dole never lost his sense of humor. He \nnever forgot his sense of humor. And I think that is what helped carry \nhim through probably that life-threatening wound that he received in \nbattle and probably through some of the more heated debates that have \ntaken place here on the Senate floor. I have never seen Bob Dole do \nanything but smile when someone said something or told him something \nthat he thought was humor.\n\n  So I am saddened by the fact that a coworker for whom I have great \nrespect, has made a choice that I think was the right choice for him to \nmake, especially with regard to the heavy responsibility that he \ncarries for his party, and he will carry in the Presidential election \nthis year. In that regard, maybe I can sum up my feelings, friendship, \nand understanding with Bob Dole by a statement that I made to him in \none of our more humorous conversations maybe 6 months ago right in the \nheat of those very tough Republican primaries for President of the \nUnited States. I said to Bob Dole, ``You know, Bob, if we have to have \na Republican President''--then I repeated it--``if we have to have a \nRepublican President, I hope it is you.'' People that do not understand \nhumor might think that was a cutting thing for Jim Exon to say, but Bob \nDole knew what I was saying. Bob Dole knows that myself and all, \nlikely, on both sides of the aisle respect not only the man's talent \nbut the man's sense of responsibility and his sense of humor which has \nendeared him to those of us on both sides of the aisle.\n  Godspeed, Bob Dole, to you and your wonderful wife, Elizabeth. You \nare a great couple. And whatever the future holds, we will always hold \nyou in high esteem.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6046-4", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6048-S6057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BOB DOLE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nebraska for his \nkind remarks about our friend Bob Dole, which were very eloquent. I \nthink he expressed it beautifully for a lot of Democrats. I think \neveryone in this body has tremendous esteem and affection and love for \nBob Dole. He is one of the all-time great Senators. There is no \nquestion about it. He will go down in history as one of the all-time \ngreat Senators.\n  Mr. President, 20 years ago, when I was first sworn in as the junior \nSenator from Utah, Bob Dole was among the first of my Republican \ncolleagues to come up and put his arm around me, and helped guide me \nand helped me to learn the ropes.\n  I rise today to thank him for that, and for his extraordinary \nleadership in the years since. When the citizens from Kansas elected \nBob Dole as their Senator, they chose a man who epitomizes the \nqualities of mainstream America, a team player, a war hero who \ndemonstrated tremendous courage and perseverance both on the \nbattlefield and afterward, a hard worker and an honest and decent man, \na man whom all Americans can look up to.\n  By now, most of us are aware of the wounds Lieutenant Dole suffered \non that April morning in 1945. That was about the same time that my \nbrother was killed in the Second World War. Bob Dole could have been \nkilled too, and almost was.\n  We have also heard about his amazing and long recovery. But less is \nknown about how Bob Dole was injured. Richard Ben Cramer's book, ``What \nit Takes,'' tells us how:\n\n       Dole got his men down to the low stone wall. Dole could \n     have stayed in the middle [of the platoon]. But he knew his \n     job, and he did it. He was out in front, with the lead squad.\n       They were pinned down quick. They were pinned down in the \n     field, when a farmhouse on the left opened fire: a Jerry \n     machine-gun nest . . . the men in the field were hamburger.\n       Dole had to get that machine gun. The lead squad was going \n     to have to flank that house and get that nest of Krauts \n     [sic]. Sergeant Carafa assumed he'd be going out with the \n     squad, but Dole said, ``Sergeant, I'll take 'em.''\n\n  Bob Dole saw many men die trying to knock out that machine gun. It \nwas that morning, trying to take it out, that he was wounded. Bob Dole \ncould have let someone else go out with the squad. Bob Dole could have \nstayed behind and provided cover. Bob Dole could have stayed in the \nmiddle. Instead, Bob Dole was out in front.\n  Bob Dole has been out in front ever since. He became a skillful \nlegislator. He knew how to get things done around here. But he also \nknew that duty required him to take action when it wasn't always in his \nown best interest or when he saw public policy going down the wrong \npath.\n  Take, for example, his leadership on addressing the crime issue. \nThroughout his career, Bob Dole consistently supported legislation to \nfight crime and help the victims of crime. From the Organized Crime \nControl Act of 1969 to the 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death \nPenalty Act, Bob Dole has fought to bring accountability to the \ncriminal justice system. But, in 1994, Senator Dole stood up for what \nhe thought was right and opposed the so-called Crime Control Act of \n1994 because it was a pork-laden, big dollar, Great Society social \nspending boondoggle. Some of our colleagues thought we had lost our \nminds when we opposed a so-called crime bill in an election year. But \nBob Dole did it because it was the right thing to do.\n  He worked tirelessly for comprehensive habeas corpus reform. He \nworked to crack down on frivolous inmate lawsuits and was at the \nforefront of reform when, in 1984, he cosponsored the Sentencing Reform \nAct, which brought truth-in-sentencing to the Federal system.\n  Mr. President, Senator Dole has been a leader and a fighter for civil \nrights from the beginning of his career. Senator Dole knows full well \nthat prejudice and artificial barriers can hold a person down. As a \nMember of the other body, he voted for landmark legislation including \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He was \na leader in the effort to extend the Voting Rights Act in 1982. In \n1967, then Congressman Dole voted for the Age Discrimination in \nEmployment Act. In 1990, Senator Dole supported the expansion and \nclarification of this law to protect older workers from the loss of \ntheir employee benefits.\n  Senator Dole led the passage of the Martin Luther King holiday bill. \nIt was a bill I voted against, and I consider it the worst mistake I \nhave made in my 20 years here. I thought that we should not add another \nholiday due to both the public and private sector costs involved. But, \nfrankly, in hindsight, I made a mistake.\n  Bob Dole, however, did what was right, and he brought that bill up \nand helped to pass it.\n  He played a key leadership role in enacting the landmark Americans \nWith Disabilities Act. I worked hard on that bill, and I know what he \ndid. I was in the late night meetings. As the ranking Republican on the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee, I was in the leadership meetings. \nI have to tell you, without Bob Dole, that bill would not have passed. \nThe ADA extended civil rights protections and opportunities to millions \nof Americans with disabilities. I can remember when it passed, he and I \nhad tears in our eyes because it was such a monumental day.\n  Yes, Bob Dole has been there for the big fights, let me tell you.\n  Bob Dole recognizes that rights inhere in individuals, not groups. In \n1995, he introduced the Equal Opportunity Act, which prohibits racial, \nethnic, and gender preferences in Federal employment, Federal \ncontacting, and federally administered programs. He sparked a healthy \nand timely national debate on affirmative action. In his view, every \nAmerican should be treated with equal rights under the law, without \npreference based on race, ethnicity, or gender.\n\n[[Page S6049]]\n\n  Bob Dole helped build the Republican Party that we have today. He \nhelped build the Republican majority we have today. There were no \nlitmus tests under Bob Dole's leadership. He successfully knit together \nSenators from Alaska to Virginia to form a working team whose sole \npurpose was to achieve the goals for America that we all held in \ncommon--goals that I personally believe we hold in common with the \nAmerican people.\n  We are going to miss Bob Dole in the U.S. Senate. I suspect even his \nworthy adversaries on the Democratic side have come to admire his \ndetermination, skill, and faithfulness to the people he represents. I \nbelieve there is unanimous agreement in this body that Bob Dole served \nwith honor and distinction as one of the greatest Senators in the \nhistory of this Federal Republic.\n  I have to say something here that I am sure Bob Dole does not know, \nbut I am going to say it publicly because it means so much to me. My \nbrother died shortly before Bob Dole got wounded in the Second World \nWar. My brother was very dear to me. I was only 10 years old when he \ndied. When we received the news, I immediately got a white streak of \nhair on the right side of my forehead because it was such a shock to \nme.\n  He was killed in the Ploiesti oil raid, which, of course, was the \npivotal oil raid of the European war because it knocked out all of the \nVienna-Austrian oilfields that Hitler depended on. But Jess' death was \na tremendous shock to us.\n  When I came to the Senate, Bob Dole put his arm around me. He looked \nlike my brother, to a large degree. My brother had the same color hair, \nwas about the same height, about the same build. My brother was a \nfootball player as well. He looked a lot like my brother. I have always \nconsidered Bob Dole, for good or bad, to be my brother.\n  I have tremendous respect and admiration for this man, this fellow \nwho has given so much to his country and who, if everybody in America \nknew him--knew him like we do--there would be no question that he would \nbe the next President of the United States.\n  I have to say I love Bob Dole. Elaine does, too. We love his wife \nLiddy. She is a tremendous human being. As both chairman and ranking \nmember of the Labor Committee, I worked with Liddy Dole, who served as \nPresident Bush's Secretary of Labor. I have to tell you I appreciated \nthose days and appreciated her kindnesses to me and her great work for \nthe country.\n  Today, Bob Dole is leaving the Senate to pursue a different calling. \nYet it still is the calling of public service. He did not have to leave \nthe Senate. Nobody could have pushed him out of here. It would have \nbeen safer to stay. But we have already learned that Bob Dole does not \nstay safely in the foxholes. That is not what we expect of our leaders, \nand Bob Dole, in my opinion, has what it takes.\n  Whatever the future may hold for Bob and Elizabeth Dole, I just want \nto wish them both happiness and Godspeed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The President pro tempore of \nthe Senate, the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, in recent years, many in the media, the \npublic, and even some Members of Congress, have come to regard those \nwho seek positions in the public sector with some amount of contempt \nand mistrust. Most of us in this Chamber know such characterizations \nare not only unfair and inaccurate, but do much to harm the sanctity \nand reputation of a body dedicated to debate and providing for the \nNation.\n  The large majority of those who become Government officials are \nhonorable individuals, but there are a handful of Senators in \nparticular whose conduct and dedication to service are above reproach, \nand who stand as living contradictions to those who believe that this \nis an ineffective and partisan body. These Senators are men and women \nof principle who are dedicated to the noble cause of working to benefit \nall the people of the United States. Today, it is with great regret \nthat I mark the departure of a man who sets a standard for service to \nthe Senate and the Nation that is truly unmatched--the majority leader \nand Senator from Kansas Bob Dole.\n  I doubt it came as a surprise to anyone in Russell, KS, when Bob Dole \nfirst ran for elected office in 1951. The bright young war veteran and \nattorney had already established a well-deserved reputation for courage \nand hard work when he declared his candidacy for a seat in that State's \nHouse of Representatives. It was these two simple attributes that not \nonly help Bob Dole to win that election, but have helped to guide him \nthrough life of challenges, hardships, and accomplishments.\n  The heartlands of the Kansan prairies are where Bob Dole learned \nabout being tough and not giving in when in the same situation the \naverage person might simply give up the fight. While this is a region \nof simple beauty, kind people, and strong values, during the time of \nBob Dole's youth it was also a place that was rife with hardships for \nthose who lived there. It was a place where hard work was not a virtue, \nit was a necessity for survival, especially during the Nation's most \nsevere economic crisis, the Great Depression.\n  In his hometown of Russell, KS, Bob Dole also learned about things \nsuch as patriotism and a commitment to serving the Nation. He was \ntaught that these words represented more than mere ideas or ideals, \nthey were part of the responsibilities of citizenship in this great \nland. During World War II, Bob Dole served his country as an officer in \nthe Army, and when he was ordered to lead an attack on a German-held \nhill in Italy, Lt. Bob Dole never had any question about his duty. It \nwas this dedication to duty, a commitment to serving the Nation, and \npure, unadulterated courage that sent Lieutenant Dole up that hill, and \nit was those same qualities that not only saved his life after being \ngravely wounded by hostile fire, but gave his life purpose in the years \nfollowing his near life-ending injuries.\n\n  As he lay in a hospital bed, it took a man of fortitude, \ndetermination, and courage to face 39 months of surgery, convalescence, \nand rehabilitation. It took courage, fortitude, and determination for \nBob Dole to face the fact that his dream of becoming a doctor and \nhelping others had ended. It took courage, fortitude, and determination \nfor him to make the decision to not make his disabilities a handicap, \nbut to force forward with life and to dedicate himself to serving \nothers through public service rather than medicine. It took a man of \nfortitude, determination, and courage to learn again how to do all the \nthings that you and I take for granted; to go back to school in order \nto finish his undergraduate degree and earn a law degree; and, to begin \nhis career. Simply put, it took grit to survive what Bob Dole survived \nand to essentially start life anew.\n  Since entering politics and public service, Bob Dole has never looked \nback and he has never faltered in his duties. He has approached each \nposition he has held with enthusiasm and has earned a reputation for \nthoroughness, fairness, and honesty. These qualities, along with those \noutlined earlier, endeared him to his fellow Kansans who sent him on to \npositions of progressively more importance and responsibility. From the \nKansas Legislature, he served as Russell County attorney, and then as a \nU.S. Congressman for four terms before coming to the U.S. Senate in \n1968. It is here that I met Bob Dole and immediately took a liking to \nthis serious-minded fellow veteran who had a pragmatic approach to the \nissues before the Nation, and a fire in him to serve.\n  Over the next 28 years, I became quite fond of Senator Dole as a \ncolleague and a friend. I was pleased to watch him grow into his \nposition as a Senator and to become one of the leading spokesmen for \nour party not only in this body, but throughout the Nation. His \nabilities as a public servant did not escape many, including President \nGerald Ford, who selected Senator Dole to be his running mate in 1976. \nThe longer Bob Dole served in the Senate, the more prominent and \ncritical his role became in the legislative process. His razor sharp \nmind gave him an encyclopedic familiarity with legislation and \nlegislative procedure, both which he put to good use as he ascended the \nladder of Senate leadership. Furthermore, his years of experience as a \nMember of Congress gave him an insight into the affairs or the Nation \nthat could be matched by a few with\n\n[[Page S6050]]\n\nwhom he served, and made him a valued advisor to fellow Senators, and \nto Presidents. In short, Bob Dole was, and continues to be, a man of \ntremendous abilities and background whose experience allows him to have \nan impact on the governing of the United States that is unique and \nnothing short of beneficial.\n\n  It seems hard to believe that Bob Dole is leaving the Senate. After \nalmost 30 years of prominent and dedicated service, he seems as much a \npart of this building as the statute of Armed Freedom which sits atop \nthe Capitol and guards the District and the Nation. More important and \nsignificant than merely enduring the rigors and battles of the Senate \nfor almost three decades is that during his life and in his tenure in \nCongress, Bob Dole has made a difference in the history of the United \nStates. Among other things, he has stood tall for a budget that will \nnot saddle future generations with an unfair debt; he has fought hard \nto give our men and women in uniform the resources they need to keep \nAmerica free and safe; he remained firm on the need for drawing the \nline against the crime and criminals that prey on innocent Americans; \nhe did not flinch in working to contain our former Communist enemies; \nand, he has worked hard to ensure that the United States maintains the \nmost dynamic economy in the world. Time and time again, Bob Dole has \nbeen on the right side of the issues, working to create legislation and \npolicy that is beneficial to the citizens of this Nation, and leading \nthis body toward a vision of an America that is safe, wealthy, and full \nof opportunity as long as there is a United States. It is with no small \nregret that I say I will miss my colleague, my leader, and most \nimportantly, my friend, Bob Dole. I wish him well and thank him for his \nservice, and for the example he has set for selflessness, patriotism, \nand humility.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today a giant in the annals of the U.S. \nSenate, Senator Robert Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, has \nchosen to leave this great institution to pursue and, I believe to win \nthe Presidency of the United States. The Senate will never be quit the \nsame; for Senator Dole has that rare and admired quality of making \nthings happen, getting things done, and moving this tradition-layered \ninstitution forward.\n  All of Bob Dole's adult life had been spent in service to the \nAmerican public and today he has not ended that service. He is just \nentering the final phase of his public service--campaigning for the \nhighest office in the land.\n  Mr. President, for the past 16 years, I have been privileged to \nrepresent the people of the State of Alaska in the Senate. And \nthroughout my tenure in the Senate, Bob Dole has been a friend to the \npeople of Alaska and a leader who has always been sensitive to the \nspecial needs of our young State.\n  Bob has traveled extensively in Alaska. And he understands that \nunlike States that entered the Union in the 18th and 19th centuries, \nAlaska, which has only been a State since 1959, is far more dependent \nthan other States on decisions made in Washington.\n  Almost 70 percent of Alaska is owned by the Federal Government. \nFifty-four million acres of Park Service land is in Alaska--68 percent \nof all Park Service land in the Nation. Fifty-seven million acres of \ndesignated wilderness is located in Alaska. That's over 60 percent of \nall wilderness lands in the country.\n  And 76 million acres of Fish and Wildlife Service land is in Alaska--\nThat's 85 percent of all Fish and Wildlife Service land in the United \nStates.\n  The purpose in providing these statistics is to reiterate to my \nfellow Senators that almost any economic activity that is done in \nAlaska can only get started if the Federal Government does not stand in \nthe way. Bob Dole has always understood that.\n  Bob Dole also understands that our natural resources can be developed \nin a responsible manner using our best technology without harming our \nenvironment.\n  Bob Dole does not sell America's technology and ingenuity short--he \nbelieves that it is better to harvest our abundant resources in an \nenvironmentally responsible manner rather than sending our dollars and \njobs overseas by importing resources.\n  Mr. President, Bob Dole  has served as the Republican leader for more \nthan 11 years-longer than any Republican leader in history. He has had \nto juggle and balance the interests of States as different as Florida \nand Alaska in order to get legislation from the drawing boards to \nPresident's desk.\n  Throughout all of the time I have known Bob, he has never sacrificed \nwhat is important to Alaska's 600,000 citizens in order to get a piece \nof legislation adopted. In fact, it was Bob Dole's leadership that \nensured that for the first time last year, Congress authorized oil \nexploration in ANWR.\n  And when Bob Dole moves to the White House next year. Alaskans can be \nassured that the roadblock to our economic development will finally be \nremoved. He knows that America's economic security cannot be assured so \nlong as we are dependent on foreign countries for more than 50 percent \nof our energy needs.\n  Mr. President, Alaskans will miss Senator Dole's leadership and \nsensitivity to our State's needs. I will miss him as a person and \nfriend that I have grown accustomed to talking with every day. Bob \nDole's destiny will take him to even greater challenges and \nresponsibilities next year. And I know he will always keep Alaska's \nspecial needs in mind whenever he makes decisions on economic policy.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have just said goodbye to the majority \nleader, who has just retired. He has left the Senate with great support \nfrom those of us who have known him and really do have a great love for \nBob Dole.\n  I have known him since he was a Member of the House. I was not a \nMember of the House, but I knew he was there in the House. Bob Dole and \nI came to the Senate at the same time. As he leaves today, I am, as he \njust said, the sole survivor of the class of 1968. He has been a great \nfriend of mine. I have been on the floor before to say how I felt about \nBob Dole.\n  I have also remarked about the fact that he has also been a great \nfriend of the State I represent. He assisted us greatly in the passage \nof the Alaska Native Land Claims Settlement Act, which paved the way \nfor the trans-Alaska pipeline. He assisted me many times in matters \npertaining to the oceans--the Fishery Conservation Act, which protects \nthe fisheries off our shores. He voted with us on the Alaska Lands Act, \non issues that we tried to change in that bill in 1980. He and \nElizabeth Dole were very helpful in assisting us on the Alaska Railroad \ntransfer. As a matter of fact, as I have told many of my friends, their \nChristmas card that year was the photograph of the Secretary of \nTransportation and her husband standing at the back of the \nsuperintendent's car on the Alaska Railroad. That was Elizabeth's trip \nto Alaska, and Bob was traveling with his wife in her official \ncapacity. He was of great assistance to me at the time that we had the \nterrible disaster of the Exxon Valdez oilspill. I could go on and on \nand talk about things that Bob has done with me.\n\n  What I really want to talk about, though, today is Bob Dole as a \nleader. As he said to some of us today, he believed that, as the \nleader, he tried to reach out to those of us here in the Senate who \nmight disagree with him, and reach out to Americans. Recently, we had a \nreport of a poll in my State that showed Bob Dole is more popular than \nalmost any of us who are elected officials in Alaska. He is well known \nin the north country because they know that he has gone out of the way \non the campaign trail to go as far away as Alaska. I am one of those.\n\n[[Page S6051]]\n\n  There are not very many of us remaining here now who saw service in \nWorld War II. Part of my role has been to work as chairman of the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee to assure that we keep the mandate \nwe received from the Constitution to provide for the common defense.\n  Bob Dole has never, ever voted against those of us who believe in a \nstrong defense. He joined all of us who worked together in the Reagan \nyears to see to it that we could rebuild our national defenses--really \nour total military capability--at the time that the Soviets were going \ninto an enormous military monolithic Communist dictatorship. He was \nquite successful in getting the Senate to help President George Bush at \nthe time of the Desert Storm victory. He knows the value of defense. \nOne of the issues he is talking about now, as he leaves us, is our \nmissile defense system.\n  He has told us himself today about his role in the Disabilities Act. \nHe has worked with us in child nutrition, and he certainly has been \nresponsible for the family tax credits coming back to where they should \nbe. We hope to really increase those in the future. As was remarked \nhere on the floor by our leader, he has reduced the tax rates in our \ncountry from a maximum of 90 percent to a maximum of just over 30 \npercent--for most Americans, 28 percent.\n  But I am really full of memories today as we have seen our leader \nleave us because, as he mentioned in his statement, in 1984, I, too, \nwas a candidate to become the leader of the Senate. After several \nvotes, it came down to a contest between Senator Dole and \nmyself. During the counting of the vote, he came over and congratulated \nme and thought that I had won. To the contrary. He won the election by \na narrow vote. At that time, I asked for recognition and asked Senate \nRepublicans to vote unanimously for Senator Dole because it was clear \nwe needed a united Republican group in the Senate to move forward. In \nretrospect, I think that was probably one of the smartest moves I ever \nmade and one of the best votes I cast--to assure that Bob Dole was \nelected the leader of the Republican side unanimously. He has shown us \nwhat he can do.\n\n  I want the Senate to know how much he demonstrated his philosophy of \nreaching out. After that election, he asked me to come see him, and he \ntold me that he had some things in mind. For instance, one of the \nthings he wanted to do was have the Senate more involved in the \noversight of the arms control negotiations that were going on at that \ntime. He asked me to chair the arms control observers group which he \ncreated at that time. He got the support of the minority, and we \ncreated a bipartisan group that played, I think, a very successful role \nin working on arms control negotiations.\n  He also came to me--I think this is probably not too well known in \nthe Senate--and said that he was disappointed that the move to bring \ntelevision to the Senate had failed, and he asked me if I would work \nwith others in the Senate to bring that about. It was at that time a \nprivilege, really, to represent the leader in meeting with Senators \nfrom the other side and on our side of the aisle. There were some \nSenators who changed their positions when they realized that the new \nleader was very sincere and wanted to have the American public know \nwhat was going on in the Senate.\n  I think that the Senate has been changed by television coverage in \nthe Senate--some good and some bad, but mostly good. I believe it has \ndemonstrated for the country what is ahead of us if Bob Dole is \nsuccessful in his new quest, because he does reach out for people. He \nmakes sure that everyone involved around him has a meaningful role and \nlistens. He listens to advice. If there is one thing that I think can \nbe assured in the days ahead, it is that candidate Dole is going to \nlisten to America and America is going to listen to candidate Dole. For \nmyself, I can think of no better thing for the country than to know \nthat we go to the beginning of the new millennium with a new President.\n  So I hope, Mr. President, that this day, this decision that my good \nfriend has made to leave this Senate, which he loves and we all love, \nproves to be the right decision for him and for the country. I know \nthat he has not left our hearts because those of us who know him will \nbe with him all the way along the trail.\n  As the statement made by Theodore Roosevelt was read today in our \nmeeting, as we gave him the bust of Teddy Roosevelt, Bob Dole has known \nboth victory and defeat, and he has shown his courage and his ability \nto stay the course. I believe he has what it takes. I hope he will know \nvictory in the days ahead.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to salute the energy, \nintelligence, and personal strength of a man who is leaving a \nremarkable career in the U.S. Senate, the majority leader, Senator \nRobert Dole.\n  Many of my colleagues have worked with Senator Dole far longer than \nI, but it didn't take me long after I arrived here in 1993 to develop a \nhealthy respect for his skill as a legislator and for his ability to \nlead his Republican colleagues. Moreover, it quickly became clear to me \nthat Senator Dole is a man shaped and defined by his ability to meet \nchallenges without flinching and to overcome them.\n  He has been accorded well-deserved praise from both sides of the \naisle, and his colleagues on the other side have demonstrated their \nrespect for his abilities by making him the longest-serving Republican \nmajority leader in the Senate's history.\n  Mr. President, Senator Dole's government career since he joined the \nSenate in 1968 is widely known and respected. He has played a pivotal \nrole in the passage of several pieces of important legislation, \nincluding, for example, the landmark Americans With Disabilities Act in \n1990.\n  For many years, Senator Dole was a supporter of legislation to \nprotect civil rights. For example, his efforts were crucial in the \npassage of the renewal of the Voting Rights Act in 1982.\n  His imprint is also on the Food Stamp Program, on Social Security, \nand other important measures.\n  One legislative achievement that may not get much notice, but which \nhelps some of our Nation's most vulnerable people, is Senator Dole's \nsupport for the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly, or PACE. \nSenator Dole and I share an interest in this innovative long-term care \nprogram, which is a nationwide effort to integrate services for certain \nelderly Medicare and Medicaid patients. PACE has managed to provide an \nextensive array of services while saving money, both laudable goals.\n  On another issue--committing United States forces to Bosnia--Senator \nDole and I were in disagreement, but even though we were on opposite \nsides of the final vote to send American troops there, I recognized his \nefforts to work for bipartisanship and to take a risk to support what \nhe regarded as the necessary action in this area.\n  Mr. President, it is unfortunate that, during an election year, the \nSenate is so often consumed by partisan tensions and maneuvers. \nNevertheless, the U.S. Senate is an institution where it is possible to \nreach across the aisle and find common ground.\n  Senator Dole has devoted many, many years to the Senate and to \nworking on issues of enormous public interest. He has earned the \nrespect and admiration of all of his colleagues, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike.\n  Mr. President, Bob Dole will be long-remembered in the U.S. Senate, \nand this Chamber will simply not be the same without him.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today the Senate loses one of its true \nlegislative craftsmen. When I came to the Senate, Bob Dole had already \nearned a reputation as a legislator, a Republican who could cross the \naisle to work with Democrats to solve problems and reach compromise. \nThis is the essence of the Senate. I soon learned that the reputation \nof the Senator from Kansas was well earned. Over the years my respect \nfor his ability to craft a legislative solution has grown. We will all \nmiss his skill.\n  We will also miss Bob Dole for his sense of humor. The Senate can be \na place of high drama, high pressure, and sometimes high dudgeon. Bob \nDole, who has himself shown a real bite from time to time, and who is a \ntough fighter for his point of view, more often than not is able to \ndefuse the situation, and sometimes disarm his opponents with a quip or \na flash of his wit which leaves them laughing.\n  But, most of all, Mr. President, Bob Dole will be remembered in the \nSenate\n\n[[Page S6052]]\n\nas a man of his word. There is no greater compliment which one Senator \ncan pay to another.\n  In this body, a Senator is only as good, only as reliable, only as \neffective, as his or her word. Senator Robert Dole has earned the \nrespect of all who have served with him in this Senate.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, there are few true heroes in this country, \nbut one who has lived in our midst for many years is Bob Dole, who has \naccomplished so much in his life and is going off to accomplish more. \nHe was a hero in war who now and forever will bear the scars of his \nservice to his country. And he is a hero in peace--a man who can \nmaneuver through the legislative trenches with grace and daring, \navoiding minefields and pitfalls, running the gauntlet while dodging \nbomb blasts from his opponents.\n  He leaves us today to enter a new battleground, where, I have no \ndoubt, he will prevail with the same creativity and tenacity that had \nmade him such an able Senate leader.\n  Bob Dole has the experience, the temperament, and the judgment to be \nPresident. He is a man of honor and courage who understands the \nworkings of Government at the highest levels but has never lost his \nunderstanding of common men and women. That's because he is a common \nman, who through the sheer force of his intellect and industry has \nreached uncommon heights.\n  There are, of course, many stories that could be told to illustrate \nthe spirit and fortitude that has brought Bob Dole to such heights, but \ntwo of my favorites date to 1952, the year he was elected county \nattorney in Russell, KS, and began his political career.\n  One night after Bob was elected, a man named Huck Boyd was driving \nthrough Russell after midnight and saw the light still on at the county \ncourthouse. Huck Boyd was editor of a weekly newspaper and thought \nthere might be a break-in, so he pulled over to investigate. It turns \nout that Bob Dole, the new county attorney, was still working at his \ndesk. And it also turns out that Huck Boyd was Kansas' member of the \nRepublican National Committee, and was so impressed by this hard-\nworking young man that he started talking him up throughout Kansas as a \nfuture political superstar.\n  But the quote I like best comes from the story of the 1952 county \nattorney election itself. Two young men who had come back from World \nWar II were running--Bob Dole and Dean Ostrum. Dean was a bright young \nman who had enjoyed many of life's advantages and was the son of \nperhaps the best lawyer in Russell. Bob Dole didn't have all the \nadvantages of life, had seen more adversity in 29 years than most \npeople see in a lifetime, and was the son of Doran Dole who worked in a \nlocal creamery. As the campaign wore on, Bob outthought and outhustled \nhis opponent, won by 200 votes, and launched his political career. The \nquote I like is from Dean Ostrum years after the campaign was over:\n  ``How long was my day? I don't know, but it wasn't as long as Bob \nDole's I'm sure of that.''\n  Forty-four years later that statement still rings true. No one I know \nhas ever outworked Bob Dole.\n  One of the reasons I believe so strongly in Bob Dole's candidacy is \nbecause we share common views and values. We believe that consensus and \ncompromise make for good government. We believe that rigid ideas and \nhardened positions drive people apart and lead to stalemate and \nparalysis. We believe in Ronald Reagan's theory of the big tent--that \nthe Republican Party is a caring and compassionate organization that \nwelcomes people of all backgrounds, a party that does not demean \nminorities by ridiculing their ancestry, a party that speaks of hope \nand promise and does not exploit fears and anxieties.\n  We believe in a strong national defense, that America cannot be the \nworld's policeman, but neither can we afford to become a prisoner of \nworld events. Some want to walk away from the world, but Bob Dole knows \nthe world won't walk away from us.\n  We believe that the best protection for American industry and workers \nis to open up our minds through education, training, and competition--\nnot by shutting down our ports. We believe we must prevent illegal \nimmigration but not punish those who seek the blessings of America by \ncomplying with our laws.\n  Bob Dole, like Ronald Reagan before him, has dedicated his life in \npublic service to tearing walls down around the world and not putting \nthem up around America.\n  We also share a common belief that for government to operate most \neffectively--or in this day and age some might say to operate at all--\nit is necessary for policymakers to understand that goals cannot always \nbe achieved at once. Progress must often come in small steps. Bob Dole \nunderstands that principle better than most and he has the judgment, \ngleaned from years of experience, to know when those steps can be taken \nsafely--or when one more step will send us hurtling over a dangerous \nprecipice.\n  Bob Dole understands that power and responsibility must be returned \nto the States. We have a $5 trillion debt that is gobbling up our \nchildren's economic future, and we know we have to slay this monster or \nit will surely slay us.\n  The man who stood for so many years beside us in the Senate does not \nappear to be wearing armor. But he is. It's made of a composite \nstronger than anything that can be manufactured by campaign \nstrategists, pollsters, or spin-meisters. It's made of a belief in God, \ncountry, family, honor, and duty.\n  I have known Bob Dole for more than 20 years as both a friend and a \nleader. He is a man of good heart and good humor who calls forth the \nbetter angels of our nature.\n  As President of the United States, he will make America safe and \nsound for us and our children. As President of the United States, he \nwill help make the world safe for America.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, as Bob Dole leaves the U.S. Senate today, \nwe are participating in a celebration unlike anything we have witnessed \nin the Senate for many years, and are unlikely to see again in this \ncentury. The abundant flow of affection in the midst of applause and \ntears are testimony to our recognition of Bob Dole's investment in the \nSenate, our recognition of the hold his leadership has on our \nperceptions of the Senate, and the meaning of statesmanship, public \nservice, and patriotism.\n  Senator Bob Dole of Kansas was easily reelected to a fifth term in \nthe U.S. Senate. After 8 years of service in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, he is in his 28th year of Senate service. On most days \nin the U.S. Senate and in most battles, Bob Dole has been the voice and \nthe very visible, energetic leader of the Republican Party.\n  Bob Dole is the personification of hard work, constructive \nintelligence, personal loyalty and the determination to succeed against \nall odds.\n  His life has been filled with honors and recognition for significant \nachievements. But perhaps the defining moments of his life were those \nhe spent on a mountainous Italian battlefield.\n  The troops he led as an Army infantry lieutenant were exposed to \ndeadly enemy machine gun fire. He led the charge to eliminate the enemy \nemplacement. He absorbed withering fire which tore his body and almost \nended his life.\n  His heroism was recognized promptly. But his ability to force feeling \nand movement into his wounded body, to restore some hope that he could \nfeed himself, dress himself, and function as a working, contributing \nman, took years of agonizing treatment, therapy, and persistence beyond \ncomprehension.\n  Bob Dole is intellectually and physically tough because his very life \nand being have depended upon that toughness. But those same fateful \nexperiences have undergirded his compassionate championship of all \nhandicapped Americans who have counted upon him to extend a strong hand \nback to pull them into the fullness of life in America.\n  From his early days in Russell, KS, Bob Dole has understood the \nstruggle of many families to keep food on the table. He has been the \nSenate champion for thoughtful nutrition programs, including \ncomprehensive knowledge about food stamp distribution and a host of \nfood programs for the working poor of our country.\n  I first met Bob Dole when he was Chairman of our national party, and \nlater as our Vice Presidential nominee in 1976. In the days following \nthat election, I called Bob Dole to thank him\n\n[[Page S6053]]\n\nfor his leadership and to ask for his help in fulfilling my first \nSenate campaign pledge, namely, to seek a seat on the Agriculture \nCommittee. Even at a time of his own personal discouragement, he was \ncharacteristically helpful to me. I was seated at the end of the \nminority side of the table as the most junior member. I have witnessed \nfor 20 years the mastery of Bob Dole as a farm legislator.\n  His energy level is astonishing. His capacity to entertain new ideas \nand his generous ability to boost other people have strengthened my \nenthusiasm for this remarkable Kansan.\n  He deserves the opportunity to serve our Nation as its President. The \nNation deserves his Presidency, which could be a term of remarkable \nachievement based on his innate courage and wisdom, and his universal \nexperience with public persons and public issues.\n  I will be one who strives to help him realize new dimensions of \nleadership, because I have witnessed his integrity and I have \nconfidence in his judgment. For the moment, I believe it is most \nimportant simply to recognize that to applaud Bob Dole is to applaud \nthe vitally important concept that good people arise in America to \nassume great responsibilities. Our country is stronger because this \nSenator always saw his duty and inspired so many Americans to follow \nhim.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in wishing the majority leader \nwell--but not too well--as he takes his leave of the Senate.\n  He and I have differed on many occasions on many issues during the \nmany years we have served together. But we have also been able to find \nmany opportunities to work well together on many different issues of \nboth foreign and domestic policy, and I have great respect for his \nability as a Senator and Senate leader.\n  Of course, I liked it better when he was minority leader instead of \nmajority leader.\n  In fact, we have worked closely on many significant issues over the \nyears. I think particularly of the Americans With Disabilities Act in \nrecent years. Senator Dole was a strong supporter from the beginning. \nHe stepped in early and often, and prevented many abrasive \nconfrontations on that bill. As a result, it was enacted with broad \nbipartisan support in Congress, and has become one of Senator Dole's \nand Congress' most notable achievements.\n  Senator Dole and I also worked well together on other civil rights \nbills, on voting rights bills, on child nutrition legislation, and a \nrange of other issues. In addition, we served together on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee for 6 years at the end of the 1970's and the \nbeginning of the 1980's, and I was consistently impressed with his day-\nto-day ability on the issues and his tireless energy and dedication.\n  I also have many warm memories of the daily radio debates we did \ntogether for 4 years in the 1980's on our program called ``Face Off.'' \nWe were usually, but not always, facing in opposite directions on the \nissues, but Senator Dole's intelligence and wit always shone through, \nand helped make the daily analyses both enlightening and enjoyable.\n  Often, even in the most contentious debates in the Senate, his \nexcellent sense of humor was particularly effective, and he used it \nskillfully to defuse the tensest moments.\n  Now, Senator Dole leaves the Senate with a record of many \naccomplishments that have served the Senate well, the Congress well, \nthe State of Kansas well, and the people of America well.\n  I join Senators on both sides of the aisle who have found it a great \nprivilege, a great honor, and a great education to work with Senator \nDole over the years. We admire his leadership and statesmanship, and we \nvalue his friendship. We respect him, and we will miss him very much in \nthe months and years ahead.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today, as have my Senate colleagues, \nto pay tribute to the distinguished Senate majority leader, Senator \nRobert Dole of Kansas.\n  Mr. President, the great American patriot Henry Clay, who also served \nas a Member of the House and the Senate, once said, ``Of all the \nproperties which belong to honorable men, not one is so highly prized \nas that of character.''\n  He was right. As imperfect beings, we all strive to cultivate \nvirtuous qualities--we endeavor to be kind; we are mindful to be \ncourteous; in trying times, we struggle to maintain a sense of humor, \nbut character, as the fiery turn-of-the-century evangelist, Dwight L. \nMoody, once so bluntly defined it, ``is what you are in the dark.''\n  Character is not something one can put on, like a new set of clothes. \nIt is not something one trots out on special occasions, like courtly \nmanners. It is not something one can pretend to possess. Yet, despite \nits ethereal quality, character is unmistakably apparent. It is the \nsteady hand in times of crisis, the quiet voice in times of stress. It \nis courage in the face of adversity, strength of purpose, when all else \nseems to fail. It is a ``property,'' as Henry Clay put it, whose value \nis beyond measure, a characteristic no amount of money can buy.\n  Mr. President, Robert Dole is a man of character. A man who has \nremained true to his convictions; a man unafraid to defend his beliefs; \na man who says what he thinks, and means what he says. He is a doer, \nnot a talker; a fighter, not an equivocator; a leader not a dodger.\n  Today he leaves the U.S. Senate and the battlefield he's loved so \nwell for so many years, the Senate floor. But he goes not gentle into \nthe good night. He leaves on one last mission. He leaves to engage \nperhaps the most important battle he will ever fight--a battle not just \nfor the heart and soul of America, but--more importantly--for the \nfuture of America. A battle that will lose or save America for the next \ngeneration; a battle to accomplish what all generations except ours \nhave done before us--leave America a better place for our children and \nour grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, it is a battle that must be fought; a battle that must \nbe won. And I can think of no one better to lead the mission than Bob \nDole.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, today Senator Dole becomes citizen Dole. He \nhas every right to be proud of that hard, courageous decision. We in \nthe Senate have every reason to be sorry for it.\n  Senator Dole leaves a legacy of lasting influence. He led this body \nto historic accomplishments, including the rescue of Social Security \nand the first balanced budget in a generation. He led his party, 2 \nyears ago, to historic victory. And now he has accepted one more \nopportunity to serve--one more chance to lead.\n  This is the common thread that runs through an uncommon life--\nleadership. He has provided a definition of the term.\n  Senator Dole has mastered the art of consensus. He knows when a \nbreakthrough depends on one well-placed word. He knows how to cool \ntempers and emphasize agreement. He knows how to turn the chaos of this \nprocess into tangible achievements. These are rare and important \nqualities.\n  But this is only half of the story. I have seen another side of \nSenator Dole's leadership. He once put it this way:\n\n       I believe there is a place for honest negotiation in \n     politics. It is an essential part of Democracy. Every \n     political movement, and every public official, however, must \n     locate a place where compromise ends--a core of conviction \n     where we keep our conscience. There comes a time when even \n     practical leaders must refuse to bend or yield.\n\n  For Senator Dole that core of conviction is basic and clear, \npermanent and solid: safe streets, strong families, military strength, \nfiscal responsibility, a decent public culture. These commitments are \nnothing new and everything important. They are rooted deeply in the \nsoil of the midwest in the lessons of a small town in his experiences \nof suffering and service. Bob Dole understands the secret strength of \nAmerica, because he embodies it.\n  Senator Dole understands that Americans value freedom and \nresponsibility, but must still care for one another in times of crisis \nand need. He understands the fears at the edge of poverty, because he \nfelt them in his youth. He understands the price of liberty, because he \npaid it himself. He fights strongly, because he believes deeply. We \nhave come to depend on this core of conviction, based on the lessons of \na life.\n  In his legislative career, Senator Dole has displayed both elements \nof true leadership: consensus and conscience, flexibility and firmness. \nHe is\n\n[[Page S6054]]\n\nan example to all of us who work with him--who follow him--who respect \nhim. Leaving the security of the Senate is just another example of the \nmoral courage we have come to know the essence of leadership at the \nmoment of testing.\n  T.S. Eliot wrote, ``in my end is my beginning.'' This is the end of a \ndistinguished legislative career. It is the beginning of a new mission. \nThat mission takes Senator Dole beyond this body, and we regret it. But \nI am convinced it will take him to the White House. Senator Dole--\ncitizen Dole--has only begun his service to this Nation.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to honor and remember our \ndistinguished majority leader, our colleague, and our friend, Bob Dole, \nas he prepares to leave the Senate.\n  When you work with or around Bob Dole, you soon realize: He has \nconsistent values and an unwavering commitment to them.\n  He's been in there fighting for a balanced budget--not because of \nsome green eyeshade interest in the numbers, but because he knows its a \nmoral issue.\n  He's been fighting for years, consistently, for a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment because he understands this is a principle of \nfundamental fairness, and he understands how the Constitution really \nworks, protecting the basic rights of the people by preventing the \nGovernment from abusing its powers.\n  I've worked with Bob Dole on other constitutional issues, from \nprotection of second amendment rights to private property rights.\n  When Congress passes the 28th amendment--the balanced budget \namendment--some time in the near future, even though he will have left \nthe Senate, it will be, in part, a monument to Senator Dole's years of \nhard work.\n  I remember many events, many battles, high points and defeats, as Bob \nDole and I have worked together for the balanced budget amendment.\n  When I was in the House, in the early 1980s, Charlie Stenholm, a \nDemocrat from Texas, and I started CLUBB--Congressional Leaders United \nfor a Balanced Budget.\n  Pete Wilson was our Senate Co-Chair and Bob Dole was a charter \nmember.\n  When we met with taxpayer groups, and stood on the steps of the \nCapitol with mail bags full of hundreds of thousands of letters and \npetitions from Americans everywhere--Bob Dole was always there with us, \npromoting the balanced budget amendment.\n  CLUBB worked with taxpayer groups to schedule Members of Congress \naround the country to meet with local leaders, State legislatures, and \nothers on behalf of the balanced budget amendment.\n  I remember back to 1985-86 and how it impressed me that, here was the \nmajority leader of the U.S. Senate, a man busy with every issue before \nCongress--and he took the time and effort to travel whenever he could, \nwherever he could, to bring the balanced budget crusade to Americans \neverywhere.\n  And last year, after our constitutional amendment fell one vote \nshort, and then again this year, he showed that the Senate could break \nwith history and make history, could muster enough courage, under his \nleadership, to actually produce a balanced budget.\n  Citizen, Senator, Majority Leader Bob Dole has worked, fought, and \nspoken to the Nation for the balanced budget amendment because he cares \nabout the future of our Nation; because he cares about our children, \nand what kind of opportunity we leave for them; because he cares about \nhaving a country that provides for the security of our seniors and the \nbest possible jobs for our working men and women.\n  Many, many aspects of Bob Dole's life have demonstrated how much he \ncares about people, especially the helpless, and about our country.\n  Much has been said about his record as a war hero and his war \ninjuries. And, of course, much has been said about his public service.\n  Unlike many in politics, he has not just sympathized with people's \npain, he has been there.\n  Doctors first said he would not live because of his war injuries. \nThen they said he would never walk again.\n  But he did much more than walk--he soared on the wings of self-\nsacrifice and service to others.\n  Because of the values he learned growing up in Russell, KS, because \nof the lessons of life, he understands people and cares about people.\n  This understanding has shown through in his leadership here in the \nSenate, where he has been perceptive about the strengths of his \ncolleagues and what things are important to them.\n  It has particularly struck me how he, as leader, has always looked to \nmatch those strengths and interests with the tasks at hand to give his \ncolleagues leadership opportunities, and to accomplish something good \nfor the Nation.\n  The Senate will miss his leadership, his dedication, his integrity, \nand how he cares about people.\n  And in the coming months the Nation will learn much more about those \nqualities, and will call upon him for one more heroic mission.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \npaying tribute to the Senator from Kansas.\n  The significance of this day should not be diminished by reference to \nor discussion of the gentleman's future pursuits. They should more \nimportantly reflect the tenure and service that he has already given \nhis State of Kansas, the office of majority leader, the institution of \nCongress, and this country as a whole.\n  Mr. President, I remember my first direct interaction with Bob Dole \nin 1993 as we crafted fundamental entitlement reform to the \nsupplemental security income system. I could talk today of our work in \nshaping the direction of our Nation's social policies, more recently \nduring a very intense debate here last fall on a comprehensive welfare \nreform package. I was honored to have been of assistance to him in \nmanaging the floor discussion, and it was during this debate that \nSenator Dole's guiding hand was once again exhibited in maneuvering \nthis body through one of the more contentious and important discussions \nof national policy.\n  As the youngest member of this body, however, it is with a different \nperspective that I would like to focus my remarks today. Many of Bob \nDole's most significant experiences, especially his service in \ndefending this country in World War II, largely precede my 38 years. \nHis 35 years of service and leadership in Congress roughly bridges the \nspan of my life. And while I have only had the honor to serve under his \ndirect leadership in the Senate for a year and a half, I have \nindirectly benefited from Bob Dole's sacrifices, courage, and \nconvictions for the better part of my life.\n  Today's speeches have been filled with personal reflections, tributes \nto service, and legislative and policy histories that all have been \ninfluenced by the gentleman from Kansas. As moving and genuine as these \nreflections have been, time and history will truly capture and attest \nto the magnitude of Senator Dole's service and the importance of his \ndeparture.\n  Rapid change in the character and makeup of both Chambers has marked \nmy 6-year service in the U.S. Congress. Since my election in 1990, the \nU.S. Congress has experienced not only one of the largest single year \nturnovers since the 1974 elections, but has also ushered in a historic \nchange in the majority parties of both houses.\n  And in the midst of this profound change, individuals like the \nSenator from Kansas have remained a stabilizing force to this \ninstitution. As it is far too easy to get lost in the direction of our \nown careers, we must not allow ourselves to lose sense of those who \nhave shaped the institution of Congress and those who have left a \nlasting imprint on the direction of our Nation. History will \nundoubtedly record Senator Dole as one of those people.\n  As the longest serving majority leader in the U.S. Senate, Senator \nDole possesses an instinctive ability to navigate the Senate's process \nof forced compromise. While at times during this session these \nabilities have served as a source of personal consternation, I readily \nacknowledge that these are qualities that a leader must exhibit to \ncarry out the duties and responsibilities of this Chamber. These are \nqualities that a leader must espouse to bridge the ideological \ndifferences that manifest themselves in the direction of our policies.\n  Clearly, the history and service of Senator Dole's 35 years in \nCongress is\n\n[[Page S6055]]\n\nan inspiration to all of us and a challenge as we, in his absence, try \nto foster and maintain the integrity and direction of the institution \nof the Senate.\n  The hallways of the Senate will long be filled with the images of \nSenator Dole's presence and the echoes of his trademark late night \nwalks from this Chamber, through the Vice President's lobby, and to the \nmajority leaders office overlooking America's Mall of monuments to this \nNation--the view across what will now be known as the Bob Dole balcony.\n  Mr. President, it is indeed a distinct honor to congratulate and \nthank the Senator from Kansas for his service to our country. I rise \nwith the distinction of being a U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania and the \nhonor of being a colleague of the Senator from Kansas. I rise with the \nprivilege of representing 12 million Pennsylvanians in the rich \ntradition and history of Senators Hugh Scott, John Heinz, and Harris \nWofford, who have had the honor to serve with Senator Dole at this very \ndesk before me, and have been enriched by the shared service and \nexperiences. But most importantly, I rise as a personal beneficiary of \nthe Senator's sacrifice, his service, his steadfastness, and his \nwisdom.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I stand today with the privilege of \nspeaking in some small way for those Pennsylvania voices in sharing our \nblessing for the continued strength, courage, and conviction in life's \npursuits for Mr. Dole and his family.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise for a final, heartfelt tribute to \nSenator Dole.\n  In another unselfish act on behalf of his country, Senator Dole will \nleave the Senate where he has so well served the people of Kansas in \norder to better serve the American people as our next President.\n  Mr. President, by any definition, Bob Dole is a great man--a man \nwhose entire life has been dedicated to serving his country with honor, \nwith courage, and with integrity.\n  Bob Dole is an American hero. He fought to defend this country during \ntimes of war. And throughout his career he has fought for policies to \nensure prosperity and security at home and peace around the world.\n  Mr. President, Bob Dole has remained dedicated to the same causes and \nprinciples that led him into public service over 40 years ago. He is a \nman certain of his core values, and anchored to his unwavering \nprinciples of service to country, honoring individual freedom, and \nbettering the lives of every American.\n  Mr. President, Bob Dole represents what's right about America: \nintegrity, courage, compassion, and patriotism.\n  Mr. President, it will be difficult to imagine the Senate without Bob \nDole's strong presence and skillful leadership. Bob Dole's monumental \nlegislative achievements--first as a legislator and now as leader--are \nthe direct result of his strongly held convictions, his forceful \nadvocacy, his skill at debate, and his respect and tolerance for other \nSenators' views, perspectives, and experiences.\n  His native State of Kansas and the many noble causes he has \nchampioned over the years have benefited from his legislative skills. \nAs his colleagues, we know--and history will record--that he has had an \nindelible influence on this body, our Government, our people, and our \ntimes that will be felt well into the next century. He will leave an \nimprint deeper and stronger than few Senators in history can rival.\n  Mr. President, some personal comments on Senator Dole are unavoidable \nat this moment. How could a Midwestern-Kansas conservative from a rural \nand agricultural State become friends and have so much in common with \nan ethnic second-generation Italian from Long Island?\n  In Bob Dole's own words:\n\n       Al D'Amato and Bob Dole--at first glance it seems like an \n     unlikely friendship. One was raised on his mother's pasta in \n     the heart of America's largest city. And the other was raised \n     on his mother's fried chicken on the plains of rural Kansas. \n     But when New Yorkers sent Al to the United States Senate in \n     1980, it didn't take me long to discover that we had a great \n     deal in common.\n       Both of us call them like we see them. Both of us believe \n     in the neighborhood values that made America great--values \n     like hard work and personal responsibility. Both of us don't \n     give up without a fight. And both of us have never forgotten \n     from where we came.\n\n  Mr. President, these insightful words are from Bob Dole's \nintroduction to my book. They reveal Bob Dole's basic decency, his \nsolid foundations, and his strong character. These are the qualities \nthat attract people to Bob Dole and the reasons he is so admired.\n  Mr. President, as my dear friend, colleague, and leader, Bob Dole, \ndeparts the Senate to pursue the Presidency; he leaves with my \ncontinued admiration and support. His unique and historic journey has \ntaken an unexpected but necessary turn. With his beloved Elizabeth \nbeside him in his quest for the Presidency, I know my friend has made \nthe right choice.\n  Mr. President, the Senate will miss Bob Dole and I will certainly \nmiss my friend.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, one of the stories Bob Dole likes to \ntell in speeches and interviews has to do with the events in the first \n2 weeks of 1983 when, quite literally, the Social Security system was \nsaved. As with many tales told on political campaign trails, it is not \none hundred percent accurate. We all recall that opening passage from \nHuckleberry Finn in which Huck tells us that we will recognize him from \nthe book about Tom Sawyer which was written by Mr. Mark Twain, ``and he \ntold the truth mainly.''\n  Which Bob Dole does. The only part of the tale he leaves out is his \nown role. It could not have happened without him. To the contrary, he \nmade it happen.\n  I was there. I so attest. It was January 3, 1983. A new Congress was \nconvening. I had just been sworn in for a second term. This was \nagreeable enough, indeed, hugely so, but there was a cloud over the \noccasion. I had gone on to the Finance Committee in 1977 and had worked \non the Social Security Amendments of that year, under the superb \nleadership of Gaylord Nelson. We had realized the actuarial troubles \nthe Social Security Trust Fund would face with the curious demography \nof the baby boom on the still-distant but recognizable horizon. We put \nin place a number of F.I.C.A. tax increases to provide for this. And \nthought our work was done. Then came the second oil shock and the great \ninflation of the late 1970's. For the first time in our history price \nincreases ran ahead of wage increases. The Trust Funds sank to the \npoint of approaching insolvency. In 1981, the new director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget, David Stockman, warned the country to \nexpect the ``world's largest bankruptcy'' on a date certain in the near \nfuture. It wasn't as bad as that, but Robert J. Myers, the former chief \nactuary, knew it was bad enough and he passed this on. President Reagan \ncalled for and Congress created a Commission on Social Security Reform, \nheaded by Alan Greenspan. We met all through 1982, but could come to no \nagreement on what to do. The year ended, the Commission ended, an \ninconsequential report was drafted.\n  But something had, in fact, happened. Bob Dole, a member of the \nCommission, had listened. He always listens, as Senators know. But this \ntime he was listening to information quite at odds with all he had ever \nheard. That Social Security was not a crazy New Deal Ponzi scheme \ncertain to go broke one day. That day being at hand. Which is what so \nmany members of his party were willing to believe. No; he learned, \nlargely from Myers, there were difficulties but they could be resolved \nand should be resolved.\n  On that January 3 morning, Senator Dole had an op-ed article in The \nNew York Times. I ask unanimous consent that it be reprinted in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 3, 1983]\n\n                        Reagan's Faithful Allies\n\n                             (By Bob Dole)\n\n       Washington.--In this city, which makes history but prefers \n     headlines, today's hottest story is President Reagan's \n     problem with his allies on Capitol Hill. But those who \n     believe that they see a divisive split between the President \n     and Congressional Republicans ignore Ronald Reagan's many \n     achievements, misunderstand the role of Congress, and \n     exaggerate the tension between the Presidency and Congress \n     that has naturally existed since the Founding Fathers found \n     room for both in the Constitution.\n       It is important to understand that Presidents of both \n     parties have always had differences with their friends on \n     Capitol Hill.\n\n[[Page S6056]]\n\n     Thomas Jefferson had to endure a Speaker of the House who was \n     not only a fellow Democrat but his own son-in-law and who had \n     the irritating habit of publicly charging members of the \n     Jefferson Administration with corrupt land speculation.\n       Abraham Lincoln found his military decisions criticized by \n     his own party's select committee on the conduct of the war, \n     and his nascent plans for Reconstruction roadblocked by the \n     so-called radical Republicans.\n       Theodore Roosevelt's pioneering efforts to regulate \n     commerce and preserve the natural splendors of the West ran \n     counter to the property-loving instincts of Republican \n     legislators.\n       Franklin Delano Roosevelt saw the wave of his personal \n     popularity crest in 1937, when disgruntled Democrats shot \n     down his plan to pack the United States Supreme Court.\n       Lyndon B. Johnson failed to unite Democrats behind the \n     Vietnam war and, in the end, abdicated. So did Richard M. \n     Nixon when many of his strongest supporters made clear their \n     distaste for his handling of Watergate. Earlier still, Mr. \n     Nixon watched as two Supreme Court nominees were torpedoed by \n     Republican Senators.\n       Jimmy Carter's term was rendered all but irrelevant by \n     Democrats of the Kennedy stripe. Now, after two years of \n     remarkable leadership, the equal of anything seen in this \n     city since the heyday of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, it \n     has become fashionable to claim that Ronald Reagan's mastery \n     over Congress has become frayed and that his options for \n     future guidance have narrowed to little more than graceful \n     acquiescence.\n       Much of this is the product of journalistic boredom or \n     perhaps, Democratic wishful thinking. Those interested in the \n     sounds of genuine partisan division ought to pitch their \n     hearing to the tunes of Mondale and Glenn and Hart and \n     Hollings and Askew and Cranston.\n       What's more, those now debating responsibility for next \n     year's agenda all too easily overlook Ronald Reagan's \n     achievement in setting the decade's agenda. They forget that \n     the President has already engineered a major shift in \n     relations between the individual and his Government. And, in \n     their own preoccupation with current headlines, they obscure \n     a personal history of political resourcefulness and a gift \n     for compromise familiar to anyone who has examined Ronald \n     Reagan's Governorship in California.\n       So, before Republicans start believing the fashionable \n     theory of a White House-Capitol Hill split, we ought to \n     remind ourselves that we are led by a persuasive chief \n     executive, that we enjoy strong, experienced leadership in \n     both houses of Congress and that the issues confronting us \n     present as much opportunity as peril.\n       Social Security is a case in point. With 116 million \n     workers supporting it and 36 million beneficiaries relying on \n     it, Social Security overwhelms every other domestic priority. \n     Through a combination of relatively modest steps, including \n     some acceleration of already scheduled taxes and some \n     reduction in the rate of future benefit increases, the system \n     can be saved. When it is, much of the credit, rightfully, \n     will belong to this President and his party.\n       Similarly, the mashed-potato circuit echoes to the \n     plaintive cries of born-again protectionists who address the \n     symptoms and not the illness plaguing our economy. Whether \n     through local-content legislation or export subsidies, they \n     would scuttle free trade and risk a global war, with tariffs \n     and other trade barriers as lethal weapons. Wrong as they may \n     be in their prescription, these new economic isolationists \n     have struck a responsive chord in a nation deeply worried \n     about present and future employment. Again, the trade issues \n     provide Republicans at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue with \n     the potential to reach out to working people, to demonstrate \n     not only verbal concern but practical solutions.\n       The nation's headline writers like to call President Reagan \n     The Great Communicator. Historians, I'm convinced, will label \n     him the Great Reformer. It is his willingness to question \n     this city's conventional (and costly) wisdom that Republicans \n     must emulate as we tackle priorities too pressing to put off. \n     No one is more eager to extend the Reagan revolution and to \n     avoid political trench warfare in the coming session than \n     Congressional Republicans.\n       The atmosphere within which the new Congress convenes will \n     be shaped by perceptions that, in politics, are sometimes the \n     equivalent of reality. And it is as a supporter of the \n     President's objectives that I express concern about \n     perceptions of his program. Clearly, they will not be \n     improved so long as the Congress, public and news media \n     discern an imbalance between human needs and military \n     hardware. When the Constitution mandated the Federal \n     Government to provide for the general welfare, it said \n     nothing about the generals' welfare.\n       The problem of perception might also be improved by a \n     closer partnership between the White House and its natural \n     allies on Capitol Hill. A modest but useful first step would \n     be more frequent and constructive give-and-take sessions with \n     G.O.P. leaders. For we, no less than his own department \n     Secretaries and other personnel, belong to the President's \n     official family. And we, no less than they, wish the next two \n     years to be as successful as the last two.\n       Certainly, tackling Social Security and trade issues will \n     engender controversy. But the alternative is momentum \n     surrendered and an anxious public disillusioned. This \n     President has always insisted that purely political \n     considerations will not affect his judgment. That is one more \n     reason why he is free to propose and achieve reforms on a \n     historic scale. By doing so, he insures that he will not have \n     to wait for history to express gratitude.\n       Those who say that the bloom is off the rose for Ronald \n     Reagan forget that the rose is a perennial. With a little \n     imaginative gardening now, it will blossom handsomely in \n     1984.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, note that paragraph about Social \nSecurity. ``. . . The system can be saved.''\n  I had read it. I went up to Senator Dole on the floor and said, \n``Bob, if you think that, and I think you are right, oughtn't we give \nit one more try?'' He asked me if I could meet with him the next day. \nBoth of us were planning vacations, but this came first. At 4 o'clock \nnext, Tuesday, January 4, we met in his office. I give you now the \nevents of the next 13 days. They are written from my daily schedule, \nbut think Bob Dole all along.\n\n       Tuesday, January 4, 1983, 4:30 p.m.: Senators Dole and \n     Moynihan meet with Robert J. Myers re Social Security.\n       Wednesday, January 5, 2:00 p.m.: Senator Moynihan meets \n     privately with Alan Greenspan, Congressman Conable and Robert \n     J.

They \nwere Dole days and should never be forgotten.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, though I cannot join my Republican \ncolleagues in wishing Senator Dole success in his next endeavor, I join \nwith Senator Daschle and all of my colleagues in wishing the \ndistinguished majority leader and his wife and daughter good health and \nevery happiness in the future. To leave his beloved institution after \nsuch a long and illustrious public service career--for whatever \nreason--is, I am sure, difficult, but there is no greater reward than \nthe legacy of honorable public service.\n  Though we may not have agreed on many issues in the time we have \nserved together in this body, there is one in particular we agreed on \nand we worked together to make it happen. The Brockton, MA Little \nLeague became a national model for the establishment of a challenge \ndivision for little leaguers with disabilities, thanks to the efforts \nof Senator Dole. He is a fellow veteran and a man of proven personal \ncourage and deep political conviction. He has been an integral part of \nthe history of this institution and he will be missed.\n  Whatever our politics, whatever our philosophy of Government, this \nNation, the democratic process, and the U.S. Senate are well served by \nthose who have both the courage to survive against the odds in the face \nof extraordinary personal hardship, and the common sense to seek \nreasonable compromise for the survival of the Nation. The distinguished \nmajority leader's life has indeed been one of personal courage and \npolitical compromise. His record of public service speaks for itself, \nand as he leaves here today, we wish him well. As colleagues, we must \nput politics aside for a moment, remember the man and his career, and \nsay to the distinguished major leader: Thank you for the lesson in \nservice and democracy that you have given us.\n\n\n                        ``the measure of a man''\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today we recognize the departure of a \ngreat friend and colleague, Majority Leader Robert Dole, from the U.S. \nSenate.

Mr. President, today has been a very interesting day for \nour former leader, Bob Dole. While the U.S. Senate suffers what I \nbelieve is a tremendous loss today with the departure of the majority \nleader, Senator Robert Dole, I can tell you it is a great day for \nAmerica. I believe that. For, while Senator Dole leaves behind a legacy \nof extraordinary leadership and commitment to this institution, his \ndeparture promises the American people a much more important commitment \nto this country. But, perhaps more important, his departure gives the \nAmerican people a better opportunity to learn more about a man that I \nand many of my colleagues greatly admire and have come to know. So I \nwould like to spend just a few minutes to describe the man that I have \ncome to know, with whom I have worked, and I hope the American people \nwill come to know over the next few months.\n  Bob Dole, Senator Dole, is a man of his word. You can trust him. He \nis a plain speaker and not one for flowery oratory. He believes in what \nhe says. He means what he says. He does not try to be everything to \neverybody. He stands for a few important principles--not everything.\n  Senator Dole is honest and he is very straightforward. He is loyal. \nHe is a doer and he is not a talker. His values are constant; they do \nnot change from day to day. He knows who he is, where he comes from, \nwhere he wants to go, and his word is his honor. He is a man who chose \nsacrifice over self, finding strength at an age when others sought the \nleisure of self-expression.\n  Briefly, Bob Dole is a man of courage, a man of character, a man of \nintegrity. These measures of the man are what sets Bob Dole apart and \nwhat has led his colleagues in the Senate to entrust him with \nleadership time after time.\n  It will be these same characteristics that will distinguish for the \nAmerican people who they should trust to lead them in the years ahead. \nWhile it may be easy for others to constantly change what they stand \nfor in order to distinguish themselves on the issues, character, \ncourage, and integrity are not mantles of convenience. They cannot be \nadopted at will, converted by choice, or otherwise assumed. They are \nbedrock principles.\n  They are like a fingerprint, intractably a part of you, easy to trace \nand difficult to fake.\n  Over the next few months it will be for the American people to ask \nthe same question that the Senate has, who do they trust to lead this \nNation? I believe the answer will be the same ultimately. It will be \nSenator Dole.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we will shortly be moving to the budget \nresolution, but I understand the Senator desires to speak up to 5 \nminutes as in morning business on a statement regarding Senator Dole.\n  Mr. DeWINE. That is correct. It could be 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that he be granted 7 minutes as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6057-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6057-S6058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          A LEGISLATIVE GIANT\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico. On \nbehalf of the people of Ohio, I join all my colleagues in paying \ntribute to a legislative giant who left the stage of the U.S. Senate \njust a few moments ago.\n\n[[Page S6058]]\n\n  The Bob Dole America saw earlier today is a person we all in the \nSenate know: A man of character, a man of integrity and a man of utter \ndevotion to the future of this country.\n  It is strange in politics, it is really an oddity in politics that a \nperson's public image sometimes differs from his or her true qualities. \nThat sometimes is the case with Bob Dole.\n  I have watched some of his press conferences earlier in the campaign \nand particularly read some of the earlier stories and newspaper \narticles about him. When I did that, I realized there was something \nmissing, that this really was not the Bob Dole that I have seen for the \nlast 18 months.\n  The Bob Dole that I have seen was the real Bob Dole, the individual, \nthe leader, the war hero, the consensus builder and a man of enormous \ncompassion. In listening to his speech earlier today on this floor, I \ndid see those qualities clearly on public display, as did the American \npeople. This is Bob Dole, many times a man of few words, but a man who \nshows tremendous character and leadership in his actions.\n  Upon joining the Senate a little over a year ago, I became a Bob Dole \nwatcher. I had the opportunity as a Member of the House for 8 years to \nwatch him from afar, but I have had the opportunity now for a little \nover a year to see him up close and watch how he operates and watch how \nhe gets things done. I have seen him, as we all have, preside over four \ndifferent meetings at once, moving from room to room to room and never \nlose track of what is going on.\n  Bob Dole is someone who keeps in mind the big picture. I think the \nmajority leader of the U.S. Senate always has to keep the big picture \nin mind. Yes, he has to understand details, he has to understand the \nnuances of legislation, how you get bills passed, but he also has to \nkeep in mind the big picture: That you have to ultimately get the job \ndone, that you ultimately have to get the bill passed, that you \nultimately have to get things to happen.\n  This is the Bob Dole I saw earlier today. Earlier today, Bob Dole \ntold how he and Senator Moynihan and others made the last, brave \nattempt to reform Social Security in 1983, with the result that Social \nSecurity is safe for another generation.\n  That leadership ability is still there. I had the opportunity to see \nthat many, many times in the last year, year and a half, but my \nfavorite example that I use to illustrate Bob Dole's leadership is the \nwelfare reform bill that we passed. Unfortunately, the President \nultimately vetoed the welfare bill, but the bill we passed in the \nSenate, Bob Dole was able to get 87 votes for.\n\n  I do not think anyone in this Chamber, anyone in this country, none \nof the political experts a year ago, a year and a half ago, if we had \nbeen talking about welfare reform, would have thought Bob Dole could \nhave brought a welfare reform bill to this Senate and could have gotten \n87 votes. What an achievement--what an achievement.\n  Bob Dole was able to deal with the Governors, trying to put that \ntogether, certainly no easy task, and the Senate, equally difficult. \nAnd he put together a fair and balanced welfare reform measure. He was \nable to accomplish this amazing feat, because he never lost sight of \nthe need to ultimately reform a system that has long failed the people \nit was intended to help.\n  Mr. President, here is a man who is capable of making tough decisions \nand right decisions. As he pointed out in his speech earlier today, the \nSenate is not like the House of Representatives. The Senate leader has \nfewer tools to control the Senate than the House Speaker possesses in \nthe House. The Senate leader rules--not rules--really leads by \nconsensus. He cannot dictate, he must lead, and I have seen, as we all \nhave in this Chamber, Bob Dole lead.\n  I have been to more than one meeting with Senators, and Senators \nonly, where a Senator complained that he or she had not been consulted \non an issue or had some other complaint to the leader, Senator Dole, \nabout how things were going, what he had done, not done. I had seen Bob \nDole look at them, as only Bob Dole can, and say, ``Well, if you want \nsomeone else to lead, if you want someone else to be a leader, that's \nfine, but you elected me to lead. As long as I am the leader, I intend \nto do just that.'' And that was the end of the conversation. That is \nBob Dole. That is leadership.\n  But, Mr. President, my admiration for Bob Dole goes far beyond his \nability as a majority leader. It is personal as well. Bob Dole has the \ninsight born of someone who suffered an enormous and unexpected \ntragedy. He was a star athlete who went off to war and came back with \ncrippling injuries. This is not campaign hype of anything. Senator Dole \nwould rather downplay, and always has throughout his life, the \nstruggles that he encountered when he came back and what he had to go \nthrough when he came back from World War II. He would rather downplay \nwhat he struggles with every day, since he was literally blown apart in \nWorld War II.\n  We all expect in life to lose our parents, even a spouse. Certain \nthings you expect to happen, but there are other defining tragedies \nthat go beyond the normal course of events, that go beyond what we are \ntaught to expect. I have thought about this often since suffering the \nloss of our daughter, Becky. I, too, am also very reticent to talk \nabout such a deep and personal tragedy, but I cannot help but admire \nthe way Bob Dole has worked through his own suffering. He understands \ndaily pain, and I take great comfort from seeing this in him. He \nunderstands that life is not fair. Through dealing with pain, he has \nlearned to understand himself, and these, Mr. President, are not bad \nqualities to have in a leader or in a President.\n  The President who comes to mind who reminds me the most of Bob Dole \nin some ways is Franklin Roosevelt, who also faced physical disability \nwith silent courage. Like Roosevelt, Bob Dole's identity and his \nunderstanding of life were forged by pain. When Senator Dole made the \nhistoric announcement last month that he would leave the Senate, the \nroom was very crowded. It was so crowded that where I was, I could not \nsee the expression on his face as he made the speech, but I could hear \nthe emotion in his voice. Bob Dole has the two seemingly opposite \nqualities of toughness and compassion. He had to be tough to leave the \nSenate. Most people do not leave voluntarily after spending a lifetime \nto get here. But he showed his more emotional side, too, when he made \nhis announcement. His voice quivered during his announcement, not an \neasy public display for him, and he was even more emotional when he \nbroke up during an earlier private meeting with us.\n\n  But as difficult as this decision was for him, I believe he will find \nit liberating to have left the Senate. I recall my own decision to make \na second run for the Senate after losing the first time. I realized at \nthat point that if I lost the second bid that my political career was \nover. If I lose this race, what happens? The same is now true for Bob \nDole who said he has ``nowhere to go but the White House or home.''\n  Bob Dole had fixed in his own mind that his time as majority leader \nhad passed and that the time had come for another challenge. Once he \nmade the mental leap from the Senate Chamber, it was time to act.\n  This is the real Bob Dole. And as he said goodbye to us then and \nagain today, his friends and coworkers, Bob Dole looked like a leader. \nHe looked like a President.\n  Mr. President, I, like the rest of my colleagues, will always \nremember the demeanor and courage of this great statesman as he said \nfarewell to the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6057-4", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6058-S6060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I just want to clarify, I understood you \nsaid we would vote by 3:30 tomorrow if it is here; is that right?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. EXON. That would be Wednesday.

I said if the papers are not here, we cannot vote \ntomorrow by 3:30; then we will vote on the following day, which is \nThursday, at a time to be determined by the majority leader in \nconsultation with the minority.\n  Mr. EXON. We have no objection.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there is a unanimous-consent request I \nwant to make that has been cleared with the other side. There is an \nerror in section 103(b) of House Concurrent Resolution 178 with respect \nto the levels of outlays in the Social Security Program. Therefore, I \nask unanimous consent that the correct levels be printed in the Record \nat this point and they be deemed the appropriate levels for the \npurposes of enforcement of this budget resolution and the Congressional \nBudget Act.\n  I send a copy of the appropriate levels to the desk and ask that it \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Corrections to section 103(b) of H. Con. Res. 178:\n\n\n                                                                Outlays\nFiscal year:\n  1997.................................................$310,400,000,000\n  1998..................................................323,000,000,000\n  1999..................................................335,900,000,000\n  2000..................................................349,300,000,000\n  2001..................................................363,900,000,000\n  2002..................................................378,800,000,000\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now, Mr. President, Senator Exon has cleared this, too. \nThere are a number of errors contained in the statement of managers \nwhich accompany House Concurrent Resolution 178 with respect to the \ntables displaying the budget authority and the outlay allocations to \nthe committees of the Senate for purposes of section 302(a) of the \nBudget Act. I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that the correct tables \nbe printed in the Record at this point. These tables will be considered \nto be the allocations to the committees for the purposes of enforcement \nof this budget resolution and the Congressional Budget Act.\n  I send a copy of the correct tables to the desk and ask unanimous \nconsent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSENATE COMMITTEE

Mr. President, there are some additional errors within \nthe narrative of the statement of managers.

I send an attachment, along with a \ntable, to the desk in compliance with that request and ask unanimous \nconsent they be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S6060]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Corrections to the text of the joint explanatory statement \n     in H. Rpt. 104-612:\n       (1) On page 58, for function 150, International Affairs, \n     the 1997 budget authority figure should be $131 million.\n       (2) On page 59, for function 370, Commerce and Housing \n     Credit, the 1997 budget authority figure should be $3,092 \n     million; the 1997 outlay figure should be $2,990 million; the \n     size-year budget authority total should be $17,789 million; \n     the six-year outlay total should be $16,879 million.\n       (3) On page 88, the table includes the incorrect levels for \n     nondefense discretionary budget authority and outlays because \n     it fails to include the levels from the Violent Crime \n     Reduction Trust Fund. Section 301 of the budget resolution \n     establishes a cap on nondefense discretionary spending, which \n     includes spending from the Crime Fund. The following table \n     includes funding from the Crime Fund and provides the correct \n     levels for nondefense and total discretionary spending.\n\n                                                                DEFENSE/NONDEFENSE LIMITS                                                               \n                                                                [In millions of dollars]                                                                \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               1997               1998               1999               2000               2001               2002      \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDefense:                                                                                                                                                \n    Budget authority..................            266,362            268,971            271,500            274,024            276,672            279,459\n    Outlays...........................            264,968            263,862            267,048            270,657            269,744            269,608\nGeneral Purpose Nondefense:                                                                                                                             \n    Budget authority..................            226,305            219,646            213,718            218,515            214,445            221,133\n    Outlays...........................            270,571            258,492            252,981            248,847            246,479            244,611\nViolent Crime Reduction Trust fund:                                                                                                                     \n    Budget authority..................              4,683              5,100              6,050              6,050  .................  .................\n    Outlays...........................              3,073              4,664              5,456              5,747  .................  .................\nSubtotal Nondefense:                                                                                                                                    \n    Budget authority..................            230,988            224,746            219,768            224,565            214,445            221,133\n    Outlays...........................            273,644            263,093            258,437            254,594            246,479            244,611\nTotal Discretionary:                                                                                                                                    \n    Budget authority..................            497,350            493,717            491,268            498,589            491,117            500,592\n    Outlays...........................            538,612            526,955            525,485            525,251            516,223            514,219\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There are some Senators who want to be heard on the \nDole departure, but I believe I have used enough time.\n  I will yield to you, Senator Exon, if you would like to open now, at \nyour convenience.\n  Mr. EXON. I say to my friend and colleague from New Mexico, the \nSenator on this side has been trying to accommodate Democratic Senators \nwho wanted to speak on the budget. I had a Senator scheduled for 4:30. \nI set him back to 5 o'clock. I thought we had agreed, and I used time \nin the 1 hour, for salutes to Senator Dole.\n  All I am saying is it is very difficult for me to schedule speakers \non the matter at hand if we keep setting these things back. I wish to \naccommodate all Senators. When you accommodate one Senator, you \n``disaccommodate'' someone else.\n  How many speakers do we have that wish to speak on the Dole matter?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Hatfield has indicated he wants \nto speak for 3 minutes, 10 minutes for Senator Kempthorne, and 5 \nminutes for Senator Coverdell.\n  I will yield them my 18 minutes as if I were making an opening \nstatement, and that will be the end of my opening statement. Then it \nwill be your turn, and you can yield to some Democrat Senators after \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I yield to Senator Mark Hatfield 3 minutes, I yield 10 \nminutes to Senator Kempthorne, and I yield 5 minutes to Senator \nCoverdell. I yield in that order at this point. Then I will be gone \nfrom the floor. When they finish, we will return to Senator Exon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator from \nIdaho who was on the floor before me. I will follow the Senator from \nIdaho. I ask unanimous consent for that.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Senator from Oregon for his courtesy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6058-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6060-S6061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BOB DOLE\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, 15 months ago I told Bob Dole I would \nenthusiastically support his quest for the Presidency of the United \nStates. We see in his quest for the Presidency that he now has left the \nSenate of the United States. I think all of us have so many emotions \nthat we are feeling today. I know the Nation, the Senate, and I would \nregret the day when the clerk would call the roll and the name of Bob \nDole would no longer be called. That day has now arrived.\n  It would be easy to dwell on the truth that the Senate will lose a \nman that history will hold in a place of great honor. Rather, I think \nit is more important that we celebrate Bob Dole's victories, his \nleadership, his humor, and his ability to get things done.\n  Mr. President, I want to discuss for a moment, then, a personal \nexperience that I had with Senator Dole. It was with great pride and \nhonor when Senator Dole designated my legislation to stop unfunded \nFederal mandates, S. 1. As we all know, the significance, of course, is \nthat this denotes a majority leader's stamp of approval in his priority \non legislation. A majority leader does not want his bill that he has \ndesignated ``No. 1'' to fail.\n  Having said that, it is all the more remarkable that he chose my \nlegislation because I had only been here 2 years. I had no track \nrecord. It would have been far safer for Senator Dole to choose some of \nthe seasoned veteran Senators, such as Senator Domenici, Senator Roth, \nor Senator Hatfield, to carry this type of legislation. Not only did he \nchoose my legislation, but he then designated me to be the floor \nmanager, a responsibility I had never, ever done before.\n  I say this not in any way to somehow bring attention to myself, \nbecause I say this with all humility, to make it clear that Bob Dole \nwas not taking the normal course of action. It was indicative of his \nleadership of reaching out to others who may not have had all of the \ncredentials, all of the experience, but who do have a passion to get \nsomething positive done.\n  He transfers his belief in a person so that that person will not ever \nwant to let Bob Dole down. I believe that is what he will do for all of \nAmerica. He will tap that spirit in others and help them to reach new \nheights. It is one thing to have the ability to do something yourself, \nas Bob Dole has that great ability, but it is a greater achievement to \ninstill in others that same can-do spirit and then go and do it. But \nyou must have someone who believes in you.\n  Bob Dole believes in people. Bob Dole believes in America. He \ninstills in others that desire to reach within yourself and to do \nsomething great. It is a high honor to be elected by your fellow \ncitizens to serve in the U.S. Senate. To then have been able to serve \nwhile Bob Dole was here magnifies that honor.\n  When we had the debate on Senate bill 1, Senator Robert C. Byrd \ndescribed the new majority leader, Bob Dole, to his Democratic \ncolleagues by saying, ``The leader over there is tough. Wait and see. \nHe will use the rules on me, and I respect that, and I admire that.''\n  Well, yes, Bob Dole is tough. He is tough, but he is also wise. When \nduty calls for him to be bipartisan, the man knows how to be \nbipartisan. But he also knows when it is time to be partisan, and he \ncan be partisan. He is tireless. How many times have we been here on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate at midnight, and many of us are starting \nto find that our energies are sagging, and there is Bob Dole, crisp, \nwith his humor that props us up, keeps us going. There is Bob Dole, who \nhas a solution.\n  I am going to miss hearing Bob Dole telling Senators to work it out, \nwork it out, work it out. If it could not be worked out, he would \nalways say, ``Do you have the votes? Let us vote.'' For my part, Bob \nDole taught me the importance of working with and listening\n\n[[Page S6061]]\n\nto all Senators and of seeking solutions that do not abandon principle. \nI want my children, Heather and Jeff, to learn from Bob Dole that they \ncan overcome any adversity--any adversity that comes their way. I \ncannot think of a more honorable man that I would entrust the future of \nmy children to.\n  Finally, a word to Elizabeth and Bob Dole. I hope you leave the \nSenate with a deep and abiding satisfaction of mission accomplished, \njob well done. My wife Patricia and I will keep you in our prayers in \nthe coming months, and we will ask for God's peace and protection for \nyour family. We look forward to working with you--you, who I believe \nwill be the next President and First Lady of this great country.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in wishing \nour majority leader a senatorial farewell. His contributions are well \nknown, his integrity is unquestioned, and his service has been an \nexample for each one of us on both sides of the aisle.\n  I want to just comment about the service factor in his life and how \nwe are all drawn to those who serve--whether it is a Boy Scout who \nwalks a hobbling grandmother across the street, or a community clothing \ndrive, raising money for charity, or a PTA member spending hours at \nlocal meetings. Service we admire, service we respect, and service from \nour elected officials we always expect.\n\n  Majority Leader Dole is no exception. Kansans expect him to represent \ntheir interests. Republicans expect him to lead the party, and \nSenators--well, we expect him to guide us through the joys and trials \nof partisan politics. So, as a U.S. Senator, I have often expected him \nto serve me as well. Long before leaving this Senate, Bob Dole had my \nadmiration. Long before he led this Senate, he had my respect, and I am \nled to believe that long before he was decorated as a war hero, I would \nhave wanted Bob Dole as my friend.\n  The issues we debate during the 104th Congress we have debated \nbefore. Like a pendulum, important issues swing away from us, and \neventually they swing back. Every so often, we see a leader who is able \nto stop the pendulum, who is able to lead us into a solution that gives \nthe pendulum a bit of a rest. For the causes of the disadvantaged and \ndisabled Americans, Senator Dole has proven to be such a leader. And \nfor the need to reduce our deficit, he has few equals.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I have seen the work \nthat he has done. I have seen the money come in and, with greater \ndetail, I have seen the money go out. Senator Dole's legacy is his \nwillingness to fight for the welfare of today while just as eagerly \nvying for the welfare of our children and our grandchildren for the \nfuture.\n  So, in 1968, he joined the ranks of this body, and in 1996 he leaves. \nI shall not wish him a happy retirement, for no matter what lies ahead, \nhe will not retire. I expect his service will always continue. I wish \nhim well. Antoinette and I both pray that Bob and Elizabeth's future \nwill be strewn with God's blessing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, not far from the Capitol, on \nConstitution, across from the Navy Memorial, is a building that houses \nthe Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United \nStates and other major artifacts of our beginning. On the outside of \nthe building, it says, ``The Past is Prolog.''\n  As I have heard the eloquent statements throughout the day and \nthroughout the past several weeks about our majority leader, this has \ncome to mind, because the future is always guided and shaped by the \npast.\n  Bob Dole is a man of this century. Bob Dole's life experience is that \nof a giant figure in American history. The experiences of his life are \nimmeasurable. The knowledge that has been accomplished by it would be \nhard to calculate. The capacity that it represents has a far and long \nreach. So when the Senator from Kansas came at midday and gave us his \nfarewell address, you could measure some of the energy and reach and \ncapacity of this world figure, of this American figure, by the response \nthat he received on both sides of the aisle, and throughout America, I \nam sure.\n  I have always said that whenever I think of Bob Dole, I think of the \nheart and soul of America. I think we saw that expressed over these \nlast several days. He truly is the embodiment of everything that we \nhave come to think of as America--the fortitude to overcome adversity, \nperseverance, patience, strength, agility, entrepreneurship, problem \nsolving, getting things done. He leaves with the love of his family of \ncolleagues, all who have wished him a safe and secure journey. He \ncharacterizes what is yet before him as ``one more mission.'' I think \nthat statement properly casts what lies before him, but it also reminds \nus of what he has endured. He is a man who has endured and built the \nAmerican mission. He brings to his task, as I have said, immeasurable \nresources.\n  I believe, as Senator Simpson alluded, that as Americans come to know \nhim as his colleagues do, they will readily embrace this man and his \nmission and his love for America. I loved it when he gave that famous \naddress as he announced that he would retire from the Senate. He said, \nwith no disrespect to the Congress, that his life had not been about \nthe Congress. He said, ``My life has been about America.'' Gratefully, \nit still is. So I join those in wishing him a safe journey and \nGodspeed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask that the time be charged equally. \nSenator Exon will be right along. He is going to speak next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6060-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6061-S6063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may need off \nof our 5 hours. I believe it is the first time charged to us. We are \nnow proceeding as I understand it with debate on the conference report \non the budget.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we are on the final leg of this Republican \nbudget's journey, and it is a fruitless one. It does not lead our \nNation to any new horizons. It blazes no new paths. It offers no \ncompromise to break the budget deadlock. This Republican budget makes a \nbeeline, it pains me to say, to another dead end.\n  Dead ends are becoming an all-too-familiar haunt for my Republican \ncolleagues if they want to move ahead to something that is workable. \nThanks to their intransigence and their extremist budget, that is where \nwe spent most of last year. And it looks as though we will waste \nanother session of Congress trying to back out of yet another dead end.\n  The majority has held the Senate hostage for almost 2 years with \nbasically the same budget. Perhaps they are hoping that the Stockholm \nsyndrome will set in and Democrats will start identifying with their \ncaptors. They are wrong. Our will and our vision are strong.\n  The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee did his best to repair \nthe damage from last year's budget debacle. I compliment him for the \nfine job he did. In the hopes of attracting some unsuspecting buyers, \nthe 1997 Republican budget has been spruced up in places. But if this \nbudget were a house, it would still be condemned as unfit. It is still \nout of touch with mainstream America and I suggest that it should be \nrejected.\n  All of the efforts of the Republican majority to portray their budget \nas a moderate one are in vain. The Republican majority have done a \nsuperb job to airbrush their budget, but the American people can see \nthe real thing--warts and all.\n  It retains the same unflattering profile as its predecessor: \nunnecessary reductions in Medicare and Medicaid\n\n[[Page S6062]]\n\npaying for tax breaks for the wealthy. This is in fact the Newt \nGingrich Budget.\n  The agenda has included a $50-billion-plus rehash of star wars that \nnot even the Pentagon wants. And we have frittered away precious time \nreconsidering the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I have \nconsistently voted for the balanced budget amendment, but could not \ncast my vote for it this time because the Republicans fouled the fiscal \nnest with senseless and in my opinion, irresponsible tax cuts if we are \ngoing to balance the budget fairly.\n  I am baffled by the inconsistency. It is enough to give a prudent man \npause. One moment the Republicans bring back to the floor the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution, the next he resurrects \ndiscredited supply-side economics with tax breaks that could turn into \nthe hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  Mr. President, all of this is a great concern to this Senator who has \nbeen trying to be bipartisan in my approach to the concerns that all of \nus have.\n  I had hoped that we could have used the good will engendered by the \nmajority leader's departure to pass something meaningful for the \nAmerican people. I ask with all sincerity, ``What has happened to the \npriorities that matter most to American families?'' What happened to \nthe minimum wage? What happened to the modest health insurance reform \npackage that passed the Senate 100 to zero? What happened to welfare \nreform? And the big question, we should be asking today, what happened \nto a balanced budget that all Americans could support?\n  One bill after another has been shackled to failed Republican dogma.\n  This rehashed budget is a prime example. It is part and parcel of the \nRepublican strategy of no-work and all-political-play. Like ancient \nGaul, the Republicans divided their budget reconciliation bill into \nthree parts. They wanted to ram through--I emphasize ram through--their \nfailed and stale political agenda and confront the President at every \nturn of this crooked legislative road. Worst of all, two of these baby \nreconciliation bills will be devoted largely to cutting taxes--an act \nthat will worsen the deficit without any sense of being responsible or \nreasonable.\n  We are already seeing the House voodoo work its way in this \nconference report. At least the Senate language required that all the \nentitlement spending reductions be enacted into law before--I emphasize \nbefore--we considered the tax breaks. The House, not surpisingly, \nshamelessly tossed that requirement out the window and the Senate \nconcurred in conference. What a fiscal sham all of this is.\n  The first reconciliation bill contains Medicaid, welfare, and tax \nbreaks. Yes. Mr. President and tax breaks. So much for performing \ndeficit reduction before doling out the tax breaks. So much for fiscal \nconservatism. The first reconciliation bill will reduce the deficit by \njust $2 billion, if it reduces the deficit at all. This is as plain as \nthe light of day. The majority now want to eliminate the Medicaid \nguarantee of meaningful health care benefits for 18 million children, 6 \nmillion disabled Americans, millions of nursing home residents, 36 \nmillion people in all, to fund their tax breaks.\n  The conferees assume a net tax cut of $122 billion, yet Chairman \nKasich maintains that the cuts will be as large as $180 billion. You \ncan look but you will not find a single specific mention of closing tax \nloopholes or of ending corporate tax giveaways. The same budget that \neagerly reduces funding for our Medicare and Medicaid Programs cannot \nfind the courage to call upon the special interests to assume any of \nthe burden of balancing the budget. By contrast, President Clinton has \nproposed that $40 billion be raised from corporate reform and loophole-\nclosers, money that keeps the President's tax cut within reason. This \nSenator would prefer no tax cut at all until we truly balance the \nbudget.\n\n  Experience also shows that once the tax-break game begins, the \nbidding keeps increasing with no thought to the consequences. Chairman \nDomenici says that the Finance Committee can use tax increases to \noffset additional tax breaks, and he is well aware that $35 billion is \nreadily available simply by extending three excise taxes. But that \nwon't be enough to satisfy their tax cut appetite and I predict that, \nlike last year, the Republicans will soon be proposing to raid pension \nfunds for working families to pay for the tax breaks that primarily \nbenefit those earning above $100,000 a year. Fiscal insanity is \ngalloping through this Chamber, and we do not have enough votes, \nunfortunately, to rein it in.\n  One thing that has not changed in the conference report are the deep \nreductions in Medicare and Medicaid. The Republican budget would reduce \nMedicare spending growth per-beneficiary far below projected private-\nsector growth rates. It would diminish quality and access to health \ncare for millions of middle-class Americans. Doctors and hospitals will \nbe able to charge seniors for the entire balance of the charges above \nthe Medicare payment. The Republican majority may assert that premiums \nare not going up, but they cannot make the same claim about seniors' \nout-of-pocket expenses, and that is where, primarily, the seniors are \ngoing to be hit.\n  The $123 billion reduction of Medicare hospital insurance spending \nwill devastate rural and some urban hospitals as well. The Republicans \nassert that it is necessary to preserve the solvency of the trust fund \nthrough 2006. That is bending the truth to fit their agenda. Funny, is \nit not, if that is humor, that the net tax breaks--at $122 billion--are \nalmost exactly equal to the cuts in Medicare part A--at $123 billion?\n  President Clinton's budget proposal extends the life of the trust \nfund without such deep reductions. The Republican-appointed CBO \nDirector has certified that the administration's proposals would extend \nthe life of the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund until 2005.\n  And if the recent alarm over the date of insolvency tells us \nanything, it is not that we should reduce Medicare more to pay for tax \nbreaks for the wealthy. That is truly Medi-Scare. The trustees' report \nis a call for the majority to come back to the bargaining table to work \nwith the President on an acceptable compromise plan that is within \nreach with just a little effort.\n  And what about Medicaid? Instead of attempting to reform Medicaid in \na manner that would be acceptable to mainstream America, the Republican \nmajority put a hard edge to their proposal.\n  I believe you would take a whole nation by surprise if you told them \nthat Republican Medicaid reform might mean that middle-class, working \nAmerican families might have to pay thousands of dollars out of their \nown pockets for nursing home care for a loved one. Or that millions of \nlow-income children might have their health care jeopardized.\n\n  In other words, reform means conform to their way of thinking, even \nif it means taking out a second mortgage on your home to pay for \nnursing home care for a sick or elderly parent. With a $72 billion \nreduction in Medicaid from projected spending, combined with a block \ngrant approach, that may well be the scenario.\n  I would like to conclude my remarks with an observation on this and \nthe previous Republican budgets. I am reminded of an old print I once \nsaw. It showed a man on a horse-drawn sleigh being chased by a pack of \nwolves. With the horses galloping as fast as they can, the driver is \ntossing out everything that is in the sleigh. If he does not lighten \nthe load, the wolves will catch him. A pack of hungry wolves focuses \nthe mind wonderfully on what is truly important. So should this debate \non balancing the budget.\n  The problem with Republican budget after Republican budget is that \nthey will not give up on what is not important. What is important to \nthe American people--and they have said it time after time, is \nbalancing the budget and balancing it fairly. They would far rather \njettison the tax breaks but maintain a first-rate health care system, \nand balance the budget than run the risk of deficits in the years \nahead, eating into the future of their children.\n  But my Republican colleagues cling to the tax breaks--the tax breaks \nthat fuel the reductions in Medicare and Medicaid and divide our great \nNation. That is why they and this budget will ultimately fail. And that \nis not only a tragedy for the departing majority leader but for the \nAmerican people as well.\n\n[[Page S6063]]\n\n  It is sad to have to conclude on this note, but this is clearly a \nfailed budget. Once it passes, as it will, we will be starting over \nagain on what we went through last year--meeting after meeting, crisis \nafter crisis, and not a workable budget that can be supported by the \nPresident, by the minority in both the House and the Senate, and \ncertainly not by the American people.

Mr. President, I rise at this time to speak in concert \nwith so many others who have spoken today about the career of Senator \nBob Dole who today moved on to a new role and new responsibilities and \nleft behind a legacy that is virtually unsurpassed in the history of \nthe Senate. Obviously, the accomplishments that Bob Dole achieved, both \nas a leader in the Senate as well, in his earlier career, as a Member \nof the House of Representatives, have been chronicled pretty thoroughly \nboth by the media as well as by Senator Dole himself today. It is a \nlegislative record that any of us would be, I think, immensely proud to \nhave at the end of our careers here in this institution.\n  So, what I thought I might do instead was to just spend a minute or \ntwo talking about the personal side of Bob Dole, the side that many of \nus here in the Senate know but which is maybe not as well known to the \nAmerican people.\n  I have certainly come to know Bob Dole as a friend. He is somebody \nwho, from the very day that I arrived in the Senate, had a door that \nwas open to me, and I know it was open to others in the freshman class \nthat makes up this 104th Congress. He is a man who did not view himself \nas a senior Member and we as, somehow, junior Members not to be on the \nsame playing field, but somebody who viewed us all as Members of this \ninstitution, as equals, who treated us that way, as he treats \neverybody.\n  He is a man of great compassion, a person who, through his own life's \nexperiences, I think, probably cares about and sympathizes and \nunderstands the problems that his fellow citizens have more than \nvirtually anybody else in national leadership. He is a person who, I \nthink, personifies the words trust and honesty and integrity more than \nanybody I have ever worked with in the political process or in the \nprivate sector. I have never known anybody who has served with Bob Dole \nwho has not said that his word was good, that his word was always one \nthat you could count on. That is clearly a reason why he is held in \nsuch high esteem on both sides of the political aisle.\n\n  These qualities, his capacity to be a good friend, his compassion for \nhis fellow citizens, the honesty, the trust and the integrity that he \nbrought to his service here in the Congress of the United States, make \nhim a giant, in my opinion, a giant who will be remembered far beyond \nthe balcony which today was named after him. But he will be remembered \nalong with the names of Webster and Clay, Johnson, Mansfield, and \nothers who have served and who are remembered as the important \ningredients in the formation of our democracy and its continuation.\n  I would just say this. Although my tenure in the Senate has lasted \nonly a year and a half, I am extraordinarily proud that I had the \nchance for that year and a half to serve with Bob Dole. I happen to be \none of those who believes that his career in public service is not \ncoming to an end today but that in just a few months he will be back in \na different role, working together with us. But I am proud that I had \nthe chance to serve as a fellow Member of the U.S. Senate with him.\n  Some people come to this Chamber and perhaps never are given the \nopportunity to work closely with one of the giants of our Nation's \nhistory and of the Senate's history. I feel very lucky and fortunate to \nhave had that chance, even if it was only for a year and a half.\n  I wish him and his family great good fortune as they move on to a new \nchallenge in this political campaign, and the best of luck and best \nwishes for the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, just for purposes of some kind of \naccounting, how much time has Senator Exon used and how much have I \nused, with all of that which I asked that I yield and asked be credited \nto me even though the speeches were on Senator Dole?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has used 28 \nminutes; the Senator from Nebraska has used 17 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask Senator Exon if he has any other \nSenators coming down this afternoon.\n  Mr. EXON. I advise my friend, I am expecting Senator Kennedy \nmomentarily. I have no certainty beyond Senator Kennedy, but I am \ncertain Senator Kennedy will be here very shortly, and I will yield to \nhim such time as he needs when he comes. Other than that, I know of no \nSenator on this side who will be speaking tonight, but we have had \nsurprises before, as you know.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will just ask again if there are any \nRepublican Senators desiring to speak on this budget resolution or ask \nany questions regarding it. While there will be some time tomorrow--I \nam not at all sure how much time there will be--to speak on the \nresolution. I think we are going to be here--\n  Mr. EXON. I might advise my colleague that Senator Kennedy will be \nusing approximately 30 minutes when he arrives, and I have just been \nadvised Senator Simon, a member of the Budget Committee, wishes 15 \nminutes. So that is about 45 minutes that I know of for Senators at \nthis juncture.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I repeat for Senators on this side, if \nthey would like to speak this evening--I know it is somewhat of an \nimposition since we have already announced there are no votes for the \nremainder of the day--there will be some time this evening and there \nwill be some time tomorrow. Clearly, there will be some Members who \nwould like to be heard.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I did not get to hear all the remarks of \nthe distinguished Senator from Nebraska, but I believe I know generally \nwhat his criticism is, and I would like to address my views and my \nbeliefs with reference to this budget.\n  First, Medicare, the trust fund for the senior citizens' hospital \nprotection--and I do not say this with any joy in my voice--is going \nbroke. I do not know how else to say it. This is not partisanship that \ndetermines that the trust fund is going bankrupt. It is not Republicans \npredicting it, it is not Democrats predicting it, in the sense of \nelected Members of Congress.\n  The trustees who are in charge of telling the American people the \ntruth about the trust fund and making recommendations have, once again, \nreported--I do not say this to frighten anyone; it is just true--we are \nnow spending more money out of the trust fund for senior citizens than \nis coming into the trust fund. In fact, we started doing that last year \nby a small amount. It is growing this year, that is, the amount that is \nspent in excess of what is coming in, and the next year after that it \nis more, and the trustees say in 5 years--in 5 years, not 30, not 20; 5 \nyears--there will not be any money in the trust fund to pay the \nhospital bills for senior citizens.\n  No one has violated the trust fund. Congress has not taken money out \nof the Medicare fund. All of the money in\n\n[[Page S6064]]\n\nthose payroll deductions is going into that trust fund. The problem is \nthat the hospital costs and home health care costs which are in that \ntrust fund are growing more rapidly than the money that comes in.\n  Can you believe that when we try to fix it and save money that \nsomebody says we are doing this because we want to cut taxes? I do not \nknow how else to present it. When the trust fund is going bankrupt and \nyou say, ``Let's save money for the trust fund'', and then you save the \nmoney for the trust fund and the trust fund gets more solvent, and over \non the side you are cutting taxes, how in the world can it be said that \nsaving the trust fund is being done so you can cut taxes?\n  What if you did not cut any taxes? Would the trust fund be any more \nsolvent? What if you said, no tax breaks for families with children--\nwhich we want to do--does that make the trust fund solvent? Not at all. \nIt has none, zero, impact on the trust fund. If the trust fund \ncontinues to spend more than it takes in, it continues bit by bit to go \nbankrupt.\n\n  Everyone knows that, and yet time after time, as we move along and \nsay, ``Let's fix the trust fund and let's fix the insurance program for \nseniors,'' as soon as you say you are doing that, somebody says, \n``You're doing it to cut taxes.''\n  The President is cutting taxes. In fact, he made another announcement \nrecently of another tax cut. Are we running around saying that he is \ndoing that because he is reforming Medicare to try to save it, albeit \nhe is not doing very much? He is doing it more than a few billion \ndollars' worth of savings, of reforms. Can it be said then that the \nPresident is doing that so he can cut taxes? Of course not. They are \nnot even related.\n  That is bad enough, but then we hear it is not changed no matter what \nwe do to this budget. It is the same song and dance: ``You're cutting \ntaxes for the rich.''\n  I want to repeat one more time, and I defy anyone who reads budgets \nto say this is not true, taxes are reduced in the next 6 years by the \nsum total of $122 billion. That means, as best you can calculate, taxes \nwere going to be X billions of dollars over the next 6 years. We have \nsaid, ``Let's assume they will be $122 billion less.'' What more can we \ndo than to say in a budget resolution that $122 billion shall be used \nfor, what? For up to $500 child credit for 46 million American \nfamilies. That is what the $122 billion is for.\n  Is that for the rich of America, or is that because we are worried \nabout families in America? Is that Republicans cutting taxes for the \nrich of America, or is it to say that it is very tough to raise two or \nthree children with the tax deductions you get because they have not \nkept pace with the demands and the needs and the moneys required to \nraise children?\n  If they want to say, ``Republicans are trying to give families with \nchildren a $500 credit for each child,'' we will stand up and say, ``We \nare guilty.'' Right? We will say, ``We are guilty as charged.'' But \nthen to then turn around and say, ``That's not the case, you're helping \nrich Americans''?\n  Mr. President, look at the budget. Read the budget, and that is what \nit says. It says precisely what I have just done, and I ask for \nSenators who will come to the floor and say you are reducing the \nexpenditures and the outlays under Medicare so you can cut taxes, I ask \none question: What if you do not cut any taxes, does the Medicare fund \nget any better? Does it last 10 years instead of going bankrupt in 5? \nOf course not. You have to reduce expenditures within the trust fund or \nincrease taxes that go into the trust fund to give it more longevity \nand a longer life.\n  Having said that, does the President of the United States not propose \nto save Medicare? If he does, must he not think it is going bankrupt? I \nbelieve he uses the same principles we use. But I want to stay on this \nsubject for just a couple more minutes.\n  The President has a very, very strange way of saving Medicare, and \nlet me explain it. Frankly, the President of the United States plays \ngames with Medicare and the taxpayers of America when it comes to \nMedicare for the future. Now let me tell you how.\n  The President says, ``Yes, my trustees,'' four of whom are part of \nhis Cabinet or appointed by him to run Social Security and Medicare, \n``have told us this trust fund is going to be bankrupt in 5 years.''\n  So the President says, ``Let's fix it.'' Now, how does he fix it? If \nthis is not a sham, then I have never seen one. If this is not smoke \nand mirrors, then I have not been around when smoke and mirrors were \nperpetrated as part of a budget. He says, ``Let's just take $55 billion \nof the current expenditures under that trust fund of the current \nobligations, just take them out.'' What does he take out?\n  He says, ``Let's take out the fastest growing item in Medicare, take \nit out of the trust fund, and not pay for it out of the trust fund \nanymore. Magic. What is the fastest one? Home health care. Home health \ncare has been part of the trust fund for a long, long time. So seniors \nexpect their home health care bills and their hospital bills to be paid \nfor out of that trust fund. Sort of like magic. What is the word? \nAbracadabra. I am making it $55 billion more solvent because it does \nnot have to pay those obligations anymore. I just take them out of \nthere and let somebody else pay for them.\n  Who is the somebody else? The President says the taxpayer will pay \nfor it. They do not even know it. They are about to be given a big gift \nby the President. The gift is, you taxpayers pay $55 billion for the \nhome health part of Medicare, which I just relieved the Medicare trust \nfund of, so that I can say it is getting solvent.\n  What is happening to America? It may be getting solvent, but America \nis getting whacked for $55 billion in taxes that a couple sitting \naround at their table one morning, wondering about how much taxes they \nare paying and will it ever stop, they just got a new present. The \npresent is another tax burden, because the President wants to claim he \nis fixing Medicare by letting that couple, who are paying income taxes \non their hard earned money, let them pay.\n  Is that the right way to fix Medicare? I ask in all honesty, if you \nbrought before the U.S. Senate a proposal, freestanding, just put one \nup here one of these days, and resolve that henceforth $55 billion over \nthe next 6 years of Medicare expenditures will be paid for by the \ngeneral tax coffers of America, and then vote. I surmise there may be \n10 Senators that vote for it, but we have never voted to put general \ntax money in Medicare part A or in Social Security, because we \nunderstand those are trust funds that should be paid for by the \nrevenues dedicated to those entrusted funds, not by the general \ntaxpayer. But this is being done in this bill, and at the same time the \nPresident and my good friend from Nebraska can run away and say it is \nthe Republicans who are restraining and cutting back on Medicare, not \nthe President.\n  What do we do? We say how much money is necessary to make it solvent \nin the next decade, and keep it solvent for 10 years. We are told how. \nWe have said, ``Let's reform the system, give seniors options to have \ntheir coverage in different ways,'' but always they can keep what they \nhave, the same system they have, and let us ratchet back on how \nproviders are paid and hospitals are paid and save enough money to make \nit solvent. We have not increased 1 cent of cost to the senior \ncitizens, yet we are making it solvent for 10 years.\n  Frankly, when we say we are doing that and Democrats and the \nPresident say you do not have to do that, we have done it another way. \nI just told you the other way. This is a very short-term fix. Medicare \nwill be growing at an annual rate of 6.2 percent--not cut. The per \ncapita expenditure for seniors will not go down. It will go from about \n$5,200 to $7,000, an $1,800 increase over that 6-year period. All of \nthat in the name of doing what is right, for which we are accused of \nharming seniors, of doing this so we can cut taxes, when it will be \ninsolvent whether you cut taxes or whether you do not cut taxes.\n  Let me move for a minute quickly to how we treat two big other items \nin the budget. The President of the United States produced another very \ninteresting phenomenon in his budget, 1997, which will be appropriated \nbefore October of this year, an election year. The President of the \nUnited States says for all of the discretionary accounts, the non-\nSocial Security, the non-Medicare, the nondefense domestic accounts, \nthe President says, ``I think I want to balance the budget, but I think \nfor 1997 I\n\n[[Page S6065]]\n\nbetter increase spending.'' So he increases it $15 billion. The \ndiscretionary accounts are increased $15 billion. But, Mr. President, \nonly for 1997. After all, we have to balance this budget.\n\n  Then read the Broder article on Sunday where Senator Bond is making \nthe case that after you get the $15 billion increase, and then you \nstill say you are going to balance by the year 2002, you let the \ndiscretionary spending just fall off the log, $72 billion in cuts in \nthe last year in discretionary accounts, but not in the year of the \nbudget, not in the year of the election. Then you get Cabinet Members \ntelling the public of the United States that the President is not \nserious about that. After all, he is not going to cut veterans that \nmuch, even though if you look at where that leads you, veterans get \nscalped.\n  But they are saying, ``We will take it 1 year at a time.'' How, 1 \nyear at a time, when the dollar numbers keep going down, how are you \ngoing to fit them all in with an increase? Something will get cut. They \nwould like to let the American people think it is only Republicans that \nhave to make these cuts.\n  What do we propose? We propose a freeze, fellow Americans. In a year \nwe are really trying to get a budget, if we cannot live with a freeze \nin domestic spending, we will never get the budget balanced. So we are \nnot cutting this year. The conference report that comes back has a \nfreeze in budget authority. Program authority for all domestic bills \nfreeze at exactly the level we are now spending for all of these \nprograms. I believe that is a fair approach in a difficult year. I hope \nwe produce these appropriations bills at a freeze level, one after \nanother. I hope there will be no strings attached and no riders, and we \nwill see whether the President wants to close down Government based \nupon a freeze, especially if he has to say we want $15 billion more to \nkeep it open. We will not mind that battle this time. We will not mind \nthat battle this time.\n  Which do you really want? Are you serious about a balanced budget? We \nwill give you a freeze. No harm, no gain. Or do you want to spend $15 \nbillion more? Those are the basic elements. I have given the tax \nproposals. I have given Medicare. Medicaid will grow at 6.2 percent a \nyear on average, not be cut, but more power is going home to our \nGovernors and to our legislators to see if we cannot streamline and \nmake the programs more efficient.\n  From my standpoint, I do not think it matters what we change in this \nbudget and how it is different from last year or the year before. We \nwill hear the same broken-down medley, ``hurting senior citizens, \nhelping the rich with tax cuts, hurting the poor with Medicare cuts,'' \nwhen, as a matter of fact, what we are really trying to do is help \nseniors, keep the fund from going bankrupt, and do little or no harm to \nthem. We have the exact same dollar amount of savings for the insurance \nprogram for senior citizens as the President. He found he needed $44 \nbillion. We got the same amount.\n  When you are all finished, clearly, there is a lot of politics \nsurrounding all of this. I wish it was not the case. Sooner or later we \nhave to fix Medicare, fix Medicaid. We have to save money on both \nprograms. We have to reduce taxes on working families in the United \nStates significantly, sooner or later. We think this is the right year \nto do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, under the leadership of a Congress \ncommitted to fundamental reform of the Federal Government, we have once \nagain delivered a balanced budget to the American people. I have no \ndoubt that this budget is a blueprint that will protect the future of \nevery American child.\n  Last year, Mr. President, the debate on the budget was mainly focused \non whether we should have a balanced budget by 2002. Today, all sides, \nincluding President Clinton, have agreed that we should and can balance \nour budget by 2002, while we provide tax relief to middle-class \nAmerican families. The remaining question is how.\n  In my view, our budget priorities should reflect traditional American \nvalues: a smaller government, less spending and more savings, and \nhelping those who want to help themselves. Mr. President, I must say \nthat this budget resolution moves us confidently in that direction. The \nbudget resolution will balance our budget in 6 years, yielding a $5 \nbillion surplus in 2002. It will also create more jobs, provide more \naffordable education, make Medicare more secure, and offer real welfare \nand Medicaid reform.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly pleased that this resolution has \nkept our promise to the American people to provide meaningful tax \nrelief for middle-class Americans. The resolution explicitly recommends \nthat this should include a tax credit of $500 per child. I am proud \nthat this provision, which I have made a priority since my election to \nCongress, remains at the heart of our efforts to balance the budget \nwhile reducing the tax burden on working families.\n  The tax burden has become increasingly unbearable for middle-class \nAmericans. This year, the average American worked from January 1 until \nMay 7 to pay his or her tax bill. Only after paying the Government more \nthan one-third of their earnings can the taxpayers then spend to meet \ntheir own needs. If we do not impose discipline in our budget, children \nborn today would have to pay as high as 84 percent of their lifetime \nearnings for our Government spending and national debt. This is simply \noutrageous. We must provide tax relief for middle-class families to \nreduce their financial burden, and encourage saving and investment.\n  It is my belief, Mr. President, that the $500-per-child tax credit is \nessential. Cutting taxes creates more real spending power for \nAmericans. It would allow more than 201,000 families in my home State \nof Minnesota with 437,000 children to save or spend more of their own \nmoney--money that should not have been taken from them in the first \nplace. The $500 per-child tax credit would return $297 million to the \ntaxpayers of Minnesota, $45 million to the taxpayers of South Dakota, \n$39 million to the taxpayers of North Dakota, $329 million to the \ntaxpayers of Wisconsin, and $180 million to the taxpayers of Iowa.\n  Mr. President, we not only need to eliminate wasteful and unnecessary \nspending, but we also must reform and control our entitlement programs. \nWithout responsible reforms, entitlement spending will consume all \nFederal spending in 2015, leaving nothing for education, environment, \ndefense, and other domestic discretionary programs.\n  I am therefore pleased, Mr. President, that this budget resolution \nhas included my amendment on long-term trends in budget estimates. In \nthe past, budget estimates were projected for only 5 years. My \namendment requires both CBO and OMB to provide a 30-year projection of \nthe budget impact on entitlements. This is good policy and will help \nCongress and the American taxpayer understand the long-term commitments \nwere are imposing on future generations. My amendment also requires the \nPresident to include long-term economic projections in his budget. \nEntitlement programs can then be reviewed and analyzed for their \neconomic impact today and for generations to come.\n  Mr. President, although I personally would prefer more cuts in \nFederal spending and more tax relief for working American families, \nthis budget resolution is a well-balanced one. While it reduces Federal \nspending by $580 billion over 6 years, it has kept vital programs such \nas law enforcement and crime prevention, education, veterans' benefits, \nR, and environmental protection as national priorities. In my view, \nthis budget resolution is a credible, workable and no-gimmicks plan for \ngetting our fiscal house in order.\n  If we want to rebuild the financial integrity of this Nation, avert \nthe Nation from fiscal disaster, and leave our children a viable \ngovernment, we must pass this balanced budget to control government \nspending and reduce the burden for our children.\n  Mr. President, I believe strongly that it is the responsibility and \nduty of this Congress to ensure our children and grandchildren a strong \neconomy, a good education, a clean environment, and a debt-free future. \nLet us fulfill that responsibility and pass the balanced budget \nresolution conference report.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Exon, can we accommodate a couple speakers on \nSenator Dole statements?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would like 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page S6066]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the health \ninsurance reform legislation. So I am happy to wait my turn.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have an arrangement that the Senator from \nMassachusetts will go next. It is your turn.\n  Mr. EXON. With the understanding, I might say, that the Senator from \nMassachusetts has been very patient. I scheduled him at 4:30, the best \nI could.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is fine.\n  Mr. EXON. We understand that you will have 7 minutes for other \nmatters, and then we will yield to the Senator from Massachusetts, is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is exactly what I hope and agree to.\n  Mr. EXON. We agree with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized \nfor 5 minutes; following that, the Senator from Kentucky will be \nrecognized for 2 minutes; then the Senator from Massachusetts will be \nrecognized for such time as the Senator from Nebraska may yield him.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6063-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO BOB DOLE\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to our friend, Bob \nDole. It has been my pleasure over the years to hold over 30 joint \nmeetings with him in my State, in my time as a Congressman and as a \nSenator and when he was running for South Dakota's early primary. There \nwere at least 30 meetings. I learned a great deal from Bob's service, \nand I learned that his tireless energy was always an inspiration to me. \nIn fact, he would always shake hands with everybody at the end of those \nmeetings, regardless of how long it took. But he offered a great deal \nof substance when somebody asked him a complicated question. He would \ngive the full Senate answer, so to speak. I believe that he will go \ndown as one of the great Members of this Chamber, in terms of \nlegislative accomplishments and contributions.\n\n  I was one of the first Senators to commit to him for majority leader \nor minority leader--whichever was the case, because at the time we did \nnot know for sure. I was one of the first Senators to endorse him for \nPresident. I think his career in the Senate represents the best of \nSenate life. I guess everybody knows about his wit and his \ndetermination. I could never believe or comprehend how he had so much \nenergy. He literally went 7 days a week. He would be as energetic on \nSunday night when he was coming back to Washington.\n  I also visited at least 15 States with him during the time he was a \nPresidential candidate or chairman of the party or when I was a \nCongressman, and he did the same thing there, too. He was not a golfer \nor a tennis player. He just worked all the time. I have never seen \nanything like it. He would fill up the whole weekend with work and \nvisits. To him, it was service. I just would not have that much energy \nbecause I need a day off now and then. I pay tribute to him because he \nis one of the great Members of this Chamber that I have served with, \nand it has been my pleasure to work side by side with him.\n  I have a number of other reminiscences, which I will place in the \nRecord. During this short time, let me also say that I have felt a \ngreat deal of friendship and still feel a great deal of friendship with \nBob Dole. He is a person with whom I could always talk to if I was \nstruggling in some of my campaigns, or whatever. He would always be \nthere to help. Just recently, he invited me along on four stops in \nseveral States with him. His energy is as great as it has ever been.\n  Bob Dole is a great man. He will be a great President, and I will \nmiss him very much here in the Senate. It feels lonely around here \nwithout him already, without his quips, and so forth. I came in a \nlittle late at lunch today and he said, ``You are late, Pressler. We \nare going to count you late.'' He was full of quips all the time. I pay \ntribute to my friend, Bob Dole, a great U.S. Senator, who will be a \ngreat President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we witnessed today the departure from \nthe Senate of one of the giants of American history. On a day like \nthis, obviously, all of your memories come back to you. I remember the \nfirst time I met Bob Dole. It was in this room in the early part of \n1969. I was a fuzzy-cheeked staffer back here on what was then these \nbig stuffed couches. Bob Dole was a freshman Senator. Since desks on \nthe floor of the Senate were assigned on the basis of seniority, he sat \nnear the back. I remember him as being the most popular of the freshman \nRepublicans with the staff. Why? Because he was nice to us. This is a \nplace where, as many know, some Senators are a little full of \nthemselves and frequently are not all that nice to staff. Bob Dole was \nnot only nice to us, his humor was often practiced on us before he \nrelated some of it on the floor.\n  In short, you could sense from the beginning, from the day Bob Dole \nwalked in here, that he was something special, that he was not going to \nbe just your average Senator. So like everybody else, I watched his \ndevelopment over the years. I left as a staffer and went back home to \ndo my own thing. My next recollection of Bob Dole was in 1980, his \nfirst campaign for President, which was not conspicuously successful. I \nremember picking him up one day in Kentucky and taking him to a meeting \nand watching him tirelessly work the crowd. He had to have a sense that \nhis campaign was failing. But as Woody Allen said, ``Eighty percent of \nlife is showing up.'' Bob Dole was driven. He always showed up. He \ncontinued to push.\n  The next time I saw him was in 1984, 3 days before the Senate race in \nKentucky. All of a sudden, the word had spread around that this \nchallenger in the Senate race in Kentucky might have a shot. Bob and \nElizabeth Dole came in, and we wheeled around the State in their plane, \nand they gave me the boost I needed at the end to get over the finish \nline.\n  In short, like everybody else here, I have had a number of \nreminiscences of this great American. On a day like this, they all come \nback. It seems like there is a giant sort of gap here in the Senate \nwith his departure. Today was a bittersweet day for all of us. I think \nit is kind of a mixture of exhilaration for him that he goes out on \nthis new challenge, undeterred by all of the restraints that are \nobvious here, but at the same time he regretted his departure. I only \nadd: Godspeed, Bob Dole. I think we will be seeing you in Government \nonce again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts whatever time he \nneeds off of our 5 hours.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator from Nebraska. I see the Senator \nfrom Kansas on the floor, who was here earlier than I was. She has \nindicated that she has just a short comment to make. I am glad, if it \nis agreeable with the Senator from Nebraska, to yield to her to speak \nbriefly.\n  Mr. EXON. I will yield whatever time she needs from our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6066-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6066-S6069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I very much appreciate the Senator from Massachusetts \ngiving me some time at this moment. I would have been happy to wait. \nBut both the Senator from Massachusetts and myself have worked for many \nmonths on health insurance reform. I very much appreciated Senator \nKennedy, the ranking member of the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee--his efforts to help us achieve what the Senate voted on 100 \nto 0 for some very important health insurance reform measures.\n  Today, I want to speak for a moment about where we stand on this \nissue. First, because I heard the chairman of the Budget Committee \nspeak on the budget resolution before us, I want to speak with respect \nto the admiration I have for Senator Domenici and his honesty and \nvision regarding what is needed in our budget. Both he and Senator Exon \nfrom Nebraska, who is the ranking member, have worked many years on \nbudget matters, and I am sure that at some point there must be a \ncertain weariness that sets in as yet one more budget resolution comes \nbefore the\n\n[[Page S6067]]\n\nSenate. But it takes dedication, which I greatly admire, on the part of \nthe Senator from New Mexico through the years to speak to what he \nfeels. I strongly support the vision that he has and that is required \nof us today.\n  Speaking to health insurance reform, which both Senator Kennedy and \nmyself feel is very important, negotiations are still going on. The \nagreement that was reached last night on this measure represents a \nconsensus among Republican members, who have been meeting informally \nfor some weeks. Both myself and Senator Kennedy have been in conference \nand negotiations ourselves to see if this issue cannot be advanced.\n  As a participant in the process of informal negotiations among \nRepublicans Members, I would say much was given up by Members who feel \nvery strongly about particular provisions. For example, Members of the \nHouse of Representatives agreed to drop provisions on medical \nmalpractice reform, which many Members there strongly supported and \nwhich was in the House-passed measure, and the multiple employer \nwelfare arrangement, MEWA's, which would have most certainly led to a \nPresidential veto.\n  Likewise, as I am sure, all realize more was added--particularly with \nrespect to medical savings accounts--that others would like to see. I \ncount myself among those who would have preferred a more focused bill. \nWe added here in the Senate parity for mental illness insurance, which \nmany here strongly support, and many in the House support. But to come \nto some agreement for those who question whether we can do that at this \ntime, or not, meant that provision was dropped as well.\n  However, I have been around here long enough to know that no one gets \neverything they prefer. I listened very carefully to my colleagues in \nthe House, and it is my assessment that the proposal now on the table \nis what it will take to bring our efforts to fruition. There may have \nto be--and I guess there would be--some more minor adjustments. I want \nto speak particularly to the medical saving accounts provision because \nthat is what has been perhaps the hardest and biggest hurdle to get \nover, and to what I believe represents a fair and credible approach to \nthis issue. Briefly, beginning in January of next year, the medical \nsavings accounts will be available to the self-employed and to \nemployees of businesses with 50 or fewer employees.\n  A study regarding the effect in the small group market on adverse \ncollections, health cost, use of preventive care, and consumer cost \nwould be conducted over a 2-year period.\n  Mr. President, I believe that starting with the small group market \nwhere many of the most important issues with respect to MSA's have been \nraised will provide Congress with the most accurate assessment of their \nadvantages or disadvantages on how perhaps MSA plans should be drawn \nthat would be the best devised plan possible for medical savings \naccounts. This is the group where concerns have been raised about the \npossibility of adverse collections and where States have developed the \ngreatest expertise in providing insurance access to small businesses. \nThe proposal goes on to extend MSA's to individuals and employers with \n50 or more employees on January 1 in the year 2000. Unless the Congress \nacts to delay or repeal the expansion, separate votes would be \nguaranteed on both the individual and large employer expansion.\n  In addition, the proposal includes new means for consumer protection \nstandards as a condition of deductibility. These provisions assure that \nthe consumers will have sufficient information to judge this new \nproduct, and they can take into account a recent Rand study showing \nthat adverse collections can be minimized by limiting the level of MSA \ndeductibles.\n  First, MSA plans would be required to disclose the information about \ncost-sharing requirements, deductibles, and limitations on coverage, if \nany, under the plan.\n  Second, MSA plans could have a maximum deductible of $5,000 for \nindividuals, or $7,500 for family coverage, indexed for medical \ninflation. That is a high deductible, but it would, we thought, be \nbetter than a floor being placed and that a ceiling should be placed.\n  Third, once deductible limits are reached, individuals would be \nrequired to pay on average no more than 30 percent cost sharing for \ntheir health benefits.\n  In addition, six adjustments to the structure of the House MSA \nprovisions were made in response to recommendations by the \nadministration. These modifications could tighten tax rules regarding \nany possible abuse.\n  Finally, it should not be forgotten that there are core elements of \nthe health insurance bill. Those dealing with portability and \npreexisting conditions are firmly in place. Those are provisions which \nwe all agreed on were very important, Mr. President. They are the ones \nSenator Kennedy cared about and that I cared about. We argued no \namendment should be added in order to achieve those core provisions. \nBut then that is not the way the House and Senate worked their will. \nAmendments were added in both Houses.\n  In addition, of course, the agreement includes Senate provisions \ndealing with deductibility and long-term care insurance, which will \nmake health insurance not only more portable but also more affordable \nfor millions of Americans.\n  These are important changes, and I am confident that further \nreflection on this proposal will produce a public law, I am absolutely \nconfident, that we can come to an agreement on both sides of the aisle \non with the administration to achieve health insurance reform which \nwill benefit millions of Americans. I recognize that compromise is \nalways difficult. It was a difficult process in committee and on the \nSenate floor. As an even broader range of issues were put on the table \nby the House, it became even more of a challenge to find common \nground among disparate views. Nevertheless, I think that each of us \nrecognize the need to compromise, and I believe this proposal will \nstrike a fair and equitable balance which will put meaningful health \ncare reform within our grasp.\n\n  Mr. President, I have had concerns about the medical savings \naccounts. I think we need to go slow and understand them--understand \nwhere there may be difficulties and how to achieve them in a way that \nwill benefit many Americans, particularly those who have not had any \nother access to health insurance. But, by doing it slowly and phasing \nit in and studying it carefully, I think it can and should be achieved.\n  So I hope that as we continue negotiations, we can actually, over \ntime, achieve some agreements on the proposals in health insurance \nreform that will allow us to succeed in efforts that we know will \nbenefit many, many.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, may I have a little dialog with Senator \nKassebaum regarding that bill?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Please do.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not choose tonight to go into an indepth analysis \nof the bill as it pertains to the severely mentally ill or those who \nneed mental health care in America. I do want to suggest as one of the \nprime sponsors of amendment, which will be dropped, that I believe we \nshould not have a commission in this bill--a commission getting bigger \nand bigger and broader and broader and more and more issues. Frankly, I \nthink we would rather have an opportunity to address this issue one \nmore time in another manner. I do not think a commission is going to \nsolve many of the issues that we think need to be solved, at least in \nany of the iterations we have seen on the commission. I would ask that \nit not be included. I mean, I think it is no compromise for us, and we \njust should not have it, and let us get on with this fight in another \nway.\n  So I personally will ask them not to put it in. I will return to my \noffice and advise the House lead conferees that I personally would like \nnot to have the commission in it.\n  I see my cosponsor on the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Might I indulge the Senator for a moment on a comment \non this?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Sure.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have a different perspective. I also feel it is not \nmuch of a compromise. I just wanted to say, having been a cosponsor of \nthis amendment with my colleague from New Mexico, that when the medical \nsavings accounts--I am all for working out an\n\n[[Page S6068]]\n\nagreement--came to the floor of the Senate, that amendment was \ndefeated. Then we talked about compromises. I know the Senator from \nMassachusetts will talk about that. The mental health amendment, I \nthink, passed with 68 votes. Then we worked very hard to pare this \ndown. What we came up with was a very reasonable formulation, if you \nwant to talk about a compromise, which dealt with lifetime annuals; \njust have the same cap parity with that, which would have been so \nimportant to families to get under.\n  I urge my colleagues, as we get into negotiations, I would like for \nthat to continue to be in the mix. It was a very reasonable \nformulation. The Congressional Budget Office projection was like two-\ntenths of 1 percent increase. To me it is just unconscionable that this \ncannot be accepted. I mean it passed by 68 votes. I do not believe that \nthis should now be knocked out of the mix.\n  I have urged my colleagues on the Democratic side to please hang in \nthere on this. The White House supports this. The Democrats support \nthis. I know many Republicans do. I do not know anyone who has worked \nharder on this than Senator Domenici.\n  I urge my colleague from Kansas, whom I believe in, and certainly my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, please, as we go forward with these \nnegotiations, do not just simply cancel us out. By the way, the ``us'' \nis not Senator Domenici and myself. The ``us'' are citizens all across \nthis country who thought finally that they were going to see a time \ncome when the U.S. Congress would put an end to some of this \ndiscrimination and do something very good and very positive and very \nhelpful for families all across the country.\n  Do not shut us out.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, if I may say so, I know that there is \nno one who cares more about this than Senator Kennedy, as well, and \nSenator Domenici and Senator Wellstone went a long way in proposing \nsomething which many of us hoped would work and be successful in \ncompromise. At this point, it has not been. But it has been probably \nthe question of how much further we can get in negotiations.\n  I very much appreciate the Senator from Massachusetts giving some \ntime to discuss the health insurance reform effort, and I appreciate \nall that he is doing and continues to do to try to help achieve a \nsuccessful resolution.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for her \ncomments. I appreciate her addressing the Senate on this particular \nmeasure about the state of negotiations. Initially, I have to respond \nto my good friend from New Mexico as well as Senator Wellstone. It is \nnot my purview about whether this matter will be in or outside the \ncompromise. It appears that whatever has been recommended by the \nRepublican leadership has at this time included a study in the \nproposal. I myself, as Senator Wellstone has pointed out, strongly \nbelieve that what would have been a reasonable compromise of perhaps \nextending mental health to Federal employees would have had included a \ncomprehensive program of up to another 10 million without affecting \nbusinesses' bottom lines. But that was not to be considered.\n  Then I supported strongly the position that has been outlined here in \nterms of the yearly inclusion and the yearly caps of the longer \nlifetime caps for the funding of mental health programs. But that has \nbeen dismissed. I think the bottom line is just to dismiss those \nproposals or to have a study.\n  I come down on the side of the Senator from New Mexico because I \nfear, if we do a study, that may very well be utilized as a way to \ncompromise further progress in addressing mental health down the road \non some future health care proposal.\n  I for one hope very much that, if we are able to get this particular \nproposal, the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, forward, the health issue will go \nback on the agenda. Mental health being as important as it is, we may \nvery well have a real opportunity to move ahead on that in another \nCongress.\n  Not that I would find it persuasive personally, but maybe there would \nbe others who would: not to debate this issue since we are doing this \ncomprehensive study over a period of years, and therefore let us wait \nuntil the study results are known.\n  But I hear the Senators. They have spoken well on this issue, and we \nwill, to the extent we can, pass on their observations and their strong \nviews to the conferees.\n  Just very briefly, I thank my friend, Senator Kassebaum, for her \nexplanation as to what was basically included in a proposal that has \nnow gathered the support of the Republican leadership in the House and \nthe Senate. As I have said many times, I admire her continued \nleadership in moving this whole debate so far forward that there still \nis, I would hope, real opportunity of enacting the core legislation. We \nhave some difference on the proposal which has been outlined. But there \nstill is a very strong desire, I believe, on everyone's part, as there \nshould be, to try to achieve the desired outcome of legislation.\n  The concept of the legislation Senator Kassebaum has outlined on \nother occasions, which goes back to the end of the 1994 congressional \ndebates on health care reform, pulled together the various proposals \nthat were advanced, Republican and Democrat, and included many of \nSenator Dole's proposals. It was spoken of as an issue of importance by \nSenator Dole at that time, and he has reiterated those comments in a \nnumber of statements in recent days.\n  So this really was a very important proposal, a modest step but a \nvery important one, a vital one to the 25 to 27 million Americans who \nhave preexisting conditions and other millions of Americans who would \nbe able to take advantage of the portability provisions.\n  So I stand with the Senator from Kansas in hoping we will be able to \nwork the will of the Senate and be able to achieve those objectives. \nThe principal concern that I had in the proposal as outlined here this \nevening, and that has been reported previously, is that, first of all, \nwe would be including not just a test, we would be immediately \nincluding about a third of the work force in an untried and untested \nprogram, which would inevitably include the entire work force in just \nthree short years unless the Congress acts to prevent it.\n  So the signal very clearly is, let us move forward with a national \nprogram that would include the MSA concept. What many of us have \nbelieved is that this idea is untested and untried, and sufficient \nquestions have been raised about it. For example, the Urban Institute, \nwhich the Senator refers to, has pointed out that, at a $1,500 \ndeduction, evidence of adverse selection is not quite evident. But once \nyou move to $2,500, adverse selection becomes a major factor and a \nmajor force. In this proposal, we are talking about a $5,000 deductible \nas a possibility.\n  So the underlying concept that all of us have had in urging the \nKassebaum-Kennedy proposal has been, when it comes to MSA's: Let us do \nno harm. Let us do no harm to the existing health insurance system. Let \nus do no harm.\n  Now as to the issue on malpractice. It is an issue we have debated \nand discussed on many different occasions and will again. It was not \nsomething that was so special, so unique to this occasion that an \nindependent bill could not come over here on that measure. It was \nbefore the Congress earlier in the session and it was set aside for, I \nthink, very, very sound reasons, which we will be glad to debate at \nanother time.\n  The issue of MEWA's was not really a new idea. That has been around \nfor a number of years. The problem with the MEWA's in the early 1980's \nis that they were so involved in fraud that by 1982 it was the judgment \nof both the Federal and the State governments that State enforcement \nagainst fraud and abuse should be put into effect. That was under a \nRepublican Congress, and that was put into effect.\n  Now, without really any review, without any kind of hearings, without \nany kind of examination, we want to take the State enforcement away. \nThat is a very important policy issue to debate, but that is certainly \nsomething\n\n[[Page S6069]]\n\nthat we could do tomorrow or do the next day. There ought to be \nhearings. We ought to find out about the role of the State and the \nFederal Government in terms of the enforcement.\n\n  The fact is, enforcement by the States on MEWA's has worked well. It \nhas reduced significantly the instances of fraud and abuse. I would be \nquite interested in listening to those on the floor of the Senate try \nto persuade the Senate why that is a good idea, to go back to a time \nwhen States were not providing oversight and regulations to protect \nworking families.\n  So we saw those two elements dropped. I think, as I say, I would have \nhoped they could have been dropped and we could have debated them at \nanother time. They were dropped. But I find it very difficult to be \nconvinced that these were major elements of a major proposal that were \ngiven up in order to try to reach common ground with the Senate--when \nthe Senator from Kansas understands very well that what she has \nfashioned and what has been supported here was really a unique, \nspecial, targeted effort to deal with the preexisting conditions and \nportability, which is really a new way of trying to come to grips with \nthe health care needs of many of our citizens.\n  At the same time, as was pointed out, another area where I think \nthere is broad agreement in terms of considering in parallel mental \nillness as well as other physical illness was completely set aside. \nThat would have been new ground that was being broken. But that, for \nthe financial cost, was really too much. I regret it. I am personally \nconvinced, as we have seen with many insurance companies, that those \ncompanies that have effective mental health as well as physical health \nprograms actually see a reduction in the outlays for the physical \nconditions because of the programs that they have there that are \navailable in mental health. Actually, it is going to save money over a \nperiod of time.\n  We have not been able to make that case in a convincing way, although \nI am, frankly, convinced. I know Senator Wellstone is convinced as \nwell. But we have the basis of a very strong indication from a number \nof the insurance companies. But we are too late in the session to have \nbeen able really to consider that. I regret it.\n  So I thought it made a good deal of sense that we have some kind of \ntest of the MSA's, and we had advanced three different proposals. The \nWhite House had advanced proposals. Those were effectively dismissed. \nThen there were proposals that were discussed last week by Republican \nleadership and then further refined over the course of the weekend.\n  So there is where we are. One of the features I mentioned to the \nSenator from Kansas is that the evaluation for all these programs is \ngoing to be as a result of the chairman of the Finance Committee and \nthe chairman of the Ways and Means Committee naming the committee that \nis going to do the evaluation. I think that was sort of a nonstarter, \nbut there may be Members who would differ with that. If we are going to \nget the kind of clear evaluation which is needed, and which has been \noutlined, in fairness, by the Senator from Kansas, the types of things \nthat should be considered are a review by an independent body to give \nreports. That would be very, very important.\n  Another item in the proposal is, with the acceptance of the \ndeductibility for small business only going up to 80 percent, here you \nhave 100 percent in MSA's, so you have a skewed condition just to get \nstarted with any kind of comparison. We phase in the 80 percent up to \nthe year 2000. They would go into an MSA immediately in terms of 100 \npercent. So you are obviously skewing this in terms of what is included \nin the other parts of the legislation.\n  These are the kinds of things which I think people who would have a \nchance to review these issues and get into matters could address. But \nthe most basic and fundamental part of it is putting in place an \nuntested and untried program in which many of those groups that have \nlooked at it, in all fairness, have felt it would be particularly \nthreatening. To whom? To our seniors, to working families, to children \nfor prevention, and consumers generally.\n  Those who are supporting it primarily have been those--I know there \nare individual Members, and I respect their views--but, frankly, the \noutside interests that have been talked about have been the particular \ncompanies who have been involved in these programs that have been \ninvolved in some of the greatest abuses of the health care system.\n  So I think when you have the Joint Tax Committee talking about the \ncost, if we get to 1 million people, it will cost $3 billion over a 10-\nyear period. Here we are talking, at the outside, 40 million people. It \nraises some questions about what the cost would be. When you have the \nUrban Institute talking about what would happen in terms of adverse \nselection and moving from $1,500 to $2,500 in deductibility--this goes \nall the way to $5,000--I think you can say there is certainly some \nreasonable kind of questions about who would become involved in this \nprogram, whether it would be, as many of us believe, the wealthiest and \nhealthiest individuals.\n  When you have the refusal of the insurance companies that are \ninvolved in this process making available to the Academy of Actuaries \nthe kinds of numbers--not the proprietary information --but just the \nnumbers in terms of markets and getting some kind of fair evaluation of \nwhat is happening in the industry and not only the particular golden \ndoor industry, but others involved in it, being turned down on that \nissue raises questions. There have been CBO studies, as well. I \nreferred to those at other times, and I will not take the time to do so \nnow.\n  So, Mr. President, this issue is not going to go away. We will have \nit, and we will be required to address it. I am personally convinced \nthat we will be successful in passing the core legislation in this \nCongress, because it is not going to go away. It is too powerful. There \nare too many families that will be affected by it. We may have some \nrocky roads and bumps along the way until we get there, but I think \nthis issue is too important for families to give way on it.\n  I know I and others and I know Senator Kassebaum is still strongly \ncommitted to achieving the objectives. We will just have to work this \nprocess through.\n  But I thank the Senator very much, and I look forward to continuing \nto work very closely with her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6066-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6069-S6072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know there are others who want to \naddress the Senate. I want to speak to the Senate on two issues, \nbriefly: the first being where we are on the budget proposal for \neducation.\n  There have been a number of representations about where we are going \nwith current funding, how we are going along with the continued \nbaseline expenditures, that we are going to see a continuing commitment \nin the area of education.\n  I want to review for the Senate very briefly, because I see other \ncolleagues on the floor who wish to address the Senate, where we are in \nthe area of education funding and why this budget proposal continues to \nrun contrary to what I believe is the fundamental commitment of this \nNation, which should be in the area of education.\n  We can start off with the fact that just spending resources and money \ndoes not solve all of our Nation's problems, but it is a pretty clear \nindication what a nation's priorities are all about. I believe in \neducation and I believe that it is important that we continue to make a \nstrong investment in the area of education and the young people of this \ncountry. If the programs are faulty, we should correct them; if \nprograms are successful, we ought to expand them. We ought to be in a \nperiod of constant review of many of these programs.\n  We did have the opportunity in the previous Congress to review a \nnumber of the programs--whether it was in the Head Start Program, title \nI, or Goals 2000--to provide reforms and funding to the local school \nlevel--90 percent of the funding went to the local school level that \ncould be used by parents, teachers, the business community to expand \neducation and academic achievement--the School-to-Work Program which \nwas as a result of America's Choice, an excellent report reviewing many \nof the programs that were taking place in other parts of the world. \nThree-fourths\n\n[[Page S6070]]\n\nof the children who go to high school do not continue on to college. \nThat is an extremely important area for this Nation if we want to both \nprovide the opportunities for the young children of this country and \nalso to ensure that our country is going to be strong in the next \ncentury.\n  And then the Direct Loan Program, the simplification of the efforts \nfor young people. I see my friend and colleague, Senator Simon, who was \nsuch a leader of that program over a period of years.\n  So we have here, Mr. President, the 1997 education funding in the \nRepublican budget compared to a true freeze. This represents a \ncompilation of all the discretionary education programs, those programs \nK through 12, and those programs that go on to higher education.\n\n  If we go back to 1995, we will see the figure on this chart of about \n$39.5 billion. We heard a great deal as we went on into 1996, ``Let's \nget back to 1995,'' and there is this freeze of current funding. Let us \nlook at what has actually happened over this period of time. The total \namount of budget authority in 1995 is $39.5 billion.\n  Then under the omnibus appropriations, that figure was reduced to \n$38.8. Of course, even $38.8 billion, $700 million below fiscal year \n1995, was only reached after a long fight to preserve education \nfunding.\n  It took a lot of shifting of funds to get close to fiscal year 1995 \nin fiscal year 1996. A good deal of funds that were uncommitted, or not \nspent, were spent in fiscal year 1996 to make up for the draconian cuts \nproposed to education--to get as close to the funding level of 1995 as \npossible. In April, education was finally funded just about $700 \nmillion below fiscal year 1995.\n  Then we had the budget resolution that was passed based on the so-\ncalled freeze at $36.3 billion. Actually, this freeze does not take \ninto account the addbacks made for fiscal year 1996 alone, and leaves \neducation funding $3.2 billion below fiscal year 1995.\n  The Senate budget resolution, with the Domenici amendment, added $5 \nbillion to discretionary funding--of which $1.7 billion was earmarked \nfor education--came right back up to $38 billion, still $1.5 billion \nbelow the 1995 level. Then the bill went to conference and $500 million \nmore were lost--$500 million were lost in the conference. They added \n$1.2 billion to the original budget resolution, but cut $500 million \nfrom the Senate resolution.\n  Every time we close the doors of negotiations on education funding, \nthe commitment to young Americans go down. It is only when we are out \nhere on the floor of the U.S. Senate, when we are battling in front of \nthe public, whether it has been on the various votes Members remember--\nthe Snowe-Simon amendments or the Specter-Harkin amendment--that we \nrestore some of the funds. But once you close the office doors and \nbegin to conference funding bills, education is one of the first to get \ncut.\n  This is where we are in this resolution, right on our way back down \nagain. The Domenici amendment increases education funding--though \nleaves it well below current funding--and then $500 million were cut in \nconference.\n  We have to ask ourselves what is happening to the total number of \nstudents at this time. The number of students was about 46 million in \n1990 and will increase to 54.6 million by the year 2002. The student \npopulation is gradually increasing by 7 percent. Even with a freeze at \nthe current funding level, you are falling behind, because you are not \ndealing with the expansion of the student population and inflation.\n  Last year alone, it would have meant 100,000 additional teachers just \nto hold even, 50,000 for the makeup of those numbers of teachers that \nwere being lost, and 50,000 more to take into consideration the \nexpansion of the school population.\n\n  That is something we have to understand. The school population for \nkids in grades K through 12 is gradually increasing by 7 percent, and \nfor college-age youth it is increasing 12 percent. Do you think there \nis any effort in the budget resolution conference report to take into \nconsideration the expansion of college students or expansion of student \npopulation in grades K through 12? Absolutely none, absolutely none. \nThe President has talked about a 33-percent increase in the Pell \ngrants. This proposal would be a $6.7 billion reduction over the period \nof time in the Pell grants targeted to the neediest students over \nthere. The list goes on and on.\n  Mr. President, I speak for those who are committed, as I know many in \nthis body are committed, toward education. It is only fair to point out \nwhat this budget does to our commitment to the young people in this \ncountry, for the Head Start programs, the title I programs, the math \nand science programs, the new technology programs to try to provide the \nbest kind of new technology to our students in schools that train our \nteachers, to the school to work program that tries to bring young \npeople into the private sector to make sure they will get decent jobs, \nand then actually is phased out over a period of time once those links \nand once those paths are created.\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In the conference report, education is cut by 20 percent \nin real terms from where we were in 1995. I find that is highly \nunacceptable. When we had the chance to let the Senate, Republicans and \nDemocrats, vote on these matters, we restored education funding.\n  I see in the chair the distinguished Senator from Maine, who has been \na strong advocate for education and for meeting this Nation's \ncommitment when we have the expansion of college and K-12 populations.\n  Madam President, I find this is a dangerous trend. It is complicated \nby the fact that in this legislation we have set aside the billions of \ndollars for tax cuts for wealthy individuals. That is what makes it \ncompletely unacceptable: we are cutting crucial education programs in \norder to pay for the tax breaks for the wealthy. That is intolerable. \nThat is wrong. That is unacceptable.\n  I see others on the floor who want to address this. I intended to \nspeak about the Medicare proposals, as well. I will yield now and hope \nperhaps maybe I will get a few minutes tomorrow at the convenience of \nthe floor managers to address the Senate briefly on that. That is an \nissue of enormous importance as well and should be addressed. The \nSenator from Nebraska has been very kind in allocating time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nhis excellent statement. There will be time tomorrow if he wishes to \nget into the Medicare matter. We discussed that to some extent already, \nand I think we should be discussing it further. There will be some time \ntomorrow, and I would be delighted to yield whatever time the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts wishes.\n  I will shortly yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Illinois who has \nbeen waiting patiently. However, I want to elaborate a little bit on \nwhat the Senator from Massachusetts has been saying about projected \ngrowth costs featuring education. The same thing is true with Medicare, \nand the same thing is true with Medicaid.\n  We have been bamboozled around here, I say to my friend from \nMassachusetts and my friend from Illinois. We have been bamboozled by \nthe statements that an increase is a decrease only in the Nation's \nCapital. What we are talking about here are not increases in education \nfunding, net, or increases in Medicare funding, net. What we are \ntalking about is trying to disguise the honest dollar amount that keeps \nthe level of the programs where they are today. Yet there has been a \nhue and cry across the Nation that the Republican budget does not cut \nMedicare, it provides more money for Medicare. It does provide more \nmoney for Medicare. The facts are it does not provide enough money to \nmeet the real needs of the increased population, the longevity of \nsenior citizens and more and more people who will rely on Medicare. You \ncan see it is not a cut in real dollars, but it is a cut in real needs \nand what the real costs will be for people who are depending on it. \nTherefore, it is a cut. We get all tied up with semantics around here.\n\n  Let me point this out. I had made reference earlier, Madam President, \nto the fact that Medicare costs were going to outstrip what the \nRepublican budget provides for Medicare. An example: The projected rate \nof growth in private-sector health care costs over the period that we \nare talking about would be 7.1\n\n[[Page S6071]]\n\npercent per person. Yet the Republican budget on a per-person basis \nallows Medicare spending to grow only by 4.7 percent. Now, the \ndifference between the projected costs and the Republican budget is 34 \npercent. Yet the Republicans are saying their increase is reasonable \nand provides more money.\n  Plainly, Medicare spending will not be keeping up with inflation in \nthe Republican budget when you consider what the inflation is going to \nbe in the private sector and how many more people are going to have to \ncome into this program. We are being bamboozled here, and the American \npublic know that, even if the U.S. Senate majority does not want to \naddress it.\n  I say also that the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee \nattributes the steep reductions in planned Medicare spending in his \nbudget to an effort to save Medicare. He neglects to note that the \nRepublicans sought to reduce Medicare spending by $270 billion even \nbefore last year's Medicare trustees' report came out. He also neglects \nto mention that the President's budget guarantees the solvency of the \nMedicare trust fund through the year 2005, without making the deep \nreductions planned in Medicare spending.\n  To back that up, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a letter of May 9, 1996, addressed to myself, the \nranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 1996.\n     Hon. J. James Exon,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on the Budget, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: At your request, the Congressional Budget \n     Office (CBO) has examined the effects of the Administration's \n     budgetary proposals on the Hospital Insurance (HI) trust \n     fund. Under current law, the HI trust fund is projected to \n     become insolvent in 2001. CBO estimates that the \n     Administration's proposals would postpone this date to 2005.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n  Mr. EXON. I drive home the point that the President is looking at \nthis realistically and should not be put down for that effort.\n  One more thing, and then I will yield to my friend from Illinois. The \nchairman of the committee complains about how steep the cuts in \ndomestic discretionary programs are in the President's budget. Yes, it \nis true the President does achieve substantial savings from \ndiscretionary spending, but the President still maintains these \ndomestic investments at a rate of $60 billion higher than the \nRepublican budget in the year 2002. If the chairman believes that the \nPresident's cuts are steep, then the chairman would also have to agree \nthat the cuts that he is endorsing in his particular budget are \nabsolutely fatal.\n  The difference between the two budgets is that the Republican budget \nalso cuts taxes so much more. The $122 billion that the chairman \nmentioned is just the tip of the iceberg. The real iceberg is much \nlarger than that. The chairman of the House Budget Committee, John \nKasich, promises $180 billion in tax breaks.\n  The chairman promised, ``We would have our own tax cut that we \noriginally said we would have--that there will be a capital gains tax, \nthat there will be a full child tax credit * * * and there will be a \nhost of other tax relief measures.''\n  Who is kidding whom? I simply say that to keep honest, we have to be \nreasonable. We have to recognize if you are going to provide massive \ntax cuts primarily to benefit the wealthiest among us, something in the \nbudget is going to have to pay for it. That is essentially why, along \nwith the other details, that we will continue to oppose this Republican \nbudget.\n  I yield 15 minutes to my friend and colleague from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Nebraska. I see \nmy colleague from Iowa here, and I will try not to use the whole 15 \nminutes.\n  I am going to join Senator Exon in opposing this budget resolution \nfor several reasons. First, we have tax cuts in here. Now, I recognize \nthat leadership of both parties is saying we ought to go ahead with a \ntax cut. I do not think it makes any sense whatsoever when we have a \ndeficit. It is like when we say we are going to have a 7-year glidepath \nto a balanced budget, but we are going to start off with a tax cut. \nThat is like having a New Year's resolution that you are going to diet \nand then you start off with a great big dessert. It is not a very \npropitious way of doing it. And both parties are saving the tough \nthings, the tough decisions, to the end of the 7 years. That is why we \nneed the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget, in order to \nreally move in that direction.\n  Second, in the area of defense, the conference is $11.3 billion over \nwhat the Pentagon requested. No other agency gets more than they \nrequest, but the Defense Department does. I think it is unrealistic. \nLet us compare it to the next function, function 150, international \naffairs. The United States, in terms of our budget, is behind every \ncountry in Western Europe and Japan in terms of the percentage of our \nbudget that we now use to help in foreign economic assistance--behind \nevery one. But we are ahead of every one in the percentage of our \nbudget that we put in defense.\n  Frankly, what other countries question about us in the area of the \nmilitary and in the area of foreign affairs is not our weapons systems, \nbut our backbone. A few people are killed in Somalia and we get out. In \nBosnia, we make speeches for a long time before we do anything.\n  The budget, I think, is unrealistic in terms of international need \nand how we get stability in other nations. But, primarily, I want to \ntalk about an area where Senator Olympia Snowe has provided leadership, \nand I am grateful to her for that, and that is in the area of \neducation. We are now $4.4 billion from where the President requested. \nWe are down $2.5 billion from where it was when it passed the Senate. \nNow, every study done of this country, every study for the State of \nNebraska, or the State of Iowa, or the State of Maine, or the State of \nIllinois, done by conservatives, liberals, you name it, every economist \nsays we are going to have to do better in education. In higher \neducation, we are ahead of other countries, but the gap is narrowing. \nIn elementary and secondary and preschool education, we are behind most \nof the other developed nations.\n  Among the 18 top industrial nations of the world, in terms of \nexpenditures for elementary and secondary, we are 14th. There are some \nbasic things we ought to do. For example, I was able to get, in the \nlast Elementary and Secondary Education Act, a paltry $90 million--\npaltry in terms of its need--to encourage schools, to give a little bit \nof a carrot to schools to go longer than 180 days. If you go to school \nin Japan, you go 243 days a year. In Germany, they go 240 days a year. \nWhen you go to school in the United States, you go 180 days a year. Can \nwe learn as much in 180 days as our friends in Germany, Japan, and in \nother countries do with longer school years? Of course, we cannot. Why \ndo we go 180 days? In theory, it is so our children can go out and \nharvest the crops. Well, I say to the Presiding Officer and my \ncolleagues, I live at Route 1, Makanda, IL, population 402. Even in \nMakanda, IL, the young people do not go out and harvest the crops \nanymore. That was a different era. We have to adjust. If we just moved \nfrom 180 days to 210, by the time you finish 12th grade, that would be \nthe equivalent of 2 additional years of school, and we would still be, \nin a major way, behind other countries.\n\n  But Senator Kennedy made the point a few minutes ago that when you \nlook at these cuts, what you have to look at, also, is the growth in \nstudent population. And so it is doubly devastating. I remember \nvisiting a Head Start Program, and almost all Head Start Programs have \nwaiting lists, in Rock Island, IL. On Monday morning, one group of kids \ncome in; on Tuesday morning, a second group comes in; on Wednesday \nmorning, a third group comes in, and so on. I asked the woman in \ncharge, ``What if you could have these children here 5 days a week?'' \nShe smiled and said, ``You cannot believe the difference it would make \nin their lives.'' We are not doing it, and we save money with a budget \nlike this? You save money like building a house and you do not put a \nroof on it. Very, very shortsighted.\n  We make great speeches on prisons in this body. Oh, I have heard \nspeeches about crime and how we put people in\n\n[[Page S6072]]\n\nprison and everything. Eighty-two percent of the people in our prisons \nand jails are high school dropouts. You should not have to be an \nEinstein to figure out that maybe if we invested a little more in \neducation, we would not have to put so many people into prison, and \nmaybe we would be a much better country if we did. That is the kind of \nthing we ought to do.\n  This budget takes a step backward in the field of education, rather \nthan a step forward. I am not going to be around here next year, and my \ngood friend from Nebraska is not going to be around here next year. I \nhope that whoever sits in this body will listen to the Presiding \nOfficer when she stands on this floor and says that we have to do \nbetter in the field of education, as she has done many times. And while \nit is true you are not going to solve problems by just throwing money \nat them, I do not hear that same argument used in the Defense \nDepartment. And while money alone is not going to solve the problem in \nthe field of education, without additional resources, we are not going \nto solve the problem.\n  That is the simple reality. We ought to be asking how do we build a \nbetter America as we put a budget together. When you ask that question, \nI think you will come to the conclusion that we ought to be doing more \nin the field of education.\n  I yield the balance of my time back to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I am not sure we have any more speakers. \nWe may have some more. I note that Senator Grassley is waiting. I have \ntalked with him, and he is not going to talk on the budget per se. I \nsimply inquire of the Republican side, are there any other speakers on \nthe budget? Senator Grassley has another subject he would like to \naddress as in morning business. Senator Smith is on the floor. Is he \nhere to talk about the budget or another matter?\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I am here to talk about Senator Dole when \nthe Senator is finished on the budget matter.\n  Mr. EXON. All right. I will just pose a question to the leadership on \nthat side of the aisle. Since there are other Senators wishing to \nproceed on other matters, maybe we could close down the debate on the \nbudget and proceed as in morning business.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If the Senator will yield, I had a discussion with \nSenator Domenici on that point. He asked me if I was going to be here. \nIt was his understanding on our side of the aisle that there was no \nmore reason to speak. He spoke of two or three people on your side of \nthe aisle. When that was done, he figured that the debate on the budget \nwas done for today.\n  Mr. EXON. Well, I have just been handed a note that Senator \nLautenberg is on the way over. I would like to close off debate on the \nbudget, if I might. I do not want to cut people off. I guess the best \nthing for me to do to protect my colleagues is to say that why do we \nnot temporarily go off of the budget to allow the Senator from Iowa and \nSenator Smith to proceed as they see fit. If, when they have finished, \nwe do not have any more speakers, we can put the budget debate over \nuntil tomorrow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we temporarily go off the budget matter \nbefore us and allow the two Senators on the Republican side, who wish \nto address other matters, to be able to proceed as in morning business, \nif that is their request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6069-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6072-S6074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE ROAD NOT TAKEN: DRUG POLICY AND LEADERSHIP\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I have spoken a number of times, last \nyear and this year, on the need for a sound drug policy. We have \nentered a time, of course, when more teenagers are using drugs. It is a \nvery serious problem. When more teenagers see no serious harm or wrong \nin using drugs, it seems to me that we cannot simply accept these facts \nin silence. We need to ask ourselves if we are prepared to see a repeat \nof the drug epidemic of the late 1960's and 1970's that claimed so many \nlives. It was an epidemic that destroyed so many young people and, of \ncourse, it brought a cycle of enduring pain to their respective \nfamilies.\n  Of course, I do not believe that we can afford to remain silent. It \nis not a responsible policy to be silent. It certainly is not effective \nleadership to preside over a repeat of what we know to have been a \nsocial disaster of epic proportions. To today's ears, this may sound \nlike exaggeration, but a brief reminder might serve to make the memory \nfresh in our thinking.\n\n  Before the 1960's, we had virtually no major problems in this country \nwith illegal drug use. Then, beginning in the mid 1960's, the notion \nbecame current that drug use was not so bad, that drugs were your \nfriend. It became common to hear the refrain that drug use was a \npersonal choice that did no harm to anyone. That drugs could be used \nresponsibly. That making drugs legal would end crime.\n  Hollywood picked up this theme and replayed it in countless movies. \nMusic and cultural leaders made drugs fashionable and exciting. Even \ngovernment got into the act. By the mid and late 1970's, a number of \nStates had decriminalized marijuana use and lowered the drinking age to \n18. Federal authorities began to talk about responsible drug use. \nGovernment experts accepted the notion that cocaine was not addictive. \nThat marijuana use did not lead to so-called harder drugs. As the \nchorus on the wonders of drugs increased, dissenting voices were \ndrowned out. Contrary opinions were overruled as unenlightened \nholdovers of a repressive past that had to be dismissed.\n  As a consequence, we decided to walk down a path that encouraged \npeople, young people especially, to believe that drugs were okay. The \nresult was the de facto legalization of drugs in this country. It was a \nvast social experiment based on wholly foolish notions about the \ndangers of large-scale drug use and its anticipated consequences. It \nrelied on creating in the mind's eye some mythical drug user of heroic \nproportions, an everyman, someone who could use drugs with no ill \naffects, someone whose mind and consciousness would expand to include \nnew horizons of enlightenment, someone who would be a better citizen. \nIt was a form of a collective delusion. We found that the path we had \nchosen led to a dead end.\n  In the space of a few years, we went from having virtually no drug \nproblem to having over 70 million people who had tried drugs and at \nleast 6 million addicts. When you stop to consider that the vast \nmajority of those addicts came from among kids, then the scale of the \ndisaster becomes more apparent. We had an explosion of emergency room \nadmissions and a plague of drug-related deaths and violence. In the \nvery years that we stopped enforcing drug laws we saw a corresponding \nexplosion in violent and property crimes. It is not wholly a \ncoincidence that the explosion in drug use also accompanied the \nexplosion in crime throughout America. It is no coincidence that the \ndevastation of our inner cities, already suffering a host of problems, \nwas a product of crack.\n  We learned, the hard way, that there was no heroic individual drug \nuser. There were just people. Ordinary people. Most of them kids. We \nfound that they listened to what adults said. We found, to our sorrow, \nthat drugs worked. We discovered that when you make drugs widely \nappealing in large quantities at affordable prices more people will use \ndrugs. Being a commercial and trading people, this should not have been \na surprise, but under the spell of the drug culture, we ignored our \nexperience.\n  We learned, to our profound regret, that dangerous drugs were illegal \nfor a reason. We learned that they were illegal because they were \ndangerous, not dangerous because they were illegal. We learned that \nincreased use leads to more addiction and to all of the collective woes \nthat come with it. We learned these lessons because we ignored reality. \nwe disparaged common sense. And we paid the price.\n  The first people to recognize the true extent of the consequences \nwere parents. It was not some mythical Everyman that was using drugs, \nit was their kids. In alarming numbers. Parents began to fight back. In \ndoing so, they enlisted the government. Finally, beginning in the early \n1980's, we made extraordinary strides in reducing use. That meant we \ngot more kids to just say no to drugs. Remember that phrase? It may \nhave been laughed at by some, but it worked.\n\n[[Page S6073]]\n\n  We still had the horrible legacy of our misdirected and ill-informed \npast, but we made real strides in reducing use. By the earlier 1990's, \nwe had a comprehensive strategy that addressed both supply and demand. \nWe had succeeded in persuading rising generations of young people that \ndrug use was both dangerous and wrong. Except for hardcore addicts--our \nlegacy from accepting the lie that drugs are OK--we were winning the \nstruggle against drugs. Then, somewhere, somehow, we lost our way.\n  Somewhere, the silence set in. We replaced ``Just Say No'' with \n``Just Say Nothing.'' We came to a crossroads and took a wrong turn. We \nhave seen the consequences. In the past several years, drug use among \nkids is on the rise. More seriously, their attitudes about the dangers \nof drugs are changing--for the worse. An increasing number of kids no \nlonger see drug use as dangerous or wrong. Moreover, to fill the \nsilence, the tragic chorus of legalization has returned. Once again the \nairwaves are filled with the sounds of the wonders of drug use. Once \nagain we are assured that drug use is a personal choice that harms no \none. Once again we are told that enforcing our laws are the cause of \nour problems. Once again we hear the refrains of drugs are OK.\n  The question we ought to be asking ourselves, is how, after all the \nprogress we were making, do we find ourselves back where we began? How \nis what we are doing today different from just a few years ago? Are we \ndoing anything different? No matter what road you follow to get to the \nanswers to these questions, it seems to me, that you come back to the \nsame crossroads. We need to retrace our steps, to put our feet back on \nthe right road.\n  Examining recent drug policy and efforts from the 1980's and early \n1990's, several major differences emerge. Today's drug strategy funding \nis quite similar to its immediate predecessor. After the initial major \nincreases in Federal drug funding in the first years of the Bush \nadministration, the budget to fight the drug war has increased on \naverage about 5 to 6 percent per year. This rate of increase holds true \nfor both Democratic- and Republican-controlled Congresses. So, if \nfunding has been fairly consistent, we need to look elsewhere for the \nchanges in policy that might account for the dramatic changes in our \ndomestic drug situation in the past 3 years. When we look at the \nproblem from this perspective, what we see as the major changes come \nnot in money but in emphasis. Emphasis on how the money is spent, and \non the public posture of the administration on the drug issue.\n  Now, we need to ask ourselves if we intend to accomplish anything by \nthe policies we pursue. If we do, then we ought to be able to look at \nthe results and draw some conclusions about whether our efforts are \nproducing the results we want. If they aren't, then we might conclude \nthat something isn't working. It is important to examine the record of \nthe administration's drug policy and what seems to be happening with \nthe drug problem. We need to remind ourselves of where we were and the \nroad we took to get where we are now. I have been detailing this issue \nin the past. The last time I did it was just before the Memorial Day \nrecess. At that time, an esteemed colleague of mine asserted that I was \nusing my remarks to play politics in an election year.\n\n  I do not want to question my colleague's motives for raising that \nparticular concern. I trust that her remarks on the administration's \nrecords were made because she is concerned as well as I am with the \nissue and not with the circumstances. Certainly, in sponsoring very \nrecently a legislative initiative that addressed a Clinton \nadministration policy of letting drug smugglers go, she herself is \naware of some of the shortcomings of that record. Unfortunately, in her \nremarks after I made my remarks that day 2 weeks ago, she did not \naddress many of the issues that I raised. In addition, she, too, seems \nto have found it difficult to set the record straight based on the \nrecord. Many of her remarks dealt with administration initiatives that \nare only indirectly concerned with drug policy.\n  It is, therefore, useful to review the record of both actions and \nwords that took us down the path that we are on today, in other words, \nthe path that changed dramatically from the 1980's up until about 1991 \nor 1992.\n  Here we can see three major difference in present policy from our \nearlier successful efforts. First, at the beginning of the Clinton \nadministration, we saw a decision to lower the profile of the drug \nczar's office. That was accomplished by firing over 80 percent of the \nstaff in the first weeks of the new administration and by appointing a \nno-profile drug czar. We should ask ourselves if that decision tells us \nanything about the intent of a new administration.\n  Second, we saw a decision by this administration to shift the counter \ndrug efforts away from interdiction and enforcement to treatment. This \nwas, in fact, an upfront announced policy of this administration. It \nwould seem to tell us something about priorities and about desired \noutcomes. The consequences of that decision have been a steady decline \nin our interdiction efforts and a decline in prosecutions of major drug \noffenders. It would seem we are getting what we should have expected.\n  Third, we saw a decision by the President to absent himself from the \ndrug issue. In this regard, I have noted the need for clear, consistent \nleadership on this issue, but a number of our colleagues, both Democrat \nand Republican, have noted a deafening silence in the past, coming from \nthe White House on the issue of drugs. This is in sharp contrast to \nprevious administrations.\n  You can actually count on your fingers on one hand the number of \ntimes the President mentioned drugs in the first 3 years of his \nadministration. We need to ask ourselves if this silence was \naccidental, was an oversight, or was a matter of deliberate policy. \nEven a policy defined by an absence of mind, however, is still a \npolicy. And, of course, as we all know, choices have consequences.\n  Taken together, these decisions represent more than just a minor \nrestructuring of programs that were working. Even though spending on \ncounter drug efforts remained fairly steady, there was a significant \nshift in emphasis. There was a very significant dropoff in rhetoric \nabout the drug problem, and there was a significant decline in \ninterdiction and enforcement efforts. These have been documented in a \nnumber of news reports, a number of congressional studies, and even in \ninformation provided by this administration.\n\n  Leading Democrats and Republicans in the last several years have also \nnoted the silence from the President on the drug issue. Their \nconclusion was that the bully pulpit lost its chief representative.\n  Unfortunately, as this silence progressed, the voices for \nlegalization of drugs gathered steam. Silence at the White House, a \nmaddening echo around the issue for legalization.\n  Not since the 1970's have we seen this much voice, this much effort \nabout the clamor to make drugs more widely available. And, \ndisturbingly, the renewed call for drug legalization comes first from \nwithin the administration itself. It came from no less a person than \nthe Surgeon General of the United States, a position that carries great \nmoral weight and an opportunity to lead.\n  At the time, the startling remarks of Joycelyn Elders may have \nreceived only a minor rebuke from the White House. Whatever might have \nbeen said or done to counter the efforts of the Surgeon General's \nremarks remain unsaid. Oh, yes, I know she was fired, but the rest, as \nthey say, is history.\n  Now, if choices have consequences and if policies have purposes, we \nshould ask ourselves what we see as a result of these choices and \npolicies of recent years. Here is the current record.\n  After a decade of decline in drug use, we see startling new figures \nof returning use of drugs. Every survey, including the most recent \nhospital emergency room studies released just last week, show a \nreturning drug problem. Teenage use is on the rise. Teenage attitudes \nabout the dangers of drug use have changed for the worse. Emergency \nroom admissions are rising. Calls for drug legalization and efforts to \naccomplish it abound.\n  The bottom line is that more kids are starting to use drugs. \nPresumably, these outcomes were not the intent of the policies stated \nor left unstated, as I have mentioned. If that is true, then we are \ndrawn to the conclusion that\n\n[[Page S6074]]\n\nthese efforts are either a failure or, at least, ineffective, and we \nhave some further evidence that this view is shared by the \nadministration.\n  In the last several months of an election year, the administration \nhas changed its course very dramatically on drug policy. The President \nhas named a new high-profile drug czar. He has agreed to restore the \npersonnel, that 80 percent cut I spoke about that came in 1993 in the \ndrug office, to restore that personnel. We have given the money to do \nthat. He has agreed to beef up spending on interdiction and \nenforcement, and he has made himself more visible on the drug issue.\n  These changes may smack of an election-year conversion, but they \ncorrespond exactly to the problems in the policies that I noted \nearlier. They seem to indicate an awareness of a problem. I leave it to \nothers to determine whether this shift is too little, too late. I leave \nit to others to decide whether the shift is as a result of political \nconvenience in an election year. But what we all need to know and \nremember is that when it comes to drugs, we find ourselves back in a \nfamiliar and dangerous neighborhood. We took a wrong turn and have \nended up on a dead-end street. We have been here before, and we cannot \nafford to stick around a dead-end street.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, if I understand the parliamentary \nsituation, we went, temporarily, off the budget resolution so the \nSenator could speak as in morning business.

Madam President, today I rise to join so many of my \ncolleagues in a tribute to my friend and my leader, Senator Bob Dole, \nwho, as we all know, is leaving the Senate today, June 11, 1996.\n  As a former history teacher, I could not help but sense the \nhistorical significance of this day. It really was a flashback to the \nold days of the great oratory that took place on the Senate floor, with \nthe likes of Calhoun and Clay and others, when Bob Dole took the podium \nthat he so many times has stood at and addressed the U.S. Senate. You \ncould hear a pin drop in the Chamber and in the gallery, not always the \ncase here on the Senate floor, with a lot of hustling and bustling and \ntalking and people not paying attention.\n  That was not the case today. Senator Bob Dole took that podium, \naddressed the country, the Chair, his colleagues and friends, many, \nmany staff in the galleries, and the Chamber was hushed and quiet and \neverybody was listening--as well they should, Madam President, because \nwhen the history books are written, they will write about the great \nSenators who have occupied this Chamber: Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, \nBob La Follette, Robert Taft and, yes, Daniel Webster. Daniel Webster \nused this very desk, Madam President, that I now have the privilege of \nspeaking from.\n  It reminds me that we are just a brief blip on the radar screen of \ntime; here for only an instant. But Bob Dole is one of the great ones, \nand he will be remembered as one of the great ones.\n  As a history student, I tried to catch a sense of what was happening. \nI looked at faces, watched people in this Chamber, as I watched, at the \nsame time, Senator Dole. Without singling anybody out by name, I could \nnot help but notice one page, a young lady, standing here on the floor \nof the Chamber during that speech and after the speech with tears \nrunning down her cheeks. It really was a very moving tribute to the \nkind of person Bob Dole is, because he commands the respect of not only \nhis colleagues but every single man, woman, youngster, page. He could \ntalk to a page as easily as he could talk to a President or world \nleader. That is what makes him such a great man.\n  Today, he left the Senate to move on to other things. I remember many \nemotional private goodbyes that he shared with his colleagues. I \nremember when we had the meeting when he told us he was leaving. Most \nof us did not expect him to do it. If we were honest, we would say we \ndid not expect him to say that. We thought he might leave the \nleadership post but not the Senate. But when he did it, and the way he \ntold us, we knew it was the right thing. We knew it was right, because \nhe needed to be out there debating, not other Senators on the floor of \nthe Senate, but the President of the United States for the Presidency. \nWe all knew that.\n  Today, I think you saw with the type of speech that Bob Dole gave the \nkind of person he is: humble, gracious, and humorous, that great sense \nof humor. In all the tough battles we have here, he still finds that \nhumor, which has always been a remarkable characteristic.\n  So he is leaving the Senate. But he left today after that speech with \nthe longest applause that I have ever seen given anyone in this Chamber \nor in the House Chamber. I have seen Presidents when we have gone to \nthe State of the Union--great Presidents--receive a lot of ovations. I \nhave never seen anybody receive a longer ovation than Bob Dole received \nhere today, and that is a tribute to this great man who was elected to \nthe House of Representatives where, Madam President, you and I both \nserved together. He was elected in 1960 and served four terms in the \nHouse before he was elected to the U.S. Senate, which really has come \nto be, the past 27 years, his home.\n  But he gave nearly 36 years of service to the State of Kansas and to \nthe people of the United States of America. When you think about that \nmany years of public service and reflect on the fact there is not one \nword or taint of scandal in any way, shape, or form, an unblemished, \nperfect political record, it is remarkable.\n  He served his country and the Senate and the people with humor, with \nhumility, and we will never forget him.\n  His wife, Elizabeth, who has been by his side for so many years, is \nsuch a gracious woman and such an asset to Bob Dole. Those who serve \nhere know how important the support of your family is as you put in the \nlong, long hours that we have to endure in the Senate.\n  Bob Dole said today in his remarks, ``My word is my bond.'' That is \nwhat it is all about. It is character. It is integrity and character. \nIf you leave here, the legacy you leave, if no one says anything about \nyou other than when he gave his word he kept it, you cannot do any \nbetter than that.\n  I tried to think about what I might say here as my tribute in my own \nway, because so many people have so many wonderful things to say about \nthis great man. I just want to share a couple of personal things, \nbecause they are important to me and I think it captures my feeling \nabout Bob Dole.\n  I come from a military family. My father served in World War II as a \nnaval aviator and was killed at the end of the war, leaving my mother \nas a widow to raise my brother and me. She did that alone. I lost my \ndad, as I say, in World War II, and Bob Dole nearly lost his life in \nthat same war. Severely injured, he had to fight his way back, not only \nfrom the brink of death but after that, paralysis, and became a U.S. \nSenator.\n  But we, the sons and daughters of that generation, those of us who \nhad parents who were in that war, World War II, we know, we are \ngrateful. Perhaps we know and are a little bit more grateful than \nothers for what they did and the sacrifices they made and how important \nthey were to save the world from tyranny. It took heroes like Bob\n\n[[Page S6075]]\n\nDole--and he was a hero, he is a hero --it took heroes like Bob Dole to \nmake that happen. We owe him, and thousands of others like him, a huge \ndebt of gratitude for their service and their sacrifice to our country, \nbecause when the call came, they stepped up and they stopped tyranny.\n  So Bob Dole did not get here the easy way. We hear a lot of stories \nabout how everybody in the Senate is rich and everybody gets here the \neasy way and you live this great life, but Bob Dole made it the hard \nway. You cannot help but admire and respect a man like that.\n  I turned to him in 1993 to be a part of one of the most personal and \nmeaningful experiences of my entire life, and I want to share that with \nmy colleagues and with the American people.\n  When my father died in 1945, it was 2 days before my fourth birthday, \nso I only have two memories of my dad. My brother has no memories of \nour dad, because he was less than a year old. I had always wanted to \nhave my father buried at Arlington, but I never wanted to bring that \nsubject up with my mother because he was not buried at Arlington and I \ndid not want to put my mother through that experience of having his \nremains moved from where he was buried in New Jersey to come here to \nArlington where I believe he would have liked to have been laid to \nrest. So I put it off.\n  Then in May 1993, my mother passed away. She used to say she was a \none-man woman, and she was. She never remarried after she lost my dad. \nBut she always would go by the cemetery and she would say, ``Put me \nthere with him so that we can be together forever.''\n  When I made the decision to bury my parents--both of them--at \nArlington National Cemetery in May 1993, I asked Senator Dole if he \nwould have the time to come and give a few remarks at that service. \nWithin a matter of minutes, the response came back: ``Of course.''\n  I asked Bob Dole to say just a few words. I listened as this man made \nconnections to my parents that I just could not believe anyone could do \nso spontaneously. He did not know my mother. He did not know my father. \nBut I listened to Bob Dole say very movingly of how my father had stood \nguard in the night and how he had made the ultimate sacrifice. I \nlistened as he spoke of how my mother had stood guard here at home when \nmy father went away to war. I listened, Madam President, and I knew how \nproud my father and mother were, looking down from Heaven to see this \nAmerican hero, Bob Dole, speaking at their memorial service in \nArlington National Cemetery.\n  He even made the connection my dad served on the U.S.S. Wichita,. He \nsaid, ``Any man who would serve on the U.S.S. Wichita,, named after a \ncity in Kansas, had to be a great man.'' He made that ceremony so \npersonal that many of my relatives came up to me afterwards and said, \n``Did Senator Dole know your parents?'' I said, ``I think he did. I \nreally think he did.''\n  So holding Bob Dole in the esteem I do, I was honored that only 8 \nmonths into my first term in the Senate, Senator Dole selected me to be \nvice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs. It was \na great honor for me to serve in that capacity. I shall always be \ngrateful to Bob Dole for giving me that opportunity. Of course, he also \nselected me for the Ethics Committee, and I may hold that against him \nfor a little while.\n  But, Madam President, in 1994, I had another moving experience. I \nattended the 50th anniversary commemoration of D-day at Normandy. I saw \nthere a sight that I will never ever forget. My wife Mary Jo and I \nwent, and Bob Dole went as well. He retraced his steps in Italy. To see \nhim there back with those people who helped to save his life, and to \nwalk those hills where he was wounded, and then to go to Normandy after \nhe left Italy, to the beaches of Normandy with those rows and rows and \nrows of crosses, and to think of the sacrifices, and men in \nwheelchairs, men with lost limbs, hugging, saluting this man--it was a \ngreat honor just to be there for the celebration of Normandy, but to be \nthere in the company of Bob Dole, I shall always be grateful to Senator \nDole for giving me that opportunity. I have never seen such admiration, \ngratitude, respect, and love as there was for that man. They loved him. \nThey absolutely loved him.\n  Another just little thing, but last summer I had two young interns, \njust college kids, Jennifer Kilgus and Greg Annis. They were walking \ndown the corridor of the Capitol, just taking a walk. They decided to \nstop in to the majority leader's office just to say they went in there, \nhoping maybe they might have the chance to meet Bob Dole.\n  Not only did he agree to see them with no appointment, but in the \nmidst of a very busy schedule he spent 15 minutes talking to them, two \nyoung interns in his office, giving them the thrill of their lives. \nThat is the kind of man Bob Dole is. That is why there were tears in \nthe eyes of that page when Bob Dole said he was leaving.\n  Finally, Madam President, as the senior Senator from New Hampshire, I \ncannot help but note that somehow Bob Dole has managed to spend quite a \nbit of time in New Hampshire over the past few years. He lost a tough \nprimary in New Hampshire but went across the Nation with a stunning \nseries of smashing primary victories as he won the Republican \nnomination for President. Gracious in defeat and gracious in victory.\n  He has been to New Hampshire just to enjoy its beautiful lakes and \nmountains and countrysides. Perhaps, Madam President, you never know, \nthere might even be a summer White House in New Hampshire someplace.\n  Final anecdote. I remember Senator Dole, I believe 2 years ago, \nsaying to me, ``You know, my Elizabeth would really like to go water-\nskiing. But we would really not like to have a crowd around. Could you \narrange that so that we didn't have to have a bunch of people with \ncameras so she could relax and enjoy herself?'' And we did. She is a \ngreat water-skier, too.\n  So, Madam President, I join my colleagues in saying farewell, but not \ngoodbye, to Bob Dole. The last thing I said to Senator Bob Dole on the \nfloor of the Senate, as I shook his hand after his remarks, was, ``I'll \nsee you at your swearing in for President on the West Front of the \nCapitol on January 20, 1997.'' He said, ``I'll be there.'' I said, ``I \nknow you will, Mr. President.'' I have been proud to serve with Bob \nDole in the U.S. Senate. I will be prouder still next year to fight as \na Senator to help President Bob Dole pass the agenda that he dreams \nabout for America.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter that Senator \nDole read at my parents' funeral be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n A TRIBUTE TO LT. COMMANDER DONALD SMITH AND MARGARET ELDRIDGE SMITH, \n     ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY, BY SENATOR BOB DOLE, MAY 24, 1993\n\n       Members and friends of the Smith family; I never knew Lt. \n     Commander Donald Smith, but we shared a great deal in common.\n       We were of the same generation. We served together in World \n     War II--he flew the skies of the Pacific, and I walked the \n     hills of Italy. And since I'm from Kansas, I note with pride \n     that Lt. Commander Smith served aboard the U.S.S. Wichita.\n       The author Herman Wouk wrote that ``If America is still the \n     great beacon in dense gloom--then we still need heroes to \n     stand guard in the night.''\n       Like so many others before and after him, Lt. Commander \n     Donald Smith stood guard in the night. And like so many \n     others, he made the ultimate sacrifice.\n       He was and he is an American hero, and it is very fitting \n     that he has been brought here, this final resting place of \n     American heroes.\n       There is another name we add today to the list of heroes at \n     Arlington. The name of Margaret Eldridge Smith.\n       Throughout our history, as American soldiers have ``stood \n     guard in the night,'' their family members have ``stood \n     guard'' here at home, supporting their country and their \n     military in countless ways.\n       When Margaret Eldridge married Donald Smith, she did so \n     knowing there would be times when they would be separated by \n     miles of land and ocean.\n       She also knew that the time might come, as it did in 1945, \n     when they would be separated by more than just territorial \n     limits.\n       And for the past half century, Margaret Smith honored her \n     husband and her country by continuing to stand guard.\n       She raised a family on her own, bringing up two fine sons \n     who would both serve their country in the military and in \n     government.\n       She, too, is an American hero.\n       I am very honored to be here this afternoon, as these two \n     heroes are reunited forever, and the best way we can honor \n     them is to continue to love freedom, to love our country, and \n     to always ``stand guard through the night.''\n\n\n[[Page S6076]]\n\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I will take just a couple of minutes \nbeyond that which was allocated to me by the Senator from Nebraska to \nsay that I, too, listened very intently to Senator Dole's remarks \ntoday. I was touched and moved by them.\n  I will not go into his record, and I will not go to any length, but I \nwant to say that Bob Dole is someone whom I have admired over the \nyears, with whom I have worked very smoothly. When he said it, he meant \nit. When he meant it, he said it. That is the way he operated.\n  He is part of a generation, of which I also am, and that is the \ngeneration of World War II veterans, a dwindling group, I regret to \nsay. This year we will see several leave because, in addition to \nSenator Bob Dole, Senator Hatfield, and Senator Heflin will leave, and \nthe group tightens and shrinks. It is not a very pleasant prospect to \ncontemplate. But, nevertheless, it is a decided loss to take away the \nexperience, the knowledge, the reflection of those who served in World \nWar II at a time when America was a much different place, at a time \nwhen the values were established by tightly knit families, by those who \nworried about the loss of a loved one or the injury of a family member \nin the war. It was a huge war with somewhere around 14, 15 million \npeople from our country in uniform. It touched every family in America. \nThere was not a family that did not have close contact with that war.\n  We were also the generation that benefited enormously--enormously--\nfrom an educational program called the GI bill that was afforded to \npeople like me and many others who serve here, where it changed our \nlives. The military experience was one thing. I served in World War II, \nnot under the same level of danger that Senator Dole or Senator Inouye \nserved, but people in my unit were killed. It changed our lives because \nof the experience of the war, the fear, the danger, the detachment from \nfamily. When I enlisted in World War II, my father was already on his \ndeath bed, a man of just 43 years of age. And a family of four became a \nfamily of two virtually overnight.\n  But the experience of serving my country, the opportunity to do so, \nthe opportunity to get an education, is something that ought to be \nfirmly implanted in everybody's mind in this place and in this \ncountry, where an education can change one's life, as it did, I know \nfor so many of my colleagues. Certainly, it did for me.\n\n  Without giving a personal biography, that is not my intent, just to \nsay that we will miss Bob Dole. We will miss his experience and we will \nmiss his wisdom. I wish him well--not quite as well as the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, but that is in terms of the upcoming Presidential \nelection--I wish him, personally, well and I wish him and his family \nmany good years of enjoyment and good health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6076-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6076-S6077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, if I may now take the time allotted \nto me by the Senator from Nebraska, I want to talk about the conference \nreport on the budget resolution, this budget that makes such deep cuts \nin Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment. My view is we \nought to reject it and start over.\n  Before I make specific comments about the budget, I want to frame it \nin terms of the historical perspective. The Federal budget over the \nlast 15 years, what has happened with it? The fiscal records of \nPresidents Clinton, Bush, and Reagan could not be more different. Over \na 12-year-period, the Reagan and Bush administrations incurred $2.3 \ntrillion of debt. In fact, if we did not have to pay the interest on \nthe debt racked up in these 12 years, the budget would be in balance \nthis year. Not once did President Reagan or President Bush propose a \nbalanced budget.\n  Fortunately, President Clinton's 4-year record is much different. \nPresident Clinton promised change in 1992 and he has produced it. \nConsider the following: The deficit has gone down for 4 straight years. \nThe revised deficit figure for the fiscal 1996 year is now $130 \nbillion--by no means a modest figure, but substantially down from where \nit was 4 years ago. It is 1.8 percent of our gross domestic product. \nThat is the lowest percentage of any industrialized country. For \nexample, Japan's deficit is more than 3 percent of its GDP; Britain, \nthe U.K., is 7 percent of its GDP; Italy's percentage of debt is 9 \npercent of GDP.\n  Finally, President Clinton is the first President to put forward a \nbalanced budget proposal in a full generation. Madam President, budgets \nare more than just numbers. A budget is a statement of values. We are \nnot accountants sent to Washington to only crunch numbers. We are here \nto respond to our people's needs for health security, for seniors on \nMedicare, and Medicaid for those who have only that program to provide \nfor their health needs.\n\n  We are here to encourage educational opportunities for our young \npeople. We are here to be stewards of the environment so that the next \ngeneration can enjoy clean water, clean air, my grandchildren will know \nabout fish in the water, and not be afraid to go to a tap to take a \ndrink of water, or will not have to be told to stay out of the air when \nplaying games or exercising.\n  We are here to provide help and vision for our people in the next \ncentury. Simply, we are here to protect our citizens' life quality, to \nprotect our economy, to protect our Nation, to protect our society. \nThis budget does not accomplish those objectives. It will hurt those \naspirations.\n  Madam President, unfortunately, some in the other party believe \nGovernment is evil. I say this because a very distinguished Republican, \na Republican House Member told a very distinguished Congressman, \nCongressman Henry Hyde, as I read from the report, ``I trust Hamas,'' \nthis person said, ``more than I trust my own Government.'' Hamas--a \nterrorist organization with programs designed to kill innocent people, \nmen, women, and children. What an odious comparison. Madam President, \nwhat government is this person talking about? Could it be the American \nGovernment? Our democratically elected Government?\n  Excluding net interest, two-thirds of the Federal Government is \nSocial Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans benefits, and national \ndefense. These are the major programs of our Federal Government. I \nrepeat, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans, national \ndefense. Are these evil programs? Are they equivalent to Hamas \nterrorist attacks? I do not get the connection, but I resent, terribly, \nthe words that are used. Whatever one thinks about mistakes or poor \nperformance of our Government, this Government and this country can \nnever be compared to a terrorist organization.\n  Madam President, the question is no longer whether we will balance \nthe budget. The question is, how? Who will win in programs that are in \nplace? Who will lose if programs are canceled? Finally, whose side is \nGovernment on?\n  President Clinton has laid out the right way to balance the budget. \nHis budget reaches balance within 6 years, as documented by CBO, but \nunlike the Republican version the President's budget, protects \nMedicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment, and it does not \nincrease taxes on working families. The President's budget not only \nprotects 37 million senior citizens from deep Medicare cuts contained \nin this budget, but it will also, despite reports to the contrary in \nrecent days, it will also make the Medicare trust fund solvent until \nthe year 2005. It preserves the guarantee of Medicaid for 36 million \nseniors and disabled persons who rely on those programs. It protects \nour Nation's environment by ensuring full funding for the \nimplementation of the major environmental programs like clean air, \nclean water, and toxic waste cleanups. It makes critical investments in \neducation and training, it provides increased funding for programs like \nHead Start, title I, and safe and drug-free schools.\n  Finally, the President's budget maintains the earned-income tax \ncredit, which provides tax relief for working families who earn less \nthan $28,000 a\n\n[[Page S6077]]\n\nyear. It allows them to maintain their family needs for basic \nessentials, for sustenance.\n  The Republican budget is much different. It is punitive to working \nfamilies and senior citizens. In reality, this budget resolution ought \nto be entitled ``Extremist Budget, Part II.'' The huge Medicare cuts in \nthis budget, combined with the proposed structural changes will truly \nmake Medicare wither on the vine. If the Republican budget is enacted, \nMedicare will become a second-class health care system. The Republican \nbudget also eliminates the guarantees of Medicaid coverage for seniors, \ndisabled, children, and pregnant women.\n  This budget contains a Republican assault on education. Over 7 years \nthis budget cuts $60 billion in education and training, compared to the \nPresident's budget. This budget continues the Republican tragedy of the \nenvironment. The budget will cut environmental programs by 19 percent \nin the year 2002 and it will slow down toxic waste cleanups.\n  Finally, this budget continues the Republican war on working \nfamilies. At the same time the GOP leadership is opposing an increase \nin the minimum wage, they are proposing to increase taxes on working \nfamilies who earn under $28,000 a year--harsh and unfair. That is why \nthis budget resolution ought to be called the extremist budget part II.\n\n  Last year, the President vetoed the Republican budget because it \ncontained huge cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the \nenvironment. This budget does very much the same, and President Clinton \nwill veto this budget as well.\n  So as soon as our Republican friends show that they can put forth a \nbalanced budget like the President's, one that protects our priorities, \nwe will have a balanced budget--but not until then.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (By unanimous consent, the remarks of Mr. Specter are printed at an \nearlier point in today's Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6076-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO PAUL F.

This is, \nof course, a happy occasion for Paul, his family and many friends, in \nour upstate Delaware County.\n  Both Paul Eaton and I came to reside in the foothills of the \nCatskills as adults. Paul came to practice law in the early 1930's. And \nLiz and I bought our farm in the early 1960's. And we have all stayed. \nThe beauty of the place and the welcoming nature of its people have \nkept us there.\n  Paul made Walton his home; he was elected village police justice and \nlater mayor; served in the Office of Price Administration during World \nWar II; has spent over a half century as trustee of St. John the \nBaptist Church; married Frances Kellogg, raised a family; remained a \nloyal Democrat; played golf; and practiced law.\n  And if I may say, Madam President, he has practiced law, and \ncontinues to practice law, in a manner that brings nothing but honor to \nthat profession. Paul Eaton is a general practitioner. He draws wills, \nhandles real estate closings, tries cases, and counsels his clients. \nHis reputation as a skillful lawyer is matched only by his reputation \nfor honesty and integrity. He is still at it. For while we will \ncelebrate his birthday on the 16th, he will be in his law office on the \n17th. This is as it should be. We wish him well. Happy birthday Paul. \nMadam.

Madam President, on Friday the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. \nInhofe] and the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] and I had an \nexchange about the inaccuracy of certain statements made by the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma regarding the debate over the balanced budget amendment. \nDuring that exchange, the Senator from Oklahoma inserted into the \nRecord copies of the original versions of Senate Joint Resolution 41 \nfrom the 103d Congress, and House Joint Resolution 1 from the 104th \nCongress. The Senator from Oklahoma represented that these were the two \nresolutions that we voted on--Senate Joint Resolution 41, in 1994, and \nHouse Joint Resolution 1, in 1996.\n  The distinguished Senator from North Dakota indicated that the two \nresolutions we voted on were not identical, since language known as the \nNunn amendment was added to House Joint Resolution 1 regarding judicial \nreview, and that this was new language from the resolution voted upon \nin 1994. The Senator from North Dakota asked unanimous consent to \ninsert into the Record the language which was actually voted on by the \nSenate. After the Senator from Oklahoma twice reserved the right to \nobject, the Senator from North Dakota withdrew his request.\n  I have since had time to review the Record, and found that Both \nresolutions inserted into the Record by the Senator from Oklahoma were \nincorrect. In other words, neither of the resolutions which he put into \nthe Record were actually voted upon by the Senate. The Senator form \nOklahoma put into the Record the balanced budget amendment proposals as \nintroduced, in order to claim the Senate voted on identical proposals. \nHowever, both resolutions were subsequently amended in different ways. \nThe 1994 resolution was modified to limit judicial remedies to \ndeclaratory judgments and other remedies authorized by Congress. This \nmodification was dropped altogether in House Joint Resolution 1, as \nintroduced in 1995. However, this resolution was then also amended by \nthe Senate through the Nunn amendment, which prohibited judicial review \nentirely.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions which were actually \nvoted upon by the Senate in 1994 and 1996--neither of which were \ninserted into the Record by the Senator from Oklahoma--be inserted at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    S.J. Res. 41, 103d Congress--Final Version on Which Senate Voted\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of \n     each House concurring therein).

Second, Madam President, the Senator from Oklahoma and I \nhad an exchange on the Senate floor because after I heard him quote \nfrom my 1994 floor statement, I believe he was quoting my statement in \nan inaccurate and distorting manner. The Senator from Oklahoma was \nquoting my statement in support of the Reid-Ford-Feinstein amendment \nwhich protected the Social Security trust funds, and making it sound \nlike I was speaking in support of the underlying Simon-Hatch version of \nthe legislation, which does not protect Social Security.\n  Madam President, after reading Friday's Record, I found that the \nSenator from Oklahoma's quoting of my 1994 statement was even more \nselective and misleading than I had first realized. I ask unanimous \nconsent that my actual full statement, as reproduced in the \nCongressional Record on March 1, 1994, and the version quoted by the \nSenator from Oklahoma be printed in the Record.\n  Those who wish to read these can draw their own conclusions about \nwhether I was quoted accurately.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Senator Wendell Ford, Actual Floor Statement, March 1, 1994\n\n       Mr. Ford. Mr. President, I have but a few minutes to speak \n     this morning on behalf of the Reid-Ford-Feinstein balanced \n     budget amendment. So I will concentrate my remarks this \n     morning on trust.\n       The public trusts the Congress to keep the Nation's \n     finances in order. Nowhere is that agreement and that trust \n     more evident or more important than in governing the Social \n     Security trust fund.\n       In the debate over our amendment and the Simon amendment, \n     honesty and protection of the trust fund have played a very \n     big role. Right now, surpluses in the trust funds are being \n     used to hide the true amount of the deficit. The biggest \n     example of this is in Social Security, but it is by no means \n     alone in this distinction.\n       During the 1980's, we allowed the Federal trust funds to \n     run up huge surpluses. We would collect a gasoline tax to \n     fund highway construction but then not spend it all on \n     highways, thus creating an accounting surplus. The problem \n     is, we did spend money elsewhere creating masked deficit and \n     budgetary illusions.\n       The Simon amendment will allow us to continue to do this. I \n     have a speech in my folder that I made back in October of \n     1987 that addressed this very issue. This particular speech \n     dealt with the Aviation trust fund. At the time, it \n     represented a $6 billion surplus.\n       Mr. President, I say to my colleagues that that is only \n     peanuts when compared to Social Security. According to OMB, \n     from 1985, when the Social Security System started to run a \n     surplus, to 1993, it singlehandedly covered up $366 billion \n     in Government red ink. Social Security covered up $366 \n     billion in Government red ink.\n       If you think that is bad, wait until we look to the future. \n     From 1994 through the year 2001, the date that Senator \n     Simon's amendment would likely take effect, CBO projects \n     another $703 billion in budgetary chicanery, for a grand \n     total of $1.69 trillion worth of deception.\n       When compared with that, the deficit hidden by the other \n     trust funds are small potatoes--only another $35 to $40 \n     billion. Pretty soon though, as we have heard in the past, it \n     adds up to real money. We pat ourselves on the back and claim \n     to cut spending and do what is right for our electorate, all \n     the while our Social Security trust fund is full of IOU's.\n       Well, I, and those who support our amendment, mean to do \n     something about that. Our amendment respects the pact our \n     Nation made with its people many years ago. It reinforces it, \n     makes it stronger, safer, and more secure. Social Security is \n     exempt from our amendment, thus securing and fortifying its \n     position as a separate trust fund. If you do not believe me, \n     just listen to the Gray Panthers, and they will tell you \n     themselves. I have here three letters to that effect. AARP, \n     the National Alliance for Senior Citizens, and the National \n     Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, all \n     endorse Social Security's treatment under this amendment.\n       Other trust funds will be treated honestly as well. They \n     will be considered as a part of the capital budget that \n     invests in infrastructure and development. Building highways \n     and airports pays dividends in the future through higher \n     productivity and job opportunity and growth. Social Security \n     and these other trust funds did not cause the deficit, and \n     under our amendment they will not be used to hide the deficit \n     either. This is honest budgeting and a workable balanced \n     budget amendment.\n       Mr. President, time is short and a vote on the Reid-Ford-\n     Feinstein balanced budget amendment is near. Unfortunately, I \n     fear that it is not near passage but defeat. Standing beside \n     that defeat will be a good faith effort of those who are \n     truly concerned about the world that we leave for future \n     generations. Standing beside that defeat will be the last \n     attempt of this Congress to face reality and tackle an ever-\n     crippling debt and deficit problem. Standing beside that \n     defeat will be faith in Government. I support the efforts of \n     my friend and colleague from Illinois to take on this \n     persistent fiscal dishonesty, but his version of the \n     amendment will go down to defeat as well.\n       The Reid-Ford-Feinstein amendment is the only amendment \n     that could stand the chance of final passage. We all know \n     that. Yet standing by the defeat of yet another balanced \n     budget will be my colleagues from the other side of the \n     aisle. Instead of getting what they could, they will go home \n     proud of taking the supposed moral high ground. If that is \n     what they want, they can have it. What I want and what 70 \n     percent of our Nation's people want is a sound financial \n     future. What they will get is more of the same under the \n     Simon amendment, for standing tall at the end of the day will \n     be disenchantment, dishonesty and fiscal irresponsibility.\n       I hear so much about ``if 40-some-odd Governors can operate \n     a balanced budget, why can't the Federal Government.''\n       Well, I give them an opportunity. I operated under it. It \n     worked. We had a huge surplus when I left the Governor's \n     office. We had an operating account. We had a capital \n     account.\n       They say operate like you do at home. At home you have \n     income, your salary. That is your operating account. You buy \n     a car within your means. You pay that out of your operating \n     account. You buy a home. You pay that out of your operating \n     account. But your operating account is always balanced. And \n     we have a time period in which to pay it off.\n       They say, ``Oh, we will never implement that legislation.'' \n     How do you know we will not? I have seen some amazing things \n     come out of this Chamber. I have seen people work and do the \n     right thing.\n       I think implementation of this amendment will work. I think \n     we can make it work. But on the other hand, if we want an \n     issue, fine. Stay with Senator Simon and Senator Hatch. Stay \n     with them and then have an issue when you go home.\n       But do you want a balanced budget amendment? There are \n     enough votes with those who are supporting that amendment \n     that we can get one.\n       Oh, I hear all this, ``The House is going to make us do \n     it.'' I have never seen us make the House do anything. I have \n     never seen the House make us do anything. So when they pass \n     their balanced budget amendment, what is it going to do? It \n     is going to die between here and there. That is what is going \n     to happen to it. It is going to die between here and there.\n       ``Oh, we will be forced into it.'' Nope. The House will not \n     do that to us. We will not do it to the House. So if you want \n     a balanced budget amendment operated like Nebraska was \n     operated, like Kentucky was operated, I will guarantee you \n     that we can do the right thing.\n       That is what it is all about here today, to do the right \n     thing. We have an operating budget. We are going to pay this \n     in 10 years.\n\n[[Page S6079]]\n\n     The slice is in here. We have IOU's in the Social Security. \n     We are going to buy it. It is in operating. We buy it, pay it \n     off. So Social Security is sound. I do not understand why it \n     takes a brain surgeon to understand how you operate a budget \n     the away the States do.\n       And so, Mr. President, I would hope that we would \n     reconsider between now and 3 o'clock this afternoon that this \n     is an opportunity to pass a balanced budget amendment that \n     will work and will give us a financially sound future, not \n     only for ourselves but for our children and our \n     grandchildren.\n       I hear my distinguished friend say he is going to do it for \n     his unborn grandchildren. I have five. The Senator is no \n     ``Lone Ranger''. I am just as worried about my grandchildren \n     as he is. And I think I have a pretty good idea I have had to \n     work under it. I had to operate it. I understand how it \n     works. There are few in this Chamber who do. You will find \n     that most of those will vote for this amendment because it \n     works.\n       Do it like the Governors do; pass the Reid amendment. Do it \n     like you do at home and operate your own budget; pass the \n     Reid amendment. It is just that simple, Mr. President.\n       I do not know how much time I have remaining, but I will \n     reserve it.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Senator Inhofe: Quotation of March 1, 1994 Statement of Senator Ford, \n                              June 7, 1996\n\n       So when the Senator from Kentucky came in--I had not quoted \n     him, but I will now. He said this back on March 1, 1994. He \n     said, ``I support the efforts of my friend and colleague from \n     Illinois''--talking about Senator Simon, who is a very \n     courageous guy, and one I complimented probably more than I \n     have ever complimented anyone else on the floor yesterday. \n     Senator Ford said, ``I support the efforts of my friend and \n     colleague from Illinois to take on this persistent fiscal \n     dishonesty. I hear so much about if 40-some-odd Governors can \n     operate a balanced budget, why can't the Federal Government? \n     I operated under it''--this is Senator Ford, who was a \n     Governor of Kentucky--``and it worked. I think implementation \n     of this amendment will work. I think we can make it work. I \n     do not understand why it takes a brain surgeon to understand \n     how you operate a budget the way the States do. This is an \n     opportunity to pass a balanced budget amendment that will \n     work and will give us a financially sound future, not only \n     for ourselves but for our children and our grandchildren.''\n\n  Mr. FORD. Lastly, Madam President, let me just note that every \nprovision of the Constitution is subject to interpretation. I am sure \nthat the Senator from Oklahoma does not agree with every Supreme Court \ndecision interpreting the words of the Constitution--even though it may \ninvolve different interpretations of the same language.\n  In 1994, the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Senator Simon, gave \nspecific assurances that he would work in support of, and even \ncosponsor, implementing legislation to require Congress to balance the \nbudget without counting the annual Social Security surplus. He even \nsubmitted a memorandum from the Congressional Research Service with the \nopinion that it would be legal and appropriate for Congress to pass \nsuch legislation. This memorandum is reprinted in the March 1, 1994, \nCongressional Record along with the debate\n  By contrast, in 1995 we saw proposals from leading proponents of the \nbalanced budget amendment spelling out how much of the Social Security \nsurplus they would count year by year.\n  As I stated last year and again last week, this was an enormous shift \nin the interpretation of the resolution and a major factor in my \ndecision to not support the balanced budget amendment without further \nassurances about Social Security.\n  It is my hope that debate on the Senate floor in the future will be \nconducted at a level which respects the opinions of fellow Senators on \nall issues. It is the least that our constituents expect of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6077-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FATHER BILL KENNY\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, one of the pleasures of working with this \nbody is the opportunity to recognize the outstanding contributions that \nindividuals have made in our respective States and in our country. I \nrise today to recognize such a person, Father Bill Kenny of Las Vegas.\n  Frequently, people are recognized for an heroic action on a specific \noccasion, or for a moment of self-sacrifice that may have saved the \nlives of people who were put in harms way. Father Kenny's achievement \nis different; he is a man who has devoted his entire life to helping \nothers, and on a continual, daily basis, he gives his energy, his time, \nand his spirit to his community, to his parishioners, and to his \nchurch. On June 19, Father Kenny will celebrate the 25th anniversary of \nhis ordainment as a Catholic Priest, and I am delighted to take this \noccasion to congratulate him on a lifetime of self-sacrifice.\n  Father Bill Kenny is truly an example of the American dream in \naction. Bill came to Las Vegas as a young boy and attended St. Joseph's \nCatholic School and Bishop Gorman High School. As a young altar boy, \nBill often thought about becoming a priest. Inspired by his uncle John, \na priest who also served in Las Vegas, Bill entered the seminary and \nafterwards completed his studies at the theological college of the \nCatholic University of America on a 3-year scholarship. He earned his \nB.A. in 1966 and his M.A. a year later, after which he was assigned for \none year to the North American College in Rome, a residence for \nAmerican students who study at the Pontifical Gregorian University. He \nresumed his studies at the theological college, and in 1971, he \nreturned to Las Vegas for his ordination.\n  He was first assigned to serve as associate pastor at St. Annes and \nthen, in 1976, at Our Lady of Las Vegas. The diocese intuitively knew \nthat, in Father Kenny, they had a man of extraordinary talent and, in \nOctober of 1978, Father Bill was asked to start a new parish in a \ngrowing section of the city; he became the founding pastor of Christ \nthe King Catholic Community, a parish that, under his tutelage, has \ngrown to over 5,000 members.\n  I have had the good fortune to attend services at Father Kenny's \nchurch and to witness, first hand, the care and compassion he has \nengendered within his parish. I participated in one of the most moving \nceremonies of my career when Father Bill invited me to take part in the \nopening of the national AIDS Quilt exhibit which he generously housed \nin the church's parish hall. We read the names of those whose lives \nwere represented in the squares of the quilt, and I know there wasn't a \ndry eye in the crowd.\n  This is just one example of the compassion that Father Bill \ndemonstrates on a continual basis; I know that there are at least 5,000 \nmore stories that reflect the influence that he has had on someone's \nlife. I am glad that Father Bill chose to come back to his home in Las \nVegas to fulfill his mission with the Catholic church, I am proud to \nhave him as my friend, and I congratulate him for his 25 years of \nexemplary service to the people of Nevada. We are all better because of \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6079-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to establish a commission to study and provide \nrecommendations on restoring solvency in the Medicare program under \ntitle XVIII of the Social Security Act; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      the medicare restoration act\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, last Wednesday the Medicare trustees \nreleased their report on the state of the Medicare trust fund, and the \nreport was grim. Instead of going bankrupt in 2002, as they previously \nforecasted, the\n\n[[Page S6083]]\n\ntrustees conclude that Medicare will go bankrupt in 2001--just 5 years \nfrom now.\n  For the past year and a half, this Republican Congress has attempted \nto deal honestly and forthrightly with the impending Medicare meltdown.\n  We put forward a budget that would protect, preserve, and strengthen \nMedicare by reducing its unsustainable rate of growth, while still \nallowing for a healthy growth rate.\n  We did not claim that our plan was perfect or that it solved the \nlong-term problem. But it was a real attempt to alleviate a crisis that \nwill immediately impact 37 million seniors and disabled Americans, and \nwill have repercussions on tens of millions more.\n  In May 1995, I called for a bipartisan Commission to be set up to \nsave Medicare similar to the one that saved Social Security. \nUnfortunately the White House dismissed the idea and decided to attack \nRepublican plans to save the Medicare system.\n  That is why I rise today to introduce the Medicare Restoration Act to \nestablish a blue-ribbon bipartisan advisory commission to help deal \nwith this crisis.\n  In my view, leadership means more than just talking about problems. \nIt also means doing something to solve them.\n  This Commission will be responsible for reviewing the current, short-\nterm and long-term condition of the Medicare Trust funds. The \nCommission will be composed of 15 members appointed by the President, \nSenate, and House of Representatives. The members of this commission \nwill be from both political parties, because it is clear to me that if \nwe are to be successful we must put politics aside and work on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  Unfortunately, President Clinton has been unwilling to do that.\n  In February 1995, President Clinton submitted a budget that contained \nno provisions for saving Medicare.\n  In April 1995, the Medicare trustees--three of whom are members of \nhis administration--issued their original report and urged ``prompt, \neffective and decisive action.'' The administration instead chose to \nattack Republican plans to save the system.\n  Last March, the President submitted a budget which, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, would only stave off Medicare's bankruptcy \nfor one more year.\n  It is an undeniable fact that the Republican proposal allowed \nMedicare spending per beneficiary to increase from $4,800 per person to \n$7,200 per person over 7 years.\n  It is also an undeniable fact that in their ill-fated health care \nreform proposal, the Clinton administration advocated slowing \nMedicare's rate of growth.\n  Despite these facts, however, the President vetoed our Medicare \nproposal, and we have heard nothing but attacks on Republicans for \nslashing and cutting Medicare.\n  And when the President was asked, not long ago at a news conference, \nwhy he continued to use these terms even though they are not true, his \nresponse was essentially that the media made him do it.\n  With the release of the trustee's report, the inescapable conclusion \nis that while the rhetoric flew, Medicare was put at further risk.\n  And those who say that talk is cheap should know that 18 months of \nmisleading rhetoric may have gained one side points in the opinion \npolls, it also put Medicare another $90 billion-plus in the red.\n  The bottom line is that the 37 million Americans who depend on \nMedicare deserve better. Future generations of Americans who will need \nMedicare deserve better.\n  I call on the President to come forward and support this bipartisan \ncommission so we can preserve the Medicare Program and to join with \nRepublicans on a bipartisan basis, as I have proposed before, to \naddress this very serious problem.\n  I send the bill to the desk and ask it be appropriately referred. It \nis cosponsored by Senators Roth, Simpson, Pressler, Hatch, Chafee, and \nMurkowski, who are on the Senate Finance Committee. I certainly welcome \nadditional cosponsors on either side of the aisle. This will be a \nbipartisan commission.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1856\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of legislation \nintroduced by the majority leader to establish a National Commission on \nMedicare Reform.\n  According to the Medicare trustees' report released last Wednesday, \nJune 5, the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund will be bankrupt \nearlier than expected. In fact, the trustees, of which three of the six \ntrustees are members of President Clinton's Cabinet, indicate that the \ntrust fund may run out of money as early as calendar year 2000.\n  Senator Dole's proposal is consistent with the recommendations of the \nMedicare trustees. The trustees recommend:\n\n       * * * the establishment of a national advisory group to \n     examine the Medicare Program. The advisory group would \n     collect and disseminate information and help develop \n     recommendations for effective solutions to the long-term \n     financing problem. This work will be of critical importance \n     to the administration, the Congress and the American public \n     in the extensive national discussion that any changes would \n     require.\n\n  We are now 2 years closer to insolvency of the Medicare trust fund \nthan we were at this time last year. We lost a year trying to address \nthe problem, and the program is 1 more year closer to bankruptcy than \nwe expected. Yet, I regret, we are miles away from reaching an \nagreement on a solution.\n  Given the very short time that Medicare will remain solvent, and \ngiven the large number of baby boomers who will be joining the Medicare \nProgram in just a few years, we cannot afford more delay. It is time to \nput politics aside and find a solution.\n  What is happening to the Medicare trust fund is pretty basic. The \nprogram is paying out more than it is taking in. This simple dynamic, \nif left unchecked, will lead Medicare to bankruptcy in less than 5 \nyears. And, simply put, bankruptcy of the trust fund means there will \nnot be money to pay the hospital bills of our senior citizens and \ndisabled individuals reliant on Medicare.\n  Again, I believe it is time to put politics aside. A Medicare Reform \nCommission is an important step in the right direction to bringing \ntogether a bipartisan, lasting agreement on resolving Medicare's fiscal \ncrisis.\n  The 1983 National Commission on Social Security Reform was an \nessential catalyst to resolving the then-looming bankruptcy of Social \nSecurity. The 1983 Commission brought together people in a cooperative \nbipartisan spirit. Ultimately, the work of the Commission laid the \nground for a solution to the solvency crisis. I believe a Medicare \nReform Commission might be able to do the same today.\n  We are facing a crisis. A crisis requires action. We cannot be a \ngovernment of empty promises. We must restore Medicare to robust health \nfor our children and our grandchildren.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DOLE:\n  S. 1857. A bill to establish a bipartisan commission on campaign \npractices and provide that its recommendations be given expedited \nconsideration; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n        the bipartisan campaign practices commission act of 1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as I prepare to leave an institution in \nwhich I have served for over 35 years, I am mindful that in many ways \nthe public has lost confidence in the ability of legislators to \nrepresent their interests, not special interests.\n  We should not allow this to continue. Representative Democracy, \nfounded on fair and competitive elections, is at the core of what makes \nAmerica great. Yet, concern over how we finance elections threatens to \nerode the trust the American people have in our elected officials.\n  As my colleagues know, Congress has tried repeatedly to grapple with \nthis issue and largely failed. However, I continue to believe that the \nvery nature of the problem makes it difficult to resolve in the normal \ngive and take of the legislative process.\n  In 1990, for example, Senator Mitchell and I appointed a six-member \ncommission of outside experts to look at this issue and report back to \nus, but the report was unfortunately ignored by Congress.\n  I suggested in 1994 and repeatedly since then that a similar \ncommission be constituted to report back to Congress, but with an \nimportant difference. This time, the report should be in the form of \nrecommended legislative language which provides a solution and Congress \nshould have an opportunity for an up and down vote.\n  As my colleagues know, both President Clinton and Speaker Gingrich \nendorsed a similar concept last year when they met in New Hampshire.\n  I therefore send to the desk a bill that establishes an eight-member \ncommission of outside experts. They would have the broadest possible \nmandate to think through this problem, come up with solutions and \nreport back to Congress not more than 30 days after the convening of \nthe 105th Congress.\n  The commission will send Congress legislative language for those \nrecommendations on which seven members agree. Congress will consider \nthose recommendations under expedited procedures that mirror the fast-\ntrack authorities in our trade laws.\n  I know my colleagues will be grappling with this issue soon. However, \nI believe that it would be better to take this issue out of what is \nalready a super-heated partisan atmosphere, and allow a bipartisan \napproach to be developed that Congress cannot ignore.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1857\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bipartisan Campaign \n     Practices Commission Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to create a point of order against legislation which \ndiverts savings achieved through medicare waste, fraud, and abuse \nenforcement activities for purposes other than improving the solvency \nof the Federal hospital insurance trust fund under title XVIII of the \nSocial Security Act, to ensure the integrity of such trust fund, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n                 the medicare restore trust act of 1996\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce timely \nlegislation with Senators Baucus and Pryor that addresses the problem \nof Medicare fraud and abuse. The two bills, entitled the ``Medicare \nAnti-Fraud Act of 1996'' and the ``Medicare Restore Trust Act of \n1996,'' would undertake serious and strong anti-fraud efforts by the \nFederal Government based in large part on the success of the \nadministration's recent Medicare and antifraud effort called Operation \nRestore Trust and ensure that savings achieved from such efforts are \nreturned to the Medicare trust fund.\n  Mr. President, we have heard in the last few days some very troubling \nreports about the impending insolvency of the Medicare trust fund. This \nlegislation would have two direct contributions to reversing that move \ntoward insolvency.\n  First, it would suture a hemorrhage of funds out of the Medicare \ntrust fund which today are going for fraudulent bills, and not for \nservice to American citizens; and, second, it would assure that any \nfunds that were recovered as a result of these more effective \ninvestigations and prosecutions would go directly back into the \nMedicare trust fund in order to restore its financial base.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately the phrase ``fraud, waste and abuse'' \nhas become discredited. It has been used so often as an excuse for not \ndealing with the more difficult and fundamental problems. \nUnfortunately, the area of Medicare waste, fraud, and abuse is a part \nof the fundamental problem. It has been estimated that of the $180 \nbillion spent last year on Medicare and on approximately 36 million \nAmericans' health care--$180 billion--10 percent, or $18 billion, was \nwasted in fraudulent activities.\n  You might ask why is there such a high level of fraud in this program \nof Medicare? Some of the reasons include: The amount of money that is \nbeing expended is huge--$180 billion and growing; that it is being \nspent largely on populations which have groups within it that are \nvulnerable to these fraudulent schemes; that those people who wish to \nperpetrate those schemes are sophisticated shysters and there has been \nlax enforcement.\n  First and foremost, the General Accounting Office estimates that the \nMedicare waste, fraud and abuse rip-off rate is about 10 percent. With \nfraud pilfering the health systems' resources, losses to Medicare and \nthe federal share of Medicaid could be $30 billion annually. Using the \nmost conservative of estimates, we could cover an additional 2 million \nseniors a year with funds lost just to Medicare waste, fraud, and \nabuse.\n  Two million additional Americans could be covered if those funds \ncould be properly directed.\n  Although it is increasingly unlikely that a Medicare reform package \nwill pass this year in Congress, it would be unconscionable to not pass \na Medicare waste, fraud and abuse this year. Rather than putting \nMedicare beneficiaries at risk of losing coverage or access with the \ncuts envisioned in some legislative proposals during this Congress, we \nshould act instead to combat Medicare fraud to protect the health care \nof beneficiaries and the Medicare trust fund.\n  As the Citizens Against Government Waste wrote in their August 23, \n1995, report entitled ``Medicare Fraud: Tales From the Gypped,'' \n``Preserving, protecting, and strengthening Medicare must be the number \none priority for Congress and the administration.'' The organization \ndetails 89 examples in its report and advises that waste, fraud,\n\n[[Page S6086]]\n\nand abuse is the first area of needed attack.\n  How did this get to be such a problem? According to the General \nAccounting Office in its February 1995 report entitled ``Medicare \nClaims,'' ``Physicians, supply companies, or diagnostic laboratories \nhave about 3 chances out of 1,000 of having Medicare audit their \nbilling practices in any given year. Moreover, Medicare pays more \nclaims with less scrutiny today than at any other time over the past 5 \nyears.'' The GAO continues, ``In fiscal year 1993, Medicare processed \nalmost 700 million claims, about 250 million more than it processed 5 \nyears earlier. Despite the rising volume of claims, per-claim funding \nfor antifraud and antiabuse activities declined between 1989 and 1993 \nby over 20 percent.''\n  As a result, FBI Director Louis Freeh says cocaine distributors in \nsouth Florida and southern California are switching from drug dealing \nto health care fraud. The reason: more money with less risk. Drug \ndealers committing health care fraud know that law enforcement is not \nyet equipped with the laws needed to effectively attack the problem. \nWith a program estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to be \nspending over $1.6 billion during the next 6 years and with lax laws to \ncombat abuse, con artists, thieves, and opportunists know Medicare is \nwhere the easy money is.\n  As Republican Congressmen Steven Schiff and Chris Shays write, \n``currently there is no Federal crime of health care fraud. It is \ndifficult to prosecute health care-related offenses because law \nenforcement must rely on wire and mail fraud statutes for their \ninvestigations and prosecutions.''\n  Attacking fraud is crucial to the overall Medicare debate for the \nfollowing reasons:\n  Fraud ought to be the first place we look when considering reductions \nin Medicare expenditures.\n  Fraud undermines public confidence in Medicare. We cannot ``fix'' \nMedicare while letting fraud erode the system.\n  One dollar spent against fraud and abuse can reduce Medicare Program \ncosts by as much as 11 dollars, according to the Health Care Financing \nAdministration [HCFA] and demonstrated by the administration's effort \nin Operation Restore Trust.\n  Solutions are available.\n  What can be done to solve this problem? To engage in a comprehensive \nassault on fraud, particularly within the Medicare Program, multiple \nagencies within the Federal Government will need additional resources. \nThe Inspector General testified at a hearing before the Senate Finance \nCommittee that ``now is the time to implement new legal remedies and \nreverse the downward trend of funding for efforts to combat health care \nfraud and abuse.'' The legislation that I am introducing today will \nachieve both of these goals.\n  Operation Restore Trust is an effort currently underway in five \nStates which brings together the HHS Office of Inspector General, \nHealth Care Financing Administration, the Department of Justice, State \nMedicaid agencies, and State Medicaid fraud control units to combat \nfraud and abuse. This legislation would institutionalize these efforts \nin all 50 States.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services recently released results \nfrom the first year of Operation Restore Trust. The program had $4.09 \nmillion to work with and has added $43.2 million to the Medicare trust \nfund and U.S. Treasury: an 11-to-1 return. This program has been a \ngreat success, but I agree with June Gibbs Brown that this is the ``tip \nof the iceberg.''\n  To provide adequate resources to go after the fraud and abuse, we \nestablish a Medicare anti-fraud account for the Inspector General (IG) \nand an anti-fraud control account for other government agency's use. \nFunds for the Medicare account would be provided by and returned to the \nMedicare trust fund. For every $1 spent on prevention, the IG uncovers \nat least $7 in fraud. By using trust fund dollars to augment IG \noperations, the legislation assures that the IG will continue to have \nthe resources necessary to combat fraud and abuse without worrying \nabout discretionary spending cuts.\n  This legislation enacts a broad-based Federal statute aimed at \nsuppressing Medicare fraud. This enhances the protection of fraud \nvictims and prescribe stiff penalties against those convicted of fraud. \nIt institutes a policy, ``one strike and you are out,'' one instance of \nMedicare fraud and you are out of the program for at least 5 years.\n  The second bill would establish a point of order against any piece of \nlegislation that would divert savings from anti-fraud, waste and abuse \nenforcement activities for any other purpose--such as new Federal \nspending or tax breaks--other than saving the Medicare trust fund. This \nlegislation would also ensure that any savings from anti-fraud, waste \nand abuse activities reimburse the up-front investment on enforcement \nand further strengthen the Medicare trust fund.\n  We have all promised to protect Medicare. We can do so by passing \ncomprehensive Medicare waste, fraud, and abuse legislation and do it in \n1996, thus ensuring savings achieved are used to protect Medicare and \nimprove its solvency. The two bills we are introducing today--the \nMedicare Anti-Fraud Act of 1996 and the Medicare Restore Trust Act--\nwould accomplish these goals.\n  Mr. President, I suggest these two pieces of legislation should get \nthe immediate attention of this Senate. I am pleased to see that we \nhave with us today the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which \nI assume will be the primary committee of reference for consideration \nof this legislation.\n  Every day that passes allows for further waste of Federal taxpayers \nmoney and further eroding of the solvency of the Medicare trust fund, \nfurther erosion of the confidence of the American people. We must take \naction now.\n  At the signing of the Medicare bill in Missouri 30 years ago, \nPresident Johnson said Medicare had been planted with ``the seed of \ncompassion and duty which have today flowered into care for the sick \nand serenity for the fearful.'' Medicare has lived up to the promise of \nPresident Johnson and President Truman. But fraud is rotting away at \nthe Medicare system. We have the prescriptions to combat fraud. Now is \nthe time to employ them if we want to save the integrity of Medicare \nfor future generations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1858\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for legal reform and consumer \ncompensation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n         the legal reform and consumer compensation act of 1996\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, several weeks ago, I was \ndisappointed, but not surprised, when the President vetoed the \nbipartisan product liability reform bill. The bill would have curbed \nrunaway punitive damage awards--which the Supreme Court endorsed in its \nrecent BMW versus Gore decision--and offered some protection to those \nneedlessly dragged into lawsuits. The President, erroneously, in my \nview, charged that the product liability reform bill, offered too many \nbenefits to business and unfairly burdened the injured.\n  The President missed an opportunity to correct some of the defects in \nthe legal system. The fact is the system is too costly and fails to \nprovide prompt and fair relief to those who are injured. Less than half \nof every dollar spent on lawsuits goes to the injured.\n  And, spiraling legal costs exact a toll on every American family and \nbusiness owner in the form of higher insurance premiums and ever-\nincreasing costs for medical care. FBI Director Louis Freeh estimates \nthat fraudulent medical claims arising out of phony car accidents cost \nevery American household $200 a year.\n  Moreover, economic growth is impeded when new American-made products, \ntechnology, medicines, and medical devices aren't brought to worldwide \nmarkets because of too many lawsuits.\n  This mess-of-a-legal system can be turned around with reforms that \nwill ensure those who are injured get fairly and quickly compensated \nwithout resort to expensive and protracted litigation. The two bills I \nam introducing today take aim at the unnecessary costs of personal \ninjury lawsuits. The result will be more money in the hands of the \ninjured more quickly, and a massive savings to American consumers.\n  The Joint Economic Committee estimates that the Auto Choice Reform \nAct will save the driving public $40 billion annually in insurance \ncosts. Savings would be progressive, resulting in savings to low-income \ndrivers of about 45 percent on their insurance premiums.\n\n[[Page S6097]]\n\n  The Legal Reform and Consumer Compensation Act, designed to change \nthe monopolistic and anticompetitive contingent fee system and to \nprovide a rapid recovery mechanism for personal injury victims, would \nsave more than $45 billion a year.\n  These dramatic savings are achieved without capping punitive damages, \nor limiting the rights of victims. Rather, these bills expand consumer \noptions. By adding a new type of auto insurance, new ways of paying \nvictims fairly for their injuries, and breaking the contingent fee \nhold, Americans will be begin to be relieved of the litigation burden \nthat threatens to strangle every family and burdens the overall \neconomy.\n  The changes proposed in these bills will require a major rethinking \nabout the current zero-sum, adversarial legal system. Occasionally, the \nlegal system rewards a persistent plaintiff with a windfall damage \naward--like the woman who won a multi-million-dollar verdict from \nMcDonald's for spilling hot coffee on herself. But odds of winning in \nthe legal system are about as good as hitting a jackpot in Las Vegas.\n\n  The perverse incentive structure--the one-in-a-million chance of \nwinning the lottery--discourages settlement and rewards a piling on of \nclaims. If a jury will award an injured party 3 times his or her out-\nof-pocket losses, then 10 trips to the doctor are better than 2. The \nRand Corp., in a study released earlier this year, estimates that \nexcess medical claiming connected with lawsuits consumed some $4 \nbillion of health care resources.\n  But the fault for the runaway legal system does not lie exclusively \nwith the injured and their lawyers. Defendants and their lawyers know \nthat the multimillion-dollar jury award is a rare occurrence. Yet, most \ncases are fought as if every case results in $1 million verdict. Every \ndollar spent on defense buys delay and precludes early and reasonable \nresolution.\n  In the meantime, every American pays the price--through higher car \ninsurance premiums, spiraling medical bills, and soaring prices at the \ncheckout counter. And the economy suffers from slow growth and through \nproducts, inventions, and technologies withheld from the world's \nmarkets because of the cost of lawsuits. It's time we cut the tort tax \nand give every American relief from the costly legal system.\n  I am pleased that Senator Dole is joining this effort. His \nsponsorship of this ambitious effort to overhaul the legal system will \nprobably be one of his last legislative initiatives. I am honored to \nhave his support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the two bills and a summary of \nthe bills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S.1860\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the costs of operating a motor vehicle are excessive \n     due to the legal and administrative costs associated with the \n     processing of claims under the tort system;\n       (2) the costly fault and liability insurance system often \n     fails to provide compensation commensurate with loss, takes \n     too long to pay benefits and wastes too many dollars on legal \n     fees;\n       (3) the distorted incentives of the tort system for motor \n     vehicles produce--\n       (A) significant fraud in the claiming process, thereby \n     dangerously exacerbating the national distrust felt by many \n     Americans toward the legal process in general and the rule of \n     law itself;\n       (B) significant wasteful, fraudulent, and costly overuse \n     and abuse of scarce health care resources and services, \n     thereby increasing the problems of affordability and \n     accessibility in the health care system;\n       (C) significant and unbearable cost burdens on low-income \n     Americans, which impose on them the Hobson's choice of \n     driving on an unlawful, uninsured basis or compelling them to \n     forego essential needs;\n       (D) significant reductions in access to, and purchases of, \n     motor vehicles, thereby damaging the economic well-being of \n     many low-income Americans, while also unnecessarily harming a \n     critical component of the American economy;\n       (E) significant deterioration of the economic well-being of \n     most major American cities through the imposition of a \n     massive, differentially greater ``tort tax'' on urban \n     residents, thereby contributing to the abandonment of cities \n     by many American taxpayers able to achieve substantial after-\n     tax savings on automobile insurance premiums by the sole act \n     of moving to adjacent suburban communities; and\n       (F) significant inability to achieve market-based discounts \n     in insurance rates for owners of safer cars, thereby \n     powerfully contributing to the lesser safety of American \n     drivers and passengers;\n       (4) a system that allows consumers the opportunity to self-\n     insure and separates economic and non-economic damages for \n     the purpose of purchasing insurance would provide enormous \n     cost savings to drivers;\n       (5) consumer choice in selection of motor vehicle insurance \n     would be greatly enhanced if each consumer could decide upon \n     the form of insurance that best suits the individual needs of \n     the consumer;\n       (6) insurance to indemnify individuals for personal injury \n     arising from motor vehicle collisions is frequently \n     unavailable at reasonable cost because of the potential for \n     third-party claims;\n       (7) a system enabling individuals to select the form of \n     motor vehicle insurance coverage that best suits individual \n     needs would enhance individual freedom and reduce the costs \n     of motor vehicle insurance for consumers; and\n       (8) a system which targets and emphasizes the scourge of \n     those who drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol will \n     further deter such dangerous and unlawful conduct.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to authorize consumers of motor \n     vehicle insurance to choose between their present tort \n     remedies under State law and a system which combines first-\n     party insurance and the right to sue negligent drivers for \n     all further uncompensated economic losses.\n\n     SEC. 4.

and\n       (19) ``uninsured motorist'' means the owner of a motor \n     vehicle, including his or her resident relatives, uninsured \n     for either personal protection or tort liability insurance at \n     the limits prescribed by the applicable State's financial \n     responsibility law or higher under section 5(a)(2)(A).\n\n     SEC. 5. MOTOR VEHICLE PERSONAL PROTECTION INSURANCE.\n\n       (a) Insurance Policy Provisions.--(1) An insurance policy \n     that includes provisions that entitle the insured to receive, \n     without regard to fault or lack of fault, the insured's net \n     economic losses caused by an injury along with an express, \n     specific waiver of tort rights as provided in the insurance \n     policy shall be valid notwithstanding any contrary provisions \n     of State law.\n       (2) In order for a personal protection insurance policy to \n     be covered by this Act, a motor vehicle insurance policy \n     issued by an insurer shall, at a minimum--\n       (A) provide personal protection coverage of the greater \n     of--\n       (i) up to the minimum limits of liability insurance for \n     personal injury under the State's financial responsibility \n     law; or\n       (ii) in a State covered by a no-fault motor vehicle \n     insurance law, up to the minimum level of insurance required \n     for no-fault benefits; and\n       (B) contain provisions under the State's financial \n     responsibility law, including those related to liability for \n     property damage, except to the extent State law would bar \n     contractual provisions giving effect to personal protection \n     authorizations set forth in this Act, or to the extent that \n     State law would be contrary to other provisions of this Act.\n       (3) A personal protection insurer is authorized to contract \n     to pay personal protection benefits periodically as losses \n     accrue. Unless the treatment or expenses related thereto are \n     in reasonable dispute, an insurer who does not pay a claim \n     for net economic loss covered by a personal protection \n     insurance under this Act within 30 days after payment is due, \n     shall pay the loss compounded at a rate of 50 percent per \n     annum, as liquidated damages and in lieu of any penalty or \n     exemplary damages.\n       (b) Operation of the Right To Choose.--(1) Under this Act, \n     in lieu of buying traditional tort liability insurance for \n     personal injury to protect third parties, motorists have the \n     right to choose personal protection which will be available \n     to themselves and their family members in the event of a \n     motor vehicle accident, including the amount of financial \n     protection they deem appropriate and affordable for \n     themselves and such others. As an alternative, motorists have \n     the right to elect traditional tort liability coverage for \n     personal injury at the minimum limits (or higher) under the \n     State's financial responsibility law.\n       (2)(A) A motorist who chooses traditional tort liability \n     has automatically included in such coverage tort maintenance \n     coverage at least at the equivalent of the minimum levels of \n     insurance under the higher of--\n       (i) the State's financial responsibility law for personal \n     injury; or\n       (ii) the State's no-fault motor vehicle law, if applicable.\n       (B) A motorist described under subparagraph (A) who is \n     involved in an accident with another motorist remains subject \n     to tort law for personal injury except that, based on fault, \n     such motorist--\n       (i) may be claimed against by those covered by personal \n     protection insurance or tort maintenance coverage only for \n     net economic loss; and\n       (ii) may not claim against those covered by personal \n     protection insurance or tort maintenance coverage except for \n     net economic loss.\n       (C)(i) With respect to a claim under subparagraph (B)(ii), \n     a deduction is made against the recovery equal to the limits \n     of tort maintenance coverage applicable to the economic loss \n     of the claimant.\n       (ii) One-half of any amount paid under tort maintenance \n     coverage referred to under clause (i) shall be deemed payable \n     for economic loss.\n       (3) A motorist who chooses personal protection coverage and \n     who is involved in an accident with another such motorist is \n     compensated under his or her own policy for net economic loss \n     only without regard to fault. But if the motorist sustains \n     net economic loss in excess of his or her policy's benefit \n     levels, that person retains the right to claim and sue for \n     net economic loss based on fault.\n       (4) If a motorist who has chosen personal protection \n     coverage is involved in an accident with an uninsured \n     motorist, the personal protection insured is compensated for \n     net economic loss without regard to fault according to the \n     terms of his or her personal protection policy, and has the \n     right to claim against the uninsured motorist for net \n     economic loss based on fault. The uninsured motorist forfeits \n     the right to claim for noneconomic loss against the motorist \n     who has chosen the personal protection policy.\n       (5)(A) A motorist who chooses either personal protection \n     insurance or tort liability insurance also binds by such \n     choice his or her resident relatives, provided that--\n       (i) an adult resident relative shall not be bound without \n     his or her consent, which, in the absence of express consent, \n     shall be implied when the relative is present in a motor \n     vehicle operated by the motorist; and\n       (ii) insurers are authorized to specify reasonable terms \n     and conditions governing the commencement, duration, and \n     application of the chosen coverage depending on the number of \n     motor vehicles and owners thereof in a household.\n       (B) In order to minimize conflict between the two options \n     under subparagraph (A), insurers are authorized to maintain \n     underwriting rules that encourage uniformity within a \n     household.\n       (6) A personal protection insured retains the right to \n     claim, and remains subject to a claim, for driving under the \n     influence of alcohol or illegal drugs, both as defined by \n     State law, or for intentional misconduct.\n       (7) A personal protection insured claims personal \n     protection benefits in the following priority:\n       (A) The personal protection of an employer if the person \n     injured is an employee of the employer and the accident \n     occurs while the employee is acting within the scope of the \n     employee's employment.\n       (B) The personal protection under which the injured person \n     is or was an insured.\n       (C) The personal protection covering a motor vehicle \n     involved in the accident, if the person injured was an \n     occupant or was struck by such motor vehicle at the time of \n     the accident.\n       (8) A personal protection insurer is authorized to write \n     personal protection coverage--\n       (A) without any deductible or subject to a reasonable \n     deductible not to exceed $1,000; and\n       (B) with an exclusion of coverage for persons driving under \n     the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs.\n       (9) A personal protection insurer is subrogated, to the \n     extent of its obligations, to all of the rights of its \n     personal protection insured with respect to an accident \n     caused in whole or in part, as determined by applicable State \n     law, by the negligence of an uninsured motorist or driving \n     under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs, or caused in \n     whole or in part by intentional misconduct or any person who \n     is not affected by the limitations on tort rights and \n     liabilities under this Act.\n       (10) Any person lawfully uninsured under the terms of State \n     law for either personal protection or tort liability \n     insurance retains his or her tort rights in a form unaffected \n     by this Act.\n       (c) Renewal or Cancellation.--An insurer shall not cancel, \n     fail to renew, or increase the premium of its insured solely \n     on account of the insured or any other injured person making \n     a claim for personal protection benefits or, where there is \n     no basis for ascribing fault to the insured or one for whom \n     the insured is vicariously liable, for tort maintenance \n     coverage.\n       (d) Immunity.--No insurer or any agent or employee of such \n     insurer, no insurance producer representing a motor vehicle \n     insurer or any automobile residual market plan, and no \n     attorney licensed to practice law within this State shall be \n     liable in an action for damages on account of an election of \n     the tort liability option, an election of the personal \n     protection option, or a failure to make a required election, \n     unless such person has willfully misrepresented the available \n     choices or has fraudulently induced the election of one \n     system over the other.\n       (e) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed--\n       (1) to waive or affect any defense of sovereign immunity \n     asserted by any State under any law or by the United States;\n       (2) to preempt State choice-of-law rules with respect to \n     claims brought by a foreign nation or a citizen of a foreign \n     nation;\n\n[[Page S6099]]\n\n       (3) to affect the right of any court to transfer venue, to \n     apply the law of a foreign nation, or to dismiss a claim of a \n     foreign nation or of a citizen of a foreign nation on the \n     ground of inconvenient forum;\n       (4) subject to paragraph (1), to create or vest \n     jurisdiction in the district courts of the United States over \n     any motor vehicle accident liability or damages action \n     subject to this Act which is not otherwise properly in the \n     United States District Court;\n       (5) to prevent insurers and insureds from contracting to \n     limit recovery for lost wages and income under personal \n     protection coverage such that only 60 percent or more of lost \n     wages or income is covered, or to offset death benefits under \n     personal protection coverage by amounts paid for lost wages \n     and replacement service losses;\n       (6) to prevent an insurer from contracting with personal \n     protection insureds, as permitted by State law, to have \n     submitted to arbitration any dispute with respect to payment \n     of personal protection benefits;\n       (7) to relieve a motorist of the obligations imposed by \n     State law to purchase tort liability insurance for personal \n     injury to protect third parties who are not affected by the \n     immunities of subsection (b); and\n       (8) to preclude a State from enacting, for all motor \n     vehicle accident cases including cases covered by this Act, a \n     minimum dollar value for defined classes of cases involving \n     death or serious bodily injury.\n\n     SEC. 6.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the current liability system is, all too often, a \n     frustrating experience for many personal injury claimants, \n     resulting in a time-consuming process which provides \n     inadequate compensation for their injuries;\n       (2) for other personal injury claimants, the system can \n     provide a windfall of financial gain, greatly in excess of \n     their actual losses;\n       (3) the unpredictable and erratic system is a product of a \n     perverse incentive structure in which the magnitude of \n     noneconomic damages is directly linked to, and is a multiple \n     of, the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the claimant;\n       (4) the incentives of the litigation system perpetuate the \n     overuse and abuse of the medical system, costing the economy \n     billions of dollars and costing every United States family \n     hundreds of dollars in unnecessary insurance premiums and \n     health care expenses;\n       (5) the system as it has recently developed--\n       (A) is highly regressive;\n       (B) is often duplicative of and inconsistent with Federal \n     regulatory and social welfare programs for the protection of \n     injured parties;\n       (C) is burdened by an administrative cost structure that \n     causes a disproportionate amount of its dollars to go to \n     lawyers rather than to injured parties;\n       (D) is particularly prejudicial to the competitive position \n     of the American small business community;\n       (E) is a major and increasing threat to the economic \n     viability of American cities;\n       (F) imposes a major burden on the American economy and if \n     reformed would significantly enhance American productivity \n     and consumer wealth;\n       (G) is replete with incentives that reward abusive claiming \n     and defensive behavior; and\n       (H) is therefore a major cause of the dangerous disesteem \n     increasingly felt by increasing numbers of Americans toward \n     the legal system and, indeed, the rule of law itself; and\n       (6) there is a need for a system of early offer, rapid \n     recovery and consumer choice to enable claimants to be made \n     whole and recover all economic losses without resort to \n     complex and protracted litigation.\n                TITLE I--EARLY OFFER AND RAPID RECOVERY\n\n     SEC. 101.

Early offer and rapid recovery mechanisms.''.\n                    TITLE II--FAIRNESS IN LEGAL FEES\n\n     SEC. 201. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that contingency fees \n     play a useful and often critical role in ensuring access to \n     counsel and the courts on the part of those who would \n     otherwise be unable to afford such access, but that--\n       (1) personal injury claimants are often subjected to \n     unnecessary costs, delays, and inefficiencies in processing \n     their compensation claims;\n\n[[Page S6101]]\n\n       (2) virtually all such claimants who are represented by \n     attorneys are charged contingent fees;\n       (3) the ethical and legal validity of a contingent fee is \n     dependent upon an attorney undertaking risk in exchange for \n     sharing proportionately in the proceeds of a claim;\n       (4) the perverse incentives of the existing system often \n     encourage and reward defendants who take intransigent \n     settlement positions and otherwise unethically add to the \n     costs and delays of settling meritorious claims for, among \n     other reasons, the purpose of reducing the marginal rates of \n     compensation received by claimants' counsel;\n       (5) many deserving claimants receive inequitable \n     compensation because--\n       (A) such claimants are required to pay attorneys \n     approximately one-third or more of any recovery even when \n     there is little or no issue of liability or damages and \n     therefore little or no assumption of risk by the attorney; \n     and\n       (B) when a defendant or its insurer has made a substantial \n     settlement offer before the attorney's retention or shortly \n     thereafter and the attorney has added little or nothing to \n     the value of the claim to that point, payment of a \n     substantial contingent fee is nonetheless generally required;\n       (6) the current compensation system often fails to provide \n     sufficient financial incentives to effectuate prompt and \n     adequate compensation to deserving claimants, resulting in--\n       (A) delays in adjudications and case settlements often \n     caused by intransigent defendant conduct that the present \n     system perversely rewards and thereby deprives claimants of \n     prompt compensation;\n       (B) a substantial burden on Federal and State courts \n     contributing to very high case backlogs; and\n       (C) regressive cost burdens and substantial avoidable costs \n     imposed on all parties resulting from the long delays in \n     resolving many claims;\n       (7) the current tort compensation system which results in \n     delays in resolving claims and which effectively provides for \n     increased noneconomic damages and, therefore, increased legal \n     fees as medical care costs increase, provides perverse \n     financial incentives for both more intensive and unnecessary \n     use of medical care providers and the fraudulent incurrence \n     of medical care expenses, thereby adding materially to the \n     Nation's health care costs and burdens;\n       (8) delays in resolving claims often result in more \n     intensive and unnecessary use of medical care providers, \n     thereby adding to the Nation's health care burden;\n       (9) the claims process gives rise to substantial, avoidable \n     transaction costs because of the lack of adequate incentives \n     for defendants and their insurers to offer prompt and \n     equitable settlements to meritorious claimants and because \n     claimants' attorneys exact a significant share of any \n     settlement even when their efforts do not generate or augment \n     the settlement offer;\n       (10) contingency fee practices, as described in the \n     preceding paragraphs, expose a clear and impermissible gap \n     between (A) the ethical standards established and promulgated \n     by courts and professed by the Bar, and (B) the actual \n     practices of the Bar;\n       (11) contingency fee practices, as described in the \n     preceding paragraphs, bring substantial disrepute to the Bar \n     and to the legal system as a whole and loss of confidence in \n     the rule of law itself, not the least because they create and \n     expose broad gaps between the stated ethical principles of \n     the legal profession and its real world practices;\n       (12) the inability of the Bar and the courts to curb \n     contingency fee abuses has led to higher settlement costs, \n     lowered compensation to injured persons, excessive medical \n     care costs and delayed claims processing; and\n       (13) there is a need for adopting a procedure to implement \n     appropriate ethical and legal standards and to resolve \n     personal injury claims more fairly and promptly.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are to--\n       (1) enforce more efficiently and effectively ethical \n     standards governing the reasonableness of lawyers' fees and \n     correspondingly to implement the stricter scrutiny that \n     courts are obliged to apply to contingent fees;\n       (2) reverse systemic incentives now in effect so as to \n     reward, and not to penalize, defendants who make substantial \n     early settlement offers;\n       (3) compensate claimants' attorneys more rationally by \n     calculating their compensation in relation to the value of \n     services rendered and risks undertaken;\n       (4) compensate more fairly those seeking redress for \n     injuries by giving them a larger share of promptly achieved \n     settlements;\n       (5) further enhance the likelihood of early settlement of \n     claims by preserving a larger share of early settlement \n     offers for claimants;\n       (6) lower the costs of the personal injury tort \n     compensation system including unnecessary medical and defense \n     costs;\n       (7) remove the burdens on interstate commerce and the \n     Nation's health care programs that are imposed by the current \n     tort compensation system;\n       (8) create a simple, self-enforcing system, controlled by \n     the parties, which forms an early basis for establishing the \n     sums and issues that are in dispute;\n       (9) reduce unworkable burdens now placed on courts and bar \n     grievance boards presently charged with enforcing ethical \n     standards through ex post facto, case-by-case fact finding \n     processes that pose difficult burdens of proof and impose \n     disproportionate transaction costs on both parties and fact \n     finders; and\n       (10) provide alternatives to across-the-board fee cap \n     reforms, which often provide defendants with unearned \n     advantages and further encourage many defendants in unethical \n     protraction of settlement of meritorious claims.\n\n     SEC. 202.

CREATION OF A FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP.\n\n       For purposes of this title, a fiduciary relationship \n     commences when a claimant consults a contingent fee attorney \n     to seek professional services.\n\n     SEC. 204. WRITTEN HOURLY RATE FEE AGREEMENT.\n\n       Contingent fee agreements for the representation of parties \n     with claims shall also include alternate hourly rate fees. If \n     a contingent fee attorney has not entered into a written \n     agreement with claimant at the time of retention setting \n     forth the attorney's hourly rate, then a reasonable hourly \n     rate is payable, subject to the limitations set forth in this \n     title.\n\n     SEC. 205. NATURE OF DEMAND FOR COMPENSATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--At any time after retention, a contingent \n     fee attorney pursuing a claim shall send a demand for \n     compensation by certified mail to an allegedly responsible \n     party, which shall set forth the material facts relevant to \n     the claim including--\n       (1) the name, address, age, marital status, and occupation \n     of claimant, which term for the purposes of this title \n     includes the injured party if claimant is operating in a \n     representative capacity;\n       (2) a brief description of how the injury occurred;\n       (3) the names, and, if known, the addresses, telephone \n     numbers, and occupations of all known witnesses to the \n     injury;\n       (4) copies of photographs in claimant's possession that \n     relate to the injury;\n       (5) the basis for claiming that the party to whom the claim \n     is addressed is at least partially responsible for causing \n     the injury;\n\n[[Page S6102]]\n\n       (6) a description of the nature of the injury, the names \n     and addresses of all physicians, other health care providers, \n     and hospitals, clinics, or other medical service entities \n     that provide medical care to claimant or the injured party \n     including the date and nature of the service;\n       (7) medical records relating to the injury and those \n     involving a prior injury or pre-existing medical condition \n     which an allegedly responsible party would be able to \n     introduce into evidence in a trial or, in lieu of either or \n     both, executed releases authorizing the allegedly responsible \n     party to obtain such records directly from health care \n     providers that produced or possess them; and\n       (8) relevant documentation, including records of earnings \n     if a claimant is self-employed and employer records of \n     earnings if a claimant is employed, or any medical expenses, \n     wages lost, or other pertinent damages suffered as a \n     consequence of the injury.\n       (b) Mailing of Copies.--At the time of the mailing of the \n     demand for compensation, a claimant's attorney shall mail \n     copies of each such demand to the claimant and to every other \n     allegedly responsible party.\n       (c) Limitation on Fee.--A fee received by or contracted for \n     by a contingent fee attorney that exceeds 10 percent of any \n     settlement or judgment received by his or her client after \n     reasonable expenses have been deducted is unreasonable and \n     excessive if the attorney has sent a timely demand for \n     compensation but has omitted information of a material nature \n     that is required by this section which he or she had in his \n     or her possession or which was readily available to him or \n     her at the time of filing.\n\n     SEC. 206. TIME LIMIT FOR, AND REQUISITE CONTENTS OF, RESPONSE \n                   SETTING FORTH SETTLEMENT OFFER.\n\n       (a) Post-Retention Offer.--To qualify its response as a \n     post-retention offer under this title, an allegedly \n     responsible party shall--\n       (1) issue a response stating a settlement offer within 60 \n     days from receipt of a demand for compensation;\n       (2) send the response to claimant's attorney with a copy to \n     claimant;\n       (3) state that the offer is open for acceptance for a \n     minimum of 30 days from the time of its receipt by claimant's \n     attorney and further state whether it expires at the end of \n     this period or remains open for acceptance for a longer \n     period or until notice of withdrawal is given; and\n       (4) include with the offer copies of materials in its or \n     its attorney's possession concerning the alleged injury upon \n     which the allegedly responsible party relied in making the \n     settlement offer except material that such party or its \n     attorney believes in good faith would not be discoverable by \n     claimant during the course of litigation.\n     If reproduction costs under paragraph (4) would be \n     significant relative to the size of the offer, the allegedly \n     responsible party may, in the alternative, offer other forms \n     of access to the materials convenient and at reasonable cost \n     to claimant's attorney.\n       (b) Time Limitations.--If within 30 days of receipt of a \n     claimant's demand for compensation an allegedly responsible \n     party notifies an unrepresented claimant or a claimant's \n     attorney that it seeks to have a medical examination of \n     claimant, and claimant is not made available for such \n     examination within 10 days of receipt of the request, the \n     time herein provided for issuing a response is extended by 1 \n     day for each day that the request is not honored after the \n     expiration of 10 days from the date of the request. Any such \n     extension also includes a further period of 10 days from the \n     date of the completion of the medical examination.\n       (c) Increase in Offer.--The settlement offer may be \n     increased during the 60-day period set forth in subsection \n     (a)(1) by issuing an additional offer stating that the time \n     for acceptance is 10 days after receipt of the additional \n     offer by claimant's attorney or 30 days from receipt of the \n     initial response, whichever is longer, unless the additional \n     response specifies a longer period of time for acceptance as \n     set forth in subsection (a)(3).\n\n     SEC. 207. CONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE TO INCLUDE PRESCRIBED \n                   MATERIAL WITH SETTLEMENT OFFER.\n\n       (a) In General.--If an allegedly responsible party or its \n     attorney willfully fails to include the material required by \n     section 206(a)(4) with a response stating a settlement offer \n     or does not otherwise make such material available--\n       (1) a claimant may revoke its acceptance of such settlement \n     offer within 2 years of having accepted it; and\n       (2) any fees and costs reasonably incurred by a claimant in \n     revoking its acceptance of such settlement offer and \n     reinstating its claim is recoverable from the allegedly \n     responsible party, including the losses suffered by a \n     claimant who is precluded from reinstating its claim by \n     operation of a statute of limitations.\n       (b) Sanctions for Party.--Willful failure of an allegedly \n     responsible party to comply with section 206(a)(4) shall \n     subject such party to the sanctions applicable to a party who \n     fails to comply with requests for the production of \n     documents.\n       (c) Sanctions for Attorney.--Willful failure of an attorney \n     for an allegedly responsible party to comply with section \n     206(a)(4) shall subject that attorney to the same sanctions \n     applicable to attorneys who improperly counsel their clients \n     not to produce documents for which there has been a discovery \n     request.\n\n     SEC. 208. NO OBLIGATION TO ISSUE RESPONSE; INADMISSIBILITY OF \n                   DEMANDS, RESPONSES, AND FAILURE TO RESPOND.\n\n       (a) No Obligation To Respond.--Nothing in this title \n     imposes on an allegedly responsible party an obligation to \n     issue a response to a demand for compensation.\n       (b) Inadmissibility of Offer.--Demands for compensation, \n     early settlement offers, or the failure of an allegedly \n     responsible party to issue same, are inadmissible in any \n     subsequent litigation, proceeding, or arbitration, to the \n     extent that evidence of settlement negotiations is \n     inadmissible in the jurisdiction where the case is brought.\n\n     SEC. 209. EFFECT OF PRE-DEMAND SETTLEMENT OFFER.\n\n       A settlement offer to an injured party represented by a \n     contingent fee counsel made before receipt of a demand for \n     compensation, which is open for acceptance for 60 days or \n     more from the time of its receipt and which conforms to the \n     requirements of section 206, is deemed a post-retention offer \n     and has the same effect under this title as if it were a \n     response to a demand for compensation.\n\n     SEC. 210. PRE-RETENTION OFFER.\n\n       (a) Prohibition of Percentage Fee of Pre-Retention Offer.--\n     It is a violation of this title for an attorney retained \n     after claimant has received a pre-retention offer to enter \n     into an agreement with claimant to receive a contingent fee \n     based upon or payable from the proceeds of the pre-retention \n     offer, provided that the pre-retention offer remains in \n     effect or is renewed until the time has elapsed for issuing a \n     response containing a settlement offer as defined under \n     section 206.\n       (b) Unreasonable and Excessive Fee.--An attorney entering \n     into a fee agreement that would effectively result in payment \n     of a percentage of a pre-retention offer to a claimant has \n     charged an unreasonable and excessive fee.\n       (c) Presumptive Reasonable Fee.--An attorney who contracts \n     with a claimant for a reasonable hourly rate or a reasonable \n     fixed fee, or who is paid such a fee for advising claimant \n     regarding the fairness of the pre-retention offer, has \n     charged a presumptively reasonable fee.\n\n     SEC. 211. POST-RETENTION OFFER WHEN A PRE-RETENTION OFFER HAS \n                   BEEN MADE.\n\n       (a) Reasonable Fee Based on Hourly Fee.--A fee paid or \n     contracted to be paid to a contingent fee attorney by a \n     claimant who has rejected a pre-retention offer and who later \n     accepts a post-retention offer of a greater amount is an \n     unreasonable and excessive fee unless it is an hourly rate \n     fee that does not exceed 25 percent of the excess of the \n     post-retention offer over the pre-retention offer.\n       (b) Reasonable Fee Based on Percentage.--If the accepted \n     post-retention offer is less than the pre-retention offer, a \n     total fee for all services rendered that is greater than 10 \n     percent of the first $100,000 of the post-retention offer \n     plus 5 percent of any amount that exceeds $100,000 after all \n     reasonable expenses have been deducted is an unreasonable and \n     excessive fee.\n\n     SEC. 212. POST-RETENTION OFFER WHEN NO PRE-RETENTION OFFER \n                   HAS BEEN MADE.\n\n       A fee paid or contracted to be paid to a contingent fee \n     attorney by a claimant who has not received a pre-retention \n     offer and who has accepted a post-retention offer is an \n     unreasonable and excessive fee unless it is an hourly rate \n     fee that does not exceed 10 percent of the first $100,000 of \n     the offer plus 5 percent of any amount that exceeds $100,000 \n     after all reasonable expenses have been deducted.\n\n     SEC. 213. CALCULATION OF ATTORNEY'S FEE WHEN THERE IS A \n                   SUBSEQUENT RESOLUTION OF THE CLAIM.\n\n       Irrespective of any pre-retention offer, the provisions of \n     section 212 regarding maximum allowable fees remain in effect \n     if a post-retention offer is not accepted by claimant within \n     the time provided by this title. Contingent fees are \n     unreasonable and excessive unless charged against the \n     difference between an unaccepted post-retention offer and the \n     judgment or settlement ultimately obtained by claimant. When \n     such judgment or settlement is lower than the unaccepted \n     offer, the fee limitations of section 212 apply against the \n     judgment or settlement.\n\n     SEC. 214. PROVISION OF CLOSING STATEMENT.\n\n       Upon receipt of any settlement or judgment, and prior to \n     disbursement thereof, a contingent fee attorney shall provide \n     claimant with a written statement detailing how the proceeds \n     are to be distributed, including the amount of the expenses \n     paid out or to be paid out of the proceeds, the amount of the \n     fee, how the fee amount is calculated, and the amount due \n     claimant.\n\n     SEC. 215. EFFECT OF CONTRAVENING AGREEMENTS.\n\n       (a) Violation.--A contingent fee attorney who charges a fee \n     that contravenes this title has charged an unreasonable and \n     excessive fee.\n       (b) Excessive and Unreasonable Fees.--If the fee violates \n     subsection (a), then it is also excessive and unreasonable to \n     the extent that it has not been reduced by any reasonable \n     fees and costs incurred by claimant in establishing that the \n     fee agreement contravened this title.\n       (c) Unenforceable Fee Agreements.--Fee agreements between \n     claimants and contingent fee attorneys who have charged fees \n     defined under this title as unreasonable or excessive are \n     illegal and unenforceable except to the extent provided in \n     this title.\n\n     SEC. 216. INAPPLICABILITY.\n\n       (a) Evaluations and Collections.--Except for the provisions \n     of section 203, nothing in\n\n[[Page S6103]]\n\n     this title applies to an agreement between a claimant and an \n     attorney to retain the attorney--\n       (1) on an hourly rate fee or fixed fee basis solely to \n     evaluate a pre-retention offer; or\n       (2) to collect overdue amounts from an accepted pre-\n     retention or post-retention settlement offer.\n       (b) Agreements in Which Certain Offers Not Made.--The \n     provisions of this title prohibiting the charging of \n     contingency fees in the absence of assuming meaningful risk \n     and defining reasonable and unreasonable fees, shall have no \n     effect on contingent fee agreements in cases in which neither \n     a pre-retention nor a post-retention offer of settlement is \n     made.\n       (c) Motor Vehicle Accidental Bodily Injury.--(1) This title \n     shall not apply to accidental bodily injury caused by the \n     operation or the use of a motor vehicle in claims in which an \n     uninsured motorist or personal protection insured is \n     involved.\n       (2) For purposes of this subsection the term ``operation or \n     use''--\n       (A) means operation or use of a motor vehicle as a motor \n     vehicle, including, incident to its operation or use as a \n     vehicle, the occupation of the vehicle;\n       (B) does not cover conduct within the course of a business \n     of manufacturing, selling, or maintaining a motor vehicle, \n     including repairing, servicing, washing, loading, or \n     unloading; and\n       (C) does not include such conduct not within the course of \n     such a business unless such conduct occurs while occupying a \n     motor vehicle.\n           TITLE III--APPLICABILITY AND RULE OF CONSTRUCTION\n\n     SEC. 301. APPLICABILITY TO STATES; CHOICE OF LAW; \n                   JURISDICTION; AND CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       (a) Applicability to States.--Title I or II of this Act \n     shall not apply in a State if such State enacts a statute \n     that--\n       (1) cites the authority of this subsection; and\n       (2) declares the election of such State that the title \n     shall not apply.\n       (b) Choice of Law.--In disputes between citizens of States \n     that elect nonapplicability under subsection (a) and citizens \n     of States that do not so elect, ordinary choice of law \n     principles shall apply.\n       (c) Jurisdiction.--This section shall not confer \n     jurisdiction on the district courts of the United States \n     under section 1331 or 1337 or title 28, United States Code.\n       (d) Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall alter or \n     diminish the authority or obligation of the Federal courts to \n     construe the terms of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 302. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            Summary of Dole-McConnell Legal Reform Proposals\n\n\n                    1. ``Choice'' in Auto Insurance\n\n       The principal feature of this proposal is the unbundling of \n     economic losses and non-economic (``pain & suffering'') \n     losses and enabling individuals to self-insure for non-\n     economic losses.\n       Without changing substantive state law of negligence, the \n     proposal would offer drivers two choices for motor vehicle \n     insurance:\n       a. Traditional tort coverage--the injured collects against \n     his/her own policy for economic and non-economic losses, upon \n     a showing that another party was at fault, pursuant to \n     relevant state law. If the injured's economic losses exceed \n     his/her policy limits, the injured will be able to sue the \n     negligent party for those remaining losses and to collect a \n     reasonable attorney's fee; or\n       b. Personal Injury Protection--the injured collects against \n     his/her policy for economic losses, regardless of fault. As \n     in the traditional tort coverage, if the injured's economic \n     loses exceed his/her policy limits, the injured will be able \n     to sue the negligent party for remaining economic losses, \n     including a reasonable attorney's fee.\n       In all cases of intentional injury or injury that occurs as \n     a result of drug or alcohol use, the injured retains the \n     ability to sue for both economic and non-economic losses in \n     accordance with applicable state law.\n       The Joint Economic Committee estimates that this proposal \n     will save consumers $40 billion annually in reduced premiums \n     for automobile insurance.\n\n\n                        2. Contingent Fee Reform\n\n       This provision limits traditional contingent fee \n     arrangements in order to ensure that more of the proceeds of \n     a settlement or award will more often go to the insured \n     party.\n       First, an attorney would be required to offer all clients \n     an hourly rate and an hourly rate is presumed, if the \n     attorney does not have a specific contingent fee agreement.\n       Where an injured party hires a lawyer to evaluate a \n     settlement offer (pre-retention offer), the attorney is \n     prohibited from receiving a percentage of the offer. The \n     attorney may collect an hourly fee or a fixed fee.\n       In a case where an injured party retains a lawyer to engage \n     in settlement negotiations on his behalf, and the injured \n     party accepts a settlement offer, the lawyer is restricted to \n     a fee of 10% of the first $100,000 and 5% of amounts above \n     $10,000, after all reasonable expenses have been deducted.\n       If the settlement offer is not accepted and the case goes \n     to trial, the lawyer may take a contingent only out of that \n     portion of the award which exceeds the settlement offer. If \n     the judgment is lower than the settlement offer, then the \n     lawyer's fee is limited to the 10%/5% formula above.\n\n\n                     3. early offer/rapid recovery\n\n       This provision, originally sponsored a decade ago by \n     Congressmen Richard Gephardt and Henson Moore, will encourage \n     an injured individual to receive an offer of full \n     compensation for economic losses, including future losses, \n     without a lawsuit. In order to encourage this offer, an \n     injured individual will be required, in making a claim \n     against the allegedly responsible party, to provide all \n     relevant information, including medical records. The \n     allegedly responsible party will have 120 days to provide \n     such economic compensation (the time may be extended by the \n     claimant), and the allegedly responsible party can verify the \n     information, including requesting the injured to get a \n     medical examination.\n       The claimant retains the right to reject such early offer \n     and may sue to recover all losses. However, noneconomic \n     losses, including any punitive damages may only be recovered \n     if the injured party proves, by clear and convincing \n     evidence, that the injury was caused intentionally or by \n     wanton misconduct.\n       In the event of more than one responsible party, relative \n     fault and proportionate contribution will be assessed by an \n     arbitrator.\n       And, the states can establish a minimum payment for serious \n     bodily injury (for example, a loss of a limb which may not \n     result in significant economic losses) that will have to be \n     paid to the injured party under early offer.\n       To satisfy the federalism concerns raised by some, the bill \n     will allow states to ``opt out'' of any of these \n     provisions.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DASCHLE:\n  S. 1863. A bill to require the Secretary of the Army to acquire \npermanent flowage and saturation easements over land that is located \nwithin the 10-year flood plain of the James River, SD, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                   easement acquisitions legislation\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, since 1993 the James River has flooded \nnearly 3 million acres of valuable farmland in my State resulting in \nbillions of dollars of lost revenue for South Dakota producers and \ngreatly diminishing the value of their land by washing away valuable \ntop soil.\n  Clearly, the extreme wet conditions of the last 4 years have \ncontributed to these floods. However, Mother Nature does not bear sole \nresponsibility for the flooding. The problem has been affected by the \nJames River management policy of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n  For producers to be asked to continue to bear these losses is unfair \nand unacceptable. Downstream landowners in South Dakota should not be \nrequired to accept financial losses directly influenced by the corps' \nriver management policy.\n  Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that will provide \nlandowners along the James River with a measure of security against \nfuture high water flows and help ensure that the Federal Government \nassumes greater responsibility for the damaging effects of its river \nmanagement policies. This bill gives the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nauthority to purchase from willing sellers easements over land that is \nlocated within the 10-year flood plain of the James River. Local \nproducers who wish to grant these easements not only will be reimbursed \nfor the loss of productivity on their flooded land, but also will \nretain their haying and grazing rights. Thus, the land will continue to \nprovide value to farmers in relatively dry years. Those who do not wish \nto grant the corps these easements will be under no obligation to do \nso.\n  This legislation will provide some relief to landowners affected by \nthe frequent flooding of the James River in South Dakota and represents \npart of the long-term solution to this troublesome problem. However, \nthe overall management of the Jamestown Dam also needs to be examined, \nand I will continue to urge the corps to take seriously the concerns of \nSouth Dakotans as the operations manual for that dam is written.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1863\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S6104]]\n\n     SECTION 1. ACQUISITION OF EASEMENTS OVER LAND NEAR JAMES \n                   RIVER, SOUTH DAKOTA.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Army shall acquire, \n     from willing sellers, permanent flowage and saturation \n     easements over land that is located within the 10-year \n     floodplain of the James River, South Dakota.\n       (b) Scope.--\n       (1) In general.--The easements acquired by the Secretary of \n     the Army under subsection (a) shall include the right, power, \n     and privilege of the Federal Government to submerge, \n     overflow, percolate, and saturate the surface and subsurface \n     of the land and such other terms and conditions as the \n     Secretary of the Army considers appropriate.\n       (2) Haying and grazing.--The Secretary of the Army shall \n     permit haying and grazing on the land subject to the \n     easements.\n       (c) Payment.--In acquiring the easements under subsection \n     (a), the Secretary of the Army shall pay an amount based on \n     the unaffected fee value of the land subject to the \n     easements. For the purpose of this subsection, the unaffected \n     fee value of the land is the value that the land would have \n     if the land were unaffected by rising ground water and \n     surface flooding associated with the James River.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section $40,000,000, to \n     remain available until expended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6082-4", "month": "06", "year":

Mr. President, Saturday, June 15, marks the \nsesquicentennial of the Oregon Treaty, which extended the domain of the \nUnited States across lands that make up my home State of Oregon and the \nStates of Washington and Idaho. With the ratification of this treaty, \nthe United States for the first time spanned the American continent, \nfrom sea to shining sea. Nevertheless, this treaty is more than just a \nsignificant chapter in our young Nation's westward expansion. It also \nrepresents--perhaps more importantly--the victory of peace and \ncompromise over ill will and nationalistic fervor.\n  On June 15, 1846, when the representatives of the British Crown and \nthe United States signed the Oregon Treaty, the two nations concluded a \nlong-standing but uneasy truce over the disposition of the Oregon \ncountry, the area bounded by the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Ocean \non the east and west, and Russian North America and Mexico on the north \nand south. Previously, a joint-occupation convention signed by Great \nBritain and the United States in 1818 and renewed in 1827 guaranteed \nboth nations' citizens free and equal access to the Oregon country. \nTrappers and traders of the British Hudson's Bay Company and settlers \nfrom the United States navigated the same rivers and used the same \nresources, without common allegiance or uniform system of law. Charles \nH. Carey's ``General History of Oregon'' offers the definitive \ndescription of this era, during which conflicts between British \nsubjects and the Hudson's Bay Company on the one hand and American \ncitizens on the other sometimes flared--and did so ever more frequently \nas thousands of American settlers followed the Oregon Trail into the \nregion beginning in 1843.\n  Throughout the United States, public sentiment flared as well. \nIndignation at the continuing British presence on Western American soil \nand concern for the rights of the United States citizens there \ncompelled private individuals and politicians alike to demand the \nwithdrawal of Britain from the Oregon country. On February 22, 1839, \nSenator Lewis Linn of Missouri exhorted this body to rush to the \ndefense of Oregon settlers by annexing the Oregon country, saying, \n``Great Britain through the medium of the Hudson's Bay Company, has \nopened a trade with all the tribes of Indians on the western slope of \nthe Rocky Mountains, as far south as the Gulf of California. Their \nhunters and trappers have penetrated all the valleys and glens of the \nRocky Mountains, scattering arms, munitions of war, and fomenting \ndiscontent against the United States in the bosoms of those distant \nIndian tribes. They have driven our people from the Indian trade, which \nyielded seven or eight hundred thousand dollars per annum, and even \npushed their operations east.\n\n  In this increasingly volatile atmosphere, the Democratic presidential \nconvention of 1844 nominated former Tennessee Governor James K. Polk, \ndespite his relative obscurity on the national stage. Polk won the \ngeneral election against the much more prominent Whig, Henry Clay of \nKentucky, by capitalizing on the expansionist mood of the country. Polk \nproudly invoked the United States' manifest destiny to span North \nAmerica and ran on the famous campaign slogans ``All of Oregon'' and \n``54-40 or fight!'', arguing that the United States should go to war \nwith Britain if she did not withdraw entirely and absolutely from the \nOregon country.\n  Once Polk entered the White House, there was substantial political \npressure to honor his fiery campaign rhetoric. By 1845, as Charles \nCarey described in his seminal study, the Oregon country was welcoming \nnew American settlers at a dizzying rate--and with each one, the need \nfor a common government increased. In addition, several influential \nMembers of Congress, including Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan--who was \nfavored over James Polk as the expansionists' candidate going into the \n1844 Democratic presidential convention--were loudly advocating \nBritain's immediate withdrawal from the region.\n  Another factor also invited President Polk to assume a relatively \nbelligerent posture with Britain. Numerous attempts by previous \nadministrations to compromise with Britain over a permanent boundary \nhad failed due to British demands for all the lands north of the 45th \nparallel, including the Columbia River. Despite contentions that the \nUnited States' contiguity with the Oregon country gave it natural title \nto the region up to the 54th parallel, Presidents James Monroe and John \nQuincy Adams had offered both to settle the boundary at the 49th \nparallel and to permit British vessels free and equal navigation of the \ngreat Columbia River. As Polk's Secretary of State, James Buchanan, \nadvised his chief negotiator with the Crown, Louis McLane, in \ncorrespondence dated July 12, 1845, British negotiators flatly rejected \nthis offer on three different occasions (in 1818, 1824, and 1827).\n  Thus it was that, when his administration began anew to seek a \nboundary settlement with the British, President Polk confronted a \ndilemma. British negotiators had shown repeatedly that they were \nuninterested in a compromise--but if the president succumbed to \npolitical pressure to annex all of Oregon he risked a western war with \nBritain just as America's recent annexation of Texas was threatening to \nignite a southern war with Mexico.\n  In response to this dilemma, the Polk administration exercised the \nself-restraint, caution, and peaceful spirit of compromise in \ninternational relations of which the Oregon Treaty endures as a lasting \nreminder. President Polk instructed his Secretary of State, James \nBuchanan, to offer once more the compromise border of the 49th \nparallel. This time, however, President Polk refused to offer British \nships free navigation of the Columbia; instead, he invited Britain to \ntake whatever lands and ports she desired on Vancouver Island that were \nsouth of the 49th parallel. Once again, the British negotiators refused \nthe compromise. President Polk then withdrew the offer, indicating that \nthe onus was therefore on the British to draft their own compromise. To \nensure that one was indeed forthcoming, the president called, in his \nfirst State of the Union Address--on December 2, 1845--for Congress to \nsupport him in giving Britain 12 months' notice that the Joint-\nOccupation Convention of 1827 was to be abrogated and nullified. \nCongress obliged, passing a joint resolution to that effect on April \n27, 1846.\n  The United States' move to vacate the Joint-Occupation Convention \nsuccessfully inspired in the British a conciliatory and cooperative \nspirit--without imperiling the peace that existed in the Oregon \ncountry. On June 6, 1946, Richard Pakenham, the British minister \nplenipotentiary, offered a proposal almost identical to President \nPolk's and transmitted it to him through Secretary of State James \nBuchanan. In accordance with the constitutional requirement that all \ntreaties are negotiated with the advice and consent of this body, \nPresident Polk conveyed the proposal to the Senate on June 10. On June \n12, the Senate voted 38-12 to advise the President to accept the \nBritish offer.\n  One hundred and fifty years ago this Saturday, Secretary of State \nJames Buchanan affixed his signature to the Oregon Treaty. With this \nstroke of a pen, the administration of James Knox Polk peacefully \nsecured for our young Nation the fruits of its manifest destiny--and \nmade Oregon a great and lasting tribute to the power of cooperation and \ncompromise.\n\n[[Page S6107]]\n\n\n\n                    ALABAMA ``TEACHER OF THE YEAR''\n\n Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one \nof Alabama's most outstanding teachers. Harriet Tyler, a sixth-grade \nteacher at Springwood School in Lanett, AL, was recently selected as \nTeacher of the Year for the State of Alabama by the Alabama Independent \nSchool Association.\n  Harriet Tyler--a native of Decatur, AL, and a graduate of Butler High \nSchool--has influenced the lives of countless elementary students since \nshe graduated from Auburn University in 1965.

General Cisneros is retiring after a \ndistinguished 35-year military career in the U.S. Army.\n  Marc Cisneros entered the military in 1961 after graduating as an \nROTC distinguished military cadet from St. Mary's University, in San \nAntonio, TX. He was commissioned a 2d Lt. in the field artillery and \nhas faithfully and selflessly served his country in a wide array of \ndemanding command and staff assignments within the continental United \nStates and overseas. Most notable was his assignment as Commanding \nGeneral, U.S. Army South and Joint Task Force, Panama, during Operation \nJust Cause. During Operation Just Cause, General Cisneros played a \nsignificant role in the combat operations in Panama and helped \nnegotiate the capture and surrender of Panamanian General Noriega. \nBesides this action, General Cisneros served two combat tours in \nVietnam.\n  This officer has risen through the ranks emphasizing military \nreadiness and displaying a genuine compassion for soldiers and their \nfamilies. Marc Cisneros has been a caring leader committed to the \nvalues and ideals that have made this country and its military so \ngreat.\n  His final assignment was as Commanding General, 5th U.S. Army, Fort \nSam Houston, TX. In this most important position, Marc Cisneros \nprovided vision, enforced standards of excellence, and committed \nhimself to helping sustain the readiness of the Nation's reserve \ncomponent forces.\n  Mr. President, our Nation owes a debt of gratitude to Lt. Gen. Marc \nA. Cisneros, and I am honored to recognize him today. With our deepest \nappreciation, the United States of America says thank you. I wish him, \nand his wife Eddy and their children, continued success and happiness \nin all future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6107-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    COMMEMORATING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF GUYANA\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the nation \nof Guyana as it celebrates its 30th year as a sovereign nation, and to \npay tribute to the citizens of this nation whose dedication to their \ncountry enabled Guyana to develop from a small colony to an independent \nnation.\n  Guyana was a Dutch colony from 1621 until it eventually came under \nthe influence of the British who acquired formal possession in 1814. \nWhile still under British control, Guyana obtained its first \nconstitution in 1928, although universal franchise was not recognized \nuntil much later in 1953. From 1957 until 1966 the People's Progressive \nParty was elected and controlled Guyana under a system of internal self \nrule.\n  In 1965, the British Guiana Independence Conference met in London to \nthe authorize a new constitution. When ratified on May 26, 1966, the \nnew constitution marked the beginning of the independent nation of \nGuyana.\n  Throughout its years as both a Dutch and British colony, Guyana \nbecame home to workers from many different lands. With a population of \n739,553, Guyana is comprised primarily of East Indians and people of \nAfrican descent. Guyana is also home to native South Americans as well \nas citizens of Chinese and European heritage.\n  Guyana was one of the founding members of the Caribbean Free Trade \nArea [CARIFTA] which was established in 1968. Guyana has been called \nthe bread basket of the Caribbean because it is blessed with many \nnatural resources and the potential for a strong economy. Guyana is \ndually blessed with both natural resources and a vibrant and diverse \npeople. These attributes ensure that in the years to come this young \ncountry will grow into a leader in its part of the world.\n  Today, I rise to offer my congratulations to Guyana on the \nanniversary of its independence as a sovereign nation. The future of \nGuyana has never looked brighter. New Jersey's multi-cultural heritage \nhas benefited from citizens from Guyana. I congratulate its citizens on \ntheir perseverance and potential, and extend my best wishes for \ncontinued success as an independent nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6107-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6107-S6108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF SALINE, MI AND THE TOWN OF BRECON, \n                         WALES AS SISTER CITIES\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 30th \nanniversary of the successful partnership of the city of Saline, MI, \nand the town of Brecon, Wales in the Sister Cities Program.\n  Thirty-years ago next month, under the People-to-People Program \nestablished by President Eisenhower, a bond was forged between these \ntwo communities. In the words of Saline Mayor Patrick J. Little, ``We \nhave become one community separated by a large body of water. Over two \ngenerations have had the pleasure of learning about each other's \nculture.''\n  To celebrate this occasion, next month approximately 50 members of \nthe Brecon community will visit Saline, the highlight of which will be \nthe first ever Celtic Festival on July 6. I would like to extend a warm \nwelcome to our visitors from Brecon, and congratulate the citizens of \nboth cities for their three decades of cooperation and \nfriendship.\n\n\n                   A CASE AGAINST INDEPENDENT COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr President, I supported the creation of the office of \nindependent counsel and have voted for its reauthorization.\n  I am now convinced that is the wrong way to solve this particular \nproblem.\n  My judgment is that we should look at the office of Attorney General \nwith great care when a nomination is made. And if the nominee is too \nclose, in any way, to the President, that nomination should be \nrejected.\n  And if the nominee has been active in political life beyond the \nnormal type of engagement, that should be weighed. Such a person should \nnot automatically be rejected, but there should be ample evidence that \nthe person will serve with honor.\n  An ideal type of arrangement was when Ed Levi was chosen as Attorney \nGeneral by President Gerald Ford. No one for a moment thought that the \nman who left as president of the University of Chicago to become \nAttorney General could be politically manipulated by the President, \neven if the President wanted to do that.\n  My impression is that Janet Reno is made of the same stuff and that \nher appointment was a good appointment.\n  When I was sounded out about John F. Kennedy appointing Bobby Kennedy \nas Attorney General I indicated to Bob Wallace, the Kennedy staff \nperson who asked me about it, that I thought it was a mistake because \nthe Attorney General should not be too close to the President. As it \nturned out, Bobby Kennedy did a good job as Attorney General, but as a \nprecedent it was not good.\n  In the same way, Ed Meese was much too close personally and \npolitically to Ronald Reagan to serve the Nation as effectively as he \nmight have as Attorney General.\n\n[[Page S6108]]\n\n  The Chicago Tribune had an editorial recently titled, ``A Case \nAgainst Independent Counsel.''\n  Their conclusion is that we should simply do away with the law.\n  I reluctantly believe their conclusion is correct.\n  But it will be correct only to the extent that we assure the American \npublic that the Attorney General is of an independent bent. It may even \nbe that we should appoint an Attorney General for a period of 10 years, \nsubject to removal from office under conditions that are carefully \nspelled out in the law prior to ending that 10-year period.\n  But the Chicago Tribune editorial contains words that we should \nreflect on.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the article from the Chicago Tribune be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                   A Case Against Independent Counsel\n\n       Remember Sam Pierce?\n       That's OK. Ronald Reagan didn't remember him either, even \n     when Pierce was serving in his cabinet as secretary of \n     Housing and Urban Development. (Reagan once greeted him in a \n     receiving line as ``Mr. Mayor'').\n       Pierce and Reagan have been gone from Washington for almost \n     eight years, but the effects of their presence continue to be \n     felt. In Pierce's case, they are felt less in policy than in \n     the work of an independent counsel, or special prosecutor, \n     who is said to be tidying up loose ends in a probe of abuses \n     and mismanagement in Pierce's agency during the Reagan years.\n       As of the end of March, this investigation had resulted in \n     17 convictions of former high-level officials and the \n     associates to whom they steered contracts or directed favors. \n     The most prominent of those convicted was James Watt, the \n     blunt former secretary of the Interior in the Reagan \n     administration, who in January pleaded guilty to attempting \n     to mislead the grand jury in the HUD investigation. He was \n     sentenced to five years of probation, 500 hours of community \n     service and a $5,000 fine.\n       To obtain these results, the independent counsel has run up \n     a tab of almost $21 million--an average of $1.2 million per \n     conviction. That's offset somewhat by the $2 million in fines \n     and $10 million in recovered HUD funds. But even so, the \n     pursuit of justice in the HUD case has been an extremely \n     costly affair.\n       The HUD probe is not even the most expensive by an \n     independent counsel. Lawrence Walsh's Iran-contra \n     investigation cost more than $40 million. Kenneth Starr's \n     Whitewater probe bids fair to become the most expensive \n     ever--by one estimate it already has cost $25 million. \n     Altogether, special counsels have cost the taxpayers $100 \n     million over the last 10 years.\n       This mounting expense, for results whose value more and \n     more members of Congress consider dubious at best, has \n     inspired a questioning of the independent counsel law that \n     arguments from principle could not.\n       The logic behind the law (formally, the Ethics in \n     Government Act) is simple and seems unassailable: When high-\n     level officials in an administration are accused of serious \n     breaches of the public trust, it takes an independent \n     outsider to conduct a credible investigation. There is a \n     built-in conflict of interest that makes it impossible for \n     the normal Justice Department processes to work. Without a \n     law, the president cannot be counted on to permit an \n     independent investigation of his administration.\n       The only problem with this logic is that in the long scope \n     of U.S. history, it has not been shown to be true. Most \n     Justice Department officials and prosecutors behave \n     honorably. In the one great historical instance in which the \n     Justice Department's integrity was in serious question--\n     Watergate--overwhelming political pressure forced President \n     Richard Nixon to yield and accept an independent counsel.\n       An independent counsel law is a source of permanent \n     temptation to political mischief. The Democrats in Congress \n     used it to bludgeon the Reagan and Bush administrations. \n     Now--after the Democrats insisted on renewing the law in Bill \n     Clinton's first year in office--the Republicans are using it \n     to bludgeon the Clinton administration. No fewer than four \n     independent counsels are at work investigating issues from \n     Whitewater to whether Henry Cisneros lied to the FBI about \n     how much money he gave his former mistress.\n       As the figures on the HUD investigation suggest, \n     independent counsels operate with none of the budget \n     constraints that fetter ordinary prosecutors. And they can \n     pursue their quarry indefinitely, meaning that individuals \n     can remain under threat of prosecution for years, with \n     devastating effects on their families, fortunes, careers and \n     psyches. That's not fair.\n       Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) and Rep. Jay Dickey (R-Ark.) each \n     have proposed legislation to reduce the powers of independent \n     counsels and make them more accountable to Congress.\n       Better that they should simply do away with the law. As the \n     Nixon case demonstrates, when a president's behavior \n     threatens the very constitutional order, the public will \n     demand an independent counsel. Absent such an outrage, it's \n     best to let normal legal processes work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6107-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO COOPER TOOLS/NICHOLSON FILE\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, the National Association of State \nDirectors of Vocational Technical Education Consortium recently \nrecognized Cooper Tools/Nicholson File of Cullman, AL, for their \ncommitment to vocational education. I, too, would like to commend \nCooper Tools/Nicholson File for their exemplary contributions to the \ncommunity of Cullman, AL, in regards to vocational training. If I may, \nMr. President, I would like to briefly outline some of the innovative \nprojects Cooper Tools/Nicholson File has initiated.\n  In 1985, Nicholson File helped the Cullman County Area Vocational \nCenter take a giant leap toward educational excellence by adopting the \nschool as its partner. As the first step, the company donated to the \nschool hand tools and power equipment worth more than $254,000.\n  In addition, Nicholson File began a scholarship program for \nvocational students to attend Wallace State Community College. To date, \n24 students have attended the college, using gifts totaling $48,000.\n  In 1986, Cooper Tools initiated Project PACE--Partnership To Aid \nCareer Education. Project PACE gave selected vocational schools an \nunrestricted grant of $10,000 each for teacher development and \nrecognition, student incentives and recognition, curriculum improvement \nor new technology, or community outreach. A national panel chose three \nschools to receive additional PACEsetter Awards totaling $50,000. \nCullman County Area Vocational Center won an additional grant of \n$25,000 for a student recognition/scholarship program. In 1995, the \nschool won a $20,000 award for curriculum improvement.\n  ComSAVE, another collaborative venture between the school and \nNicholson File was instrumental in the implementation of the tech prep \ninitiative in Cullman County. Other efforts have led to new programs, \nincluding CAD and Computer Electronics.\n  As you can see, Mr. President, Cooper Tools/Nicholson File has taken \na very proactive approach in regards to vocational education. Cooper \nTools/Nicholson File is setting a standard which I hope others will \nemulate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6108-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6108-S6109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE RUSH TO GULP U.S. RADIO STATIONS\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, some of my colleagues may remember that \nwhen the new telecommunications law was before the Senate, I offered an \namendment to limit the expansion of radio station ownership by any one \ncorporation or any one individual.\n  That amendment was tabled by a vote of 64 to 34.\n  The other day I read an article by Prof. Jerry Landay, former \nbroadcast journalist, who now teaches at the University of Illinois. \nThe article appeared in the Christian Science Monitor under the title. \n``The Rush To Gulp U.S. Radio Stations.''\n  I ended up voting against the bill even though I know there were some \ngood things in it.\n  But diversity in ownership is good for all the media. I don't like \nthe concentration of ownership that is taking place in newspapers, but \nthat is not a federally regulated entity.\n  Radio stations and television stations are federally regulated, and \nwe have every right to demand diversity of ownership and not \nmonopolistic or oligarchical practices.\n  I ask that the Jerry Landay article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n           [From the Christian Science Monitor, May 7, 1996]\n\n                   The Rush to Gulp US Radio Stations\n\n                          (By Jerry M. Landay)\n\n       The surface glamour faded long ago from radio. But \n     Americans keep as many as five or six sets in the house and \n     use them regularly. Don Imus, Rush Limbaugh, and Garrison \n     Keillor remind us that television hasn't stripped all the \n     glory from the medium or its revenues--Totaling $11.5 billion \n     in 1995.\n       The radio stations that CBS owns--39 of them--grossed a \n     half-billion dollars last year. Like the printing presses in \n     the Federal Mint, commercial radio stations in America churn \n     out cash in prodigious amounts. Returns of 40 to 50 percent \n     yearly are not uncommon.\n       Multibillion-dollar mergers and acquisitions in the \n     telephone and television-based\n\n[[Page S6109]]\n\n     industries spawned by the new telecommunications law have \n     stolen our eye from the land rush now under way in Radioland. \n     A vast consolidation of ownership has begun among America's \n     10,000 commercial stations. Just two months after passage of \n     the law erased the limits on the number of radio stations a \n     single owner may acquire, a station-buying blowout is \n     justifying critics' fears that the law is not spurring \n     competition, but monopoly. An industry that once had to base \n     its license renewals on service to a station's community has \n     been let off the hook by Congress and the president.\n       Rita Zanella, a media analyst at Gruntal & Co. in New York, \n     predicts that eight or 10 big station groups will eventually \n     control the entire broadcasting industry. ``You control \n     pricing,'' she told the Chicago Tribune. ``You eliminate your \n     competition and have greater control over what you can \n     charge.''\n       To cite just a few examples of the radio land rush, Jacor \n     Communications Inc. of Cincinnati spent nearly a billion \n     dollars in February to acquire 26 radio stations and two \n     television stations. Jacor now controls 62 percent of the \n     radio revenues in the Cincinnati, market, nearly half the \n     Denver market, 30 percent of the Tampa market, and a quarter \n     of the radio business in Portland, OR. In a single deal worth \n     $1.2 billion, announced earlier this month, the Sinclair \n     Broadcasting Group of Baltimore acquired 34 radio stations in \n     27 markets, along with a group of television stations, \n     becoming a miniconglomerate in a single bound.\n       With the purchase of three stations in March, Citadel \n     Communications Corporation now owns seven of the most \n     powerful AM and FM stations in Albuquerque's 36-station radio \n     market. That includes KKOB, which blankets much of the \n     southwest, and the city's only classical music station, KHFM. \n     Arthur Schreiber, a former manager of KKOB and a veteran of \n     the radio wars, predicts that Albuquerque's classical-music \n     listeners will soon find themselves without choice on the \n     air. ``It's hard for me to believe that Citadel can meet its \n     debt service by continuing to play classical music on a \n     station that cost it $5.6 million,'' says Mr. Schreiber.\n       The federal government is essentially licensing the drive \n     to bigness. Station brokers predict that 1996 will be the \n     most lucrative year ever for station trades. I a deregulatory \n     environment, small, aggressive companies such as Jacor and \n     Citadel can become mass-comm players in a single bound, with \n     lenders anxious to supply cheap money.\n       But radio isn't just any business. Radio is an essential \n     part of our civic capital. It speaks over publicly licensed \n     frequencies to millions of listeners, at home, at work, and \n     on the road. In the past stations were more than juke boxes. \n     They provided breaking news and weather bulletins, \n     specialized information for farmers, investors, community \n     organizations, local governments, and emergency services. \n     Before the start of deregulation in the 1980s, owners were \n     limited to seven AM and seven FM stations, to ensure diverse \n     voices and dispersed power.\n       The new barons of radio are absentee owners who convert \n     their stations from local presences into cash cows for \n     instant milking, their values ballooned for trading to the \n     next buyer. The name of the game is to avoid being the ``last \n     sucker'' stuck with debt if recession hits.\n       Radio, once the most trusted news source in America, has \n     increasingly abandoned the role of local service-provider. \n     Newsrooms in many stations have been cut to the bone--one or \n     two readers, Schreiber says, ``ripping and reading'' news and \n     weather supplied to all clients by a single news source, the \n     Associated Press.\n       there is teeth-gritting sameness in the music they play, as \n     dial-twisters who have traveled long distances in a car can \n     testify--various shades of rock and country music.\n       Before deregulation, the Federal Communications Commission \n     required buyers to hold their stations for at least three \n     years before resale, to ensure local commitment. In the new \n     environment, a wheeler-dealer can theoretically turn his \n     station over as soon as the FCC approves the purchase. Media \n     writer Ken Auletta was told by the head of a station \n     ownership group: ``It's commodity trading to us. We don't \n     know [our] community. We're short-term players.''\n       The fundamental question is unavoidable: Is mass \n     communications solely a growth game for entrepreneurs, banks, \n     and Wall Street, or is it also a social partner that \n     justifies its existence by living up to its civic \n     obligations? The late Donald H. McGannon, a respected \n     industry leader of the 1950s and '60s as chairman of the \n     Group W (Westinghouse) Stations, was a businessman with a \n     vision who told his staff: ``If we do the right thing in our \n     cities and towns, the money comes.'' They did--and it did.\n       The times have changed. But not the relevance of McGannon's \n     vision. Undoing the damage of the Telecommunications Act of \n     1996 will be difficult, but it will have to happen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6108-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6109-S6110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSUBMISSION OF CBO SCORING FOR INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION BILL (S. 1718)\n\n Mr. SPECTER.

Bill purpose: This bill would authorize appropriations \n     for fiscal year 1997 for intelligence activities of the \n     United States government, the Community Management Staff of \n     the Director of Central Intelligence, and the Central \n     Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System.\n       5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: Table 1 \n     summarizes the budgetary effects of the unclassified sections \n     of the bill on direct spending, revenues, and authorizations \n     of appropriations for 1997. CBO could not obtain the \n     necessary information to estimate the costs for the entire \n     bill because parts are classified at a level above clearances \n     now held by CBO employees.\n       6. Basis of estimate: The estimate assumes that S. 1718 \n     will be enacted by October 1, 1996, and that the full amounts \n     authorized will be appropriated. CBO used historical spending \n     rates for estimating outlays.\n\n\n                      Direct Spending and Revenues\n\n       Title V of S. 1718 defines economic espionage and contains \n     provisions governing fines and forfeitures that would affect \n     direct spending and revenues. Although the bill would provide \n     for penalties that could accumulate to be in the millions of \n     dollars in any one year, CBO cannot predict the frequency of \n     successful prosecutions for economic espionage or the amounts \n     of the fines that would be levied and collected. \n     Nevertheless, the only net budgetary impact would stem from \n     civil fines.\n\n TABLE 1.--ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNCLASSIFIED \n                           SECTIONS OF S. 1718                          \n                [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                1996  1997  1998  1999  2000  2001  2002\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                      DIRECT SPENDING AND REVENUES                      \n                                                                        \nDirect spending:                                                        \n  Estimated budget authority..     0  (\\1\\                              \n                                         )  (\\1\\                        \n                                               )  (\\1\\                  \n                                                     )  (\\1\\            \n                                                           )  (\\1\\      \n                                                                 )  (\\1\\\n                                                                       )\n  Estimated outlays...........     0  (\\1\\                              \n                                         )  (\\1\\                        \n                                               )  (\\1\\                  \n                                                     )  (\\1\\            \n                                                           )  (\\1\\      \n                                                                 )  (\\1\\\n                                                                       )\nRevenues......................     0  (\\1\\                              \n                                         )  (\\1\\                        \n                                               )  (\\1\\                  \n                                                     )  (\\1\\            \n                                                           )  (\\1\\      \n                                                                 )  (\\1\\\n                                                                       )\n                                                                        \n                SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATIONS ACTION               \n                                                                        \nSpending under current law:                                             \n  Budget authority \\2\\........   305     0     0     0     0     0     0\n  Estimated outlays...........   350    39    19     5     0     0     0\nProposed changes:                                                       \n  Estimated authorization                                               \n   level......................     0   282     1     0     0     0     0\n  Estimated outlays...........     0   239    25    14     5     0     0\nSpending under the bill:                                                \n  Estimated authorization                                               \n   level \\2\\..................   305   282     1     0     0     0     0\n  Estimated outlays...........   350   278    44    19     5     0     0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ CBO cannot estimate the direct spending and revenue impacts of the  \n  bill. Title V would affect both spending and revenues through fines   \n  and forefeitures associated with economic espionage. Over time, these \n  effects would be offsetting except for civil fines as described in the\n  text.                                                                 \n\\2\\ The 1996 figure is the amount already appropriated.                 \n\n       Fines.--The imposition of new civil and criminal fines in \n     S. 1718 could cause governmental receipts to increase. Civil \n     fines would be deposited into the general fund of the \n     Treasury. Criminal fines would be deposited in the Crime \n     Victims Fund and would be spent in the following year; thus, \n     direct spending from the fund would match the increase in \n     revenues from criminal fines with a one-year lag.\n       Forfeiture.--A new forfeiture provision in S. 1718 could \n     lead to more assets seized and forfeited to the United States \n     as a result of economic espionage. Proceeds from the sale of \n     any such assets would be deposited as revenues into the \n     Assets Forfeiture Fund of the Department of Justice and spent \n     out of the fund in the same year. Thus, direct spending from \n     the Assets Forfeiture Fund would match any increase in \n     revenues.\n\n[[Page S6110]]\n\n               spending subject to appropriations action\n\n       The bill would authorize the appropriation of $280 million \n     for intelligence and intelligence-related activities for 1997 \n     as well as such sums as may be necessary to establish the \n     Commission to Assess the Organization of the Federal \n     Government to Combat the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass \n     Destruction.\n       Section 104 would authorize appropriations of $95.5 million \n     for 1997 for the Community Management Account of the Director \n     of Central Intelligence. Similarly, section 201 specifies an \n     authorization of appropriations for the Central Intelligence \n     Agency Retirement and Disability Fund of $184.2 million. In \n     addition, CBO estimates costs of $3 million over two years to \n     establish the new commission.\n       7. Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 sets up pay-as-you-go \n     procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or \n     receipts through 1998. The bill would have the following pay-\n     as-you-go impact:\n\n                [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      1996   1997   1998\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChange in outlays..................................      0  (\\1\\)  (\\1\\)\nChange in receipts.................................      0  (\\1\\)  (\\1\\)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ CBO cannot estimate the direct spending and revenue impacts of the  \n  bill.

CBO has determined that all the provisions \n     of S. 1718 either fit within this exclusion or do not contain \n     intergovernmental mandates as defined by Public Law 104-4.\n       9. Estimated impact on the private sector: CBO has \n     determined that all the provisions of S. 1718 either fit \n     within the national security exclusion or do not contain \n     private-sector mandates as defined by Public Law 104-4.\n       10.

Madam President, I will not keep us long in the closing \nhours of the U.S. Senate in what will certainly be recognized and \nreported as a historic day.\n  Madam President, this evening I want to add to my earlier remarks two \nthoughts that I think are appropriate as many of our colleagues have \ncome to the floor today to express their sadness, their reminiscent \nthoughts, and in some instances our joy that Bob Dole is now free to \nlead our party, my party, the Republican Party, in his quest for the \nPresidency.\n\n[[Page S6111]]\n\n  Over the last 2 years I have had the privilege of developing a unique \nrelationship with leader Bob Dole. I chair the steering committee here \nin the Senate, better known as the conservatives, or a group of \nconservatives, and there have been many occasions when I have been \ninstructed by that group to go sit down with our leader and express our \nconcern over a given issue.\n  It has been over the course of that time that I have gotten to know \nBob Dole for the person that so many have spoken to today: a man whose \nleadership, and his concern about our country and this institution, the \nSenate, was always foremost. He did so in style and dignity. Bob Dole \nis one of those people who could tell you no with as much sincerity as \nhe could tell you yes; that he would take your issue and carry it \nforward, or that he did not believe what you were discussing with him \nwas appropriate at the time and that sometime in the future it might \nfit. That was the kind of person who I have grown to know and respect \nin my first term here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Another issue that Bob Dole has been more than fair to this Senator \non is the issue of my leadership on the balanced budget amendment. I \nhad started that effort in the House in the 1980's, but it was some \nyears after Bob Dole had already presented the idea here in the U.S. \nSenate. I, along with the Presiding Officer at this moment, had felt \nthe importance of this issue and had worked hard to make it a national \nissue.\n  When I arrived here in the Senate in 1990 as the citizens of Idaho \nchose me as one of their U.S. Senators, Bob Dole was very quick to say, \n``Larry, that is your issue, and we want you to lead.'' As our \ncommittee meetings went forward, or as there were press conferences, or \nas there were other gatherings in behalf of a balanced budget \namendment, Bob Dole attended them religiously. But with his seniority \nand with his prestige, he was always willing to step back and say to \npeople like myself, or Orrin Hatch, or others, or Paul Simon, ``This is \nyour issue. You lead with it. You carry it.''\n  When we convened the historic 104th session, as Bob Dole become the \nmajority leader of the U.S. Senate, he was very quick to say to me and \nothers, ``This is an issue that will be one of our lead issues this \nyear, and I want you, Larry Craig, or Orrin Hatch, or Paul Simon, to \nlead me.''\n  What I am saying is that in all of the opportunities that Bob Dole \nhad to be in the forefront, there were many occasions when he was very \nwilling to step back and let others lead, and I think that is the sign \nof a leader. I think that is the expression of the confidence that he \nhad in himself, but at the same time the willingness to share that with \nall of us as he saw the importance of broadening our base and carrying \nthese issues forward.\n  I, along with every Senator in this body, will miss Bob Dole as our \nmajority leader.\n  But I say that I am excited about the future. And I am excited about \nthe opportunity someday, as I believe I will have that opportunity, to \nsay to Bob Dole, ``Mr. President, it is my pleasure to serve you.''\n  With those thoughts, I yield back my time with the understanding that \nthe Senate will stand in adjournment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/11/senate-section/article/S6110-7", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 11:30 A.M.
