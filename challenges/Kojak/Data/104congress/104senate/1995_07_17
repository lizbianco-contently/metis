Before the problems pile up and the demands of the day hit us, \nwe deliberately stop to commit our way to You, to trust in You, to rest \nin You, and wait patiently for You. Nothing is more important than \nbeing in an honest, open, receptive relationship with You. Everything \nwe need to be competent leaders comes in fellowship with You. We are \nstunned by the fact that You know and care about us. We are amazed and \nhumbled that You have chosen to bless this Nation through our \nleadership. In response, we want to be spiritually fit for the rigorous \nresponsibilities. So, we turn over to Your control our personal lives, \nour relationships, and all the duties You have entrusted to us. We \ntrust You to guide us. We seek the source of our security and strength \nin You. We will not run ahead of You or lag behind, but will walk with \nYou in Your timing and pacing toward Your goals. You always are on time \nand in time for our needs. May the serenity and peace we feel in this \ntime of prayer sustain us throughout this day. We thank You in advance \nfor a great day filled with incredible surprises of sheer joy. In Your \nall-powerful name.

Mr. President, any successful entrepreneur who starts out \nsmall and gradually builds their business up knows about bureaucracy.\n  As his or her company grows, so do the piles of paperwork, and the \nnumber of employees handling it, and pretty soon projects that used to \ntake a day are taking weeks, or even longer. Lines of communication \nthat used to be clear and open become tangled and confused. What began \nas a lean machine too often turns into a convoluted, Rube Goldberg \ncontraption.\n  ``In every small business lies the seeds of a bureaucracy.''\n  I read that line in a recent column in the Minneapolis Star-Tribune--\na piece by Mark Stevens entitled ``Action Needed to Guard Against \nBureaucracy.''\n  ``Rules begin to sprout,'' wrote Mr. Stevens, ``and procedures start \nto take hold that do more to complicate life than to achieve \nobjectives. Left unchecked, these enemies of efficiency tend to \nmultiply until they choke the business.''\n  How many entrepreneurs, do you suppose, have choked on their own \nenemies of efficiency? How many have been done in by a self-generated \nbureaucracy that simply ate up resources, devoured precious time, and \nclouded the original goals outlined in the business' master plan?\n  Judging by the rate that small businesses come and go in this \ncountry, I guess that it is a significant number. Bureaucracy is a lot \nlike hail on a cornfield--a little is not going to hurt, but too much \nof it can be disastrous.\n  And nobody knows more about bureaucracy than the folks who work here \non Capitol Hill.\n  Mr. Stevens was writing about small business in his article, but he \ncould just as easily have been describing the \n\n[[Page S 10080]]\nFederal Government--the biggest bureaucracy this world has ever known.\n  I have said it often: small business and Government actually have a \ngreat deal in common. But the bureaucratic problems that can plague a \nsmall business are magnified a million times in Washington.\n  Imagine having so many new regulations that it took 65,000 pages to \nprint them last year alone.\n  Imagine having so many employees that you are not only far and away \nthe largest employer in the Nation, but your annual receipts put you at \nthe very top of the Fortune 500 list as well.\n  Imagine having your finger in so many pies that diversified is just \ntoo small a word to describe your operation.\n  Your employees are overseeing thousands of individual little \nbureaucracies, thousands of programs, projects, and agencies that have \ntaken on lives of their own, and have little accountability to the home \noffice or the folks who ultimately pay the bills--the taxpayers.\n  That is the Federal Government.\n  But just as small business owners need to take steps to clear out the \ncobwebs of bureaucracy and get back to basics to survive, so should \nWashington.\n  In fact, the line that originally caught my eye in Mr. Steven s \narticle could easily be turned around to read: ``In every bureaucracy \nlies the seeds of a small business.''\n  Re-exposing those seeds to the light of day and refocusing on the \nbasics is the key to what we are now trying to create in Congress--a \nFederal Government that runs with the same efficiency as an effective \nsmall business.\n  In his column, Mr. Stevens outlined four steps that managers can use \nto gauge whether a business is drowning in bureaucracy, and suggestions \non how to turn things around if it is. His ideas work equally well when \napplied to the Federal Government.\n\n\n                              Step No. 1:\n\n       Review company rules and procedures, questioning why they \n     were established and, equally important, if they still make \n     sense.\n       [Eliminate] anything that detracts from your company's \n     ability to achieve its business objectives rapidly and \n     productively.\n\n  Of course, the National agenda changes with time and circumstances, \nbut we are in a period now where our objectives, as mandated by the \nvoters, seem better focused than ever.\n  Provide for the Nation's needs, protect the unprotected, and \nunshackle our job providers, so that they are able to put more \nAmericans to work in new, higher paying jobs.\n  Mountains of Federal rules and procedures litter the track and keep \nthe objectives out of reach.\n  Sure, they may create Federal jobs--after all, there are some 128,000 \nregulators on the Federal payroll--but in reality they are job-killers \nfor the private sector, with a cost to the economy as high as $1.65 \ntrillion each year.\n  More Government jobs are not the answer.\n  That is why the efforts in this Congress toward regulatory reform, \nand the legislation we are considering on the floor, are so critical.\n  Cutting back the forest of Federal regulations will make Government \nmore efficient. Loosening the bureaucracy will free Government to meet \nits objectives.\n\n\n                              Step No. 2:\n\n       Take a fresh look at payroll, asking if you really need all \n     of the people who work at your company. Investigate whether \n     some people have been added to back up others--who have \n     little to do themselves--or to enforce the wasteful rules and \n     procedures already in place.\n\n  Small business owners often work 80-hour weeks just to barely break \neven. When they see how the Government wastes their tax dollars, they \nget furious. They could not run their business the way Congress runs \nthe Government, with reckless overspending and billion dollar deficits. \nThe Government would toss them in jail.\n  Many businesses, large and small, realized during the past decade \nthat bigger does not necessarily mean better. To help boost their \nprofit margin and cut back on the waste, they began downsizing. It is a \nmove that has saved many businesses from extinction and returned them \nto profitability, and it is a move being duplicated here in Washington. \nWe call it ``reinventing Government.'' With fewer rules and regulations \nclogging the pipeline, fewer Federal employees are needed to enforce \nthem, and fewer taxpayer dollars are wasted.\n  But re-inventing does not just apply to the number of people on the \npayroll, because bureaucracy is more than just employees--it is also \nthe programs that the employees create, enlarge, and regulate. In the \nbalanced budget resolution we have crafted, this Congress has taken a \nclose look at each and every place we are spending the taxpayers' \ndollars. If a program or an agency does not meet the test of relevancy, \nif it is not meeting an important national need during tight economic \ntimes, then perhaps this nation can do without it.\n  Small business makes these tough decisions every day--it is about \ntime Congress makes some tough decisions, too. Writes Mr. Stevens:\n\n       Unless you rid your company of this dead wood, you will be \n     building a bloated company that is likely to sink under its \n     own weight.\n\n                              Step No. 3:\n\n       Make certain that accountability is built into every job. \n     Every personal function and responsibility should be \n     monitored and evaluated. Be sure that seniority is not the \n     criterion for promotion.\n\n  There is a strong correlation to this in Washington. When it comes to \nspending decisions on the Federal level, the effectiveness of a \nGovernment program does not always determine whether it gets funded \nyear after year. Far too often, Government programs get their annual \nfunding simply because they are there. Unmonitored and unevaluated, \nthey are often automatically renewed for decades. And nothing breeds \nmore bureaucracy than an entity which never needs to justify its \nexistence.\n  If Washington is serious about guarding against bureaucracy, it will \nbuild accountability into the budget process by sunsetting Federal \nspending. Congress needs the opportunity to reexamine what works and \nwhat does not. Just because a program has been around for a while does \nnot mean it is a good investment.\n\n\n                              Step No. 4:\n\n       Grant responsible employees the authority to make certain \n     decisions--for which they now need approval--unilaterally. \n     Elaborate approvals do little more than slow the company's \n     response time and make it more difficult to serve customers.\n\n  For the Federal Government, that means moving the concentration of \npower from Washington back to the States, where it belongs. There is \nmore than just a physical distance between Washington and the rest of \nthe country. There are different priorities outside here as well, and \nnobody on the other side of the Beltway really believes that Congress \ncan spend the taxpayers' dollars better than local officials can.\n  Our responsibility is to leave the decision making where it can do \nthe most good and speed up the response time to best serve the \ntaxpayers--who are not only the customers of this Government, but its \nowners as well.\n  ``Keep in mind that no one sets out to create a bureaucracy,'' wrote \nMark Stevens. ``But unless you are diligent in protecting it, the \nbureaucracy will form on its own.''\n  Of course, that is exactly what happened in Washington. But if we \nfollow the same advice that scores of small businesses have used to \npull themselves out of the bureaucratic quagmire--eliminating senseless \nrules and regulations, downsizing to promote efficiency, evaluating \nspending decisions, and putting faith, and the dollars to go along with \nit, in the hands of the States, not Washington--we will shrink the \nbureaucracy. And while we are doing that, Mr. President, we will expand \nthe people's faith in their Government.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on Saturday President Clinton gave his \nSaturday speech wherein he justified defeating the regulatory reform \nbill.\n  I really believe that so many people who are opposed to this \nregulatory reform bill did not get the message that came from the \nAmerican people on the 8th of November because, loudly and clearly, \nthey wanted to redefine the role of Government in our lives.\n  The President talked about how you are going to be poisoned by your \nhamburgers. He talked about how people are dying in the streets because \nthey are not adequately protected from exposure to the physical \nelements, and from food, as if Government has a role of taking care of \neveryone and people's responsibility for themselves is nonexistent. And \nthe theme of all of this was that Government really does things better \nthan people do. That is not what this country is all about.\n  The other day we were talking about some reforms that were necessary \ninsofar as the EPA is concerned. The EPA is a good example of a \nregulator that has gone far beyond the intent of what we have always \nfelt a regulator should do.\n  I remember in my city of Tulsa, OK, there is a lumber company called \nMill Creek Lumber Co. owned by the Dunn family. It is a third \ngeneration lumber company owned by the family. It is a competitive \nbusiness. It is a tough business.\n  I got a call from Jimmy Dunn, the owner and CEO of Mill Creek Lumber \nCo., that family lumber company on 15th Street in Tulsa, OK. He said, \n``The EPA just put me out of business after three generations of family \nrunning this business.'' I said, ``What did you do wrong?'' He said, \n``I do not think I did anything wrong.'' He said, ``About 10 years ago \nI sold used crankcase oil to a licensed contractor, and the licensed \ncontractor apparently disposed of it in the wrong place.'' It was \ncalled the Double Eagle site.\n  So this guy 10 years later, after disposing of crankcase oil, long \nbefore the law was even in effect, ended up with a letter from the EPA \nAdministrator saying that you are going to be fined $25,000 a day, and \nyou are going to maybe even have criminal sanctions.\n  Then a year ago Christmas, about 4 or 5 days before Christmas, I got \na phone call from a guy named Keith Carter. Keith Carter was a man of \nvery modest means. He had developed a business in Skiatook, OK, which \nwas in my congressional district at that time. He called up one day 4 \ndays before Christmas and he said, ``Congressman Inhofe, I have a \nserious problem. The EPA just put me out of business, and right before \nChristmas, I have to fire my six employees.'' I said, ``What \nhappened?'' He said, ``Well, about 2 years ago I moved from the \nbasement in my home three blocks down the street to another location \nbecause the business was kind of good and I needed a little bit more \nroom. Apparently they say that I did not advise the EPA that I made my \nmove.'' I said, ``My gosh. You have been operating for 2 years in an \narea where they did not know where you were?'' He said, ``Oh, no. I \ntold the regional office in Texas. But apparently they did not tell the \noffice in Washington.'' They called up and put him out of business.\n  It took me about a week to get him back in business. He called up a \nweek later, and he said, ``I have another problem, Congressman.'' He \nsaid, ``They let me back in business but I cannot use the number that I \nhad before because they said during that 1 week I was out of business, \nthey assigned it to somebody else. I had $25,000 worth of inventory.''\n  So we finally got it corrected. But for each one who calls a \nCongressman or someone to intervene in behalf of decency and honesty \nand good sense, there are hundreds of them who do not do that. If he \nhad not called, then Keith Carter would have been out of business and \nhis employees would be unemployed today, most likely. That is the kind \nof abuse that takes place by regulators in our society.\n  I suggest, Mr. President, the theme of this thing is far greater than \nwe have been talking about. We are talking about freedom. That is what \nthis whole thing is about; freedom, individual freedom. That is what \nthis country is supposed to be all about.\n  I remember a few years ago when we had the problems down in \nNicaragua. And I know, Mr. President, you were serving over in the \nHouse at that time and remember it also. At that time, it was, \nfortunately, driven home to me how we are perceived around the world, \nthat we are the bastion of freedom, that we are the beacon of freedom. \nIf you lose it here, you do not have it anywhere else. That is what \nthis regulation is about, the theme that Government knows better how to \ntake care of our lives than we do.\n  This is what was happening in Nicaragua at that time, if you will \nremember the big controversy we had here in both Houses of the U.S. \nCongress with people saying, ``Well, the freedom fighters are really a \nbunch of rebels. We should not get involved in this thing.'' Yet, we \nknew that the Communists at that time were supplying them with the best \nof armaments, with the best of tanks, and with the best of helicopters.\n And so you had the freedom fighters risking their lives.\n\n  I can remember going down to Honduras. I think we were only about 7 \nmiles from the Nicaraguan border. And I went through a hospital tent \ndown there where they were bringing the freedom fighters in and nursing \nthem back to health. The tent was about the size of these Chambers. It \nwas a very large tent. And all around the periphery they had hospital \nbeds that were in a circle. And then they did their surgical procedures \nin the center. About all they did was amputations at that time because \nmost of the young people who were in there, the freedom fighters from \nNicaragua, were in there because they had stepped on land mines or \nsomething like that, so most of them were amputations. The average age \nof the freedom fighter was 18 at that time, because the older ones had \neither died or lost their arms or legs.\n  I remember, I went all the way around--I speak Spanish--and I talked \nto each one of those individuals. I tried to get in my own mind: What \nis it that is driving these people? What is it that they risk their \nlives for that so many of them are dying? And so I asked the question \nto each of them. The last one was a young girl 19 years old. Her name \nwas Maria Lynn Gonzalez. I will always remember her because she was an \nitty-bitty girl. It was her third visit to the hospital tent; she kept \ncoming back. But she would not go back to fight again because that \nmorning they amputated her left leg and blood was oozing through the \nbandages.\n  As she lay there, with her large eyes looking up after having gone \nthrough all that terror, I asked her that question. She responded to \nme, and she said:\n\n       Es porque han tomado nuestras casas, campos, todo lo que \n     tenemos. Pero, de veras, ustedes en los Estados Unidos \n     entienden. Porque ustedes tuvieron que luchar por su libertad \n     lo mismo que estamos luchando ahora.\n\n  What the little girl was saying was well, of course, we are fighting; \nwe are fighting because they have taken our farms and our houses and \neverything we own. But surely you in the United States do not have to \nask that question because you had to fight for your freedom from an \nabusive government the same as we are fighting for our freedom today.\n  It occurred to me at that time this little girl, Maria Lynn Gonzalez, \nwho could not read or write, she was not well educated; she had never \ngone to school; she was brilliant in her knowledge and appreciation of \nfreedom, and she was willing to die for it. She looked at our \nrevolution in this country, that revolution which we could not have won \nany other way than our reliance upon God and the principles that made \nthis country so great, and she did not know whether we won that \nrevolution 5 years ago or 200 years ago; she did not have any concept \nof when all this was happening, but to her it was a fight for freedom \nagainst all odds, and we were that beacon of freedom that led them to \ntheir success down there.\n  It has been that way for 200 years. The whole world looks at us. And \nwhile the world looks at us as the example that people are bigger than \ngovernment, and that totalitarian government, centralized government \nthat is in charge of people's lives does not perform as people do when \nthey are unleashed and can do as they wish and \n\n[[Page S 10082]]\nhave the product of their labors, then that means so much more.\n  So while we are the beacon of that freedom, the administration is \ntrying to hold on to the old, abusive governmental waste of the past \nwith white knuckles.\n  And so I say to you, Mr. President--not this Mr. President but Mr. \nPresident Clinton--that you are not going to win this battle because \nthere was an election. When that election took place in November 1994, \nthere were a lot of loud messages. They wanted to rebuild a strong \nnational defense at the same time they wanted to balance the budget. We \nare going to do both.\n  They wanted to change the role of Government so it no longer has \nabusive control and power over the citizenry, and that is exactly what \nis going to happen.\n  So this is a very important debate that we are in the middle of right \nnow, Mr. President, the debate on the role of Government, how abusive \nis Government, and for all those people around the world who look to us \nas that beacon of freedom we are going to keep that beacon very bright \nand shiny for them.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/17/senate-section/article/S10081-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SENATOR PRYOR\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, Senator David Pryor is a man of many \naccomplishments. In his distinguished career, he has been a journalist \nand founder of a newspaper, a member of the Arkansas House of \nRepresentatives and a two-term Governor of his State. In Arkansas, they \nstill talk about his achievements as Governor during the 70's \nrecession. Carefully and caringly, he cut spending without cutting the \nprograms that people depended on.\n  He is also a lawyer who served three terms as the Representative of \nthe Fourth Congressional District of Arkansas. He has served three \nterms in this body as a U.S. Senator and the last time he ran, he was \nso popular that nobody bothered to run against him. As a member of the \nAgriculture Committee, he has actively shaped innovative programs and \npolicies which have helped the farmers of Arkansas while furthering the \nleadership position of the United States in the world agricultural \ncommunity.\n  More than anything else, what has distinguished Senator Pryor's \nlegislative work in the U.S. Congress has been his sensitivity to the \nneeds of private citizens. As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, \nhe wrote a ``Taxpayer Bill of Rights'' which guaranteed--for the first \ntime in 40 years--the rights of individual citizens in their dealings \nwith the IRS.\n  Senator Pryor is known as an advocate for senior citizens. His \nadvocacy is based on an extensive acquaintance with their situation, a \ncompassionate understanding of their needs and a thorough knowledge of \nthe existing support systems for the elderly. As a Member of the House \nof Representatives, he at one point worked incognito to gain first-hand \nexperience of conditions in the nursing home industry. He served for 6 \nyears as chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, and, as \nranking member, is continuing the fight to save Social Security and \nbring down prescription drug prices.\n  Senators, and I was one of them, heard his announcement that he did \nnot plan to run again in 1996 with both relief and great regret. \nRelief, because he works too hard. If by leaving the Senate he can stop \nworking too hard, then that is the right thing to do, for his health \nand for his wonderful wife and family. But I do feel sincere regret, \nfor the Senate and for the Nation, that in 1996 we will lose his \nlegislative skills and his compassion for the individual. And speaking \nfor myself, I feel genuine regret that our working relationship will be \nending. It has been a warm, collegial, productive relationship for 17 \nyears, most notably on the Aging Committee. I have appreciated both the \nastuteness of his insights and the pleasure of his company, and hope to \ndo so for the remainder of our terms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/17/senate-section/article/S10082-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10082-S10085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE NUCLEAR AGE'S BLINDING DAWN\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, 50 years ago yesterday, July 16, 1945, \nthe course of human history was changed forever.\n  President Harry Truman, Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin were \npreparing for the European peace conference to end the war with Hitler \nand the Axis. There were major questions to be answered. Where would \nthe conference by held? The war in the Pacific was still raging; would \nRussia enter into the war against Japan?\n  And, then, we learned about the events at Los Alamos, NM. We did not \nknow that we had just succeeded in the greatest scientific race of all \ntime, let alone the unquestionable magnitude of this achievement that \nwould end the Second World War. Until this time, the activities at Los \nAlamos were shrouded in complete secrecy.\n  As recounted in several superb articles in New Mexico newspapers, the \nactivities at Los Alamos changed the lives of New Mexicans as much as \nthey impacted upon the rest of the world.\n  During the early morning of July 16, 1945, some of the citizens in \nNew Mexico witnessed a sudden illumination in the sky. A friend of mine \nRowena Baca, was quoted as saying that her ``grandmother thought it was \nthe end of the world.'' This shocking irradiation incited Mrs. Baca's \ngrandmother to shove her, as well as her cousin, under the bed. From \nunderneath the bed, the two children saw the walls and ceiling reflect \na red color. They were 35 miles from the Trinity sight, where the \nexplosion occurred.\n  Dolly Oscuro's ranch used to include the land that became the Trinity \nsight. Where the cattle grazed, Mrs. Oscuro remembers looking out her \nwindow and seeing a rising mushroom cloud.\n  Helen and William Wrye, also ranchers, were returning home from a \nlong and exhausting trip. They live in the same house that is 20 miles \nfrom the Trinity sight. They slept through the explosion. The \nradiation, according to Mr. Wrye, caused his beard to quit growing for \na while. Of course, we are not sure that was the case, but at least \nthat is what he perceives.\n  Mr. friend, Larry Calloway, who writes for the Albuquerque Journal, \nwrote what is in my opinion an articulate, well-documented, and human \nperspective of the first successfully tested atomic bomb. The article, \n``The Nuclear Age's Blinding Dawn,'' describes in detail the events of \nthe night and morning leading up to this first display of atomic power.\n  Mr. Calloway's article portrays the human side of this historic day: \nabout people such as Joe McKibben who wired the instruments that set \noff the implosion bomb; Berlyn Brizner who served as chief \nphotographer; and Jack Aeby, a civilian technician who assisted in \nplacing the radiation detectors--just to name a few.\n  ``The Nuclear Age's Blinding Dawn'' is worthy reading for all \nAmericans. Many times, the specific event in history overshadows the \nindividuals who made the event possible. Mr. Calloway tells us about \nthe people in New Mexico who made this historic achievement happen.\n  Fifty years later, in hindsight, debate continues on the issue of \nwhether development and deployment of the atomic bomb was the right \nthing to do. For example, a Smithsonian exhibit featuring the Enola \nGay, the plane that dropped ``Little Boy'' on Hiroshima, becomes \ncontroversial. It is probably fair to suggest that the debate will rage \nfor another 50 years. However, many believe that their work associated \nwith this effort was right.\n  On this anniversary, let's turn to other aspects of this event. Our \nentrance into the Nuclear Age is as much about people as it is about \nscience. It is the well known people: J. Robert Oppenheimer, Enrico \nFermi, I.I. Rabi, Niels Bohr, Hans Bethe, Luis Alvarez, Emilio Segre, \nNorman Ramsey, Val Fitch, Aage Bohr, A.H. Compton, E.O. Lawrence, and \nJames Chadwick, and Maj. Gen. Leslie R. Groves, to mention a few.\n  It is about the citizens of New Mexico who witnessed the Trinity \ntest.\n  And, it is about the unsung workers and scientists at Los Alamos who \nwere \n\n[[Page S 10083]]\nimportant players in this enormous discovery. They were not alone. They \nwere joined by many thousands in the State of Tennessee at Oak Ridge \nand other scientific locations around America. Together they performed \ntheir duties for a cause they believed in. The employees of New \nMexico's national laboratories continue this legacy today.\n  In honor of these men and women, let us acknowledge their countless \ncontributions since that time. Let us give appreciation for their \ndedication and commitment. These are the people who changed the course \nof human history.\n  I respectfully ask unanimous consent that the text of Mr. Calloway's \n``The Nuclear Age's Blinding Dawn,'' Fritz Thompson's article ``Locals \nHad Ringside Seat to History,'' and Patrick Armijo's article, ``A-Bomb \nScientists Bear No Regrets'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                    The Nuclear Age's Blinding Dawn\n\n       (A half-century ago on July 16, the United States detonated \n     the first atomic bomb. The test, code named Trinity, was the \n     conclusion of the Manhattan Project to build the bomb in a \n     frantic race with Adolf Hitler's scientists. The explosion \n     ushered in the nuclear age, gave rise to New Mexico's modern \n     economy, led to Japan's surrender and set off 50 years of \n     debate about the morality of using such awesome force.)\n\n                          (By Larry Calloway)\n\n       For Joe McKibben, the Nuclear Age came in the back door \n     without knocking. For Jack Aeby, it slipped blindingly \n     through a crack in his welder's goggles. For Berlyn Brixner, \n     it rose in dead silence like an awesome new desert sun.\n       After 50 years, they are among the few who remain to tell \n     about the test of the first atomic bomb, made in the secret \n     wartime city of Los Alamos and code named Trinity by lab \n     director J. Robert Oppenheimer. The survivors are among the \n     dwindling few on Earth who have seen any nuclear explosion. \n     It's been 32 years since the last U.S. atmospheric test.\n       On that Monday, July 16, 1945, at 5:10 a.m., the senatorial \n     voice of physicist Sam Allison began what's now called a \n     countdown. ``Minus 20 minutes'' boomed over the loudspeakers \n     and shortwave radios in the dark Jornada del Muerto in New \n     Mexico's dry Tularosa Basin.\n       By space-age standards, it was a very short countdown, but \n     it was probably the first in the about-to-be-born world of \n     big science. ``Sam seemed to think it was,'' McKibben says. \n     ``He told me, `I think I'm the first person to count \n     backward.' ''\n       Just as Allison is remembered for the Trinity countdown, \n     McKibben will probably be remembered as the guy who pushed \n     the button. ``That kind of annoys me,'' says McKibben, 82, \n     folding himself down on a couch in his cluttered study in \n     White Rock. ``I consider it a minor part of my work.''\n\n\n                         exhaustive preparation\n\n       It wasn't minor at the time, of course. McKibben, a lanky \n     Missouri farm boy-turned-Ph.D physicist, sat at the Trinity \n     control panel. For three months, he had been wiring \n     instruments across 360 square miles of desert around a 100-\n     foot steel tower. The fat implosion bomb, 5 feet round, 5 \n     tons heavy, squatted in a harness of cables on a platform on \n     top. And the desert floor was scattered with instruments.\n       McKibben, of the University of Wisconsin, had spent the \n     night at the tower on guard duty with two Harvard physicists, \n     Trinity director Kenneth Bainbridge and Russian explosives \n     wizard George Kistiakowsky, a former Cossack.\n       This was the second night of uneasy thunderstorms with \n     close strikes of lightning in the Jornada.\n       McKibben fell asleep under some tarps on the clean linoleum \n     floor at the tower base where the final assembly team had \n     done its job carefully, very carefully.\n       And McKibben had a dream. It was simple, peaceful. ``I \n     started dreaming Kistiakowsky had gotten a garden hose and \n     was sprinkling the bomb. Then I woke up and realized there \n     was rain in my face.''\n\n\n                          everything in place\n\n       Soon the rain paused, and Bainbridge rescheduled the shot \n     for 5:30 a.m. After closing the last open circuits, the three \n     physicists drove south in a jeep as fast as they could on the \n     straight blacktop road.\n       They were the last men out of the zone of lethal heat, \n     blast and radiation. The nearest humans were in bunkers \n     called North 10,000, West 10,000 and South 10,000 because \n     they were 10,000 meters (6.2 miles) from Ground Zero.\n       ``We got to South 10,000 (the control bunker) at 5:10, and \n     that was the time I needed to throw the first switch,'' \n     McKibben recalls. Allison took up the microphone in the \n     countdown booth. A quick young Harvard physicist named Donald \n     Hornig, who would become President Johnson's science adviser \n     18 years later, took his place near McKibben at an abort \n     switch. Hornig's job was to stop everything if the detonation \n     circuit faltered, in order to save the first precious \n     production of the Hanford, Wash., plutonium plant.\n       Kistiakowsky, who would become President Eisenhower's \n     science adviser, was in and out of the crowded room. An 18-\n     year-old soldier named Val Fitch was attending British \n     scientist Ernest Titterton at a set of vacuum tubes that \n     would deliver the detonating voltage 6 miles of cable. Fitch \n     would win the 1980 Nobel Prize in physics. Also there was \n     Navy Cmdr. Norris Bradbury, who would become director of the \n     Los Alamos lab from 1945-70.\n       McKibben recalls these men but says, ``I didn't see \n     Oppenheimer. I was told that he came in the door and observed \n     me at the controls and went away. Just to see that I was \n     sane.'' And he laughs.\n       Hundreds turned their expectant eyes to the unforgiving New \n     Mexico desert; it was a who's who of the scientific world.\n       At North 10,000, Berlyn Brixner was in the open on top of \n     the bunker at the controls of a fast movie camera with a \n     blackened viewfinder. ``I was one of the few people given \n     permission to look directly at the bomb at zero time,'' says \n     Brixner, an amiable man of 84 sitting alertly in his \n     minimalist living room in a ponderosa-shaded Los Alamos \n     neighborhood.\n       Brixner's assignment as chief photographer was this: Shoot \n     movies in 16-millimeter black-and-white, from every angle and \n     distance and at every speed, of an unknown event beginning \n     with the brightest flash ever produced on Earth.\n       ``The theoretical people had calculated a . . . 10-sun \n     brightness. So that was easy,'' Brixner says. ``All I had to \n     do was go out and point my camera at the sun and take some \n     pictures. Ten times that was easy to calculate.''\n       The theoretical people also knew a little about radiation, \n     which fogs film, and Brixner consequently shielded two of his \n     near-tower cameras behind 12-inch-thick leaded glass. Some of \n     his cameras were so fast they shot 100 feet of film in a \n     second. Some were 20 miles away and ran for 10 minutes.\n       And now he waited on top of the bunker, gripping the \n     panning mechanism of his movie camera, which like all the \n     others would be turned on by signals from McKibben's control \n     panel.\n\n\n                          sneaking a camera in\n       At Base Camp, the old David McDonald ranch house 10 miles \n     south of the tower, the box-seat audience included Maj. Gen. \n     Leslie Groves, the hard-driving director of the whole \n     Manhattan Project, and its presidential overseers--Carnegie \n     Institute president Vannevar Bush and Harvard president James \n     Bryant Conant. Among the physicists at Base Camp were I.I. \n     Rabi, a New Yorker who would go on to win a Nobel Prize, and \n     the revered Italian Enrico Fermi, who had led the research on \n     the first nuclear chain reaction. Among the 250 lab workers \n     and 125 soldiers was a young civilian technician named Jack \n     Aeby who was exempt from the draft because he'd suffered from \n     tuberculosis.\n       Now 72 and retired from a Los Alamos career in health \n     physics, Aeby sits in his solar home near Espanola and \n     recalls how his job in the weeks leading to the test was to \n     help the Italian physicist Emilio Segre set radiation \n     detectors near the tower. Some of the instruments were hung \n     on barrage balloons tethered 800 yards from the tower. They'd \n     be vaporized in a millisecond after they transmitted their \n     nuclear data.\n       Aeby carried his personal 35 millimeter still camera, which \n     Segre got through security, and as the countdown started, he \n     was planning to take a new Anscochrome color transparency \n     picture of the bomb. Aeby had carried a chair out into the \n     darkness and was sitting there with the camera propped on the \n     back and pointed north. He put on his government-issue \n     welding goggles, not noticing in the dark that there was a \n     crack in one lens. And he listened to the countdown on the \n     Base Camp loudspeakers.\n\n\n                         preparing for the best\n\n       At the VIP viewing area called Compania Hill, 20 miles \n     northwest of the tower and about 10 miles southeast of the \n     village of San Antonio, N.M., two refugee physicists put on \n     sunscreen in the dark. They were Edward Teller of Hungary and \n     Hans Bethe of Germany. Teller would become famous as an \n     advocate of the hydrogen bomb, and Bethe would win the 1967 \n     Nobel Prize in physics.\n       Teller put on gloves to protect his hands and sunglasses \n     under his welder's goggles, for extra protection. ``I \n     expected it to work,'' Teller, now 87 and bent, said in a \n     June interview.\n       Not far away was German Communist refugee Klaus Fuchs, who \n     would be uncovered as a Russian spy five years later.\n       Outside the Jornada, of course, New Mexico had eyes and \n     ears. Teller said that many Los Alamos employees, including \n     his secretary Mary Argo, clipped away to Sandia Crest for a \n     direct 100-mile view of the shot that morning.\n       And in Potsdam, just outside the rubble of bombed-out \n     Berlin, President Truman waited for coded messages so he \n     could tell Josef Stalin what the Russians already knew.\n       But the rest of the world didn't have a clue. Not the B-29 \n     pilots who had hit Tokyo, again, with 3,000 conventional \n     bombs that Friday. Not the 750,000 American troops that would \n     be needed in the planned Nov. 1 invasion of Japan.\n       A countdown. A bellow of ``Zero!'' Silence. A flash of \n     light brighter than the rising of the sun. Then the shock \n     wave hit, and the blast's roar echoed off the mountains.\n\n[[Page S 10084]]\n\n       At minus 45 seconds, McKibben cut in an automatic timing \n     drum he and Clarence Turner had made to generate the final 20 \n     relay signals, including the big one. The drum turned once a \n     second, and McKibben says he had attached a chime that struck \n     once each revolution. So there were 44 chimes before Allison \n     bellowed: ``Zero!''\n       It was 5:29.45 a.m. Mountain War Time, the same as Mountain \n     Daylight Time.\n       McKibben's bunker was under dirt on the north, and there \n     was a small open door on the south, facing away from the \n     shot.\n       ``Suddenly, I realized there was a hell of a lot more light \n     coming in the back door,'' McKibben says. ``A very brilliant \n     light. It outdid the light I had on the control panel many \n     times over. I looked out the back door and I could see \n     everything brighter than daylight.''\n       Aeby had put his Perfex 44 camera on ``bulb'' and in the \n     dark before ``Zero'' opened up the shutter, figuring that way \n     he'd get a good image of the flash. Suddenly, the light cut a \n     sharp white line across his vision. ``I could see that crack \n     for some time afterward,'' he says. It was daylight, and Aeby \n     flung off the goggles to reset his camera. ``I released the \n     shutter, cranked the diaphragm down, changed the shutter \n     speed and fired three times in succession,'' he says. ``I \n     quit at three because I was out of film.''\n       Brixner, at North 10,000, was stunned. ``The whole filter \n     seemed to light up as bright as the sun. I was temporarily \n     blinded. I looked to the side. The Oscura Mountains were as \n     bright as day. I saw this tremendous ball of fire, and it was \n     rising. I was just spellbound! I followed it as it rose. Then \n     it dawned on me. I'm the photographer! I've gotta get that \n     ball of fire.'' He jerked the camera up.\n       One thing more, he says: ``There was no sound! It all took \n     place in absolute silence.''\n\n\n                        unique sights and sounds\n\n       By the time the blast hit, 30 seconds after the flash, most \n     of Brixner's 55 cameras in the desert were finished. Some had \n     done their work in a second. There would be 100,000 frames to \n     develop in black and white and a few in temperamental \n     Kodachrome.\n       In the silence, McKibben stepped out the back door of South \n     10,000 and looked north over the bunker. ``It was quite a \n     pretty sight. Colored. Purplish. No doubt from the iron in \n     the tower and a lot of soil off the ground that had been \n     vaporized. I was surprised at the enormity of it and \n     immediately felt it had gone big.''\n       McKibben ducked behind the bunker just as the shock wave \n     hit. ``Then an amazing thing: It was followed by echoes from \n     the mountains. There was one echo after another. A real \n     symphony of echoes.''\n       As the shock wave hit Base Camp, Aeby saw Enrico Fermi with \n     a handful of torn paper. ``He was dribbling it in the air. \n     When the shock wave came it moved the confetti.''\n       Fermi had just estimated the yield of the first nuclear \n     explosion at the equivalent of 10,000 tons of TNT. Later \n     measures put the yield nearly twice as much, at 18.6 \n     kilotons. And this terrible new energy came from a plutonium \n     ball weighing 13.6 pounds.\n       Thes test's success brought elation yet was tempered for \n     many by the knowledge that the world had suddenly taken a \n     hazardous turn.\n       Robert Van Gemert of Albuquerque, now 79, who was at Base \n     Camp after the shot, says, ``I'm just amazed how those \n     scientists whipped out so many bottles of gin or whatever \n     they could find. And it was rapidly consumed, I can tell you \n     that.''\n       Writer Lansing Lamont in 1965 recorded secondhand some GI \n     exclamations: ``Buddy, you just saw the end of the war!'' \n     ``Now we've got the world by the tail!''\n       At South 10,000, Frank Oppenheimer recalled, his brother \n     probably said, ``It worked!'' Kistiakowsky is supposed to \n     have said to Robert Oppenheimer, ``You owe me 10 dollars'' \n     because of a bet they had. Bainbridge is supposed to have \n     told Oppie, ``Now we are all sons of bitches.''\n       At Compania Hill, Teller remembers, ``I was impressed.''\n       Hans Bethe, now 89, remembers his first thought was, \n     ``We've done it!'' and his second was, ``What a terrible \n     weapon have we fashioned.''\n\n\n                         fleeing the radiation\n\n       At North 10,000, Brixner and the others were thinking \n     suddenly only of a kind of hazard the world had never known. \n     ``I was looking up, and I noticed there was a red haze up \n     there, and it seemed to be coming down on us,'' he says.\n       ``Pretty soon the radiation monitors said, `The radiation \n     is rising! We've got to evacuate!' I said, `That's fine, but \n     not until I get all the film from my cameras.' '' In the \n     midst of the world's first fallout, somebody helped Brixner \n     throw his last three cameras in an Army car, and they all got \n     out of there fast. Film badges later showed they got low \n     doses--by the standards of the time.\n       About 160 men were waiting secretly north of the Jornada \n     with enough vehicles to evacuate the\n      small communities in the probable fallout path. Gen. Groves \n     had phoned Gov. John Dempsey before the test to warn him \n     that he might be asked to declare martial law in southwest \n     New Mexico.\n       But the radiation readings from people secretly stationed \n     all over New Mexico stayed safe--again by the standards of \n     the time.\n       The test was shrouded in secrecy, but, within weeks, the \n     world would know what science had wrought in a lonely stretch \n     of New Mexico desert.\n       When Teller returned to his Los Alamos office, he says, \n     Mary Argo ran to him, breaking all the secrecy rules, `` `Mr. \n     Teller! Mr. Teller! Did you ever see such a thing in your \n     life?' I laughed. And she laughed,'' he says with joy in his \n     voice. ``Does that tell you something?''\n       At community radio station KRS in Los Alamos, Bob Porton, a \n     GI, was about to rebroadcast the noon news, courtesy of KOB. \n     ``Suddenly, about 30 or 40 scientists all came in and stood \n     around,'' he says. ``We knew something was up.''\n       The lead story, Porton says, was this: ``The commanding \n     officer of Alamogordo Air Base announced this morning a huge \n     ammunition dump had blown up, but there were no injuries.''\n       ``All these scientists jumped up and down and slapped each \n     other on the back,'' Porton says. ``I was familiar with \n     secrecy. I never asked any questions. But I knew it was \n     something big.''\n       It was something big. What they'd heard was the coverup \n     story for the first atomic bomb blast.\n\n\n                        counting backward again\n\n       Brixner was on his way to Hollywood to get his film \n     developed in secrecy at a studio lab. One reel showed his \n     jerk of the camera.\n       Aeby developed his color film that night in Los Alamos, \n     using the complex system of a half dozen Ansco chemicals. The \n     first shot of the bomb was overexposed off the scale, but one \n     of the next three became the only good color picture known of \n     the first atomic explosion.\n       Weeks later, Ellen Wilder Bradbury of Santa Fe recalls, the \n     Wilder family tuned in the only radio they had, in their car, \n     to hear a wire recording broadcast over KRS. Ellen was about \n     five and hadn't understood about Hiroshima. And now she was \n     hearing a recording made in the cockpit of Bocks Car, the B-\n     29 that dropped ``Fat Man,'' identical in design to the \n     Trinity bomb, on Nagasaki.\n       Ellen, who would marry Norris Bradbury's son, recalls the \n     now-lost recording clearly: ``They said, `We've got an \n     opening in the clouds. OK. We're going ahead.' And then they \n     counted down to drop it. And they did say, `Bombs away!' But \n     I had just learned to count, and I was most impressed by the \n     fact that they could count backwards.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n                  Locals Had Ringside Seat to History\n\n                          (By Fritz Thompson)\n\n       Sparkey Harkey and his son, Richard, were standing in the \n     gloom before dawn, waiting for a train at Ancho, N.M., when \n     the bomb went off.\n       ``Everything suddenly got brighter than daylight,'' Richard \n     Harkey remembers today. ``My dad thought for sure the steam \n     locomotive had blown up.''.\n       Ir was 5:29.45 a.m. on July 16, 1945. Harkey and his father \n     didn't know it then, but they had just witnessed, in that \n     instant 50 years ago, an event that came to change the course \n     of history and to thereafter touch the lives of everyone in \n     the world.\n       It was mankind's first detonation of an atomic bomb--at \n     Ground Zero on the empty, foreboding sweep of some of the \n     most desolate land in New Mexico; Jornada del Muerto, it is \n     called, the Journey of Death.\n       Awesomely thunderous, the explosion transformed the sand in \n     the desert to green glass, hurled dust and smoke thousands of \n     feet into the sky and startled the bejabbers out of early \n     morning risers in central New Mexico.\n       The place where the bomb exploded is called Trinity Site, \n     and it was 50 miles and a mountain range away from the \n     Harkeys, standing as they were on the tracks, mouths agape, \n     bathed in the glow from man's most fearsome and terrible \n     weapon. That they could see a manmade light brighter than the \n     sun from their far vantage point attests to the incredible \n     power unleashed that morning.\n       Ancho was not even a whistle-stop then. Sparkey, the \n     stationmaster, was out on the tracks, ready to wave a red \n     flag to stop the train so Richard, then 18, could board and \n     ride to his job in Tucumcari.\n       ``It was a blinding flash and it lasted at least a full \n     minute,'' Richard says. ``We didn't know what it was.''\n       Was he curious?\n       ``Yeah. But when you see something like that you're so \n     flabbergasted that you just let it go.''\n\n\n                         The sun was coming up\n\n       Ranchers and other residents on both sides of the Oscura \n     Mountains had a ringside seat to the explosion but didn't \n     know it. In one of the best-kept secrets before or since, \n     civilians had no warning.\n       The lone exception was the late Jose Miera, proprietor of \n     the Owl Bar in San Antonio, a mere 35 unobstructed miles \n     northwest from Trinity and a popular hangout for the site's \n     scientists and soldiers. Rowena Baca, who runs the family \n     establishment these days, says friendly MPs that night went \n     to her grandfather's house, woke him up, ``and told him to \n     stand in the street out front because he was going to see \n     something he had never seen before.''\n       Sure enough.\n       Baca remembers that the sky suddenly turned red. It \n     illuminated the inside of the house she was in, reflecting \n     red off the walls and the ceiling.\n       ``My grandmother shoved me and my cousin under a bed,'' \n     Baca remembers, ``because she thought it was the end of the \n     world.''.\n       At the same moment, a U.S. Navy aviator named John R. Lugo, \n     now of Scottsdale, \n\n[[Page S 10085]]\n     Ariz., was flying a naval transport plane at 10,000 feet some 30 miles \n     east of Albuquerque, en route to the West Coast.\n       ``I saw this tremendous explosion to the south of me, \n     roughly 55 miles from my position,'' Lugo recalls. ``My first \n     impression was, like, the sun was coming up in the south. \n     What a ball of fire! It was so bright it lit up the cockpit \n     of the plane.''\n       Lugo radioed Albuquerque. He got no explanation for the \n     blast, but was told ``don't fly south.''\n       As the sun itself finally rose, rancher Dolly Onsrud of \n     Oscuro woke up, looked out her window and saw a mushroom \n     cloud rising from the other side of the mountains--right \n     about where her cattle-grazing land had been before the U.S. \n     Army took it over three years earlier.\n       She had been none too happy about giving up her 36 \n     sections, and now it looked as if the government was blowing \n     it up.\n       Like Onsrud, most ranchers who witnessed some aspect of the \n     blast are the same ones who were moved off what became White \n     Sands Missile Range. They are still bitter--bitter that the \n     Army never returned the land, bitter that they weren't more \n     generously compensated for giving up their ranches for what \n     they believed was a patriotic duty. And, these days, they \n     would much rather talk about their lost lands than about the \n     first atomic bomb.\n       With the passage of half a century, these same people also \n     find it remarkable that the government never warned them \n     about an event that some scientists thought might set off a \n     chain reaction and destroy all humanity.\n       The fact was, not many workers at Trinity knew for sure \n     what they were working on. Retired teacher Grace Lucero of \n     San Antonio said soldiers who came to the bar that her \n     husband operated told him they were building a tower. ``They \n     said they didn't know what it was for,'' Lucero says. The \n     tower, everyone later learned, steadied the bomb before it \n     was detonated.\n       ``No one knew what was going on out there,'' says Evelyn \n     Fite Tune, who lives on a family ranch 24 miles west of \n     Trinity. ``And of course none of us ever heard of Los Alamos \n     or the atomic bomb.''\n       She and her late husband, Dean Fite, were away in Nevada \n     when the blast went off. They couldn't tell from the news \n     accounts of those days exactly where it happened.\n       ``Finally, on the way back we went to a movie house in \n     Denver and watched the newsreel,'' she says. ``When they \n     showed the hills around the blast area, my husband said \n     `Hell, that's our ranch!' ''\n       Pat Withers lives south of Carrizozo. He is 86 now and has \n     been a rancher all his life. His house is 300 yards from the \n     black and hardened lava flow that's sometimes called the \n     malpais.\n       ``The explosion was loud enough that I jumped out of bed,'' \n     he says. ``I thought the malpais had blowed up. It wasn't on \n     fire, so I went back to bed.''\n       Few ranchers had an experience to match that of William \n     Wrye, whose house then and now is 20 miles northeast of \n     Trinity.\n       Wrye and his wife, Helen, had been returning from a tiring \n     trip to Amarillo the night before the explosion. ``We got to \n     Bingham (on U.S. 380) and there were eight or 10 vehicles and \n     all kinds of lights shining up on the clouds. We were stopped \n     by an MP and a flashing red light. After we told them who we \n     were, they let us go on to the ranch. We were so tired we \n     must have slept right through the blast.\n       ``Next morning, we were eating breakfast when we saw a \n     couple of soldiers with a little black box out by the stock \n     tank, I went out there and asked what they were doing, and \n     they said they were looking for radioactivity. Well, we had \n     no idea what radioactivity was back then. I told them we \n     didn't even have the radio on.\n       ``For four or five days after that, a white substance like \n     flour settled on everything. it got on the posts of the \n     corral and you couldn't see it real well in the daylight, but \n     at night it would glow.''\n       Before long, Wrye's whiskers stopped growing. Three or four \n     months later, they came back, but they were white, then \n     later, black.\n       Cattle in the area sprouted white hair along the side that \n     had been exposed to the blast. Half the coat on Wrye's black \n     cat turned white.\n\n\n                            End of innocence\n\n       Out at the north end of the Oscura range, 30 miles from \n     Trinity, rancher Bill Gallacher was 15 years old. He \n     remembers the blast, that it lighted up the sky and the rooms \n     in his house, much brighter than a bolt of lightning. His \n     father, evidently man of few words who was just getting out \n     of bed, simply said ``Damm.''\n       ``It was a sort-of-sudden deal,'' Gallacher says, \n     ``especially before you've had your morning coffee.''\n       Several ranchers say they never believed the Army cover \n     story that an ammunition dump had blown up. But they didn't \n     guess what it was until the devastation of bombs at Hiroshima \n     and Nagasaki weeks later. Even then, they didn't guess the \n     import of what had been wrought in their backyard.\n       Evelyn Fite Tune and her friends and neighbors visited the \n     site soon after. ``We found the hole, we picked up the glass, \n     we climbed the twisted and melted parts of the tower,'' she \n     says.\n       ``All those people,'' she says, ``grew up and got married \n     and had kids. Nobody that I know of ever turned up sterile.''\n       Back at the Wrye Ranch, Helen Wrye goes to the front door, \n     gazing at the sweep of prairie and desert, the Oscuras \n     looming to the south, 20 miles from here to Trinity. She \n     speaks of this dawn of the atomic age, and she sounds \n     wistful. ``People weren't afraid of the government then,'' \n     she says. ``It was a time of innocence. People were trusting. \n     We had never heard of an atomic bomb.''\n       She is silhouetted against the sunlight of a bright spring \n     day.\n       ``It was a happy time to live,'' she says. ``It was a happy \n     time to live.''\n                   A-Bomb Scientists Bear No Regrets\n\n                          (By Patrick Armijo)\n\n       Los Alamos.--The view from three Manhattan Project \n     scientists was unanimous Thursday.\n       Questioned by Japanese journalists who wanted to know what \n     they felt upon hearing about Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the \n     three couldn't hide the pride they have in the work they did \n     50 years ago.\n       The retired scientists said their work on the bomb was \n     vital to ending World War II--that bombing Hiroshima and \n     Nagasaki was necessary to end prolonged fighting.\n       ``It looked like very quickly it would be the end of the \n     war, which otherwise who knew how long it would drag on?'' \n     Manhattan Project chemist John Balagna told Hiromasa Konishi \n     of Japan America Television.\n       Konishi was at the Bradbury Science Museum with several \n     other reporters from Japan, Britain and Australia to hear the \n     Manhattan Project recollections of Balagna, L.D.P. ``Perc'' \n     King and Joseph McKibben.\n       Balagna said the A-bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki kept \n     someone from using the even more destructive hydrogen bomb in \n     later years.\n       ``The demonstration was so graphic, it put the fear of the \n     Lord in everyone,'' he said. ``That's what kept the Cold War \n     cold.''\n       He said he believes invading Japan would have resulted in \n     more loss of life than the bombings.\n       The Japanese reporters' perspective differed.\n       ``The director Steven Spielberg asked me why the cities \n     were rebuilt and not kept as a memorial to genocide. It was \n     like a genocide. The two bombs killed 200,000 people \n     instantly,'' Konishi said.\n       Japan America Television was in Los Alamos working on \n     stories for the 50th anniversary of the bombings.\n       Konishi said the bombing of Nagasaki, in particular, was \n     ``a difficult thing for the Japanese people to understand.''\n       The Japanese still question the thinking behind the \n     bombings, Konishi said, but his country for the past several \n     years also has been coming to grips with its wartime \n     ``atrocities.''\n       Itsuki Iwata, Los Angeles bureau chief for The Yomiuri \n     Shibun, a Japanese newspaper, said he has conducted numerous \n     interviews with the Manhattan scientists, and virtually all \n     report they had few moral qualms about using the A-bomb.\n       ``The view of the scientists is very much like the point of \n     view you hear today. I think this is a very difficult thing \n     for the scientists to talk about,'' Iwata said.\n       For King the problems people face today can't be \n     superimposed onto 1945.\n       ``We were terribly worried that Hitler had it (the bomb). \n     It was the inspiration to work very long hours, six days a \n     week,'' he said.\n       Balagna, who lost a brother in France about a month after \n     D-Day, said, ``My only regret is that we didn't finish in \n     time to use it on Hitler.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/17/senate-section/article/S10082-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10085-S10086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE? THE VOTERS HAVE SAID YES\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the incredibly enormous Federal debt is \nlike the temperature outside--rising rapidly. As for the rising Federal \ndebt, Congress had better get cracking--time is a-wasting and the debt \nis mushrooming and approaching the $5 trillion level.\n  In the past, a lot of politicians talked a good game, when they were \nback home with the voters, about bringing Federal deficits and the \nFederal debt under control. But many of them regularly voted in support \nof bloated spending bills that rolled through the Senate like \nTennyson's brook. So look at what has happened:\n  As of Friday, July 14, at the close of business, the Federal debt \nstood--down to the penny--at exactly $4,933,039,330,339.52. This debt, \nremember, was run up by the Congress of the United States.\n  Mr. President, most citizens cannot conceive of a billion of \nanything, let alone a trillion. It may provide a bit of perspective to \nbear in mind that a billion seconds ago, the Cuban Missile Crisis was \nin progress. A billion minutes ago, the crucifixion of Jesus Christ had \noccurred not long before.\n  Which sort of puts it in perspective, does it not, that Congress has \nrun up an incredible Federal debt totaling 4,808 of those billions--of \ndollars. In other words, the Federal debt, as I said earlier, stood \nthis morning at opening time at four trillion, 933 billion, 39 million, \n330 thousand, 339 dollars and 52 \n\n[[Page S 10086]]\ncents.

Mr. President, the majority leader announced today his \nintentions to bring S. 908, the State Department Authorization Bill, to \nthe Senate floor before the August recess.\n  As my colleagues are well aware, this bill proposes to reorganize the \nagencies of the executive branch charged with the conduct of America's \nforeign policy, saving needed Federal tax dollars in the process.\n  Before my colleagues rush to judgment on the efforts to restructure \nthe State Department, I recommend they read John Bolton's June 25 op-ed \npiece in the Washington Times, ``Quest for a Stronger Foreign Policy \nHand.''\n  Mr. President, John Bolton writes with authority on the purpose and \npast performance of the State Department because of his having served \nas Assistant Administrator of the Agency for International Development \nin the Reagan administration and as assistant Secretary of State in the \nBush administration. Currently, John Bolton serves as the president of \nthe National Policy Forum.\n  I urge Senators to take note of John Bolton's counsel. His advice \nregarding strengthening America's foreign policy hand is both sound and \nsorely needed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the June 25 op-ed piece \nin the Washington Times, ``Quest for a Stronger Foreign Policy Hand'', \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 25, 1995]\n\n                Quest for a Stronger Foreign Policy Hand\n\n                            (By John Bolton)\n       The House of Representatives has just adopted sweeping \n     organizational changes in formulating American foreign \n     policy. The Clinton administration has argued that the \n     restructuring under debate--merging the Agency for \n     International Development, the U.S. Information Agency and \n     the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency into the State \n     Department--are isolationist and unnecessary. Comparable \n     legislation is now pending in the Senate.\n       Lost in the swirling and sometimes confusing arguments \n     about reorganization is the principal point: How to \n     strengthen the hand of the president in the conduct of \n     foreign policy. Constitutionally, only the president can and \n     should speak authoritatively for the United States in \n     international matters.\n       The paramountcy of executive branch leadership in these \n     affairs, however, has been repeatedly compromised by \n     splitting, again and again, the president's authority among a \n     multiplicity of agencies. Each agency develops its own \n     ``mission,'' its own political constituencies, and its own \n     set of priorities, many or all of which may have little or no \n     congruence with the wishes of the sitting president. The \n     result, too often, has been interagency disagreements that \n     retard if not entirely paralyze effective decision-making and \n     policy implementation.\n       Over the years, therefore, the president's has been \n     weakened, and his ability to act firmly and decisively \n     hampered. Now, in the early days of a post-Cold War era, it \n     is precisely the right time to sweep away the bureaucratic \n     remnants of the past, and the ossified ``old thinking'' they \n     have come to embody. It is simply wrong to argue that the \n     proponents of change are attempting to shift power between \n     the branches. To the contrary, the proposals are intended to \n     enhance presidential authority within his own often-unruly \n     family.\n       Advocates of USIA's continued independence, for example, \n     argue that its news and other functions should remain \n     rigorously independent from the tainting touch of foreign \n     policy considerations. AID's defenders assert that providing \n     foreign economic assistance should serve as a poverty program \n     rather than a support for vital U.S. interests. ACDA's \n     champions believe that only its separateness will protect the \n     Holy Grail of arms control. In fact, the secret agenda in all \n     three cases is to insulate the sub-Cabinet agencies from \n     effective control by the secretary of state, for fear that \n     their respective missions will be ``politicized.'' In this \n     context, ``politicized'' means becoming consonant with U.S. \n     national interests, which most Americans would simply take as \n     a given, not as a problem.\n       Many who wish to preserve AID's separateness, such as Vice \n     President Al Gore, do so because they support increased \n     spending on international population control and \n     environmental matters rather than fundamental economic policy \n     reforms in developing countries. The vice president's \n     preference for condoms and trees instead of markets \n     notwithstanding, these policies will receive long-term \n     political support in Congress only if they are tied to \n     enhancing demonstrable U.S. foreign policy interests.\n       Changes in bureaucratic structures, however, do not require \n     or even imply changes in budget levels or program priorities. \n     Any such changes in these areas must stand or fall on their \n     own merits, independently of which department or agency \n     actually implements policies and programs. Disagreements on \n     funding and program matters can be handled through the \n     legislative amendment process, and will change over time in \n     any event. Anyone who has actually served in the federal \n     government knows that one of the few effective ways to \n     capture the bureaucracy's attention is to threaten massive \n     changes in its budget. Even so, efforts by opponents of \n     reorganization to confuse structure and policy are simply \n     obscurantist at best.\n       These are the tired arguments of inside-the-Beltway turf \n     warriors. They deserve exactly as much weight as the voters \n     gave to similar arguments on the domestic front in November. \n     In fact, most breathtaking here is the opposition to reform \n     agencies created up to 35 years ago, a pace that would imply \n     roughly three bureaucratic reorganizations every century.\n       Nonetheless it is the centrality of enhancing the \n     president's foreign policy authority that provides the \n     inspiring vision to the reform proposals crafted by Rep. \n     Benjamin Gilman, New York Republican, and Sens. Jesse Helms, \n     North Carolina Republican, and Mitch McConnell, Kentucky \n     Republican. Rising above the narrow political temptations \n     occasioned by the split in control between democrats in the \n     executive and Republicans in the legislative branches, they \n     have crafted reorganization plans that transcend today's \n     particular partisan wrangling. They have gained widespread \n     support--including from distinguished career Foreign Service \n     officers like former Secretary of State Larry Eagleberger. \n     These may be sweeping proposals, but they are not extreme.\n       The reforms' directions, more-over, are decidedly \n     internationalist in their implications. Reorganization \n     opponents have repeatedly attempted to paint efforts to \n     achieve sound policy-making and management as isolationist, \n     but their ad hominem rhetoric is off the mark. By attempting \n     to evoke dark memories of pre-World War II policies, they \n     demonstrate that they are simply unable to appreciate why new \n     international realities require new American structures.\n       It is precisely to make the United States more forceful, \n     more dynamic and more adaptable that restructuring is so \n     necessary. Thus, the real internationalists today in foreign \n     affairs follow the lead of predecessors who were also not \n     afraid of massive change in process and structure. Those \n     internationalists who were ``present at the creation'' of \n     U.S. policy and institutions in the aftermath of World War II \n     would undoubtedly be cheerleaders for the reorganizations \n     under discussion.\n       How the reorganizations are actually implemented and in \n     what period of time they must be made operational are \n     subjects for reasonable debate, as is the degree of \n     flexibility the president and the secretary of state should \n     be provided in reordering the combined agencies. Important as \n     these questions may be, however, they are simply details in \n     the larger vision of Messrs. Gilman, Helms and McConnell.\n       Moreover, no one should be confused that the proposals to \n     fold USIA, AID and ACDA into the Department of State are \n     preferred because of any illusion that the State Department \n     is the unique repository of superior skill or efficiency. \n     Phase two of the reorganization process should encompass a \n     major re-examination of attitudinal, press and management \n     issues within the department itself.\n       To step back now from the reform proposals out of timidity \n     or indecision would be to miss an historic opportunity. Soon, \n     the House of Representatives will complete consideration of \n     the Gilman version of reorganization, where it deserves \n     overwhelming approval, followed by immediate action by the \n     Senate. What President Clinton ultimately does with the \n     legislation when it reaches him will speak volumes about \n     whether his ``reinventing government'' initiative is just one \n     more disposable promise.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/17/senate-section/article/S10086-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are already in the second full week of \nthis bill. It is an important bill and it does deserve the type of \nconsideration that we have been giving to it, but we are, hopefully, \ncoming to closure on it.\n  This is a very, very important bill to our society. I do not think \nthere is anybody in this body that will not admit that our society is \noverregulated. In fact, some people think we are being regulated to \ndeath, that it will be the end of a great society, the end of the \ngreatest country in the world if we keep going the way we are, if we \nhave bureaucrats back here, who do not understand the problems out \nthere, issuing ridiculous, silly regulations.\n  This bill is about common sense. It is putting common sense into the \nregulatory process. It does not mean doing away with regulations. This \nbill means we are going to have to use common sense in coming up with \nregulations. I think most Americans would agree the Federal Government \nis out of control, certainly in terms of the burdens that it places \nupon them and their small businesses in particular.\n  What this bill does is it requires governmental agencies to abide by \nrules and regulations that they issue that help rather than hurt our \npeople. It will require the Federal bureaucracy to live by the same \nrules that Americans live by in their day-to-day lives.\n  Those rules are that the benefits of what you are telling people to \ndo have to be justified by the costs of those benefits, the cost \nimposed because of the regulations.\n  The notion of common sense and accountability in rulemaking sounds \nlike a radical idea inside the beltway, but it is really something \npeople want outside the Washington beltway.\n  Americans are smothered, inundated. They are drowning in redtape in \nall aspects of their lives, and they are getting tired of it. They have \nasked us to get rid of the status quo and to get some reason into this \nsystem. This bill certainly does not mean the end of health concerns or \nsafety concerns and it certainly does not mean the end of health and \nsafety regulations. It just means they have to be regulations that make \nsense. They just cannot be imposed ad infinitum on top of American \ncitizens without some justification for the regulations themselves.\n  We have seen on the floor of the Senate a lot of effort to maintain \nthe status quo. That is at the same time that everybody prefaces their \nremarks with ``the status quo is unacceptable.'' The debate this week \nis going to determine whether we stick with the status quo or whether \nwe do some things that will really help our country and resolve some of \nthese difficulties. We simply have to get rid of the silly, ridiculous \nregulations.\n  In that regard, let me give you my top 10 list of silly regulations. \nThis will be list No. 7. I might add that all of these are from Utah \nconstituents this time, but they apply across the country. I think you \nwill find some similarities in each and every one of our States.\n  Silly regulation No. 10: Requiring a company, if they spill just 1 \npint of antifreeze, to call the Coast Guard in Washington, DC, to alert \nthem. That is silly.\n  Silly regulation No. 9: Purposefully releasing more water from a dam \nto create a flood-stage flow in order to help endangered fish, \nregardless of the farmland that was flooded as a consequence.\n  Silly regulation No. 8: Requiring a person who is on a 6-foot \nscaffold to be tethered to a fall protection device which is also 6 \nfeet high.\n  I cannot help laughing at some of these. Some are so bad. This is \nwhat our people go through out there. The problem is, if you think \nabout it, that the person with that 6-foot tether would already hit the \nground before the device could save him.\n  Silly regulation No. 7: Requiring a company to hire an outside \ncontractor to check emissions, in spite of the fact the company does it \nthemselves every 8 hours.\n  Silly regulation No. 6: Refusing to approve a plan to divert a \nportion of a flow of water for stock watering, in spite of the fact \nthat it would drain into the same basin. Further, the Bureau of Land \nManagement, U.S. Forest Service, State engineer and Utah Department of \nWater Resources all approve of the plan.\n  Silly regulation No. 5: Requiring buildings built after the asbestos \nban took effect to be inspected for asbestos, despite the fact they \ncontain no asbestos. That is just typical of what is happening all the \ntime. These are specific cases, but it is typical to require stupid, \nidiotic things just because the people back here are not willing to do \nwhat is right or use common sense.\n  Silly regulation No. 4: Requiring a company to use only hand tools if \nthey want to replace a concrete ditch with an underground pipeline, \ndespite warnings that the ditch may fail. This spring, the ditch did \nfail and flooded the whole surrounding area.\n  Silly regulation No. 3: Requiring a contractor to pay a person $55 an \nhour to walk in front of a back hoe to look out for the desert \ntortoise. People in southern Utah are just beside themselves. Can you \nimagine paying a person $55 an hour to walk in front of a back hoe to \nlook out for the desert tortoise? Well, I admit, desert tortoises are \nwonderful creatures that ought to be preserved, but there is a limit, \nit seems to me, to this type of stupid action.\n  Silly regulation No. 2: Diverting water to aid the ``Lady's Ute tress \norchid,'' in spite of the fact that this will reduce the flow to a \nfamily farm with a decreed right to the water. No prior notice of the \nplan diversion was given to the family, nor were they made aware of the \nissuance of a wetlands permit for the plan.\n  I have to acknowledge that the Lady's Ute tress orchid, I am sure, is \na beautiful flower, but I also think that that family farm is \nimportant, too. That just shows how ridiculous some of these rules and \ninterpretations of the rules are.\n  Now let us turn to silly regulation No. 1:\n   Requiring that a company submit a list to the fire department of all \nthe ingredients in their fire proof bricks, sand, gravel, mortar, and \nsteel. This semiannual report containing the list of the fire \ndepartment of all of the ingredients of fire proof bricks, gravel, \nmortar and steel is about six inches thick. You wonder why people do \nnot want to go into business today or put up with this. This is a \nperfectly good explanation why.\n\n  Well, to make a long story short, it is easy to see why Federal \nregulators--even the good ones--are held in disdain by our people out \nthere. And there are good regulators, we know that. We know there is a \nneed for good regulation. We know there is a need to have Washington \noperate in a careful fashion to protect health and safety and other \nthings.\n  On the other hand, these types of interpretations of regulations and \nthese types of regulations, I think, bring condemnation upon the \npeople, on everybody, even those who are sincere and who do a good job.\n  Now, Mr. President, finally, I want to once again address the \nrelative merits of S. 343 and the Glenn amendment. Last Friday, I \nstated that the Glenn amendment could be termed ``reg lite,'' because \nit was a somewhat weaker version of S. 291, which was itself a product \nof compromise and, for that reason, unanimously voted out of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee under my good friend, Senator Bill Roth. \nI noted that Chairman Roth explained that S. 343 is a superior vehicle \nfor achieving meaningful and effective regulatory reform that neither \nS. 291 or the Glenn substitute does. I also critiqued in some detail \nthe Glenn bill's provisions and concluded that S. 343 is a far more \neffective mechanism for regulatory reform--that is, if you really want \nto do something about regulatory reform.\n  Last Friday, a modified Glenn amendment was introduced. This is a \nlittle bit stronger and moves a little bit closer to the Dole-Johnston \nbill by adopting a little more of S. 343's reform measures. The gap is \nnarrowing. We appear to be moving closer together. Nonetheless, while \nimitation is the sincerest form of flattery, my original conclusion \nremains the same: S. 343 is a far superior vehicle for regulatory \nreform.\n  Let me first say that the Dole-Johnston bill is not a bill that \nsimply requires agencies to perform cost-benefit analysis or risk \nassessment. It is a comprehensive regulatory reform measure that, for \nthe first time in \n\n[[Page S 10088]]\nabout a half century, reforms the Administrative Procedure Act.\n  These reforms, many of which were recommended by the Administrative \nConference of the United States and the American Bar Association, are \ncommonsense proposals that make the notice and comment requirements of \nthe Administrative Procedure Act more productive. These reforms \nguarantee effective public participation in the promulgation of rules \nand assure that judicial review will be more effective. They provide \nfairness to the administrative process. And most are missing in the \nGlenn substitute.\n  More specifically, Dole-Johnston, amends section 553 of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act by requiring, among other things, in the \nnotice of proposed rulemaking in the rule's statement of basis and \npurpose:\n  First, a succinct explanation of the need for and specific objectives \nof the rule.\n  Second, a succinct explanation of the statutory basis for the rule, \nincluding whether the agency's interpretation is clearly required by \nthe text of the statute and, if not, an explanation that the \ninterpretation selected by the agency is within the range of \npermissible interpretations identified by the agency, and an \nexplanation of why the interpretation selected by the agency is the \npreferred interpretation.\n  Third, a summary of the cost-benefit analysis required to be prepared \npursuant to chapter 6 of this bill.\n  Fourth, a statement in the proposed stage of the rule that the agency \nwill seek proposals from the public and local governments for \nalternative methods of accomplishing the objectives of the rulemaking.\n  Fifth, in the statement of basis and purpose, a discussion and \nresponse to any factual and legal issues raised by the comments to the \nproposed rule, including a description of all reasonable alternatives \nto the rule raised by the agency and the commenters, and the reason why \nsuch alternatives were rejected.\n  All of these statements and explanations must be part of the \nrulemaking file and, along with factual and methodological material \nsupporting the basis of the rule, made available to the public for \ninspection and copy.\n  These requirements are absolutely essential for regulatory reform. \nThey assure that the public has the needed information to cogently \ncomment on--or challenge--the rule. They also assured that the courts \nhave the needed information to effectively review the factual and legal \nunderpinnings of the rule.\n  To be sure, without these requirements--and the requirements of \nsection 622 that all reasonable alternatives facing the agency in \nrulemaking be identified--judicial review of cost-benefit analysis is \neffectively impossible.\n  How can there be review of whether cost justify benefits if all the \nrelevant factors facing the agency are not fully disclosed? The absence \nof such requirements are a fatal weakness of the Glenn substitute.\n  I also want to point out that these requirements are hardly \ncontroversial. These rulemaking requirements were all endorsed by the \nAmerican Bar Association, and the American Bar Association has \ncorrectly criticized the Glenn bill for not containing these needed \nreforms.\n  The fairness provisions of Dole-Johnston also constitute significant \nreformation of the administrative process. They include section 707, \nthe reform of consent decree provision.\n  This section assures that consent decrees are not construed in such a \nway as to limit agency discretion to protect the rights of innocent \nthird parties or to respond to changing circumstances. All too often, \nparticularly in environmental enforcement actions, sweetheart consent \ndecrees are entered into by agencies and special interest environmental \ngroups that impinge on the rights of innocent third parties and \nimplement the political agenda of those special interests. The Glenn \nbill contains no equivalent provision.\n  Section 708 is another one of these fairness provisions. This \nprovision prevents impaling the regulated public on the horns of a \ndilemma. An affirmative defense is provided in any enforcement action \nwhere a regulated party faces compliance with contradictory or \ninconsistent regulations. Who can argue with this fairness provision? I \nguess the sponsors of the Glenn substitute can because it is, again, \nabsent from their substitute, from their bill.\n  The sponsors of the Glenn bill are also AWOL in not including the \nfinal of these fairness provisions--section 709. This provision was \noriginally in the Judiciary Committee version of S. 343 and was \nunanimously restored to the bill, 80 to 0, by amendment introduced by \nSenator Hutchison last Friday. It prevents the imposition of criminal \npenalties or civil fines in a situation where parties reasonably relied \non a longstanding position of an agency, and the agency tries to \nretroactively enforce a new interpretation of law or policy. This \nadministrative ex post facto provision is a codification of a \nfundamental precept of justice dating back to Magna Carta; yet, it is \nmissing from the Glenn substitute.\n  Besides Administrative Procedure Act reform, the Glenn substitute \ndoes not contain certain critical elements of regulatory reform. \nPerhaps the most important missing element is Dole-Johnston's \n``decisional criteria'' section 624. This section is the heart of Dole-\nJohnston and constitutes a far more sophisticated and efficacious \napproach to assuring the compliance with cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessment requirements than does the Glenn approach.\n  First of all, this decisional criteria section mandates that no rule \nshall be promulgated unless the rule complies with this section--624. \nThat requirement will act as a hammer to assure agency compliance with \nthe standards set forth in the decisional criteria section 624 of S. \n343.\n  Some will say this is overkill, that agencies will abide by cost-\nbenefit standards without section 624's hammer. Yet, every President \nsince President Ford, including President Ford, right up to the current \nPresident, President Clinton, have issued Executive orders on \nregulations. And President Clinton's Executive order on regulations \ncontains a hammerless cost-benefit analysis requirement, which is why \nit is routinely ignored by all of his Federal agencies and OMB, the \nOffice of Management and Budget.\n  According to an April 1995 study by the Institute for Regulatory \nPolicy, of the 222 major EPA rules issued from April to September 1994, \nonly six passed cost-benefit analysis muster.\n  The rest were promulgated anyway. So we see there is a need to assure \nagency compliance, because when they will not listen to their own \nPresident, or their own Presidents through the years, imagine how they \nwill not listen to us if we do not go into a compliance process \ntogether.\n  Of the 510 regulatory actions published during this period, this \nperiod of April to September of 1994, 465 were not even reviewed by the \nOffice of Management and Budget; and of the 45 rules that were \nreviewed, not one--not one, not a single one--was returned to the \nagency for having failed the obligatory cost-benefit analysis. They \ncall this regulatory reform?\n  Moreover, section 624 not only requires, like the Glenn substitute, \nthat ``benefits of the rule justify the costs of the rule,'' but unlike \nthe Glenn substitute, it also requires that the rule must achieve the \n``least cost alternative'' of any of the reasonable alternatives facing \nthe agency, or if the ``public interest'' requires it, the lowest cost \nalternative taking into consideration scientific or economic \nuncertainty or unquantifiable benefits.\n  Now, this does two things. No. 1, it assures that the least \nburdensome rule will be promulgated; No. 2, that agencies are not \nstraitjacketed, when facing scientific or economic uncertainties or \nbenefits that cannot be quantified, into promulgating a rule based on \nan option that is only the least costly in the short-term. In the \nlatter situation, agencies may explicitly take these factors into \naccount when considering the least cost alternative when promulgating a \nrule.\n  What about the effect on existing law? Section 624 of 343 provides \nthat its cost-benefit decisional criteria ``supplement\" the decisional \ncriteria for rulemaking applicable under the statute granting the \nrulemaking authority.\n  This supplement requirement is applicable except when an underlying \nstatute mandates that a rule to protect health, safety, or the \nenvironment be \n\n[[Page S 10089]]\npromulgated, and the agency rule cannot, applying in the standard in \nthe text of the statute, satisfy the cost-benefit criteria of section \n624.\n  In such a case, the agency taking action may promulgate the rule but \nmust choose the regulatory alternative meeting the requirements of the \nunderlying statute that imposes the lowest cost. In this way, agencies \nare given great latitude in promulgating cost-effective rules. Thus, S. \n343 strongly supplements existing law but does not embody a \nsupermandate.\n  This was made absolutely clear in a bipartisan amendment adopted last \nweek. In contrast, the Glenn amendment only requires agencies to \njustify costs in those situations where such requirement is not \nexpressly or implicitly ``inconsistent with\" the underlying statute. \nThis allows agencies to select any costly or burdensome option \nallowable under the underlying statute.\n  What about judicial review? Could it not be argued that while Glenn \ndoes not contain a decisional criteria section, forcing agencies to \nabide by cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment criteria, its \njudicial review provision assures that agencies will comply with that \nbill's albeit weak cost-benefit analysis requirement. The answer is, \nunfortunately, no.\n  While both S. 343 and the Glenn bill basically only allow for \nadministrative procedure action ``arbitrary and capricious\" review of \nthe final, and not independent review of a cost-benefit analysis and a \nrisk assessment, the Glenn judicial review section contains a provision \nthat perhaps inadvertently could be construed to prohibit a court from \nconsidering a faulty cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment in \ndetermining if a rule passes arbitrary and capricious muster.\n  That provision expressly states that ``if an analysis or assessment \nhas been performed, the court shall not review to determine whether the \nanalysis or assessment conform to the particular requirements of this \nchapter.''\n  This means that a poorly or sloppily done cost-benefit analysis or \nrisk assessment could avoid judicial scrutiny even if material to the \noutcome of a rule, because the Glenn judicial review section literally \nstates that the bill's ``requirements\" for analysis and assessment are \nnot reviewable.\n  Now, that is serious. That is a critical difference on the judicial \nreview aspects of these two approaches, S. 343 and the Glenn substitute \namendment.\n  Another significant reform contained in S. 343 but missing in the \nGlenn bill is the petition process. While critics of S. 343 contend \nthat the bill's petition processes are too many and overlapping, I \nbelieve that the bill's petition provisions are workable, not at all \nburdensome, and empower that part of the American public affected by \nexisting burdensome regulations to challenge rules that have not been \nsubject to S. 343's cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment \nrequirements.\n  For instance, in section 623, the requirement for agency review of \nexisting rules, the petition provision allows for either placing the \nrule on the agency schedule for review, or in effect to accelerate \nagency review of rules already on the agency's schedule for review. The \npetitioner has a significant burden to justify that the requested \nrelief is necessary. I might add that this provision was a product of \nnegotiations between Senators Kerry, Levin, Biden, Johnston, Roth, \nNickles, Murkowski, Bond, Dole, and myself.\n  One other petition provision that I want to mention is section 629, \nwhich allows for the petitioner to seek an alternative means to comply \nwith the requirements of a rule. This allows for needed flexibility \nthat will save industry untold amounts of money and having to comply \nwith sometimes irrational requirements, without weakening the \nprotection of health, safety, or the environment.\n  In this way, agencies are given great latitude in promulgating cost-\neffective rules. In this way, agencies can do a better job.\n  Moreover, the following provisions of S. 343 are much better than \ntheir counterpart provisions in Senator Glenn's.\n  Risk assessment provisions: S. 343 applies its risk assessment and \nrisk characterization principles to all agency major rules. The Glenn \namendment, by sharp contrast, limits even the applicability of the risk \nassessment and risk characterization principles to major rules \npromulgated by certain listed agencies and it contains no decisional \nrequirements for risk assessments.\n  Emergency provisions: The Dole-Johnston bill contains exemptions for \nimposition of the notice and comment, cost-benefit analysis, and risk \nassessment requirements. When an emergency arises where a threat to \npublic health and safety arises, these provisions would allow for a \nrule that addresses these concerns to promptly go into effect. There is \nabsolutely no delay. The government can protect our health and safety \nin all of these cases, including the red herring of E. coli. The Glenn \nsubstitute, on the other hand, only contains one exemption, and that is \nfor risk assessments.\n  As I pointed out last Friday, this contains an element of irony. The \nsupporters of the Glenn measure have complained endlessly how S. 343 \nwould prevent the agencies from protecting the public from E. coli \nbacteria present in bad meat, or cryptosporidium in drinking water, and \nhave screamed that rules addressing these problems be exempt from S. \n343.\n  Of course, S. 343's emergency provisions adequately deal with the \nproblem. But Glenn does not. There is not even similar language.\n  Where are the equivalent provisions in the Glenn substitute? Does the \nGlenn substitute exempt these types of rules from cost-benefit \nanalysis? No. It is apparent, Mr. President, that the Dole-Johnston \nmeasure is a superior vehicle for regulatory reform. I ask my \ncolleagues to vote against the Glenn ``reg lite'' bill and support the \nreal thing. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, last week I took the floor to reply to some \nof the top 10 silly regulations that the Senator from Utah had brought \nup last week. We found, upon investigation, that of some of those silly \nregulations last week there were, probably a good half of them, I do \nnot know the exact number, but probably half of them I gave responses \nto that showed that the so-called silly regulations were not \nregulations at all and were, in some cases, municipal or State \nregulations that were being somehow tossed over into the Federal \nbailiwick of responsibility. And I gave real details on that, and it \ncaused considerable concern on the other side of the aisle, I \nunderstand.\n  I do not know the regulations that were cited this morning, how they \noriginated or what their backgrounds are, but I hope we have better \nsubstantiation for the ones given this morning than we did for the ones \nlast week. If we wish to take up our time here going through those, we \ncan do that again like the ones that were put in last week. But we \nfound in many of the cases mentioned they were not Federal regulations \nat all. There was no requirement in Federal law for some of the things \nthat Federal regulators were being credited with doing.\n  So what we are trying to do is bring some common sense to this \nregulatory process. I have said many times during this debate, \nregulatory reform is probably the most important issue we will take up \nthis year, outside of the actual appropriations bills, because it \naffects every person in this Chamber today, whether on the floor, in \nthe gallery, every person outside, every man, woman, child, every \nbusiness, every organization across the whole United States of America. \nSo regulatory reform is one of the most important items.\n  The American people want regulatory reform. I want regulatory reform. \nI believe the vast majority of Members of Congress do. I do not know of \nanybody who does not want regulatory reform. When we go back to our \nStates, the horror stories we hear every time are about some of the \nrules and regulations that are too heavyhanded and too intrusive, so we \nneed to correct those things. The question is, how will we correct \nthem? If we are drowning in red tape, how do we correct it?\n  I have made no effort to retain the status quo, in spite of what was \nsaid this morning. Quite the opposite. I do not want to retain the \nstatus quo. That is the reason why we worked 2\\1/2\\ years on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee to try to get responsible regulatory \nreform legislation ready. We have \n\n[[Page S 10090]]\nheard a lot of talk about specific instances of regulatory excess. And, \nas I have pointed out, many of these stories are just factually not \ntrue. But even for those that may be true, let us make sure that the \nmedicine we prescribe is not worse than the illness we want to cure. \nIndividual instances of excess do not justify bogging down our \nGovernment with equally excessive bureaucratic procedures and \nlitigation, and that is what I fear the proponents of S. 343 are giving \nus.\n  Instead of making Government more cumbersome, more bureaucratic, and \nmore expensive, we should be working to make the regulatory process \nmore effective, more efficient, and less burdensome. Regardless of our \ndebates about process, about how Federal agencies should make \ndecisions, we must not forget what the process is all about. The \nregulatory process is about protecting the public interest. It is about \nimplementing the laws that we in Congress pass. It is about providing \nfor the common good, protecting public health and safety, preserving \nthe environment, and making this country a land of opportunity for all \nand, at the same time, correcting regulatory excesses to make sure that \nthose just do not happen. That is a balance. It is a balance that we \nhave to seek and it is a balance that I think we have addressed in S. \n1001, which was laid down last Friday afternoon.\n  That is why, as we debate how to reform the regulatory process, we \nmust ask ourselves two essential questions--basically what I stated a \nmoment ago. First, does the bill before us provide for reasonable and \nappropriate changes to regulatory procedures to eliminate unnecessary \nburdens on businesses and individuals and organizations and everyone \nall over this country? And, second, does the bill maintain our ability \nto protect the environment and the health and the safety of our people? \nIn other words, does the legislation strike an appropriate balance? \nThat is what we have to find in this debate--is the balance.\n  If we find the proper balance, there will be broad support for this \neffort. However, if we produce a bill that relieves regulatory burdens \nbut threatens protections for the American people in health and in \nsafety or the environment, the legislation should be opposed.\n  Today we will focus our debate on two bills, the Dole-Johnston \nsubstitute and the Glenn-Chafee substitute to that substitute. Both \nwill transform the regulatory process, but I am convinced that the \nDole-Johnston substitute goes too far. I believe that only the Glenn-\nChafee substitute will reform the regulatory process in a way that \nmeets my tests just outlined. The Glenn-Chafee bill will relieve \nburdens and maintain an efficient and effective process to protect \npublic health and safety and the environment.\n  Before I discuss the differences between the two bills, I want to \nreview the debate of last week, because I believe that this past week's \ndebate alone, just standing by itself, makes the case for the Glenn-\nChafee substitute.\n  Proponents of the Dole-Johnston substitute have repeatedly stated \nthat their bill is a good bill, that their bill went through a long \nprocess of improvement before coming to the floor, and that it is ready \nfor enactment. But I believe our activities on the Senate floor last \nweek proved otherwise. When confronted with the challenge that their \nbill would threaten important health and safety rules--impending rules, \nnow, not just something thought about for the future, but important \npending health and safety rules such as those for food safety, drinking \nwater, mammograms--the proponents of Dole-Johnston first denied that \ntheir bill would compromise those regulations. Then they tried to add \ngeneral and symbolic exemptions just in case, like the sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution that was supposed to be a substitute for the Boxer \namendment protecting mammogram rules. But when all the votes were done, \nwe see that they voted against meat and poultry inspection rules, \nputting the American people at risk due to the dangers of E. coli and \nother foodborne diseases; and that they voted against drinking water \nsafety rules. But we see that they voted for mammogram rules and for \nchild poisoning protection rules.\n  I do not think my colleagues value food and drinking water safety \nless than women's or children's health. What I really think is that the \nproponents of the Dole-Johnston bill have yet to come to terms with the \nfact that their bill fails my test. It may reduce regulatory burdens--\nit will do that--but it will also jeopardize public health and safety \nand the environment. In other words, it does not hit the balance that I \nspoke about earlier.\n  They say their bill will not harm the public but they are not really \nsure. I am sure that the Glenn-Chafee substitute will protect the \npublic and reduce regulatory burdens, and I say we should support that \nGlenn-Chafee substitute.\n  When it came time last week to discuss the effect of their bill on \nthe implementation of current laws, again we saw confusion and \nuncertainty. Throughout the negotiations, prior to coming to the floor, \nand during the first hours of debate, the proponents again and again \ndenied that their bill contained a supermandate--that is, a prevision \nthat would have economic cost-benefit analyses override other statutory \nrequirements if there was any conflict between the two.\n  Those other statutory requirements are things like clean air, clean \nwater, and worker safety. Even so, they refused to add language to \nclearly state that assertion, that in a case of a conflict between the \ncost-benefit test and the statutory requirement, the underlying statute \nwould prevail. In other words, there would not be a supermandate that \nsaid: If there is a conflict, that the earlier law would be knocked \nout. Their provision would have provided that, if there was a conflict \nbetween the rule that came up and a previous law passed by the \nCongress, signed by the President, and in effect all over this country, \nthe underlying statute could be knocked out by a regulation.\n  Finally, on the floor an amendment appears from the proponents to do \njust that, to say that if there is a conflict between the cost-benefit \ntest and the statutory requirement, that the underlying statute would \nprevail. Again, I have to ask why was the Dole-Johnston bill brought to \nthe floor in the form it was? The proponents insisted it was in fine \nshape and provided just the right amount of reform, but when pressed on \nthe floor, their arguments went both ways and the weaknesses of the \nbill, their bill, were revealed.\n  When it came time to discuss what their bill covers, again we saw \nconfusion and inconsistency. Their bill provided the proper threshold, \nthey said--a major rule should be a rule with an annual effect of $50 \nmillion or more. On Monday, the first day of debate, that threshold \nwas, however, lowered even further with the addition of significant, \nwhat are called significant rules, under the Regulatory Flexibility \nAct. This will add between 500 and 800 rules to the agency cost-benefit \nprocess.\n This was an incredible expansion of coverage. It could quadruple the \nnumber of rules that agencies have to put through detailed analysis.\n\n  The very next day an amendment was passed, which I supported, to \nraise the threshold from the $50 million figure to $100 million. But \nthe problem is that the amendments are inconsistent. It makes no sense \nto say that we have restricted the scope of the bill to a more \nreasonable threshold--$100 million overall economic impact on the \ncountry--when the threshold at the same time had just been lowered to \ninclude hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of more rules.\n  I simply do not understand how my colleagues can think that agencies \nin a time of falling budgets and full-time employees--FTE's--will be \nable to effectively perform the duties that we give them. Yes, you have \nto remember that we in Congress passed the laws that require agency \naction. I add that some 80 percent of the regulations written are \nrequired in the laws that we sent over to the agencies to have the \nregulations written.\n  Now those agencies will have to spend scarce resources on analyzing \nrules that do not have a significant impact on the Nation as a whole. \nThis is simply a mistake. They cannot do something with nothing. We are \ncutting their budgets with fewer full-time employees and at same time \nloading them up with new policies that must be done, new analyses--that \nI favor but not the expansion that was done on the \n\n[[Page S 10091]]\nfloor--in the numbers of overall reviews that have to be made. We need \nto stick with the higher threshold, and that is it. That is manageable.\n  Agencies need to be more sensitive to the burdens that Government \nplaces on small business. I also add that is what the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act is all about. Thinking that businesses somehow are \nbeing overregulated is not something new. We passed the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act I believe back in 1972 or 1973. It was supposed to \naddress some of this problem.\n  Let me repeat that agencies need to be more sensitive to the burdens \nthat Government places on small business. That is what the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act is all about. But requiring agencies to go through \nlengthy analyses for nearly every rule that comes under that act is \njust too much. We will end up with a Government that spends more money \nand more time, and has less and less to show for it.\n  If the proponents of Dole-Johnston are trying to make it much harder \nto issue regulations, regulations that we in Congress often require--\nrequire as much as 80 percent of the time--then this is the way to do \nit. If they want to make it harder to issue rules that protect the \nhealth and safety of the American people, this is the way to do it.\n  Let me just observe that two major supporters of the Dole-Johnston \nsubstitute, Senator Johnston and Senator Roth, did not support the \nexpansion of the bill to cover regulatory flexibility rules. So I hope \nwe can still address this problem in a reasonable way and maybe work \nout something on that before we come to a final vote on this \nlegislation.\n  Finally, let me mention the issue of sunshine. On Thursday, my \namendment to the Dole-Johnston substitute to provide for sunshine in \nthe OMB regulatory review process was accepted. I was very happy that \namendment was accepted. It was not just passed by a vote. It was \naccepted unanimously. That was very good because it shows support for \nan important component of reasonable regulatory reform. This sunshine \nprovision came from the bipartisan Governmental Affairs Committee bill, \nthe bill sponsored by my good friend from Delaware, Senator Roth. The \nprovision is also contained in the Glenn-Chafee bill.\n  The problem is that for the last 2 months we have repeatedly urged \nthose Senators involved in crafting the Dole-Johnston substitute to \nincorporate that sunshine provision. Despite our requests we were \nturned down at every turn. The latest rejection came last Wednesday, \nJuly 12, when we finally got a response to our June 28 list of 9 major \nand 23 minor issues with the Dole-Johnston bill. We were told then that \nwe would have an answer. We do not have a full answer yet. But we did \nget a response to our June 28 list of 9 major and 23 minor issues with \nthe Dole-Johnston bill. But then the next day, on Thursday, July 13, \nwhen confronted with the sunshine provision as an actual amendment, \nsuddenly it was fine. Suddenly it was acceptable.\n  I have a lot of respect for the intelligence and good faith and \nlegislative abilities of the proponents of the Dole-Johnston \nsubstitute. I must admit I do not understand the thinking that goes \ninto developing a legislative proposal of such great complexity and far \nreaching impact in a closed room dismissing compromise proposals out of \nhand and insisting that the bill should be passed, and then on the \nfloor accepting some of the very proposals that were earlier rejected \nall the while maintaining that no changes are needed.\n  I have not changed the stand I took, along with Senator Roth and our \nother colleagues in the Governmental Affairs Committee 3 months ago. I \nbelieve we had a tough but workable regulatory reform bill in S. 291. \nThat bill provides the basis for the Glenn-Chafee substitute that I \nthink should be supported now. So my position has not changed. Of \ncourse, there is always room for improvement in any bill. We modified \nGlenn-Chafee to reflect improvements that we have seen over the last \nseveral weeks. But on the basic provisions of the bill, my position is \nclear. It has been consistent.\n  With the proponents of the Dole-Johnston substitute I think the story \nis different. I believe the truth is they are finally realizing that \ntheir bill is flawed, weighted with ill-thought-through provisions that \nwill frustrate the very reform that they say they want to accomplish.\n  I believe my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Johnston, has \naccomplished significant changes in S. 343 in the month or so that he \nhas been working with the majority leader and the Senator from Utah, \nSenator Hatch. I also believe Senator Johnston deserves a great deal of \ncredit for his commitment to regulatory reform, and for his tireless \nefforts to improve S. 343. He has been involved in regulatory reform \nfor a number of years, and that has had pieces of legislation passed \nhere on the Senate floor before. But if nothing else, his constant \npresence on the floor over the last week, and the detailed personal \nknowledge he has of the bill, shows his commitment and expertise. I \ncertainly commend him for his effort. I believe the product, though, is \nstill flawed, too unwieldy, too unworkable to provide the reform that \nwe all believe is necessary and needed for the regulatory process. I \nthink last week's debate highlighted a number of these differences.\n  To bring the debate to the present, I would like to describe the \nmajor differences that I see between the Dole-Johnston bill, as \nmodified this past Friday, and the Glenn-Chafee substitute.\n  The Dole-Johnston substitute is based on the Judiciary Committee's \nbill that emerged from a divisive committee proceeding that was cut \nshort before the bill could be fully debated. The Glenn-Chafee \nsubstitute is based on the Governmental Affairs Committee's unanimous \nbipartisan legislation. S. 291 which was sponsored by Senator Roth, the \nchairman of our committee, and fully debated in committee. Nothing was \ncut short there. It was fully debated before it was voted out with \neight Republican votes and seven Democrat votes. It was a unanimous \ncommittee vote.\n  An examination of the two committee reports shows the differences \nbetween those two bills. The Governmental Affairs report had a \nunanimous bipartisan discussion of a tough but workable approach to \nregulatory reform. The Judiciary report is divided and filled with \ndivergent views, and they have never been reconciled yet.\n  I believe that these two reports tell us why we are in the posture we \nare in today. Instead of choosing the path of bipartisan dialog and \ncooperation, the proponents of S. 343 chose to push ahead with what I \nview as an extreme bill. All the effort of Senator Johnston to moderate \nthat bill--and again he has accomplished much--has not altered the \nfundamental nature of that bill. As I have said previously during this \ndebate, the result is a bill tailored to special interests, and is a \nlawyer's dream.\n It does not, in my view, meet the goals of at the same time protecting \nhealth and safety or of having a more effective and efficient \nGovernment.\n\n  Yes, we want agencies to have more thoughtful and less burdensome \nrules, but we also want agencies to be effective. The American public \ndoes not want the Federal Government to be more inefficient or to have \nimportant public protections delayed or bogged down in red tape, delay \nand courtroom argument. That is why Senator Chafee, myself and several \nothers offered an alternative bill just before the last recess, and it \nwas laid down here before the Senate last Friday as a substitute.\n  Our substitute bill, S. 1001, is based on that same Governmental \nAffairs Committee bill, S. 291, that was reported out with full \nbipartisan support. It provides for tough but fair reform. It will \nrequire agencies to do cost-benefit analyses and risk assessments, but \nit will not tie up all their resources unnecessarily. It does not \nprovide for special interest fixes, and it does not create a lawyer's \ndream. It provides for reasonable, fair, and tough reform.\n  Since introducing the bill, we have incorporated additional changes \nto reflect agreed upon improvements arrived at during negotiations and \ndebate on the underlying bill.\n  This is a very complex matter. We do not necessarily claim we have \nthe very last word on every detail, and we look forward to suggestions \nfor improvement. We do think our approach is much more workable than \nthe Dole-Johnston substitute and that our substitute provides the \nbetter approach for reform. \n\n[[Page S 10092]]\n\n  Now, that is a little bit on the background, and that brings us to \ntoday. After a week of debate and amendments as well as the \nnegotiations that preceded floor action, the Dole-Johnston substitute \nhas been modified in a number of ways. There are, however, major issues \nthat still distinguish the two bills and recommend support for the \nGlenn-Chafee substitute.\n  In my mind, there are five major areas of difference remaining. First \nis the issue of how agencies should use regulatory analysis. We believe \nthat agencies should be required to perform risk assessments and cost-\nbenefit analyses for all major rules. These analyses should inform \nagency decisionmaking --inform agency decisionmaking. They should not \nunilaterally control those decisions and impose least-cost solutions to \nevery problem. Let us put some common sense into this process. We \nshould not unilaterally control those decisions and impose least-cost \nsolutions to every problem.\n  Second is the question of look back. We believe that agencies should \nreview existing rules, those that have been in effect, some for a long \ntime, but their reviews should not be dictated by special interests or \nlead to wasteful litigation.\n  Third is a matter of judicial review. The courts should be used to \nensure that final agency rules are based on adequate analysis. \nRegulatory reform should not be a lawyer's dream with unending ways for \nspecial interests to bog down agencies in litigation.\n  Fourth is the concern about special interests. Regulatory reform \nshould provide a new, across-the-board process for Federal agency \ndecisionmaking. It should not provide program fixes for special \ninterests.\n  Fifth is the implementation of the new reforms. In a nutshell, this \nis the issue of effective date. More broadly, however, it involves the \nquestion of whether we want to implement reforms in a way that improves \nGovernment decisions or whether we want to impose new requirements in \norder to frustrate decisions, create more delay, waste resources, \nintroduce uncertainty and open up new avenues for litigation. I believe \nthat implementation of the Glenn-Chafee substitute will improve \ndecisionmaking and reduce burdens on the American public. The Dole-\nJohnston substitute, on the other hand, has the potential to create \nproblems, cost money, and harm the public interest.\n  If we could resolve these five sets of issues, we could establish for \nthe first time a governmentwide comprehensive regulatory reform \nprocess. This process would produce better, less burdensome and fewer \nregulations. It would also provide the protections for the public \ninterest that the American people demand of their Government and that \nthey have a right to expect from their Government.\n  S. 343 does not follow these principles. Instead, it does special \nfavors for a special few. In so doing, it creates a process that will \ndelay important decisions, waste taxpayer dollars, enrich lawyers and \nlobbyists, undermine protections for health, safety, and the \nenvironment and further erode public confidence in government.\n  Now, let me talk about each one of these five major issue areas. The \nfirst issue is the question of the use of regulatory analysis. We \nbelieve that agencies should perform risk assessment and cost-benefit \nanalyses for all major rules. As I have already said, the threshold for \na major rule should be a $100 million economic impact. If it includes \nmore rules, as the Dole-Johnston substitute now does, it will fail its \nown cost-benefit test, and we will just waste Government resources \ninstead of reforming Government. Once undertaken, the cost-benefit \nanalyses and risk assessments should be used to inform agency \ndecisionmaking.\n  We all agree that regulatory decisions will be improved if Federal \nagencies routinely use consistent economic and scientific analysis to \ntest their proposals. The question is, should that analysis control \nagency decisions, as under the Dole-Johnston approach, by requiring \nthat the agency choose the least-cost solution to every problem--the \nleast-cost solution to every problem.\n  We had examples last week in the Chamber. If something costs $2 more \nbut saves 200 lives, would it be worth that excess cost? Yes, it would. \nRight now, you could not do that, as this is worded, as I understand \nit. You have to have a least-cost solution.\n  I simply do not believe we always want the agencies to take the \ncheapest path to implement our laws. What if that alternative that \ncosts $2 extra saves 200 lives? Do we say pick the cheapest; do not \nlook at the benefits of the alternatives before you? That is what S. \n343 does.\n  What if the cheapest alternative imposes more costs on State and \nlocal governments? Or what if it imposes more costs on small business, \nor a specific region of our country, a certain section of our Nation? \nDo we want to stop agencies from considering such distributional \neffects?\n  I think we have to let agencies use common sense. We keep saying that \nis what regulatory reform is all about. If so, then agencies should be \nable to choose the most cost-effective approach--the cost-effective \napproach we use in the Glenn-Chafee bill, looking not just at cost but \nalso at the benefits. Remember, if for some reason we in Congress do \nnot agree with the agency's solution, the congressional review \nprovisions of both bills, S. 343 and S. 1001, allow us to rescind that \nrule by bringing it back to Congress for further action. That is \nsomething that has not been done in the past. We have that provision in \nboth of these bills. So should we not create a process that allows for \ngood decisions and a way to catch the bad ones rather than to create a \nprocess that ensures there probably will be bad decisions in the first \nplace?\n  The Glenn-Chafee substitute requires the analysis of costs and \nbenefits. It requires agencies to certify whether benefits justify the \ncosts and to explain if those benefits do not justify the costs.\n In other words, Glenn-Chafee uses cost-benefit analysis to improve \ndecisions, but it does not give important decisions over to a \nmechanical economic analysis. Too much is at stake with Government \ndecisions to simply rely on a least-cost approach to protecting the \npublic interest.\n\n  Let me point out here that the Dole-Johnston substitute also creates \nconfusion with its Regulatory Flexibility Act decisional criteria. \nSection 604 is amended by adding a requirement that agencies not issue \na rule unless it minimizes the economic impact ``to the maximum extent \npossible'' on small entities; that is, small businesses, State and \nlocal governments, and other small organizations.\n  The least-cost-alternative test in this minimal impact test will \nprobably conflict quite often. Least cost overall may often involve \nmore than the lowest cost possible for small entities. As brought to \nthe floor, the Dole-Johnston substitute simply did not address this \ninherent contradiction. As now amended, there is something of a fix. \nAgencies are to explain whenever the tests are in conflict but can go \nforward. My personal opinion is this is still not enough.\n  To create a standard for governmentwide rulemaking that says, \n``Choose the alternative that is the absolute cheapest for small \nbusiness and other small entities,'' is to me to turn away from common \nsense, away from traditional notions of administrative law and reasoned \ndecisionmaking and to create a lengthy analytic process that, again, is \ngeared to the cheapest solution, not the most cost-effective solution.\n  The Regulatory Flexibility Act was designed to ensure that agencies \nconsider more flexible and less burdensome alternatives for small \nentities. The Dole-Johnston substitute would turn that important \npurpose around and let it govern decisionmaking. I am all for looking \nout for the interest of small business and State and local governments, \nbut American public interest is broader than that. Protecting public \nhealth and safety and the environment, for example, requires a broad \nview of what works best for the Nation as a whole, not just for some.\n  That brings us back, once again, to the issue of balance that we are \nlooking for.\n  The second major issue is the question of lookback. We believe that \nagencies should review existing rules, but their reviews should not be \ndictated by special interests or lead to wasteful litigation. \nRegulatory reform is not just about improving new rules. It must also \nlook back and help existing \n\n[[Page S 10093]]\nrules, existing laws that currently govern so many activities in our \ncountry. So we all agree that agencies should use cost-benefit analysis \nand risk assessment to look back and review existing regulations to \neliminate outdated, duplicative and unnecessary rules and to reform and \nstreamline others.\n  This process should be fair and open with plenty of opportunity for \npublic comment, so that those who are interested in particular rules \ncan make their concerns known to the agency. But this review should not \nbe dictated by special interests, and I believe this is what would \nhappen should the Dole-Johnston substitute become law. It would create \na number of petition processes. That is an innocuous sounding phrase, \n``petition processes.'' It would create a number of petition processes \nthat has the potential of gridlocking agencies and putting special \ninterests and the courts, not the agencies and the executive branch, in \ncharge of the review.\n  The Dole-Johnston substitute uses a petition process to put rules on \na schedule for review, and if the agency grants the petition, it has to \nreview the rule in 3 years, which is a very short timeframe for such \nmatters. If it fails to review the rule in that time, the rule \nautomatically sunsets, goes out of existence. It just automatically \nsunsets. This process, it seems to me, puts the petitioner in the \ndriver's seat, not the agency or the Congress who passed the law in the \nfirst place. It also creates a process more prone to just killing \nregulation than creating a thoughtful, balanced review of regulations.\n  In addition to the review petitions, the Dole-Johnston substitute has \nseveral other petitions for ``any interested party\" to challenge an \nagency on any rule, not just major rules. This is another example of \nthe lawyer's-dream approach taken under this bill.\n  People could petition for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of any \nrule. They could petition for the amendment or repeal of an \ninterpretive rule or general statement of policy or guidance, and they \ncould petition for the interpretation of the meaning of a rule, \ninterpretive rule, general statement of policy or guidance. That is a \nmighty big list of things that could be petitioned under S. 343.\n  Just to add to the confusion, the bill also has a separate section, \nsection 629, for petitions for alternative compliance. Any person \nsubject to a major rule can petition an agency to modify or waive the \nspecific requirements of a major rule and to allow the person to \ndemonstrate compliance through alternative means not permitted by the \nrule. In addition, it adds yet another petition process in section 634 \nso that interested persons may petition an agency to conduct a \nscientific review of a risk assessment.\n  Each agency decision on every one of these petitions, except that \npetition for alternative compliance, is judicially reviewable. What a \ndream for lawyers. At any step along the way, in other words, they can \nbring a suit for any one of the list of things I mentioned. All of \nthese petitions and reviews add up to one of the worst parts of this \nbill. It is a formula for true gridlock. Agencies will have to spend \nenormous resources responding to each other and every petition. Then \nthey can be dragged to court if they turn down a petition.\n  So I do not feel this comes close to being real regulatory reform. \nThis is regulatory and judicial gridlock, and this is the way to keep \nthe agencies from doing their jobs and to keep lawyers happy and, I \nwould add, extremely prosperous. This bill would make all the rhetoric \nabout tort reform a big joke, except in this case judicial gridlock \nmeans the health and safety of the American people would be \njeopardized.\n  Mr. President, I think sometimes people think that a regulation is \nput out by the agencies with a little bit of effort and very few people \ninvolved. They do not understand why the delay and why they are so \ncomplex. We gave an example on the floor the other day.\n  Just one regulation pursuant to the Clean Water Act that dealt with \nsome of the metal fabricating areas, just one regulation covers, now \nthat it is in place and it has been finalized, covers 123 feet of shelf \nspace. That is a pile of documents from the well, right here in the \nSenate, to the ceiling, which is 42\\1/2\\ feet, we found out from the \nCapitol Architect. That is three piles of documents from the well to \nthe ceiling. Three piles of documents to implement one regulation, and \nunder the Clean Water Act there are hundreds of regulations like that.\n  So we are not talking about something that is just a little thing--\nwell, we can just throw that over at the agencies and they can handle \nthat OK, they can grind these out OK. That was one regulation written \nto a small part of what was addressed in the Clean Water Act.\n  So these are not small things. When we talk about upping the cost for \neach regulation that would have to be written by some $500,000 to \n$800,000, I think is what the estimate was made last week on the floor, \nand we had testimony before the committee at one time that each \nregulation averages out, or can average out, around $700,000 per \nregulation to get it implemented.\n  We begin to see that this is no small matter. Now, these petitions \nthat we were addressing here--each agency decision on every one of \nthese petitions, except that petition for alternative compliance I \nmentioned, is judicially reviewable. That is an absolute dream for the \nlawyers. All of these petitions and reviews add up to one of the worst \nparts of the bill--that is, it is a formula for true gridlock. Agencies \nare going to have to spend enormous resources responding to each \npetition. They can be dragged to court if they turn down a petition--\njust a petition. It does not come close to being real regulatory \nreform. It is regulatory and judicial gridlock. It opens up to those \nwho would thwart a particular piece of regulation that might be in the \npublic good. They can thwart it and stop it dead in its tracks by \nkeeping it in court. So this is a way to keep agencies from doing their \njobs and to keep lawyers happy and prosperous. So all this tort reform \nbecomes a big joke if this type of thing goes into effect.\n  Now, while the Dole-Johnston substitute creates a recipe for \ngridlock, the Glenn-Chafee approach provides a workable process of \nreview. Every 5 years, agencies will have to produce a 10-year schedule \nof rules to be reviewed. Opportunities for public comment will identify \nrules that the agency may not think is pressing. While there is no \npetition process or judicial review, our process allows Congress to add \nrules to the agency schedule. In other words, if we think their \npriority review of existing rules and regulations is not what it should \nbe, Congress can add rules to that agency's schedule.\n  Now, I must admit that I am not 100 percent happy with using the \nannual appropriations process, as we are proposing, to amend these \nschedules. I would be happy to consider alternatives. But the critical \npoint is that we provide for amendments to the review schedules without \nbogging down agencies into the lengthy petition and judicial \nproceedings created under Dole-Johnston.\n  I think that is the key point. We want review. We want a review that \nis sensitive to the complaints of people covered by the rules, but we \ndo not want gridlock. We want Government to keep working so that we can \nhave more effective and more efficient protections of public health and \nsafety and the environment.\n  The third major issue that distinguishes the Dole-Johnston substitute \nfrom the Glenn-Chafee substitute involves judicial review. The courts \nshould be used to ensure that final agency rules are based on adequate \nanalysis. Regulatory reform should not be a lawyer's dream, with \nunending ways for special interests to bog down agencies in litigation. \nWe firmly believe in the courts' role in determining whether a rule is \narbitrary or capricious. The Glenn-Chafee substitute authorizes \njudicial review of determinations of two things--whether a rule is \nmajor and therefore subject to the requirements of the legislation. \nAlso, it allows review of the whole rulemaking record, which would \ninclude any cost-benefit and risk assessment documents.\n  In other words, it allows review of the final rules at the final \nstage before that can be taken to court to see whether all of the \nrequirements of cost-benefit and risk assessment have been provided. We \nshould not, however, provide unnecessary, new avenues for technical or \nprocedural challenges that \n\n[[Page S 10094]]\ncan be used solely as impediments by affected parties to stop a rule. \nCourts should not, for example, be asked to review the sufficiency of \nan agency's preliminary cost-benefit analysis, or the use of particular \nunits of measurement for costs and benefits.\n  While courts have a vital role to play, they should not become the \narbiters of the adequacy of highly technical cost-benefit analysis or \nrisk assessment, independent of the rule itself. Thus, Glenn-Chafee \nclearly states that ``if an analysis or assessment has been performed, \nthe court shall not review to determine whether the analysis or \nassessment conformed to the particular requirements of this chapter, \nsection 623(D).''\n  I believe the way the Dole-Johnston substitute is currently drafted \nthat lawyers and the courts will get into the details of a risk \nassessment or cost-benefit analysis. I think that is a mistake. From \nwhat I understand, there has been a great deal of discussion about this \nissue, and I believe many of us want the same result. The question is \nhow to get there from here. Leaving the language as ambiguous as it is \nnow is unacceptable. That is just an invitation to litigation.\n  With all of the attention to the question of to what extent might the \ncourts get into the details of cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessment, we have not discussed enough the amendments that the Dole-\nJohnston substitute makes to the Administrative Procedure Act. I am not \na lawyer, but I know that with every statute we pass, the courts \nslowly, over the years, develop a body of case law that interprets each \nstatute. The APA is no exception. It was enacted in 1946 and, to a \ngreat extent, it has been given more meaning by the courts in the \nintervening 50 years than Congress was able to squeeze into its \nrelatively brief sections in 1946. While judicial interpretation of \nadministrative procedures continues, I am not aware of any major \ncriticisms of the APA. Certainly, the Administrative Conference has not \nproposed any major overhaul. But that is what will happen should the \nDole-Johnston substitute be enacted into law. Its amendments to the \nAPA, innocuous though they may seem to some, will usher in a whole new \ngeneration of lawsuits that will use the new legislative language to \nattack the case law that has developed around the 1946 statutory \nlanguage.\n  Adding more petition processes, requiring new details in rulemaking \nnotices, adding the phrase ``substantial support in the Record'' to the \ntraditional formulation of arbitrary and capricious, these will \ninvariably be used by lawyers to go after rules not on substantive \ngrounds but on these procedural grounds. This is not reform. This will \nrecreate a litigation explosion that will give deeper gridlock than we \ncould ever imagine.\n  Let me just add that this is one of the reasons that I believe such \nimportant pending rules as the USDA meat inspection rules--the rules \nthat are needed to protect the American people from foodborne \nillnesses, such as E. coli--should be exempted from Dole-Johnston. \nIndependent of its cost-benefit analysis, all the supporting evidence, \nprocedural steps, rulemaking notices, and more will all be open to \nchallenge in the courts under these APA amendments.\n  Again, this is not reform. This is a lawyer's dream and a potential \nnightmare for the American people. I am sure my colleagues, Senator \nLevin and Senator Biden, both excellent lawyers, will go into this \nissue. But it seems to me that these unneeded amendments to the APA \nalone are reason enough to oppose the Dole-Johnston substitute.\n  The fourth major difference between the two bills is the concern \nabout special interest. Regulatory reform should provide a new across-\nthe-board process for Federal agency decisionmaking. It should not \nprovide program fixes for special interests.\n  From the beginning, S. 343 has included a number of provisions that \nare not about Government-wide regulatory reform. Quite the contrary, \nthey are about giving specific relief to specific interests or stalling \nparticular programs. Frankly, I do not think these provisions have any \nplace in a regulatory reform bill that should be meant to establish a \nfair process, fair and equal to all.\n  Unlike S. 343, and unlike its revised alternative, the Dole-Johnston \nsubstitute, our bill, the Glenn-Chafee substitute, like its \npredecessor, Senator Roth's S. 291, has no such special fixes. Let me \nsay that I sympathize with those who would like to fix particular \nproblems. I know of examples where regulations go too far and where \nagencies go too far. But as testimony before our committee showed, 80 \npercent of the rules are required by Congress. It is not up to the \nagencies. We require them in the legislation that we send over. So it \nis not just the regulatory process that needs fixing. We in Congress \nare also responsible for a lot of these problems. In other words, if we \nhave a problem, we ought to look in the mirror a good part of the time.\n  Let us focus on making the regulatory process better as a whole and \nnot affix for special interest. Let me give some examples. This is not \njust idle talk. The original S. 343 tried to rewrite the Delaney \nclause. Now, I happen to think the Delaney clause needs some \nmodification, but they went too far in rewriting the Delaney clause.\n They also shut down the EPA toxic release inventory, providing \nenforcement relief for companies and so on.\n\n  Now, while I agree that some of these legitimate problems deserve our \nattention, this is not the place. A regulatory reform bill should \naddress regulatory issues. It should not become a Christmas tree for \nlobbyists to hang solutions to whatever problems they may have.\n  Over the last week, the Senate's resolution of amendments on several \nof these special fixes shows that they are divisive, unrelated to the \nbasic process reforms proposed in the legislation, and simply an \nattempt to avoid going through the appropriate legislative channels.\n  For example, the section that would delay an increased cost for \nenvironmental cleanups was stricken on the grounds that it was a \nspecific program fix unrelated to the larger process reforms, and that \nSuperfund reform is currently under consideration by the committee of \njurisdiction.\n  When it came time to consider a similar amendment to strike a section \nthat would restrict EPA's toxic release inventory, the same arguments \nwere rejected. Outside the scope of general regulatory reform--no \nmatter. More properly considered by the committee of jurisdiction--no \nmatter. Special interests want the TRI gutted--you got it.\n  This is not how we should be reforming the regulatory process. We say \nwe are creating a new, fair, and reasonable process. What we are really \nshowing the American people is that if they are a big enough company, \nthey use enough high-priced lawyers, you can fill the halls of power \nand get relief.\n  It is unfortunately clear how a majority of the body weigh the \ncommunity's right to know about the release of toxics into the \nenvironment against companies who apparently do not want companies \naround the plant to know what they are drinking and breathing.\n  The irony for me is that the TRI is perhaps the most notable example \nof a rule that is relatively inexpensive and really not that \nburdensome. It is a so-called risk communication rule. Unlike a command \nand control rule that would prohibit the use of such toxic materials, \nTRI merely requires industry to inform the communities of the release \nof such chemicals.\n  Now, do you know who cares about the TRI as much as anyone? It is \nlocal fire departments. People probably would not have thought of that, \nbut they are the men and women who have to fight the local chemical \nplant fires and clean up chemical spills, and they want to know what \nthey will face. They do not want a Bhopal, the tragedy that took place \nin India, to take place in their city or town.\n  But no matter to the proponents of S. 343. Powerful business \ninterests and their lawyers have sent the word around they do not want \nto have to comply with TRI. So it will be reworked, it will be revised, \nit will be restricted. I know what that means. I do not think the \nAmerican public comes out on top in that particular consideration.\n  These and other fixes are found in the Dole-Johnston substitute. They \nare not found in the Glenn-Chafee substitute. We stuck with the process \nof how the Government should go about regulatory reform. This is reason \nenough to support our bill. \n\n[[Page S 10095]]\n\n  The fifth and final major difference between our two bills involves \nthe implementation of the new reforms. In simple terms, this is a \nquestion of the statute's effective date. Last week, several questions \narose about the effect of reform legislation on pending rules, on \nexpected rules, and on avenues for increased litigation. I have already \ntalked at some length about these in this statement.\n  I believe if we are serious about changing the way Federal agencies \nmake regulatory decisions, if we are serious about improving those \ndecisions, about reducing burdens and improving commonsense solutions \nto pressing issues involving public health and safety and the \nenvironment, then we must have a sensible approach to implement the \nreforms.\n  The Dole-Johnston substitute, as it now stands, reaches back and \ncovers health and safety rules whose notice of proposed rulemaking \noccurred as early as April of this year. While that is supposed to let \nsome rules off the hook, it also means that should that bill become \nlaw, rules in the pipeline between April and the date of enactment \ncould be challenged in court and would have to go back to square one to \ncomply with the many requirements of the new law.\n  Now, I want to improve rulemaking. But I see no value in wasting \nresources already expended to promulgate a rule. If the rule is so bad, \na court can overturn it under current law. There is no need to reach \nback and waste Government resources. The Dole-Johnston immediate \neffective date for all other rules simply adds to this bad picture. \nChallenges will flood the courts the very next day to go after rules \ndeveloped under current law--current until the day Dole-Johnston S. 343 \nis enacted.\n  During our debate last week, proponents of the S. 343 substitute \nargued that because the Glenn-Chafee substitute does not have a broad \nexemption for health and safety rules, it is more restrictive than \nDole-Johnston in its effect on pending rules. This argument is based on \na misunderstanding of our bill.\n  We apply our reform legislation to rules that are proposed 6 months \nafter enactment. This delay gives agencies a reasonable amount of time \nto develop new procedures, bring new regulatory proposals up to the new \nstandards before they are published as proposed rules. Again, Dole-\nJohnston applies all requirements immediately.\n  Once promulgated and coming under Glenn-Chafee, rules will face \nanalytic requirements that are tough, but they are also fair and they \nare not unreasonable. Remember, we do not have the least-cost \nalternative. We do not have the least-cost alternative test or the \nminimal impact reg flex test of Dole-Johnston. We are not afraid to \nhave important rules go through our process. They will face a tough \ntest. But if they are needed, the rules will survive.\n  What they will not face are the challenges that rules under Dole-\nJohnston would face such as the new APA challenges that would be \ncreated for rulemaking procedures and substantial evidence \nrequirements.\n  The basic question is whether we want government to work better for \nthe American people or whether we want to impose new requirements in \norder to frustrate decisions, create more delay, waste resources, \nintroduce uncertainty, and open up new avenues for litigation.\n  I believe that implementation of the Glenn-Chafee substitutes will \nimprove decisionmaking and will reduce burdens on the American public.\n  The Dole-Johnston substitute, on the other hand, will create \nproblems, cost money--we do not know how much yet--and harm the public \ninterest.\n  In conclusion, I want to state again, I want regulatory reform. We \nhave worked on this in the Governmental Affairs Committee for the last \nseveral years. It is not something that came up just recently.\n  I believe that S. 343 does not provide the balanced regulatory reform \nwe should have. I believe the Glenn-Chafee S. 1001, the substitute that \nwe are proposing today, does that job.\n  In the coming hours of debate, we will focus more closely on these \ntwo alternatives. I welcome suggestions for improvement to our bill. I \nam sure there are details that can be revised. I am also sure our bill \nprovides a better approach. I urge our colleagues to support our \nsubstitute.\n  Mr. President, I reiterate, once again, these areas: The Glenn-Chafee \nsubstitute focuses on truly major rules. Glenn-Chafee substitute \nrequires cost-benefit analysis for all major rules. It does not take \nthe least-cost approach that the Dole-Johnston bill does.\n  The Glenn-Chafee substitute provides for review of current rule but \nwith no automatic sunset. If we run out to a time period and the agency \nhas not taken adequate action in the prescribed time period, then they \nmust issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to repeal the rule. In other \nwords, either approve it or put the forces in motion to repeal it, but \nallowing public comments on the rule.\n  Also, the Glenn-Chafee substitute is not a lawyer's dream. We allow \nfor judicial review of the determination of a major rule and whether \nthe final rule is arbitrary and capricious in light of the whole \nrulemaking file.\n  The Dole-Johnston bill provides procedures, petition, multitudinous \nplaces where suits can be filed to stop even the best of legislation.\n  Also, the Glenn-Chafee substitute does not create brand-new petitions \nby private persons that will eat up agency resources and let special \ninterests--not the agency or Congress--guide priorities.\n  Lastly, Glenn-Chafee substitute has no special interest provision. We \ndid not put a section in here that deals with things like the Delaney \nclause or toxic release inventory or things like that, that have a \nspecial interest to a special few.\n  For all the reasons given this morning, Mr. President, I urge support \nof the Glenn-Chafee substitute which was laid down Friday evening \nbefore we left. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, the lines in this debate are becoming \nvery, very clear. If you are for risk assessment, if you are for \nregulatory reform, you should be for the Dole-Johnston bill which is \npending. If you are against that reform, you should be for the Glenn-\nChafee substitute because, Mr. President, the Glenn-Chafee substitute \nis sham reform. Make no mistake about it, it is totally consensual. \nThere are no requirements to it. If the agency head wants to do it, it \nwill be done.\n  We are told that this is an outgrowth of the Roth bill which came out \nof committee unanimously, with both Democrats and Republicans \nsupporting it, and so it did. And it had some teeth in it. All of those \nteeth have now been removed, so now it is totally consensual.\n  We do not need a bill for consensual reform. We now have that. That \nis the problem. Right now there is a risk assessment rulemaking which \napplies to Federal agencies, but it is consensual and they do not do \nit--and that is the problem. We have been told there are all these \nlists of these rules, the top 10 list we have been talking about here \non the floor, and that some of those were not Federal rules, they were \nState rules or whatever. But what really is the problem? The problem is \nthat Federal agencies today are not doing the risk assessment, are not \ndoing the cost-benefit analysis, are not using good science, and their \nregulations are a disaster.\n  Who says so? EPA says so. In their own studies they have determined \nthat the risks which they have rules against are risks perceived by the \npublic rather than real risks. So anyone who says there is no problem \nwith rulemaking, let them go on like they are doing, let them be \nconsensual; we can trust these bureaucrats, they have done a great \njob--those who say that are not reading EPA's own documents.\n  I say this is a consensual bill. It has no teeth. What is the basis \nof saying that? If you look at section 625 of the Glenn-Chafee \nsubstitute, it says that the agency head picks the rules to be reviewed \n``in the sole discretion of the head of the agency.'' Let me repeat \nthat. According to the Glenn-Chafee substitute, the only rules to be \nreviewed are those which the agency head picks at the sole discretion \nof the agency head.\n  If there was any chance of any court reversing that discretion, that \nalso is totally removed by section 625, which says on judicial review \nthat ``judicial \n\n[[Page S 10096]]\nreview of agency action taken pursuant to the requirements of this \nsection shall be limited to review of compliance or noncompliance with \nthe requirements of this section.''\n  What does that mean? It means when you judicially review, you look at \nthat phrase ``sole discretion of the head of the agency,'' and it \ndisappears. There is no judicial review. There is sole discretion of \nthe agency. There is nothing enforceable. So if Carol Browner, the head \nof the EPA, decides she wants to review a rule she can do so. And if \nshe does not want to, guess what, Mr. President? Nobody can force her \nto do that. She can do that today. She can do that today. So why do we \nhave all these pages of bills if we are going to adopt the Glenn-Chafee \nsubstitute? What is the point of all that, if it is all going to be \nconsensual? If we think these bureaucrats are doing a great job?\n  How about new rules? First of all, let me compare that with the Roth \nbill. Under the original Roth bill, which came out unanimously, all \nrules had to be reviewed by every agency head, every single rule had to \nbe reviewed--every single major rule, $100 million, had to be reviewed. \nAnd at the end of 10 years they were sunsetted, boom, unless they were \ncontinued or modified, which, in turn, would have been a major Federal \naction or final agency action subject to judicial review.\n  So under the original Roth bill, it had sharp teeth. In fact, I think \nits teeth were maybe even a little too sharp because they had to review \nall the rules. But the fact of the matter is, all those rules were \nthere to be reviewed and they were there, there was judicial review of \nthe agency action.\n  So if you were an aggrieved party and there was one of these bad \nrules, either it was sunsetted or you had your right to come in and \nhave your say. Under the Glenn-Chafee bill, all of those rules out \nthere, which again EPA, in its own documents, says do not realistically \nreflect risk--some of them imposing hundreds of millions of dollars, \nhundreds of billions of dollars in some instances, costs on the \ntaxpayers and on citizens--you cannot get to them. You have no right to \nbe heard. You have no ability to review those rules.\n  Oh, you can call it special interest. You can say special interests \nshould not be able to come in and be heard on these rules. I can tell \nyou who pays for those rules. It is the American taxpayer. It is the \nAmerican citizen who pays for those rules.\n  How about the new rules under the Glenn-Chafee amendment? We have a \nnew provision here that says you do not have to do a cost-benefit \nanalysis if a cost-benefit analysis is ``expressly or implicitly \ninconsistent with the statute''--``expressly or implicitly inconsistent \nwith the statute.''\n  And do not forget the agency head is able to interpret the statute \nand that judgment is reversed only if it is arbitrary and capricious. \nSo a new rule comes along and the head of the agency says, ``I think \nthis is not expressly inconsistent.'' There is nothing in this new \nstatute that comes along that says you should not do a cost-benefit \nanalysis. There is nothing here that prohibits it. There is no language \non it. But I, agency head, think it is implicitly inconsistent with the \nstatute.\n  If there was ever a subjective rule, beauty in the eye of the \nbeholder, unfettered discretion in an agency head, it is found in this \nword ``implicitly'' inconsistent. Implicitly inconsistent--Mr. \nPresident, it is a hole wide enough to drive three M-1 tanks side by \nside through and never touch the sides. It does not pass the straight-\nface test. Really, ``implicitly inconsistent''? If that is not enough, \nthey have taken out the rule about the benefits justifying the costs.\n  I have told my colleagues, when we initially came up almost 2 years \nago with the first risk assessment amendment--which passed \noverwhelmingly here in the Senate--of the example of the carbon 14 rule \nwhich EPA came up with which set these limits at 0.063 of the amount of \ncarbon 14 contained in the body naturally, and they set that limit at \nthat amount. Yet, it was going to cost $2.3 billion to comply with the \nrule.\n  If there was ever an example of something that needed to be done--I \nmean you needed--they did not know what it was going to cost, and it \nwas clearly not a risk. In other words, this was over 6,000 times the \nrisk of dancing with your wife than was allowed in this carbon 14 \nprovision. But it was going to cost $2.3 billion to comply with it.\n  Why should you not have that kind of information? Why should not that \nbe there? Under this new language you do not have to certify that the \nbenefits justify the cost. All you have to do is indicate whether the \nbenefits justify the costs.\n  In other words, rather than a rigorous test that says the benefits \nought to justify the cost, all you have to do is sort of give the \ninformation whether it is or whether it is not. It does not matter in \nthe bill.\n  So, Mr. President, we have consensual legislation that does not make \nany requirements on anybody to do anything. And it is, as I say, sham \nreform.\n  Now, if you are against risk assessment, if you are against cost-\nbenefit analysis, vote for this amendment because you can feel very \nconfident that you are not going to change anything in the Federal \nGovernment, that it is going to be business as usual, that we are going \nto let the bureaucrats continue to waste the money of American \ntaxpayers and American citizens as they have in the past by the \nhundreds of billions of dollars.\n  Mr. President, there really are two bills being debated; two Dole-\nJohnston bills. One is the bill that is before the Senate. The other is \nthis fictitious bill that is misdescribed, mischaracterized, factually \nmisquoted. And let me tell you what I mean.\n  My friend from Ohio, Senator Glenn, just said that the Dole-Johnston \nbill requires the cheapest solution. He went on to say you could not \nget an alternative that cost a little more and saves 200 lives. He just \nsaid that, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, here is the decisional criterion. It says you adopt \nthe ``least cost.'' Or ``if scientific, technical, or economic \nuncertainties are nonquantifiable benefits to health, safety, or the \nenvironment, identified by the agency in the rulemaking record make a \nmore costly alternative that achieves the objectives of the statute \nappropriate and in the public interest and the agency head * * *'' \nexplains that, then you may adopt the ``more costly alternative.''\n  What are ``nonquantifiable benefits to health, safety, or the \nenvironment?'' Mr. President, the value of 200 lives is first of all a \nbenefit defined as a benefit in the bill.\n  Second, it explicitly states that you can have a more costly \nalternative; not only that, but ``scientific, technical, or economic \nuncertainties'' because the science is frequently uncertain.\n  Mr. President, it escapes me how people can continue to say that we \nrequire the ``least cost alternative'' when the plain language of the \nbill states otherwise. I mean, why can people not understand the \nEnglish language? Why can they not understand this, Mr. President? It \nis clear. And we have continually stated what that English language is.\n  The fact of the matter is that the agency head under this has \nenormous discretion. And the agency head ought to have enormous \ndiscretion. But it requires this rigorous analysis so that if there is \nuncertain science the agency head has to make an explanation of those \nconsiderations. And if it is nonquantifiable benefits to health, \nsafety, or the environment, you have to make an explanation of those \nthings. It is designed to focus the logic of the thinking of the agency \nprocess to make them focus on what it is they are trying to achieve \nbecause in the past that has not been done. We do not know. With that \ncarbon 14 regulation, we just did not know what the thinking was \nbecause they had ignored their own scientists, did not know what it was \ngoing to cost, and trotted out the regulation without any idea of what \nthey were doing.\n  Mr. President, let me turn to judicial review. The judicial review \nprovisions of the Roth amendment have changed at least twice since \nSenator Roth reported that legislation. It was changed again this \nmorning.\n  Mr. President, the fact of the matter is that the Glenn-Chafee \nsubstitute has the faults which they accuse the Dole-Johnston bill of \nhaving--which we do not have and which they do have. May I explain? \n\n[[Page S 10097]]\n\n  First of all, let me say what the problem is here. What we wanted to \nachieve all along was to have a review of the final agency action; that \nis, in most cases that will be the major rule. We wanted that to be \napproved, to be tested according to the standard of whether or not it \nis arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion. Those are the \nold standards in the Administrative Procedure Act. We wanted those \nstandards to govern the final agency action. We did not want the cost-\nbenefit analysis, or the risk assessment provisions to be independently \nreviewed so as to test them for the procedures, for the adequacy of the \nprocedures.\n  The reason we wanted the risk assessment and the cost-benefit \nanalysis to be made part of the record is because only by making them \npart of the record and considering that can you understand whether the \nfinal agency action is arbitrary and capricious. In effect, it would be \na rule of common sense.\n  Let me tell my colleagues how it might work on three rules which may \ncome up in the future. They are not proposed now. But it will give you \na good indication of what is at stake here.\n  One possible rule is electromagnetic fields, so-called EMF. EMF \nregulations could cost literally hundreds of billions of dollars \nbecause it could require the relocation of electric lines, high power \ntension lines all over this country. We have ongoing studies now, \nscientific studies, as to whether or not EMF causes cancer, and if so, \nat what levels, and to what extent. I might tell my colleagues that we \ndo that under the Energy Committee. We have been funding those studies. \nI do not want to prejudge all of them. But the preliminary studies \nindicate that the level at which people receive EMF does not cause \ncancer. But again, that will await bringing in all of the science.\n  Let us suppose you have an EMF rule here, and let us suppose that the \nscientists that they pick for peer review violates section 627 on \nconflict of interest. Let us say, for example, that all of the \nscientists, if it is EPA who is doing the rule, are from the electric \npower industry.\n They come up with a rule that says no problem; it does not cause \ncancer.\n\n  Why, Mr. President, in that kind of situation, with the importance of \nthat rule, the huge amount of expense involved, the centrality of the \nquestion of science, then I believe, if I were in the Court--and that \nis the record we had under this language--I would reverse it and send \nit back and say you have to get this science right, because the science \nis very important. On the other hand, if you had a rule where the \nscience is fairly well understood and is not central to the issue, I \nthink you could leave out a risk assessment altogether, and the final \nagency action might not be arbitrary and capricious.\n  The point is that the risk assessment might or might not, depending \non the circumstances, be grounds for reversal.\n  Let us take another one: radon. We have had various radon legislation \nand some rules up on radon. Radon could be very expensive as well. And \nthe scientific judgments there are very well known. We know radon \ncauses cancer, but at what levels does it cause cancer, and in what \nsections of the country is it a risk, and what efforts ought to be made \nto deal with radon.\n  If you picked scientists who are, say, with the home building \nindustry and are not impartial, I can imagine a reversal on that \nground. If you did not have a cost-benefit analysis on something like \nradon, which could cost a huge amount of money, I can imagine a \nreversal on that ground.\n  Or suppose we have a regulation on second-hand tobacco smoke, to name \none of our biggest areas now. Suppose you had a regulation on that, and \nall the scientists came from the tobacco companies. You mean to tell me \nyou could not reverse on that ground? Because the science is so \ncritical to that particular issue. On the other hand, if you were going \nto be setting a hunting season--I think, by the way, hunting seasons \nhave been expressly exempted. In earlier versions of the act, they were \nnot. But I can imagine that you might leave out the cost-benefit \nanalysis altogether in setting a hunting season, and it would not \naffect the final agency action. So it is a rule of reason, and under \nthis language:\n\n       Failure to comply with this subchapter--\n\n  This subchapter, of course, deals with risk assessment and cost-\nbenefit analysis.\n\n     and subchapter III may be considered by the Court solely--\n\n  s-o-l-e-l-y, which means solely.\n\n     for the purpose of determining whether the final agency \n     action is arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion.\n\n  Mr. President, we are continually told by the opponents of risk \nassessment that ``solely'' does not mean solely. ``Solely'' means \nsomething else. ``Solely'' means solely part of the time and means \nsomething else some other part of the time.\n  Mr. President, it is as clear as the noonday Sun on a cloudless day \nthat ``solely'' means solely and only for the purpose of determining \nwhether that final agency action is arbitrary and capricious, which is \nexactly what we want to achieve.\n  Now, Mr. President, let us look at this new iteration of the Glenn-\nChafee judicial review language. It says:\n\n       When an action for judicial review of an agency action is \n     instituted--\n\n  In other words, when you get to appeal.\n\n     any analysis or assessment of such agency action shall \n     constitute part of the whole administrative record of agency \n     action for the purpose of judicial review of the agency \n     action.\n\n  ``For the purpose of judicial review of the agency action.''\n  Now, what is the guiding rule of review of agency action? Under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, particularly section 706 of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, it provides for review of all agency \naction--all final agency action.\n  So I assume that section 706 is the guiding rule for appellate \nreview. I tell my friend from Ohio that I am going to ask him some \nquestions about it if he is willing to answer when I finish these \nremarks because I would like to know what in his opinion the standard \nof that review is.\n  When you say, ``judicial review of the agency action,'' what is the \nstandard? Now, if it is section 706, section 706 has two pertinent \nprovisions. One is the same standard we have here, that is, arbitrary \nand capricious or an abuse of discretion. But it also has subsection \n(d) that says ``without observance of procedure required by law.''\n  Now, if I am correct that it is section 706 under which this is \nreviewed, then under the Glenn-Chafee amendment by that last phrase you \ncan review both the arbitrary and capricious nature of the final agency \naction, the abuse of discretion of the final agency action, and you can \nreview with the phrase ``without observance of procedure required by \nlaw.''\n  Now, there is another provision, though, of the Glenn-Chafee judicial \nreview provision upon which they rely which says this:\n\n       If an analysis or assessment has been performed, the Court \n     shall not review to determine whether the analysis or \n     assessment conformed to the particular requirements of this \n     chapter.\n\n  Now, the operative phrase here, Mr. President, is ``particular.'' One \nof the oldest rules of statutory construction is that when two \nprovisions are in pari materia; that is, when they are on the same \nsubject and particularly when they are in the same section, you read \nthose two together so as to give life to both of them, so that you do \nnot nullify one at the expense of the other.\n  Now, I will tell you what this means to me. ``Shall not review to \ndetermine whether the analysis or the assessment conformed to the \nparticular requirements of this chapter.'' The word ``particular'' must \nhave some meaning, and I believe that meaning is to institute a de \nminimis test; that is to say, you do not reverse for procedural errors \nof small degree, but you may reduce for procedural errors of greater \ndegree.\n  If that is the not the meaning, then what is the meaning of the word \n``particular''? They could have said conform to the requirements of \nthis subchapter as opposed to the particular requirements of this \nsubchapter. And if, Mr. President, I am wrong on that, then you still \nhave a review under the other provisions of section 706, which leads \nyou to the same conclusion we have here.\n  So either the Glenn-Chafee amendment goes beyond what our amendment \ngoes to by at least implicitly allowing a procedural review, or it at \n\n[[Page S 10098]]\nleast provides for a review of the final agency action and to the same \nextent that ours does.\n  So now, Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from Ohio would \nyield for a few questions, if I may ask him, when you say ``purpose of \njudicial review of the agency action,'' by what rule is that? Is that \nnot under section 706 of the APA and, if not, then under what standard?\n  Mr. GLENN. I think we are referring to--you are talking about section \n706?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. In your amendment, this is section 623(e), providing \nfor judicial review, the last sentence of which says, ``When an action \nfor judicial review of an agency action is instituted, any analysis or \nassessment for such agency action shall constitute part of the whole \nadministrative record of agency action for the purpose of judicial \nreview of the agency action.''\n  My question is, Is that review not under section 706 of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, and if that is not the applicable \nsection, what is the applicable section?\n  (Mr. KYL assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. GLENN. I reply to my colleague from Louisiana, we maintain the \ncurrent status under the APA, the standard being arbitrary and \ncapricious, which has been the case for a long time.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That is section 706.\n  Mr. GLENN. Section 706. It is my understanding, under Dole-Johnston, \nit expands 706 for scope of review. It allows a court to set aside an \nagency action if findings are ``without substantial support.'' That is \na new and higher standard of review than APA has acknowledged in the \npast.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That is a different section. For the purpose of \ncompliance with this subchapter, subchapter II, and subchapter III, \nthat is risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis, that review shall be \nsolely on the basis of what is arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of \ndiscretion.\n  Mr. GLENN. Then we disagree on the meaning of----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. ``Solely''?\n  Mr. GLENN. Arbitrary and capricious.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That language is excerpted--it is the same standard \nthat you have. That is section 706.\n  Mr. GLENN. No, it is my understanding Dole-Johnston goes beyond that \nand establishes ``without substantial support'' as a new and higher \nstandard of review, where we stick with the Administrative Procedure \nAct that has been in effect, acknowledged under law, a whole body of \nlaw developed under that, and we stick with that so there can be no \nmisunderstanding of it. Dole-Johnston goes well beyond that and \nestablishes a whole new procedure.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I say to my friend, that is a different question. That \nis a different section. We are talking about the review of cost-benefit \nanalysis and risk assessment which, under our language, specifically \nstates that it is solely for the purpose of determining whether the \nfinal agency action is arbitrary and capricious.\n  My question to you is, under your language which says--you allow risk \nassessments--``analysis or assessment shall constitute part of the \nwhole administrative record for the purpose of judicial review of the \nagency action,'' is that review not under section 706?\n  Mr. GLENN. The difference here being, what we provide is that final \nreview, just before the rule or reg would go into effect, then it would \nbe challengeable in the court. There would be judicial review at that \npoint. They could consider everything that has happened up to that \npoint. It would not be judicially reviewable at all the multitudinous \nsteps along the way that would still be permitted under Dole-Johnston.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I do not even know what you are talking about, \nmultitudinous. Name one place.\n  Mr. GLENN. I will get the detail on that a little later on today.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I suggest to my friend from Ohio that there is only one \nreview, explicitly only one review, under our proposal, and that is \nfinal agency action.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield so I can read some of the areas----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I want to clear this up, because we say specifically \nthat there is--all right, let me read this, from section 625 of Dole-\nJohnston:\n\n       Compliance or noncompliance by an agency with the \n     provisions of this subchapter and subchapter III shall be \n     subject to judicial review only in accordance with this \n     section.\n       (b) except as provided in subsection (e) and subject to \n     subchapter II each court with jurisdiction under a statute to \n     review final agency action to which this title applies has \n     jurisdiction to review any claims of noncompliance with this \n     subchapter and subchapter III. . . .\n\n  And then next:\n\n       Except as provided in subsection (e), no claims of \n     noncompliance with this chapter or subchapter III shall be \n     reviewed separate or apart from judicial review of the final \n     agency action to which they relate.\n\n  And then we state here that that is a review of final agency action.\n  It is as clear as it can be. Now tell me where else you were going to \nbe able to review this? It says ``compliance or noncompliance shall be \nsubject to judicial review only in accordance with this section,'' and \nthere is the section. It is final agency action. Now is that not clear, \nI ask my friend?\n  Mr. GLENN. No, I do not think it is. EPA has given a list of things \nwhere they feel this could be challenged, where litigation could come \nout of this. I was asked a moment ago, I believe the gist of it was, \nwhat possible litigation could come out of this?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Right.\n  Mr. GLENN. We have here--I do not know whether it is necessary to \nread all of these or not--but there are 144 items that could be \nlitigated under S. 343 as counsel to EPA interprets this. Let me go \nthrough some of these.\n  No. 1: Did the agency sufficiently explain the need for and \nobjectives of a rule?\n  No. 2----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. On that first one----\n  Mr. GLENN. Is the Senator going to let me read these?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Not 144.\n  Mr. GLENN. I am not the counsel for EPA. I am saying this is their \ninterpretation of exactly what you are referring to here.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. But you said you would have a separate review, even \nunder what counsel for EPA says, that would come only at the final \nreview and solely for the purpose of determining whether or not the \nfinal agency action was arbitrary and capricious; is that not correct? \nIt is clear.\n  Mr. GLENN. We stick with the arbitrary-and-capricious rule. We do not \nexpand that as Dole-Johnston does.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. There is the standard right there. It is plain English. \nIt is as plain as it can be. It is ``arbitrary and capricious or abuse \nof discretion,'' that is the sole and only basis for review of the \ncost-benefit analysis or of the risk assessment. That is it. Look, read \nthe language.\n  Mr. GLENN. I say to my friend from Louisiana, there is a difference \nof opinion here on what is meant by the language. I know we have had a \nnumber of discussions back and forth, and with the Senator from \nLouisiana and Senator Levin on the Senate floor.\n  The interpretation counsel at EPA is giving on this is the one I was \nabout to read, and there are 144 different questions where they feel \nlitigation can come up under this.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Those may be requirements of risk assessment or cost-\nbenefit analysis which, to the extent they are relevant, can be used to \nchallenge the final agency action. Maybe so. But those are only \narguments you make. The first one there is notice. Do you really think \nyou are going to throw out a final agency action as being arbitrary and \ncapricious because they did not give notice?\n  Mr. GLENN. This was not notice. I read this. ``Did agencies \nsufficiently explain the need for and objectives of a rule?''\n  They feel, under S. 343, this language under your proposal could be \nchallenged in litigation.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. You can challenge anything.\n  Mr. GLENN. No, not under Glenn-Chafee, you cannot challenge anything. \nWe have the final rule that can be challengeable, or whether it is a \nmajor rule or not. We specify that.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If you ever got a cost-benefit analysis done under \nGlenn-Chafee, all that is consensual. If you want to do it, if you feel \nlike it, if it feels good, do it. Otherwise, do not do it because you \ndo not have to. It is business as usual. Am I not right that it is all \nconsensual on the lookback process under Glenn-Chafee; is that correct?\n\n[[Page S 10099]]\n\n  Mr. GLENN. No, that is not correct. I will tell you the difference. \nWhat we provided in both pieces of legislation is the right for \nCongress to get in the act and review anything that we want to that \ncould come back to Congress. So if there is any question about it, it \ncomes back to Congress. That is provided in both pieces of legislation.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Oh, well, sure. Congress can always pass a law. The \nConstitution provides that. This bill does not provide that. But save \nCongress enacting a law, it is consensual, is it not?\n  Mr. GLENN. I say to my friend that we provide specifically for a \nprocedure for any rule to come back to Congress for further \nconsideration. And in both bills, we give a time period that is \nrequired for Congress to review whatever it is that was brought back. \nOne is 60 days, the other is 45 days--not a huge difference. So it \nseems to me that protects whatever may be required or whatever may come \nup over there, as far as whether something has had adequate review or \nnot before it was put into a rule.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Well, let us say that the director of EPA or another \nagency looks back and says, ``We have done a heck of a good job, we \nhave great bureaucrats in this agency, and we do not think anything \nneeds to be reviewed.'' So the slate is clean, it is a tabula rasa, it \nis a devoid of any rules to be reviewed. I am an aggrieved party and \nwhat is my remedy? To come to Congress and ask them to pass an act? \nThat is it, is it not?\n  Mr. GLENN. I will reply. The standard of review is arbitrary and \ncapricious under Dole-Johnston, but that issue itself is what can be \nreviewed. Now, these 144 items here--\n  I ask unanimous consent that these 144 items be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  One Hundred Forty-Four Items To Litigate Under S. 343 (Version 783)\n\n       1.

Was such reliance and compliance incompatible, \n     contradictory, or otherwise irreconcilable with the rule, \n     regulation or directive for which enforcement is sought?\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, this is a list of 144 bases upon which a \nrule can be challenged using the arbitrary and capricious standard that \nyou are talking about.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Well----\n  Mr. GLENN. These can still be challenged.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Let me ask my friend to answer this question: EPA does \nnot do anything. It puts no rule up for review. What is your remedy if \nyou are an aggrieved party, if you are outraged citizens, if you are \nmillions of American citizens, what is your remedy? To come to \nCongress?\n  Mr. GLENN. Yes, that is the ultimate protection, Congress, where 80 \npercent of these things start to begin with, where the requirements are \nput in.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I tell my friend that the American public has come to \nCongress. That is what we are doing here today. That is what this is \nall about. EPA has reviewed its own rules and says they are not based \non real risks, they are based on public perceptions of risk and we need \nto do something about it. Everybody says let us do something about it. \nAnd now that is where we are.\n  There was a 1987 study called ``Unfinished Business'' where EPA \nsystematically ranked the seriousness of the various risks that it was \naddressing or could address. The report found that there was little \ncorrelation between the risk that the EPA staff judged as most \nthreatening and EPA's program priorities. Instead, EPA found a \ncorrelation between EPA's priorities and public opinion on the \nseriousness of the various environmental threats. ``Overall, EPA's \npriorities appear more closely aligned with public opinion than with \nour estimated risk.''\n  Mr. President, these conclusions were confirmed in 1990 by EPA's \nScience Advisory Board, in its report entitled ``Reducing Risks.'' The \nreport urged EPA to target its environmental protection efforts on the \nbasis of opportunities for the greatest risk reduction.\n  So, Mr. President, I think we now have the picture. The Glenn-Chafee \namendment allows aggrieved parties to come to Congress, and that is it. \nOther than trusting in the judgment--to use the words of the statute, \n``the sole discretion of the head of the agency,'' that is it. You have \nthe sole discretion of the head of the agency, and that is exactly what \nwe have right now.\n  Mr. President, right now, we have the sole discretion of the head of \nthe EPA. We have the sole discretion of OSHA and all these other places \nthat are run amok. Listen to what EPA says about its own rules. This is \nnot some rightwing interest group talking about how badly EPA is \nassessing its rules. This is EPA saying it. Its own Science Advisory \nBoard confirmed it in 1990, and we are told, well, trust them. Let us \ncontinue to go with unfettered discretion, with ``sole discretion.'' \nNow, that is what Glenn-Chafee says--``sole discretion.''\n  Now, Mr. President, we have been on the floor for 6 days. This is the \n6th day on this legislation, the 6th straight day going through all of \nthese provisions and arguing about these provisions and all that. And \nwe are told, well, leave it to the sole discretion of the agency head. \nAnd then, as for new rules, if it is implicitly--whatever that means, \nand I think it means whatever in the sole discretion of the agency head \nthey want it to mean--you do not have to do for a new rule the cost-\nbenefit analysis. By the way, you do not even have to justify the \ncost--that benefits justify the cost.\n  Mr. GLENN. If the Senator will yield, the Senator defends the \npetition process in the Dole-Johnston bill. On March 14, the Senator \nfrom Louisiana responded to a letter that Senators Levin, Lieberman, \nand I had sent to him asking his opinion on these, because he has had a \nlot of experience in these areas. We asked him to comment on S. 291 and \nS. 343. He sent us back a very thoughtful and well-reasoned-out letter \nresponse of his views at that time. I say that within that letter--and \nI will not read the whole letter because it was rather lengthy--but in \ntalking about the petition process, the Senator from Louisiana stated \nthe following:\n\n       To help set priorities for the review, I prefer some sort \n     of advisory committee to assist the agency head. I am very \n     skeptical of the petition process, which is likely to skew \n     the priorities, and I am strongly opposed to any judicial \n     review of actions taken under a lookback provision.\n\n  It seems to me that is pretty clear as to what the thinking was in \nMarch. Further on down in another paragraph, it says:\n\n       The Dole bill, however, allows any person to petition for a \n     cost-benefit analysis of an existing regulation. If the \n     analysis shows that the regulation does not satisfy the \n     decisional criteria of the bill (that is, that the benefits \n     of the regulation outweigh the cost) the agency must either \n     revoke the regulation or amend it to conform to the \n     decisional criteria.\n      Denial of the petition by an agency head is subject to \n     judicial review.\n\n  Needless to say, I strongly disagree with this approach. Unless I am \nreading something wrong, the Senator from Louisiana is stating one \nthing in March and a different thing on the floor here today.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I appreciate that question.\n  This is the very provision that we accepted, the advice of Sally \nKatzen, who is head of OIRA, and other Democrats.\n  Frankly, I think we ought to have advisory boards. But the advisory \nboards were objected to by the Senator from Ohio, the Senator from \nMichigan, Senator Levin, and others, who said we should not have this \nadvisory board, and it would clog up the thing.\n  I think advisory boards would be useful.\n  Mr. GLENN. Could the Senator tell me when he objected to that? I do \nnot believe there was an objection to that.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thought it was in our negotiating session. Does the \nSenator wish to get advisory boards back in?\n  Mr. GLENN. I do not know what happened in our session. There were so \nmany things that occurred in those sessions. It would be hard to go \nback and recall everything that occurred.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The advisory boards, in my judgment, are useful, and I \ntried to sell advisory boards. I do not think they are central to the \nprocess, but if the Senator from Ohio thinks they are important, I will \ncome back----\n  Mr. GLENN. I would be happy to talk about advisory boards. We might \nbe able to get some wording here that would be proposed as an amendment \nhere, and we would be glad to consider that if that is possible.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Under the original Dole amendment, people would be able \nto petition as often as they wished to. They would have an automatic \njudicial review of that.\n  Sally Katzen suggested--I think it was an excellent idea. I think the \nSenator carried forward some of the ideas with that, which was we have \n180 days after the publication of the initial list within which to \npetition with a very high threshold. That is, we have to show a \nsubstantial likelihood that the existing rule does not meet the test. \nIf you do not make the application during the 180 days, you cannot \napply again for 5 years. This is only an every 5-year process.\n  The appeals from that are consolidated so that there is only one \nappeal, so that the very problems that I was talking about in my bill, \nthat Sally Katzen was talking about in our negotiating session, were \naccepted on terms suggested by her.\n  It deals with that problem of agency overload and court overload. We \ndid that. I think it was an ingenious suggestion that she made. We \naccepted it hook, line, and sinker. We said, ``Yes.'' That is the \nproblem with this bill. It is hard to accept ``yes'' for an answer.\n  Mr. President, this bill, virtually everything, virtually all the \nmajor areas of opposition to this bill as suggested have been dealt \nwith, and dealt with successfully.\n  Supermandate--that is, does this statute override any other \nunderlying statutes? We, first of all, made it clear in the Dole-\nJohnston original bill and Senators came back and said it is not clear. \nWell, we made it absolutely clear by stating it again on terms agreed \nto \n\n[[Page S 10102]]\nby both the left and the right of this Chamber. Supermandate is solved.\n  Judicial review, I submit, is solved. The language is clear.\n  The $100 million threshold, that is a big thing. We had the amendment \nhere and we passed it. It is now part of the process.\n  The petition process, we accepted the Katzen suggestion, wholly and \ncompletely, and it is now incorporated. Now, they may want more. Was it \nSamuel Gompers, the labor leader, when they asked, ``What does labor \nwant?'' and he said, ``More, more, more.'' Whoever said it, they should \nhave said it for this bill. Because they come in and ask for things, \nand we do them, and somehow it is not enough.\n  Effective day--we dealt with the effective date. The problem was we \nhave all the ongoing rules that have to be redone. We say, OK, if you \nhave a notice of proposed rulemaking out by April 1 of this year, you \ndo not have to go back and redo any cost-benefit or risk assessment. \nYou are home free.\n  Now, I think that solves the problem because if you just started with \na notice of proposed rulemaking since April 1, you got plenty of time \nto incorporate that in your bill.\n  Superfund--Mr. President, one of the toughest issues in this bill as \nto which there was a huge amount of disagreement, I very strongly sided \nwith the Senator from Ohio in thinking that all of this environmental \ncleanup, all of these Superfund provisions ought to be out of here. And \nwe accepted. As a matter of fact, we did it by unanimous consent. We \nprobably should have had a vote to have seared that into the memory of \nour colleagues, but at least we did it. Superfund is gone. Sayonara.\n  The sunshine amendment--the Senator from Ohio suggested it. We \naccepted it. It is done. Now, it is, I am sure, not enough. I am sure \nthat there is not enough we can do to satisfy some people, other than \nto make this bill solely in the discretion of the agency heads, because \nthat in effect is what Glenn-Chafee does. Solely in the discretion, not \nreviewable by the court, do it if you want to, but if you did not want \nto, do not bother.\n  And you have plenty of redress by coming to the Congress.\n  Mr. GLENN. Would the Senator yield? That is what the Senator argued \nfor in his letter.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Not that, no, indeed.\n  Mr. GLENN. Yes. I read it into the letter a little while ago. I will \nask anybody to reread that to see if this is not a change in position.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I have never said this ought to be consensual, that it \nought to be solely in the discretion of the agency head. Never have \nsaid that. Never believed that. It simply is not so.\n  I think we have delivered very, very well on this letter of mine.\n  Mr. GLENN. This position, I submit to my friend from Louisiana, is \n180 degrees opposed. ``To help set priorities for the review, I prefer \nsome sort of advisory committee to assist the agency head. I am very \nskeptical of a petition process which is likely to skew the priorities, \nand am strongly opposed to any judicial review of actions taken under a \nlookback provision.''\n  Now, that is diametrically opposed to what the Senator is talking \nabout here today. Further, if I might continue just for a second here, \nI think in all of our best recollection of those here who were in some \nof those negotiating sessions, Miss Katzen never supported the \npetitioner a right to have a major rule reviewed in 3 years. That is \nway too short and forces an agency to set priorities by petition and \nnot by what is most important or what is most pressing.\n  In addition, Dole-Johnston also allows for interlocutory appeal of \nthree different issues. No. 1, a major rule. No. 2, does it require \nrisk assessment? No. 3, does it require regulatory flexibility \nanalysis? It allows judicial review in the middle of the rulemaking.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If the Senator would allow me to answer that, first of \nall, on the reg flex, I did not support the reg flex. A big bipartisan \nvote of 58 votes approved reg flex.\n  I really do not think it is workable. But the two Senators from \nGeorgia, Nunn and Coverdell, have indicated that they would work on \nthis and try to relieve the burden.\n  Let me tell the Senator from Ohio, that is not the fault of this \nSenator. I suspect that if by any chance the Glenn-Chafee amendment got \nadopted, that it would have the Nunn-Coverdell amendment bit. Do not \ncriticize Dole-Johnston for having Nunn-Coverdell.\n I was not for it, and the Senator would get it if he had it.\n\n  With respect to the interlocutory appeal on the size of the rule, \nwhether it is a $100-million rule or whether it is one that requires a \nrisk assessment because it pertains to health, safety, and the \nenvironment, I had said all along that was a proposal which I put in. \nIt was not in the original Dole amendment. It was meant to give agency \nheads flexibility and help. And if that is a real problem, it can come \nout. I think those who criticize the interlocutory appeal do not \nunderstand it. I mean, it is meant so agency heads will know at the end \nof 60 days whether they are going to have a challenge on whether it is \na major rule.\n  The problem you have now--for example, we had hearings on NEPA. If \nthe Senator would follow through with me on this, we had hearings on \nNEPA and we found that EPA is spending $100 million a year on NEPA \nstudies. As the Senator knows, an environmental impact statement is \nmuch more detailed and, in turn, much more expensive than an \nenvironmental impact assessment. But they always do an environmental \nimpact statement rather than an assessment because they do not want to \nwait until the end of all this study and rulemaking and what have you \nand have to go back and redo it.\n  That was, frankly, the idea of the interlocutory appeal. So that, if \nyou do not complain about the size of the rule in the first 60 days, \nthen that is forever sealed in. And if they do complain and do make the \nappeal, the agency head can moot the appeal by simply going back and \nagreeing to do the risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis. It is \nsimply meant to help them.\n  But if that is a problem, the whole thing can come out. Let me just \nmake a remark or two and then I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. ROTH. Am I correct in understanding that I believe every \nPresident since President Ford has required a cost-benefit analysis to \nbe made, but, despite that general requirement through Executive order \nand otherwise, it has not been adhered to? Is that correct?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. There has been a risk assessment rulemaking rule out \nthere--Executive order I should say--under every President since \nPresident Ford.\n  By the way, I have a copy of it here. The problem is that it is \nconsensual as well, and it is generally ignored, as my friend suggests.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is the point I am trying to make. It is consensual \nunder current conditions, and the Glenn-Chafee would make no change, it \nwould continue to be consensual. Is that correct?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. It would even more clearly be consensual under those \nbecause they make sure, and they say, ``in sole discretion of the \nagency head,'' and then they go back, under section 625, and ensure \nthat there is no appeal from the exercise of sole discretion. I do not \nknow how you could otherwise have an appeal from the exercise of sole \ndiscretion, but they make sure that there is no appeal. It is \nnonenforceable. It is sort of the honor system, or I should say the \nbuddy system, the bureaucratic buddy system.\n  Mr. ROTH. So, in a very real way, the adoption of the Glenn-Chafee \nlegislation would mean no significant change, at least as far as cost-\nbenefit is concerned?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The Senator has put it very, very well. No significant \nchange. And your recourse, according to the Senator from Ohio, is to \ncome to Congress.\n  Mr. ROTH. As the distinguished Senator from Louisiana already pointed \nout, that is what we are doing now. It is a fact--is it not a fact that \nthe Vice President, the head of OIRA, and others, have said that there \nare bad rules on the books and something needs to be done? Is that not \ncorrect?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That is exactly correct. But they say, trust us, we \nwill do them in our sole discretion.\n  Mr. ROTH. But that is the problem; it has not been done. Is that not \ncorrect?\n\n[[Page S 10103]]\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That is, even according to EPA's own studies. They had \none study in 1987 that determined that risks conformed--the EPA study \nin 1987 entitled, ``Unfinished Business'' says that they \n``systematically failed to properly rank risks.'' They ranked them \naccording to public opinion rather than science.\n  Then they came back 3 years later, in 1990, had another study from \nEPA's Science Advisory Board, and said they were continuing to do the \nsame thing.\n  I submit they are continuing to do the same thing today. And this \nsame crowd is coming in and saying, trust us, we are doing it right, \nand no change needs to be made.\n  Mr. ROTH. As I understand it, and of course none of us have had a \nchance to review that carefully, the new language of the Glenn-Chafee \nbill--but essentially what they have done is taken the teeth out of the \nlegislation that was reported out by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That is exactly right. The Roth bill, which came out \nunanimously, out of Governmental Affairs, had a lot of teeth. The \nSenator and I have talked about that. My own view was I liked some of \nthe teeth. I thought some of the other teeth were too sharp.\n  Mr. ROTH. The Senator is partly right.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. But no need to worry, all of those teeth are gone. You \ndo not even have false teeth here.\n  Mr. ROTH. So this, in a sense, would be an exercise in futility.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. This is a waste of time. If you want to kill this bill, \nenact this Glenn-Chafee amendment, beat your chest, feel good about it. \nIt has risk assessment in the title of the bill, but it amounts to \nnothing, zero.\n  Mr. ROTH. I congratulate the distinguished Senator from Louisiana for \nhis very penetrating analysis.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank my colleague and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, this was an interesting discussion. It \nshows the complexities of this legislation and why we should not be \nrushed on the floor of the Senate putting it into effect. We should be \nconsidering all these things and all the legal ramifications of it in \nevery respect.\n  I come back, though, that if the Agency passes something that is \nconsidered to be not OK, or tries to put something into effect, that \nanyone can petition the Agency and say, ``We think this should go back \nto Congress,'' or notify their Congressman, notify their Senator, we \ncan call it back.\n  I do not see yet why that is not--that is where the responsibility \nlies, is right here. We are the ones who passed the original \nlegislation. What we have done is, for the first time, put into play a \nspecific arrangement. We are detailing it in legislation. We are \ninviting people to watch what goes on in the agencies and say we will \nbring it back.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is absolutely correct. We always have the \nright in Congress to do something like this if we want to pass separate \nlegislation. But that takes a lot of time. It is time consuming, it \ncould go on for a whole session of Congress. It could go on for another \nyear. What we did is provide, in both pieces of legislation, time \nrestraints by which Congress has to complete its action. In other \nwords, any authorizing committee can call back a rule or regulation for \nreconsideration before it goes into effect. I really do not see how \nthere could be a better protection than that. I do not know what else \nthere is that would be needed.\n  Let me read some things into the Record that apply to this judicial \nreview:\n Judicial Review Provisions in Glenn-Chafee and Dole-Johnston Versions \n                   of S. 343--A Comparative Approach\n\n\n               1. rulemaking file requirements and review\n\n       The Dole-Johnston bill amends the A.P.A. to add elaborate \n     rulemaking file requirements to all notice-and-comment \n     rulemaking; these sections contain their own confusing \n     judicial review provision [553(m), p. 12] and would encourage \n     lawsuits over the adequacy of the file and whether items were \n     placed in the file as quickly as possible. Additionally, the \n     Dole-Johnston bill would change the standards of review for \n     rules issued under notice-and-comment; it would add 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 706(a)(2)(F) to require that the factual basis for a \n     rule have ``substantial support'' in the rulemaking file. See \n     discussion below.\n       The Glenn-Chafee bill does not include these troublesome \n     provisions.\n\n\n            2. judicial review of scheduling review/lookback\n\n       Section 623(e) (p. 30) of the Dole-Johnston bill provides \n     for judicial review of agency non-compliance with the process \n     for scheduling of review of existing rules. However, the \n     section does not clearly limit judicial review to only the \n     reasonableness of the schedule. The scope of review is \n     broad--i.e., ``agency compliance or noncompliance with the \n     requirements of this section'' and review exists \n     ``notwithstanding section 625.'' Review is limited to the \n     D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Review of final agency action \n     must be filed within 60 days of publication of the final \n     rule. However, the section does not preclude interlocutory \n     review.\n       Section 625(c) of the Glenn-Chafee bill (p. 18) provides \n     for judicial review of the agency regulatory review but \n     precludes review of agency decisions whether to place a rule \n     on the schedule and the deadlines for completion.\n                3. Review of decision to ``sunset'' rule\n\n       Section 623(g)(3) (p. 33-34) of the Dole-Johnston bill \n     grants interested parties the right to petition the D.C. \n     Circuit Count of Appeals to extend the period for review of a \n     rule up to two years and to grant equitable relief to prevent \n     termination where, inter alia, termination of the rule would \n     not be in the public interest.\n       The last sentence of section 623(h) provides that the \n     decision of an agency to not modify a major rule ``shall \n     constitute final agency action for the purposes of judicial \n     review.'' Section 623(j)(2) similarly states that failure to \n     promulgate an amended major rule or to make decisions by the \n     date required shall be considered final agency action.\n       Under the Glenn-Chafee bill, rules would not automatically \n     ``sunset.'' Instead, the agency would be required to publish \n     a notice of rulemaking to terminate a rule. \n     Sec. 625(e)(1)(C)(iv).\n\n\n                  4. jurisdiction and judicial review\n\n       Clarity of limitation on judicial review.--Section 625(a) \n     and (b) of the Dole-Johnston bill (p. 38) affirmatively grant \n     jurisdiction to review ``any claims of noncompliance with \n     this subchapter and subchapter III.'' While compliance is \n     subject to judicial review ``only in accordance with this \n     section,'' subsection 625(d) arguably permits broad judicial \n     review.\n       By contrast, the Glenn-Chafee bill clearly states there is \n     no judicial review except as provided therein. Sec. 623(a), \n     p. 13. Section 623 of the Glenn-Chafee bill is very clear \n     concerning what is reviewable and what is not.\n       Procedural errors.--Section 625 of the Dole-Johnston bill \n     is unclear as to whether procedural errors are reviewable. It \n     states that ``failure to comply'' may be considered by the \n     court solely to determine ``whether the final agency action \n     is arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion (or \n     unsupported by substantial evidence where that standard is \n     otherwise required by law.'' 625(d), p. 39\n       The use of the words ``failure to comply'' in at least \n     three places in section 625 suggests procedural errors are \n     reviewable.\n       The limitation of review to the ``arbitrary and \n     capricious'' or ``abuse of discretion'' test may not be \n     sufficient to keep courts from reviewing alleged agency non-\n     compliance just as they otherwise would under the A.P.A. That \n     was the view of one court in a case where Congress limited \n     review of agency procedural error to those which rendered the \n     agency action arbitrary and capricious. That court had \n     difficulty understanding the limitation as violation of \n     procedure is often regarded as rendering the action arbitrary \n     and capricious. Small Refiner Lead Phase-Down Task Force v. \n     U.S. E.P.A., 705 F.2d, 521\n      (D.C. Cir. 1983). See also, Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of \n     U.S. v. E.P.A., 768 F. 2d 385 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (statutory \n     test of action in excess of statutory authority same \n     standard as arbitrary and capricious).\n       The Glenn-Chafee bill, by contrast, makes it clear that \n     courts are not to review the underlying steps and procedures \n     leading up to the cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment. \n     Section 623(d) expressly states that ``. . . the court shall \n     not review to determine whether the analysis or assessment \n     conformed to the particular requirements of this chapter.'' \n     Sec. 623(d), p. 14. The Glenn-Chafee bill would permit the \n     court to consider the actual documents produced by the agency \n     to evaluate cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment in \n     determining the reasonableness of the agency action but not \n     to permit review of the underlying steps to development of \n     the risk assessment or cost-benefit analysis.\n       Judicial ``second-guessing'' of agency judgment and \n     scientific expertise The Dole-Johnston bill creates great \n     risk that courts will second guess agency judgments and \n     scientific determinations which go into the cost-benefit \n     analysis, risk assessment, and application of the \n     prescriptive decisional criteria.\n       The Dole-Johnston bill contains many prescriptive \n     requirements which tell agencies what they must consider and \n     what they cannot. However, many of these factors are very \n     difficult in application. Yet consideration of factors \n     Congress has decided are not to be considered has been cited \n     as a basis for reversal under arbitrary and capricious \n     review. \n\n[[Page S 10104]]\n     Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 416 91 S. Ct. \n     814, 823, 28 L. Ed. 2d 136 (1971).\n       S. 343 turns administrative law on its head if it takes \n     away agency's ability to make policy choices and to have \n     those upheld so long as they are reasonable and consistent \n     with the statute being applied. See cases cited in Small \n     Refiner Lead Phase-Down Task Force, 705 F. 2d at 520. If \n     Congress takes away an agency's discretion to make policy \n     choices, then special interests challenging a rule will argue \n     that an abuse of discretion standard permits the court to \n     second-guess the agency's decision as to what is a ``policy \n     judgment'' and what is ``scientific understanding.''\n       Courts are not situated to ``second-guess'' the \n     prescriptive requirements of the Dole-Johnston bill. Courts \n     are not well situated to review the underlying basis of cost-\n     benefit analyses and risk assessments against the \n     prescriptive standards of the bill.\n       ``. . . the crowded states of judicial dockets offers a \n     highly practical reason why judges will not, and probably \n     should not, devote the considerable time and effort needed to \n     review a several-thousand-page agency\n      record, informed by a thorough understanding of the \n     substance of risk-related regulatory problems, in order to \n     see whether or not that agency determination was \n     arbitrary.''\n\n     Justice Breyer, Breaking the Vicious Circle: Toward Effective \n     Risk Regulation (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press \n     1973), pp. 58-59 (describing why courts are not \n     institutionally suited to resolve risk issues).\n       Prejudicial error [Note: Neither bill contains a \n     prejudicial error provision in this section. However, Senator \n     Johnston says concerns with the decisional criteria and \n     judicial review provisions are solved by the prejudicial \n     error test in 5 U.S.C. 706. This is not an adequate \n     protection.]\n       The problems with judicial review of the many prescriptive \n     requirements of the Dole-Johnston bill are also not cured by \n     the ``prejudicial error'' test in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 706. That \n     test, which is unchanged from the current APA, has been \n     described as requiring remand if the court ``cannot be sure \n     that under the correct procedures the Agency would have \n     reached the same conclusion . . .'' Weyerhaeuser Co. v. \n     Costle, 590 F.2d 1011, 1031 (D.C. Cir. 1978). That case \n     invalidated a pollution emission limitation rule for failure \n     to provide adequate notice for comment on agency data even \n     though petitioner could not show that recomputation of the \n     data would have made the process so costly as to invalidate \n     the limitation as an abuse of discretion.\n       Clogging the Courts.--The language of section 625 will \n     encourage years of litigation before even the question of \n     what is reviewable is resolved. This bill gives regulated \n     industry many hooks to delay rulemaking and then to challenge \n     the final result. If those steps are subject to judicial \n     review, there will be every incentive to stop regulation \n     through complex and lengthy judicial review proceeding. When \n     this is combined with the increased time and cost of \n     rulemaking under this bill, the result may be gridlock. This \n     frustration of law is not a desirable goal.\n       Judicial review of whether the agency chose the ``least \n     cost alternative,'' given the great differences in underlying \n     data, will generate challenges.--The Dole-Johnston bill takes \n     away agency discretion and mandates that all costs and \n     benefits be turned into one number and that the agency select \n     the ``least cost alternative'' of those available under 624 \n     (b) or (c). Yet some say that cost-benefit analyses may be \n     off by a magnitude of hundreds. This makes it difficult for \n     agencies to achieve any certainty concerning application of \n     cost-benefit analyses. If agencies must constantly be looking \n     over their shoulder at the possibility of judicial review, it \n     is clear this will provide many opportunities for challenges \n     to rules by the regulated industry.\n       By contrast, the Glenn-Chafee bill provides a range of \n     discretion to the agency decision-maker in section 622(f) and \n     is much more clear that the decisional criteria do not alter \n     statutory criteria for rulemaking.\n\n\n       5. interlocutory review of determination of ``major rule''\n\n       The Dole-Johnston bill permits interlocutory appeal of an \n     agency decision that a rule is not a major rule or is not \n     subject to risk assessment requirements. Sec. 625(e) p. 39.\n       The Glenn-Chafee bill requires ``a clear and convincing \n     showing that the determination is erroneous in light of the \n     information available to the agency at the time the agency \n     made the determination. Sec. 623(c). It does not authorize \n     interlocutory review.\n\n\n 6. dole-johnston amends the APA standards of judicial review for all \n                  agency rules--glenn-chafee does not\n\n          Factual basis for rules--5 U.S.C. Sec. 706(a)(2)(F)\n\n       The Dole--Johnston bill amends 5 U.S.C. 706(a)(2) by adding \n     (F) which requires courts to set aside agency action, \n     findings and conclusions found to be ``without substantial \n     support in the rulemaking file, viewed as a whole, for the \n     asserted or necessary factual basis, as distinguished from \n     the policy or legal basis, of a rule adopted in a proceeding \n     subject to section 553. . .''\n       The Dole-Johnston version of S. 343 also requires the final \n     notice of rulemaking to explain how the factual conclusions \n     upon which the rule is based are substantially supported in \n     the rulemaking file. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 553(g)(4), p. 8). The \n     ``rulemaking file'' must identify factual and methodological \n     material that pertains directly to the rulemaking and was \n     considered by the agency or submitted to or prepared by or \n     for the agency in connection with the rulemaking. \n     Sec. 553(j)(3)(d), p. 10.\n       Position: The standards for judicial review in the APA \n     should not be changed. Agencies should be able to rely on \n     their knowledge and expertise in informal notice-and-comment \n     rulemaking. Review should be on an arbitrary and capricious \n     standard, not require that the factual basis have \n     ``substantial support'' on a limited record. This new \n     standard will create much litigation in an established area \n     of the law.\n       This standard may encourage judicial intrusion into \n     agency's scientific determinations. In Corrosion Pipe \n     Fittings v. E.P.A., 947 F.2d 1201, 1213-1214 (5th Cir. 1991), \n     the court held that the ``substantial evidence'' test used in \n     the Toxic Substances Control Act for notice-and-comment \n     rulemaking was a more rigorous standard than the ``arbitrary \n     and capricious'' standard applied now to informal rulemaking \n     and showed that Congress wanted the courts to scrutinize the \n     agency's actions more closely. The Court then proceeded to \n     apply close scrutiny to the agency's cost-benefit\n      calculations and invalidated the asbestos rule that had \n     taken ten years to develop. 947 F. 2d at 1223-1230.\n       New section 706(a)(2)(F) requires the agency to amass a \n     record for potential litigation in every case. It calls into \n     question the principle that an agency can utilize its \n     knowledge and expertise.\n       It gives well-healed parties the opportunity to skew the \n     results on judicial review by salting the rulemaking file \n     with comments and materials which support their position. \n     Even in cases where the agency position has an adequate \n     factual basis in scientific literature, this standard might \n     require the agency to list all sources in the file or not be \n     able to later rely on them if a challenge is raised on \n     judicial review.\n\n\n                  7. multiple opportunities for review\n\n       Dole Johnston contains other provisions permitting judicial \n     review. Glenn-Chafee contains other provisions making it \n     clear that judicial review is not available. See, \n     Sec. 636(d), p. 40, no judicial review of risk assessment \n     guidelines' development, issuance, or publication; Sec. 646 \n     (p. 48), no judicial review of executive oversight authority; \n     Sec. 6(f), p. 70, no judicial review of study of comparative \n     risk; Sec. 6(f), p. 78, no judicial review of regulatory \n     accounting.\n\n\n   8. glenn-chafee reduces uncertainty and increases discretion and \nthereby reduces opportunities for successful challenges to agency rules\n\n       An example where Glenn-Chafee gets rid of a problem is the \n     effective date provision, Sec. 8, p. 70. By making it clear \n     that the section does not apply to pending rules and by \n     providing a reasonable grace period, this eliminates a \n     troublesome problem for pending rules.\n\n\n                       9. regulatory flexibility\n\n       Glenn-Chafee eliminates some of the problems with \n     regulatory flexibility under the Dole-Johnston bill. Section \n     611 (p. 48) avoids inconsistent statutes of limitation where \n     that for the underlying rule is less than 1 year. It provides \n     that court may stay the rule if a failure is not corrected \n     within 90 days but does not automatically terminate a rule if \n     not corrected in that period. Its judicial review standard is \n     more limited, and it does not contain the decisional criteria \n     of the Dole-Johnston bill.\n\n  Mr. President, I think this indicates to all who might be paying \nattention to this debate in the Chamber today how very, very complex \nand how far-reaching some of these decisions are. It is not something \nwe can rush through. I know it has been stated we want to move forward \nas rapidly as possible, and I agree with that. But I also want to make \nsure that while we are setting up a new regulatory review process, we \nat the same time make every protection for whatever existing law \ndeserves that kind of protection, and before we make changes that we \nmake very certain we do it in a way which protects the health and \nbenefit and safety of the American people.\n  Mr. President, I would go further in talking a little bit more about \nthe cost-benefit analysis and the decisional criteria.\n  Glenn-Chafee has no ``decisional criteria requiring agencies to pass \ncost-benefit tests before issuing a rule.''\n  Our response to some of the charges under that are, No. 1: Both the \nGlenn-Chafee and Dole-Johnston substitutes require agencies to do the \nsame type of cost-benefit analysis. We believe in making agencies do \nsuch analyses to better understand what the costs and benefits are of a \nrule. There is no problem with that with either bill. The differences, \nthough, between our substitutes is how they use cost-benefit analysis.\n  Glenn-Chafee uses cost-benefit analysis as a tool and not just as a \nfinal decisional criteria. There is no language in the Glenn-Chafee \nsubstitute that states, ``An agency shall not promulgate a rule,'' \nunless it passes a \n\n[[Page S 10105]]\ncost-benefit test. Glenn-Chafee requires agencies to provide an \nexplanation and certification of whether, one, benefits of the rule \njustify the cost and, two, the rule achieves the objectives of the \nrulemaking in a more cost-effective manner than the alternatives.\n  If it cannot make such a determination, it has to explain why not. \nThe Dole-Johnston substitute has decisional criteria that prohibit \nusing a rule unless, one, the benefits justify the costs, the rule uses \nflexible alternatives to the extent practicable, the rule is the \n``least-cost alternative'' that satisfies the objectives of the \nstatute, and if a risk assessment is required, the rule is likely to \n``significantly reduce the risks addressed by the rule.''\n  Why the decisional criteria are problematic: No. 1, cost-benefit \nanalysis is an imprecise science. Cost and benefits are hard to \nquantify and are loaded with assumptions, and some economists might \neven say, tell me what answer you want and I will give you the right \nnumbers for costs and benefits.\n  Agencies should not be required to decide whether or not to \npromulgate a rule based just on a cost-benefit test.\n  No. 2, another reason why decisional criteria are problematic: \nAgencies would have to choose the least-cost alternative. We should \nrequire agencies to choose the most cost-effective rule, not just the \ncheapest. The distinguished Senator from Louisiana has pointed to the \nout for agencies. They can choose something other than a least-cost \nsolution in the event of ``scientific, technical or economic \nuncertainties or nonquantifiable benefits to health, safety or the \nenvironment.''\n  But what if there are certain quantifiable benefits? Agencies would \nstill have to put out the least-cost rule, and that just makes no \nsense. Even if something is more cost-effective, beneficial to the \npeople of this country, we still have to go with whatever the \nalternative was that was solely least cost. That makes no sense.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GLENN. I am almost finished. Another minute or two and I will be \nglad to yield.\n  No. 3, agencies must prove that a rule significantly reduces risk. \nThe FAA tells us, however, that some of their safety rules, while quite \nimportant and quite effective, may not pass the ``significant'' test.\n  No. 4, if agencies determine that the benefits of a rule do not \njustify its costs, that rule should come back to Congress. And that is \na key element of this; that rule should come back to Congress if the \nagency determines that the benefits do not justify its costs. Agencies \nshould not be the ones to decide whether to issue a rule based on a \ncost-benefit test. That rule should come back to Congress to decide \nwhether a rule should go forward or not, and that is provided. \nCongressional veto, as it is called, makes more sense than decisional \ncriteria. It does not hand over Congress' responsibilities to the \nagencies.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished friend and \ncolleague from Ohio that I have been in negotiations and discussions \nwith representatives of his side of the aisle in an effort to revise \nthe decisional criteria with respect to the least cost. I am \nsympathetic to the concept of utilizing a test of cost-effectiveness or \ngreater net benefit to avoid some of the problems raised in his \ndiscussion of this section.\n  I wonder if the distinguished Senator is willing to proceed along \nthose lines at this time in developing such an amendment?\n  Mr. GLENN. Yes. As I understand it, what the Senator was proposing \nwas that there are some negotiations going on in this regard, and we \nwould be willing to proceed with further negotiations with regard to \ncost effective as opposed to least cost; is that correct?\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct.\n  Mr. GLENN. Certainly, I always want to negotiate on these things and \nsee what we can come out with.\n  Mr. ROTH. I think it important we proceed on this matter, because it \nis an important one, and that we proceed as rapidly as possible. To be \ncandid, I am disappointed that we have not been able to address this \nproblem on the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. I think what the distinguished Senator from Delaware is \naddressing is one of the most important items in all of this \nlegislative package. I think it is important that we get that one \nironed out, because it is a major issue in how we deal with regulatory \nreform. I agree with him.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the distinguished Senator for his comments.\n  Mr. President, I rise to call upon my colleagues to support \nmeaningful regulatory reform. I want to explain why I believe that the \nDole-Johnston compromise, S. 343, is the key to changing the status \nquo, and why the Glenn substitute is not the solution to reforming the \nregulatory process.\n  I believe that regulatory reform is one of the most important issues \nwe face. The reason is that, overall, Government regulation has an \nenormous impact on our lives--for better or for worse. If regulations \nare well-designed and implemented, they can do a lot of good--by making \na cleaner environment, safer workplaces, and safer products. But, at \nthe same time, regulations can be very costly, and, if poorly designed, \ntoo costly--by raising prices, taxes, and paperwork; diminishing wages; \neating up time; and wasting opportunities to do better things with our \nlimited resources. The cumulative regulatory burden costs about $600 \nbillion per year. I believe that, if this massive regulatory machine \nwere retooled, it could do much more good at less cost.\n  Most experts who have examined the regulatory process, regardless of \nbackground or political bent, have concluded that the regulatory \nprocess is seriously out of whack and must be reformed. Few if any of \nmy colleagues would dare to say publicly that we should be happy with \nthe status quo.\n  So the question is, why is there so much controversy about the S. \n343? The answer is simple--it is very hard to change the status quo in \na significant way. It is a Herculean task to reform one of the most \nuntamed frontiers of big Government--a massive regulatory machine that \ncosts the average American family about $6,000 per year.\n  That explains why an earlier attempt at regulatory reform, S. 1080, \nwhich passed the Senate 94-0 in 1982, was killed in the House. And that \nexplains why people are accusing supporters of S. 343 of wanting to \nexpose the public to tainted meat, breast cancer, and contaminated \ndrinking water. None of this is remotely true, and it does not belong \non the Senate floor.\n  We wasted days last week on meritless arguments that S. 343 needs \nspecific exemptions for meat inspection rules, mammography rules, and \nso on. The fact is, these arguments got a lot of press, but such \nexemptions were not needed. The Dole-Johnston compromise has a clear \nexemption for threats to human health and safety, as well as other \nemergencies.\n  In fact, the Glenn bill itself does not have such exemptions, \nbecause, as anyone recognizes who knows how these bills work, such \nexceptions are not needed.\n  The truth is, if you compare the Dole bill and the Glenn bill section \nby section, they look a lot alike. At bottom, there are only a few key \ndifferences. But these few differences are critical to effective \nregulatory reform.\n  First, meaningful regulatory reform must change future rules. The key \nto ensuring that new rules will be efficient and cost-effective is to \nhave an effective cost-benefit test.\n  The Dole bill has a focused cost-benefit test. The decisional \ncriteria in section 624 ensures that the benefits of a rule will \njustify its cost, unless prohibited by the underlying law authorizing \nthe rule. Section 624 is not a supermandate; it does not trump existing \nlaw. It simply tells the agency, if possible and allowed by law, to \nissue regulations whose benefits justify their costs. That is plain \ncommon sense.\n  In contrast, the Glenn bill has no cost-benefit decisional criteria. \nThe bill requires that a cost-benefit analysis be done, but the bill \ndoes not require that the cost-benefit analysis be used or that the \nrule will be affected by the cost-benefit analysis.\n  The agency only has to publish a determination whether the benefits \nof a rule will justify its costs and whether the regulation is cost-\neffective. But the Glenn bill does not push regulators to issue rules \nwhose benefits actually do \n\n[[Page S 10106]]\njustify their costs. I have always believed that an effective \nregulatory reform bill should have a stronger cost-benefit test.\n  Some of my colleagues, including Senators Glenn and Levin, have \ncomplained repeatedly about the least cost component of the decisional \ncriteria. Section 624 of S. 343 says, whether or not the benefits of a \nrule can justify its costs, the agency should select the least cost \nalternative the achieves the objectives of the statute.\n  I think there is some merit to the concern that the least cost \nstandard is too limited. If a rule costs a little more than the least \ncost alternative but provides much greater benefits, I believe that the \nagency should pick the much more beneficial rule--even if the benefits \nare quantifiable or are not environmental, health or safety benefits. \nWhy not? Why not spend a little more to get much greater benefits for \nthe public?\n  Yet, while I share the concerns of many of my colleagues, I have not \nbeen able to work out a solution. For weeks, I have tried to work out \ntwo solutions--a most cost-effective test or a greater net benefits \ntest--with my other colleagues. I believe that either test is far \nbetter than the least cost test with its vague exception for certain \nnonquantifiable benefits. Yet, we have made no progress, even though \nproponents of the substitute continue to complain about the least cost \nstandard. I think it is time we worked this out in a bipartisan \nfashion.\n  Now, I want to return to a second point about regulatory reform: \neffective regulatory reform cannot be prospective only; it must look \nback to reform old rules already on the books. The Dole-Johnston \ncompromise contains a balanced, workable, and fair resolution of how \nagencies should review existing rules. Agencies may select for \nthemselves any particular rules that they think need reexamination, \nwhile allowing interested parties to petition the agency to add an \noverlooked rule. To ensure that only a limited number of petitions will \nbe filed, S. 343 limits petitions to major rules and sets a high burden \nof proof--petitioners must show a substantial likelihood that the rule \ncould not satisfy the cost-benefit decisional criteria of section 624.\n  This is an efficient and workable method to review problematic rules.\n  The Glenn substitute, on the other hand, makes the review of agency \nrules a voluntary undertaking. There are no firm requirements for \naction--no set rules to be reviewed, no binding standards, no \nmeaningful deadlines. The Glenn substitute simply asks that, every 5 \nyears, the agencies issue a schedule of rules that each agency in its \nsole discretion thinks merits review. It does not require any \nparticular number of rules to be reviewed. And, if someone asks the \nagency to review a particular rule, there is no judicial review of a \ndecision declining to place the rule on the schedule.\n  Moreover, there is no judicial review of deadlines for completing the \nreview of any rules. No matter how irrational a rule is, no matter how \nmany people it is burdening, an agency does not have to review it. If \nthe agency happens to put the rule on the schedule, nothing prevents \nthe agency from procrastinating for 11 years. Again, the only deadline \nis a modest 11-year deadline for reviewing the rule.\n  The third point I want to emphasize is that effective regulatory \nreform must be enforceable to be effective. That means there has to be \nsome opportunity for judicial review of the requirements of the \nlegislation, just as there is with almost any law Congress passes. S. \n343 strikes a balance by allowing limited, but effective, judicial \nreview. I should note at the outset that S. 343 has been \nmischaracterized as a lawyer's dream and a litigation morass. In fact, \nS. 343 provides less judicial review than is normally provided for any \nlaw that Congress passes.\n  S. 343 carves away from the standard level of judicial review \nprovided by the Administrative Procedure Act, which has existed for \nalmost 50 years. The limited judicial review provided by S. 343 will \nhelp discourage frivolous lawsuits, and that is why S. 343 has limited \njudicial review. At the same time, it does allow an agency to be held \naccountable for complying with the major requirements of the bill.\n  An agency's compliance or noncompliance with the provisions of S. 343 \ncan be considered by a court to some degree. The court can, based on \nthe whole rulemaking record, determine whether the agency sufficiently \ncomplied with the cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment \nrequirements of S. 343 so that the rule passes muster under the \narbitrary and capricious standard. The arbitrary and capricious \nstandard is very deferential to the agency. A court would uphold the \nrule unless that agency's cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment was \nso flawed that the rule itself was arbitrary and capricious. The court \nwould not strike down a rule merely because there were some minor \nprocedural missteps in the cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment.\n  In contrast, the Glenn substitute, as now redrafted, does not permit \nmeaningful judicial review of the risk assessment or cost-benefit \nanalysis. The Glenn substitute only requires a court to invalidate a \nrule if the cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment was not done at \nall. But the Glenn substitute does not really allow the court to \nconsider whether the cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment was done \nproperly. Indeed, Senator Glenn has weakened the language originally in \nhis bill so that now substantial portions of his bill are irrelevant to \nthe extent that a court could not require the agency to perform the \ncost-benefit analysis, risk assessment, or peer review in the manner \nprescribed by the bill.\n  Compliance with cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment \nrequirements of the bill would be optional by the agency, the same way \nit is optional for them to comply with the Executive order that now \nrequires these analyses.\n  Senator Glenn has claimed that his bill is essentially the same as S. \n291--the regulatory reform bill I introduced in January and which \nreceived the bipartisan support of the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs. Although the original Glenn bill was similar to the Roth bill, \nthe current Glenn substitute seriously differs from the Roth bill. For \nexample, Senator Glenn has seriously weakened the review of rules \nprovision.\n  The Roth bill required agencies to review all major rules in a 10-\nyear period, with a possible 5-year extension, or the rules would \nsunset, or terminate. The revised Glenn substitute lacks any firm \nrequirement about the number of rules to be reviewed.\n  Worse still, Senator Glenn has weakened the judicial review provision \nthat was in the Roth bill and that originally appeared in the Glenn \nbill. Section 623(e) of the Roth bill and the original Glenn bill \nstated that the cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment ``shall, to \nthe extent relevant, be considered by a court in determining the \nlegality of the agency action.''\n  That meant that the court should focus on the cost-benefit analysis \nand risk assessment in determining whether the rule was arbitrary and \ncapricious. Now, the Glenn substitute strikes that language. The Glenn \nsubstitute merely asks the agency do the cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessment, but the agency can do a sloppy job. The agency also does \nnot have to act upon the analyses and issue a rule whose benefits \njustify its costs. In fact, the agency simply can ignore the cost-\nbenefit analysis. And nobody can do much about an agency that is doing \na bad job. For a reviewing court, the analyses are just some more \npieces of paper among the many thousands of pieces of paper in the \nrulemaking record.\n  The court does not have to focus on the cost-benefit analysis in \ndetermining whether the rule makes sense. Mr. President, that is not \nreal regulatory reform. That is protecting the bureaucracy at the \nexpense of the public.\n  I should also mention that the Glenn bill seriously weakens the risk \nassessment provisions of the Roth bill. The Glenn substitute \nsignificantly carves back on the number of agencies and programs that \nwould have to comply with the risk assessment requirements.\n Moreover, the risk assessment language itself is weakened. As just one \nexample, section 634(c)(1) of the Glenn language reverses the standard \ninterpretation of how defaults should be used. The substitute relies on \na minority comment in the National Academy of Science report, Science \nand Judgment. That is, the Glenn substitute \n\n[[Page S 10107]]\nprefers default assumption when relevant data is available. That is not \nwhat good scientists would do. And that is not what the majority of the \nNational Academy would recommend.\n\n  Finally, Senator Glenn has weakened the definition of ``major rule.'' \nThere are no narrative provisions under which OMB could list certain \nproblematic rules as major rules subject to full analysis.\n  Now, as I mentioned, if you compare S. 343 with the Glenn substitute, \nyou would see that, section-by-section, they look similar. Both have \nprovisions for cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment, review of \nexisting rules, comparative risk analysis, market mechanisms and \nperformance standards, reform of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, \ncongressional review of rules, and regulatory accounting.\n  But without a focused and effective cost-benefit test, there is \nnothing to require future rules to be justifiable and cost-effective. \nAnd without an effective lookback provision with real requirements, \nthere is nothing to ensure that old rules already on the books will be \nreformed. Finally, without effective judicial review, we may as well \nnot have a statute at all--we could keep the existing Executive order \n12866 that governs regulatory planning and review.\n  But the whole reason for regulatory reform legislation is that the \nExecutive orders for regulatory review, issued by every President since \nPresident Ford, have not been working well enough. There is widespread \nconsensus that the regulatory process is broken and that firm action is \nneeded. There is widespread agreement that many rules have been issued \nin violation of the requirements of the Executive orders. Many rules \ncould not be justified if scrutinized under a cost-benefit test. Yet, \nExecutive orders since President Ford have required cost-benefit \nanalysis. The current Executive order of President Clinton, No. 12866, \nsimilarly requires cost-benefit analysis, but again, there is nothing \nto ensure that the agencies will comply. There is no effective judicial \nreview in Senator Glenn's substitute to solve this problem.\n  I also should add that many of the objections that Senator Glenn and \nothers have raised are off the mark or have already been addressed. \nFirst, we agree agencies should be required to perform risk assessment \nand cost-benefit analysis. Second, S. 343 clearly does not override \nexisting statutory criteria. Moreover, S. 343 is not a special interest \nbill. It does add a petition process to review rules so that the work \ndoes get done. I should also note that we did add Senator Glenn's \nsunshine provision verbatim. Finally, as I have detailed, we agree with \nSenator Glenn that ``judicial review should be available to ensure that \nfinal agency rules are based on adequate analysis.'' The Dole-Johnston \ncompromise meets these principles.\n  The Dole-Johnston compromise merely directs regulators to issue \nregulations whose benefits justify their costs. But the bill does not \noverride existing law. This should not be a radical idea in the White \nHouse or on Capitol Hill. I do not believe that the American people \nthink it is radical to ask that the benefits of regulations justify \ntheir costs.\n  Similarly, review of existing rules has been required for almost 15 \nyears under Executive order. Yet, there is a lot of evidence that \ngetting agencies to review existing rules is a lot easier said than \ndone. In the first annual report on President Clinton's Executive Order \n12866, OIRA Administrator Sally Katzen admitted that bureaucratic \nincentives make reviewing rules a difficult undertaking. In discussing \nthe ``lookback'' requirement of Executive Order 12866, Administrator \nKatzen said:\n\n       It had proven more difficult to institute than we had \n     anticipated. . . . [A]gencies are focused on meeting \n     obligations for new rules, often under statutory or court \n     deadlines, at a time when staff and budgets are being \n     reduced; under these circumstances, it is hard to muster \n     resources for the generally thankless task of rethinking and \n     rewriting current regulatory programs.\n\n  After extensive review of the regulatory process, Vice President Gore \nconcluded that ``thousands upon thousands of outdated, overlapping \nregulations remain in place.'' The long but disappointing record of \nexecutive branch review efforts necessitates a legislative mandate. But \nthis must be a real mandate, with real requirements. As redrafted, the \nGlenn substitute does not adequately address this pressing problem. The \nDole bill will bring real change.\n  The Dole compromise reflects many comments and suggestions from \nnumerous Senators of both parties, the Clinton administration, the \nAmerican Bar Association, and many scholars and legal experts.\n  In sum, the Dole-Johnston compromise strikes a balance between reform \nthat is strong but workable. I urge my colleagues to set aside partisan \npolitics and support the effort to restore common sense to the \nregulatory process.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Did the Senator have a question for me?\n  Mr. ROTH. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, getting back to this question of the \nscope of review under section 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act, \nwhich is contained in our bill, there is a subsection (e), about which \nthere has been some comment and argument. Subsection (e) adds new \nlanguage as follows, that:\n\n       The reviewing court shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside \n     an agency action if it is:\n       (e) . . . substantial evidence in a case subject to section \n     556 and 557 . . . and otherwise reviewed on the record.\n\n  Excuse me, it is not subsection (e). It is subsection (f). It says it \nshall hold unlawful an action:\n\n       Without substantial support in the rulemaking file viewed \n     as a whole, for the asserted or necessary factual basis.\n\n  This, as I understand it, is a principle of law which is about a \ncentury old. And this codifies that view. It was first proposed by \nSenator Bumpers, and I hope Senator Bumpers will come over and defend \nthis provision.\n  From my own point of view, it adds, really, very little. It has very \nlittle to do with risk assessment. It has nothing to do with risk \nassessment or cost-benefit analysis because that provision does not \nrelate to risk assessment or cost-benefit analysis. That relates to the \nAdministrative Procedure Act appeals, which are outside of cost-benefit \nanalysis or risk assessment.\n  So it is really, in my view, not a very important issue in this bill. \nI hope and believe that Senators will be able to get together on that \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I believe that we have accommodated virtually every \ncomplaint with this bill, save some of those which we have debated. We \nhave not yet satisfied everybody on toxic relief inventory. But I \nbelieve that is also in the total scheme of things, not a terribly \nimportant provision of this bill.\n  But we have satisfied the critics of the bill on the question of \nsupermandate. That was always the hot button in this bill. The House \nbill has a supermandate; that is, under the House bill, you can change \nexisting standards under existing law. Expressly, they override \nexisting law.\n  Mr. President, we have made it clear--expressly, explicitly clear--\nthat there is no supermandate in this bill. We have straightened out \nthe judicial review provisions, so there is no independent review of \nthe procedures as opposed to the final agency action.\n  We have passed the threshold of $100 million, the threshold that \nSenators so insisted upon. It is done. It is in the bill. It is passed.\n  We have straightened out the petition process so that there is one \nopportunity to get on the list for review, if you were left off. It is \n180 days in length. And, if you miss that 180-day window, then you are \nforeclosed for a full 5 years.\n  The appeal from that provision is consolidated. So that the former \ncriticism of the Dole bill, the original Dole bill, which was that \nthere would be this multiplicity of appeals, is simply not here on this \nbill. There is one consolidated appeal. It will not overload agencies \nor their legal staffs. There will be simply one appeal and one \nrulemaking action with respect to the schedule.\n  We have dealt with the effective date, so that those ongoing rules, \nwhich have been in the making for, in some cases, 2 and 3 years, will \nnot be subject to either cost-benefit or to risk assessment. They do \nnot have to do it. They are exempted totally. In fact, all rules are \nexempted from cost-benefit or \n\n[[Page S 10108]]\nfrom risk assessment, if the original notice of proposed rulemaking was \nfiled on or before April 1st, 1995. If it was filed after that, they \nhave ample opportunity to do what the law requires.\n  Mr. President, we won the fight on Superfund. Superfund environmental \nactivities are now out of this bill. And we have passed the Glenn \nsunshine amendment.\n  What we have not done is to go along with what the Glenn-Chafee \namendment now requires, which is to throw out any requirements and to \nmake this bill completely consensual, because the Glenn-Chafee \nsubstitute is sham reform. If you do not want to have cost-benefit \nanalysis, if you do not want to have risk assessment, then vote for the \nGlenn-Chafee amendment because it is all consensual. If an agency head \nwants to do it in his or her sole discretion, then vote to put it in \ntheir sole discretion. There is no judicial review. There is no \nrequirement. And you can be sure it will not be done.\n  It will be business as usual if you vote for the Glenn-Chafee \namendment. There is no requirement of meeting a test that the benefits \njustify the cost. Oh, to be sure, you must state whether the benefits \njustify the costs, but you do not have to meet that test. You just give \nthe information and go merrily on your way and nobody can question you.\n  Mr. President, the Dole-Johnston amendment is a workable, logical, \nscientifically sound set of requirements that will put agencies of this \nFederal Government to a rigorous set of logical steps so that we can \navoid what we have under the present law, which is regulations not \nbased on science, not based on real risks, but, as EPA said in 1987 in \ntheir own study, that systematically they rate risk according to what \nthe public thinks about those risks as opposed to what the scientists \nthink about those risks. That is a 1987 study by EPA, not some industry \ngroup, not some right-wing think tank, but EPA's own study, which said \nin 1987 in their publication entitled ``Unfinished Business,'' that \ntheir estimations of risk were wrong.\n  In 1990, EPA's own Science Advisory Board made a new study of the old \nstudy. They made a new study to determine whether the old study was \ncorrect. And they stated that the 1987 study was correct; that is, EPA \nhas not been using science or the proper estimation of risks.\n  To bring science into the proposition is not to erode health \nstandards. It is not to allow E. coli in meat. It is not to make people \nless safe. To the contrary, the way we determine whether someone is at \nrisk in the health, safety, or the environment is by a scientific \nevaluation. You do not decide what to do on a health standard by \nconsulting some soothsayer or some pollster or some political \noperative. You determine what meets a standard of health by looking at \nthe best science available. That is what we do in this bill. We require \nthe best science available--not the best politics, not the best \nbureaucrat, not the pressure group with the most members, not the one \nthat can make the most noise, not the one that can meet the most people \nat a public meeting, but the best science available. And we require \nthem to justify the cost--not to get the cheapest, not to get the least \ncost, but to get that which satisfies the requirement of health, \nsafety, or the environment, and satisfies the uncertainties of science \nor data.\n  Mr. President, the Dole-Johnston bill is a tightly drawn bill which \nserves the public well. I hope my colleagues will endorse that bill \ntoday and vote cloture.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have listened for some long while to \nthis debate and participated during previous days in this debate on \nregulatory reform.\n  I must say that in the early stages of this debate, it was beyond \nboring. I mean there are boring debates and then there are boring \ndebates that are well beyond the definition of boring. I suppose the \nreason for that is because the language of this legislation--and also, \nin some respects, the language of the debate itself--is technical and \nso arcane and so terribly difficult to understand. I suspect for that \nreason it has not been very interesting.\n  Yet the debate itself about regulatory reform, or what kind of \nregulations we ought to have in this country, is a debate that will \naffect every single American. It is very important, especially this \ndebate as it relates to the safety of what we eat and drink and \nbreathe. It relates to the controversy that we have had now for a \ncouple of decades over how we do things in this country.\n  It was not too many years ago that we did not care much about \nenvironmentalism or about environmental concerns. The issue was if you \nare going to produce widgets or you are going to manufacture widgets, \nyou get yourself a manufacturing plant and you start manufacturing \nwidgets, whatever they are, and you can dump the pollution into the \nairshed; you can drop your raw chemicals into the waters and streams \nand lakes. It just did not matter because you were providing jobs and \nproducing widgets. And, of course, what you were doing was passing the \ncosts of this manufacturing down the road to someone else who someday \nwould be required to clean up the air and those streams and rivers and \nlakes.\n  About 20 or 30 years ago, the people in this country started asking a \nquestion: Would it not make more sense for us to stop spoiling this \nplace in which we live by requiring those who produce and those who do \ncertain things to do it without despoiling the air or the water? Would \nthat not make more sense? And, of course, those who were producing, \nthose who wanted to dump chemicals and effluents and pollution into the \nair, and those who dumped chemicals into the water, did not want to \nchange the way they did business. Frankly, it was costly to change the \nway they did business.\n  I have told my colleagues before; I grew up in a town of about 300 to \n400 people, which is a small town, in North Dakota. When I was a young \nboy, my father ran a service station and farm implement dealership, and \npart of what was done in that service station was people would drive in \nand we would change the oil in their cars. After we had changed the \noil--we would take the nut out of the crankcase and drain their \ncrankcase of the used oil--it would go into a barrel, and when the \nbarrel was full, the barrel was poured into a large tank. And when the \ntank was full of all of this used oil, we would hook the tank up to a \nlittle co-op tractor and drive up and down Main Street of Regent, ND. \nWe had a pipe on the back of that tank with little drip valves on it, \nand we would drip that used oil all up and down the Main Street of my \nhometown.\n  Why did we do that? Because my hometown did not have paved streets, \nand it was a wonderful thing that the Farmers Union Oil Co. did for \nRegent. And for that matter, it was a wonderful thing the Regent Garage \ndid for Regent. Every so often, when they had enough used oil in their \ntank, they hooked it behind the tractor and drove up and down Main \nStreet and dripped that oil on Main Street to keep the dust down.\n  That was an old-time version of blacktop, I guess, just drip used oil \non Main Street to keep the dust down. Of course, if you caught someone \ntoday riding a little co-op tractor dripping a barrel of used oil on \nMain Street of Regent, ND, someone would soon have them on the way to a \npenitentiary someplace because that is a very serious violation of \nFederal law and State law. You cannot decide to drop oil on the main \nstreet of a town in order to hold the dust down as we did because we \nunderstand now, many decades later, we were contaminating and polluting \nand ruining our water supply. It was not the right thing to do. We did \nnot know it at the time; we thought we were doing a good thing at the \ntime. The people of my hometown thought it was wonderful. But we were \npolluting the water supply, contaminating groundwater.\n  So we have rules and regulations that say you cannot do that. If you \nare going to take used oil out of cars, you are going to have to figure \nout a way of disposing of that used oil without ruining our water \nsupply--a fairly simple requirement except it costs money. It is a pain \nfor somebody who is changing oil in cars to have to figure out what to \ndo with that used oil. It costs money to \n\n[[Page S 10109]]\ndeal with that used oil in the right way.\n  Well, is it reasonable to require that we not dump that on the \nstreets or dump it in a ditch someplace? Yes, that is reasonable. And \nit is a cost that then is passed on with the cost of doing business.\n  In a much larger way, we have had that same debate with respect to \nair pollution. In the 1970's in North Dakota, there was a decision that \nwe were going to use a lot more lignite coal. We are part of the Fort \nUnion Basin, which has the largest lignite coal deposits in the world. \nIn order to produce electricity to fuel Minneapolis, using lignite coal \nfrom North Dakota out there in the prairies, they wanted to build large \ncoal-fired generators to burn that coal and produce electricity. The \nproblem with that was that North Dakota was to host this lignite coal \nburning. If you are going to burn lignite coal to ship electricity to \nMinneapolis-St. Paul, for example, so they can have heat in the winter \nand air conditioning in the summer, do we want air pollution in our \nairshed in North Dakota as a result of doing that? The answer is no.\n  So in the 1970's, I and two or three other fellows led at the time a \nfight in North Dakota to say if you are going to build coal generating \nplants in North Dakota, you are going to do it right. In other words, \nyou are going to be required to use the latest available technology \nwith respect to your stacks, and the effluence or emissions that come \nfrom those coal-fired generating plants have to be reduced by using the \nlatest available technology; in other words, wet scrubbers on those \nstacks to clean the air. Expensive? You bet. Very expensive. Was it the \nright thing? Well, 20 years later, I can tell you I am proud of having \nbeen involved in that fight and proud of having been in a group that \nwon that fight in North Dakota because, yes, we burn a lot of lignite \ncoal. I am pleased that we do. But it is burned in plants that have wet \nscrubbers and the latest available technology to prevent the kind of \npollution we would have had.\n  The result is that North Dakota met the clean air standards. We still \nhave a good airshed, largely because we fought the fight and said you \nare required to do this the right way. That was a regulation, a \nrequirement. Was it a pain for somebody? Was it costly? Yes, it was. \nBut it was the right thing, as well. Had we not done that, we would \nhave produced power and sent it east somewhere and we would have been \nstuck with dirty air in North Dakota. It is not the right way to do \nthings.\n  Now, the issue with respect to this matter in this Chamber is an \nissue, it seems to me, of what is reasonable. Some call this regulatory \nreform. Others call it regulatory rollback. I happen to believe there \nare a lot of silly, unnecessary, and unreasonable Federal rules and \nregulations, and we ought to get rid of them and the people who write \nthem. There is no excuse for that. But we ought to deal with facts, not \nfiction.\n  It is interesting, in the book The ``Death of Common Sense,'' among \nother things, it is said a dentist is now prevented from extracting a \ntooth, a child's tooth, and giving the tooth to the child. I thought to \nmyself when I read that, what on Earth is happening? Who would write a \nrule like that? Well, I looked into it. It turns out it is not true--a \ngreat story, but it just is not true.\n  There is a host of those kinds of myths that gain life because \nsomeone said it in an anecdote that turns out to be just not true. In \nfact, there are a dozen or so that have been used in the Chamber, which \nI am going to come and describe, and most of those dozen are not true \neither. I will do that in a subsequent presentation. It is one thing if \nwe are dealing with fact. It is another thing if we are not dealing \nwith the truth.\n  One of the issues that has been raised in the Chamber as silly \nregulations, we are told, is that a worker cannot wear a beard. In \nfact, I think it was on Senator Hatch's top 10 list, No. 9. It says \nforcing a man to choose between his religion and his job because rules \ndo not allow workers to wear a mask over a beard. A stupid rule, \nSenator Hatch alleged.\n  Well, I looked into that to try to understand: Is that the case? The \nGovernment, at least to the extent that I have been able to find--and \nmaybe someone will correct this--never forces workers to choose between \ntheir safety and their religious beliefs about wearing beards.\n  There are some businesses that do that, that require their male \nemployees to be clean shaven. This actually deals with the question of \nrespirators, which prevent workers from breathing in harmful substances \nsuch as asbestos, lead, or toxic chemicals, and apparently about 2.6 \nmillion American workers do wear respirators. One kind of respirator \ndoes not work if you wear a beard, because you do not get a good seal \naround your mouth.\n  But a better respirator can work even if you wear a beard. And if you \nuse environmental engineering controls, to stop workers from breathing \nin these toxic substances in the first place, you do not need to wear a \nrespirator at all.\n  So the fact is the Government does not force workers to choose \nbetween their safety and their religious beliefs about wearing beards.\n  Here is another one. An elderly woman cannot plant a rose garden. No. \n3 on the top 10 list of silly regulations. We do not have any idea \nwhere that comes from. The suggestion, I guess, is that section 404 of \nthe Clean Water Act is preventing someone from gardening as they \nwished. As we understand it, the story turns out to be almost entirely \napocryphal. A number of people have tried to get the facts on this \nsilly regulation, or alleged regulation.\n  It first appeared in 1991, I understand. It was alleged it happened \nto a woman in Louisiana. And then when retold, apparently it happened \nto a woman in South Carolina. And then retold again, it turns out it \nwas probably a woman in Georgia. The Heritage Foundation said that this \nwas a woman in Wyoming. Well, the Army Corps of Engineers has never \nbeen able to determine where this story might have come from.\n  Perhaps if Senator Hatch, or others, might tell us who this happened \nto and give us some details, we can verify whether this is actually the \ncase. At least those who have tried to verify this say the allegation \nthat an elderly woman was prevented from planting a bed of roses on her \nown land is simply not the case, simply not true. There are no facts to \nsupport it.\n  There are a whole series of these myths.\n  No. 4 that was offered in a chart, Senator Hatch's list of top 10 \nsilly regulations, was failing to approve a potentially lifesaving \ndrug, thus forcing a terminal cancer patient to go across the border to \nMexico to have it administered.\n  Now, I want to note that we have provisions of the Federal Food, Drug \nand Cosmetic Act in this country that do relate to the question of what \ndrugs patients who are terminally ill may use.\n  First, since 1968, the FDA has had what is called a ``compassionate \nuse policy,'' to permit the use of a drug that is still being tested if \nthere is no other drug available for the condition. Second, the FDA may \nmake promising drugs that are still under investigation available to \nterminally ill patients before the drugs go on the general market. \nThird, FDA now has a new fast-track procedure to speed approval of new \ndrugs for serious or life-threatening illnesses.\n  I understand that there are some concerns about the speed or the pace \nwith which the FDA acts. It seems to me that the Congress and the FDA \nhave tried to address this issue.\n  You know, the FDA has had an interesting history in this country. \nThey have been careful, it is true. A recent study showed that 56 drugs \nhave been removed from the market in the United States, Great Britain, \nFrance, and Germany since 1970. In other words, drugs have been removed \nfrom the market 56 times. Of these, only nine removals occurred in the \nUnited States. Why? Because the drugs that were removed from British, \nFrench and German markets were not approved by the FDA.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I wonder if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The Senator has been talking about the list of the top \n10 worst regulations. Frankly, I have not paid too much attention to \nthose anecdotal sort of things. Is the Senator aware that EPA did a \nstudy of its own \n\n[[Page S 10110]]\nregulations in 1987 called ``Unfinished Business: A Comparative \nAssessment of Environmental Problems,'' and that they concluded that \ntheir own estimation of risk did not comport with scientific risk, but \nrather with the public opinion about those risks? Is the Senator aware \nthat was EPA's own evaluation of its own regulations?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am familiar with the study, but I have not had the \nopportunity to review it in detail.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I have a copy of it here. I wonder if the Senator is \naware that in 1990, the Science Advisory Board did a study of that and, \nin effect, concluded that the first study was correct; that is, that it \ndid not comport with scientific evaluation of those risks, but rather \nwith public perception of those risks. The Senator was not aware of \nthat?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Again, I have not examined the results of that study in \ndepth.\n  However, I do not think the Senator would use either study to \ndemonstrate a conclusion that the central thesis of what I am talking \nabout, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and a whole range of \nother health, safety and environmental standards, are somehow not \ngrounded in science or not grounded in fact. I think the Senator would \nnot be correct if he says the bulk of what we do to make sure our water \nis safe, to make sure our air is clean, to make sure drugs are tested \nand safe, the bulk of what we do is inappropriate. The Senator would \nnot be making that case, would he?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Absolutely not. As a matter of fact, we have \nspecifically stated that all of those laws to which the Senator refers \nwill not be changed in any way, will not be overridden. I thought it \nwas clear in the original Dole-Johnston bill, and we have had a lot of \ndebate here, as the Senator knows, about the question of whether it was \nclear. We accepted the amendment that made it doubly clear; that is, \nthat each one of those laws will remain in full force and effect, all \nthe standards will be there.\n  What we are dealing with here is rules. When you take those laws and \ntranslate them into rules, what we are saying is that you must look at \nthose laws through the lens of sound science and proper risk \nassessment, rather than public opinion, politics, emotion, prejudice, \nsuperstition--whatever. We are saying translate those good laws, which \nprotect public health and safety, but do it in a rigorously logical and \nscientifically appropriate way. Would you agree with that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, as the Senator states that principle, I have no \nsubstantial disagreement with him. However, the Senator understands \nvery well what is at work with respect to this body of change and \nreform. The Senator is perhaps familiar with the stories of the bill \nthat is similar to this one--though not identical--the regulatory \nreform bill that went through the House of Representatives?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. It differs with this bill as night does day.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Perhaps. My point is with respect to the regulatory \nreform agenda, I know the Senator has read the accounts and probably \nverified them in discussing them with our colleagues that the bill in \nthe House of Representatives was actually written by a bunch of \nlobbyists sitting in a room saying, ``This is what we need to have \nhappen.''\n  I guarantee you this--I just guarantee because I have been in these \nfights in North Dakota for a long time, with respect to air pollution \nand other matters. The corporate system is interested in profit, and \nthey should be because they are responsible to their stockholders. When \nthey sit around and propose regulatory reform legislation, they are \ndesigning to find ways to weaken the Clear Air Act, the Clean Water Act \nand a whole series of regulatory standards. That is simply the way it \nworks. I think that is unfortunate, but they have every right to try to \ndo that. I want to make sure we get rid of the silly and the outrageous \nregulations--and there are some--but I want to keep the foundation of \nwhat we have done.\n  Is the Senator aware of this: I wonder if the Senator is aware--\nlikely, because I think he is one of the best in the Senate on the \nissue of energy and related issues--that in the last 20 years, we have \nnearly doubled the amount of energy we use, and yet the airshed in \nAmerica is cleaner than it was 20 years ago?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator is aware of that, the Senator, I think, \nwould agree with me that is not because the captains of American \nindustry said, ``We ought to invest our money to clean the air.'' It is \nbecause Congress decided to do something. We decided to say to people, \n``When you produce, part of the cost of the production is the \nrequirement not to pollute America's air.''\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. And that is why we have every single provision of that \nClean Air Act unchanged, not overridden, and the full force and effect \nif this bill passes.\n  Did the Senator know the original risk assessment was proposed by a \nDemocrat, namely me, and passed overwhelmingly here?\n  Mr. DORGAN. In the last session of Congress, absolutely.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I do not know what happened in the House, whether or \nnot lobbyists were involved in it. That is irrelevant to this bill. We \ntook the original Dole bill which came out of committee, which, in \nturn, differed from the House bill, and made over 100 changes, \nincluding all of those I talked about. So I do not know how it started \nor how it changed or how the House did it or what the Louisiana \nLegislature did. I am telling you what is before the Senate now, which \nis the relevant thing, and what is before the Senate now is a tough \nbill which incorporates all of those good provisions for clean air and \nwater that the Senator speaks about.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator's participation. I have great \nrespect for Senator Johnston.\n  Let me finish what I was trying to say.\n  Mr. LEVIN. While the Senator is yielding, if the Senator will yield \nfor an additional question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Louisiana asked if the Senator was \nfamiliar with a number of documents, and there is a third document I \nwould like to refer to, which is the March 1995 report, later than the \ntwo documents to which the Senator from Louisiana referred.\n  In the 1994 report of the National Academy of Sciences--that report \nentitled ``Science and Judgment in Risk Assessment''--they made a \nnumber of specific recommendations to the EPA where they might improve \npolicies, practices, and methods of risk assessment, but also concluded \nthe following:\n\n       EPA's approach to assessing risks is fundamentally sound, \n     despite often-heard criticisms.\n\n  I ask this question of my friend--as to when the Senator was \nreviewing the two earlier documents of the Senator from Louisiana--\nwhether he might also add to that reading list the 1994 report of the \nNational Academy of Sciences?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to add that report to the list of \nreports I should review. I have heard the Senator from Louisiana refer \nto his two in previous debate. I doubt whether the conclusion one can \nreach from them is that you have a bunch of folks proposing regulations \non unscientific basis. Let us think about the facts here.\n  The fact is we use twice as much energy now and have cleaner air. Why \nis that? Because we have clean air regulations that do not work? Of \ncourse not. They have succeeded. One of the things we at least ought to \ntake credit for is having marched in the right direction. I think the \nSenator from Louisiana would not contest that. He is making the case, \nyes, that is probably true, but we are not interfering with that.\n  So let us understand that what has been done in the name of \nregulation, in many instances, has been awfully good for this country. \nWe now have started to clean up America's airshed. I think a lot of the \nkids and families would say thanks for that. That is the right thing. \nWe want to live in a healthier place. My sense is that if you ask folks \nout there: Do you think that the food safety standards in this country \nmake sense? Would you sooner go into a restaurant and order a side of \nbeef--not that the Senator from Louisiana would eat a whole side of \nbeef at one sitting--but would you like to see on that side of beef one \nof those big stamps that says ``USDA inspected,'' or would you \n\n[[Page S 10111]]\nlike to see that it has a little stamp that says, ``This side of beef \nwas inspected by Sid and Arnie's Meatpackers Co.''?\n  Well, look, I think what we have done for food safety has made a lot \nof sense in this country. I will not tell the stories about bread and \nrat poison and meat going down the same holes in the 1900's before we \ndecided to have meat safety standards.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The answer is, of course, I want that ``USDA \ninspected'' label on there, and I want scientists to make that \ninspection based on scientific standards and not on some public opinion \npoll or some prejudice or some superstition. Put good science in the \npicture. That is all we are saying. I want the inspections to continue, \nbut with good science. That is what we are about. You know, it is the \nscientists who discovered E. coli, not some pollster out there reading \nthe results of the last election.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator knows what has happened with E. coli in the \nlast couple of days. He has read the reports about outbreaks in three \nor five States in recent days. We are now going to be talking, one of \nthese days--I hope seriously--about inspection of fish and seafood. \nThat is now voluntary in this country, and it ought not be. When we get \nto that point, I wonder whether we will be as aggressive and interested \nin making sure that that inspection is the equivalent of other flesh \nfood and that we will have the same kind of assurance for the American \nconsumer that they are buying fish and seafood that is healthy and \nwholesome.\n  I happen to think that in some areas regulations make sense. I do not \nthink the Senator from Louisiana disagrees with that. But we have been \nin this circle here where if somebody holds up a silly regulation, I \nguarantee you--and I know we are not debating the House bill--that that \nbill was written by the people who want to get out from under the cost \nof regulations. People used silly examples then to demonstrate the \nrule. Well, even if the exception is true, it does not demonstrate the \nrule.\n  We are always debating things the Government is spending. Somebody \nmight say, gee, ``Did you know somebody in a research is studying the \nsex life of a screw worm?'' Yes, they study that with public dollars. \nWhy? They did that to save the beef industry in this country. And they \ndid. I cannot even describe to you the cost-benefit ratio of that work. \nBut someone can make fun of that, I suppose, or the fact that somebody \nwas sitting in a laboratory with dark glasses studying molds and \ndiscovered penicillin. You can go on forever.\n  With respect to regulations, we go through the same kind of \nsituation. Someone holds up a silly one--and there are some--and says, \n``This demonstrates the rule.''\n  I am going to support the Glenn-Chafee regulatory reform substitute \nbecause I think it moves in the right direction. It is substantial \nreform. It requires agencies to show that benefits justify the costs, \nbut it does not allow the cost estimates to control, just singularly--\n--\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If the Senator will yield, I submit to the Senator the \nGlenn-Chafee bill does not make such a requirement. It makes a \nrequirement of stating whether the benefits justify the cost. But it is \nno longer a decisional criterion. You state it, but you do not have to \ncomply with it. That is the point.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will yield soon, but I say that my understanding of the \nGlenn-Chafee substitute is that it requires that the agency use a cost-\neffectiveness standard, and the cost effectiveness standard, in looking \nat which regulatory scheme or approach to use, is substantially \ndifferent than what I believe your proposal would require, which is the \nleast-cost standard. You might find a standard that is the least cost \nbut is less appropriate than the most cost-effective standard. That is \nhow I view the differences in these proposals.\n  I yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator has pointed exactly to one of the major \ndifferences in the two bills, which is the requirement in the Johnston \nbill that you go with least cost, unless there is a certain \nnonquantifiable benefit. But if the benefits are quantifiable--which \nthey are in many instances--you are forced to go with the least cost, \neven though a slightly larger cost would produce a major additional \nbenefit.\n  So the Senator is exactly right on that. On the question of whether \nor not cost-benefit analyses were required in the Glenn-Chafee \nsubstitute, it is required. It is right here on page 29, line 14. I am \ngoing to read the language because it is required, but if it cannot be \ngiven, then the agency must say why, in fact, the certification that \nthe benefits justify the cost cannot be made, because there are \ninstances where an agency cannot make that certification. This is the \nlanguage:\n\n       The agency must certify that the rule will produce benefits \n     that will justify the cost to the Government and to the \n     public of implementation of and compliance with the rule, or \n     an explanation of why such certification cannot be made.\n\n  And in addition to requiring that that certification be given, the \nGlenn-Chafee approach is that Congress is then put in the position \nwhere, if such a certification is not or cannot be made, then it will \nor can veto such a regulation. We are put in the position, because of \nthe expedited process here, for Congress to review regulations, and \nwhere the benefits do not justify the costs or any other regulation, we \nare accountable.\n  Finally, there is some accountability in the elected officials of \nthis land for the regulations which people might think are burdensome. \nWe are not going to be able to hide behind the regulators under Glenn-\nChafee. We have here legislative veto.\n  So in the event an agency cannot certify that the benefits justify \nthe cost, someone can come to us--a constituent can come to us and say, \nhey, look at this cost-benefit analysis. They are producing here \nsomething which costs $1 billion and only produced one-half billion \ndollars in benefits. We want you to veto that because it does not make \nsense. We are not going to have any excuses--no more excuses, no more \nhiding behind regulatory agencies. So there are significant differences \nbetween the two bills, but they are not both regulatory reform, and \ncost-benefit is required in both bills. The difference is what happens \nwhen an agency cannot certify, or should certify, that the benefits \njustify the cost under Glenn-Chafee. We then take the position as to \nwhat should happen.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know that others want to speak. Let me \nmake two final points on this subject. I appreciate the comments of the \nSenator from Michigan.\n  It is very hard, it seems to me, for anyone to talk much about \nsuccess. Failure is what sells. Scandal sells. Success is largely \nboring.\n  You know, Gregg Easterbrook has recently published a book about the \ncircumstances we face in this country with our air and our water. He \npoints out something most Americans probably do not know, that our air \nis cleaner now than 20 years ago. Is it perfect? No. Are we moving in \nthe right direction? Yes. Our water is cleaner now than it was 20 years \nago. Our lakes, rivers, and streams are cleaner than 20, 25 years ago.\n  Think back 20 or 25 years ago. Most people foresaw an era ahead of \ngloom and doom. That seemed to be where we were headed--more pollution, \nmore use of energy, and more pollution of our air, of our water. And \nthey figured that we were consigned to do that. It was inevitable, they \nthought, because we could not control it.\n  Congress decided we wanted to do something about it, and we passed \nlegislation and said we have to change the way we do business. Yes, it \nis costly. Yes, it is probably a pain to do that. But we insist it is a \ncost of doing business, to keep America's airshed clean, to clean up \nour rivers and streams.\n  Mr. President, 20 years later we can stand on the floor of the Senate \nand debate regulations and talk about the fact that we changed the \ndirection this country was headed in. How? By regulations, by laws that \nsay we demand this country change the way it is moving.\n  Now, I happen to think that is wonderful. We should claim a little \nsuccess in areas where we have made progress.\n  Those who are elected to Congress under a regime of reform or change, \nwho come here thinking they ought to change what is successful, in my \njudgment, jumped on the wrong wagon on the way to town.\n  We ought not be reforming something that is working and moving us in \n\n[[Page S 10112]]\n  the right direction. If anyone believes that the direction of the \nregulatory reform bills in the House and some that have been proposed \nhere would weaken the fundamental structure of our attempt to clean our \nair and clean our water and keep our food safe, it seems to me the \nchoice is pretty clear. The choice is to support the Glenn-Chafee bill, \nwhich does reform our scheme of regulations in a sound and a practical \nway but does not jeopardize what we have accomplished in this country.\n  When I began this presentation, to those who took umbrage when I said \nthis debate is beyond boring, and for those who have participated in \nit, I do not mean this personally. I say it is beyond boring because \nmost of it is so fundamentally arcane and technical and hard to \nunderstand, but it will affect the life of every American citizen. It \nmight be boring, but it is critically important.\n  If we strip the peeling off, we are talking at the roots, yes, about \nE. coli; yes, about mammograms. We are talking about health, safety, \nclean air, clean water, and that affects every single American. That is \nwhy this debate is important. It is why it is important we get it \nright.\n  Finally, it is why it is important we not decide to be champions of \nchange in areas where we are successful. That makes no sense.\n  That is why I come here supporting the Glenn-Chafee bill, the \nsubstitute, and hope that we will not invoke cloture late today, and \ninstead decide to embrace the Glenn-Chafee regulatory reform \nsubstitute. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I rise to support S. 343, \nthe Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, and in strong \nopposition to the amendment offered by our friends, the Senators from \nOhio and Rhode Island.\n  Let Members know at the outset that the Dole-Johnston substitute is \nnot a regulatory repeal act. It is not a regulatory prohibition act. It \nis, in fact, a strong, regulatory reform act.\n  It reforms the way Government regulations are issued, with three \ngoals in mind: First, to bring accountability to the bureaucrats \nwriting the regulation and, just as importantly, to those in Congress, \nwho, after all, write the laws that generate those regulations; second, \nit attempts to bring a little common sense to the regulations that are \nissued; third, it brings a little more honesty to the way we talk about \nwhat we are regulating and why some truth in regulating is necessary.\n  I am afraid that the Glenn-Chafee amendment comes up short when \nmeasured by these criteria. This is an effort to go back to the status \nquo. It will ensure we stay where we are. It would fail to ensure that \nGovernment agencies obey the law and follow common sense like the rest \nof Americans have to do.\n  If the Glenn-Chafee amendment were to be adopted, we might as well do \nnothing--for that is, in fact, what will happen. There will be no \nchange. Same old 6's and 7's, the same old way we have been doing \nthings.\n  It is my contention that we simply cannot afford to do nothing. We \ncannot accept the status quo. Regulations are like water: Too little \nand you cannot live; too much and you drown. In our crowded society, \nthere is no question that regulations are needed to help make our \ncommunities a better place.\n  As has been pointed out at length in the recent discussions on this \nfloor, over the last 25 years, environmental regulations have helped \nensure that the air we breathe is cleaner, the water we drink is safer, \nand the rivers we fish and play in are increasingly less polluted.\n  Workplace regulations have made our jobs safer. One would think from \nlistening to the recent debate that we were going to change all that. \nThat is not the point.\n  Those who argue for 25 years are not being contested. But the \nargument is about here, today, and where we go from here. That is the \npoint that has been missed in some of the discussions we have just \nheard.\n  In recent years, the fact is that government regulation has risen to \nthe level where it is choking off the growth of jobs, the growth of \neconomic opportunity and the betterment of the way of life of everyone.\n  Just like the waters of the Missouri River that recently rose to \nflood part of my home State of Missouri, we are suffering a flood tide \nof regulation. The Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995 will go \na long way to stop the rising tide of overregulation. When the \nPresident signs this legislation, as I believe he eventually will, \nbecause he must, we are going to reduce the burden of government \nregulations below the flood stage so that regulations continue to \nenhance the quality of life, not interfere.\n  Now, opponents of this legislation have taken the approach that there \nis no problem with overregulation; regulation is only good. We have \nheard stated how many good things regulation has done. They say, Do not \nworry, be happy; regulatory burdens are all in your imagination. To \nthat I say, respectfully, Bunk. Get outside the beltway, ask the people \nwho live and work in the rest of America what they think. Ask the \npeople who have to comply with the regulations. Ask small businesses.\n  I have had the opportunity as chairman of the Small Business \nCommittee and as cochair of the Regulatory Relief Task Force to hear \nplenty from people in small business. Last week, I spoke on this floor \nabout a series of field hearings the Small Business Committee has held \naround the country. I can say that the Senators who attended those \nhearings had our eyes open to what is going on with small business and \nthe cumulative burden of regulations.\n  As the Chair well knows, we heard in Memphis from people from all \ndifferent areas of small business how the burdens of government \nregulation were making it impossible for them to continue to bring the \njobs, to provide the products that were essential, not only to the \neconomy, but to the well-being of the people in that area.\n  Just last month, I heard the same message from delegates to the White \nHouse Conference on Small Business. They made it very clear to anyone \nwho was willing to listen that excessive overreaching regulations and \noutrageous enforcement zeal are a top priority for the Nation's small \nentrepreneurs who create large numbers of new jobs.\n  These delegates came to Washington, took time away from their \nbusiness, spent their money, and devoted resources and effort of \nextraordinary magnitude to speak on behalf of small business.\n  They voted on the biggest concerns to small business from a list of \nseveral hundred proposals, from judicial review of the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act to cost-benefit analysis, to protection for self-\naudits, to sunsetting old regulations, to reform of OSHA--the delegates \nsent a clear message to us and to the President. Maybe some people \nstuck inside the beltway do not know that regulations are a big \nproblem. But small business knows that it is drowning in a floodtide of \nregulations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed at the end of \nmy remarks the list of the top 30 concerns as voted on by the delegates \nto the White House Conference on Small Business, so everyone can see \nhow important this legislation is to small business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BOND. I do not believe the delegates to the White House \nconference would want to see this bill weakened by the Glenn-Chafee \namendment.\n  Let us look at environmental regulations as an example of the rising \ncost of regulation. In the past, environmental regulations were based \non common sense and they have been responsible for giving us a much \nimproved quality of life. But increasingly they are now choking off \nAmerican entrepreneurship and producing fewer and fewer benefits.\n  I think I understand why this is happening. Because, to me, solving \nour environmental problems is a little like harvesting a Missouri \nsoybean field. You can get most of the soybeans quickly and efficiently \nwith a modern combine. It is an expensive machine but it is worth the \ncost because it is fast, efficient, gets the soybeans that provides a \nvital food source supply, and it does so in an economical way. We could \nbuild a superefficient combine, designed to harvest almost every single \nsoybean, leaving almost none behind, but it would sure be a lot slower \nand it would undoubtedly be far more expensive. And very few farmers in \nAudrain \n\n[[Page S 10113]]\nCounty, MO, where I am from, could afford it because it would only get \na few more soybeans. You could even take that one step farther. You \ncould get every last bean, perhaps, if you hired an army of people to \ncrawl through the fields on their hands and knees, looking for any \nsingle bean the machine has missed.\n  The point of all this is, simply, there is a diminishing return on \ninvestment at some point. Sooner or later, you have to say enough is \nenough and move on to another field. When is it that you say enough is \nenough? You say enough is enough when science says that it is enough. \nIf there is something truly dangerous, if the gathering of that last \nsoybean out of the field has to be done for critically important human \nhealth, welfare and environmental needs, then yes, let us talk about \ngetting that last bean. But when there is no real danger to the \nenvironment, or to human health, what good is there to pursue \nperfection?\n  Environmental regulations work just like that. Initially, our \nregulations were based on common sense and well worth the money we \nspent to reduce pollution. Nobody wants to go back--and nobody is \ntalking about going back--to the days of dirty water, dirty air, dirty \nfood. We have made great gains in environmental quality and \nsignificantly reduced pollution at moderate costs.\n  But in the last few years, I will tell you, something has gotten out \nof whack. In many areas of environmental protection we have found the \ncosts to get those last few molecules of pollution skyrocketed. \nAchieving additional gains is exorbitantly expensive, with more and \nmore money being spent on fewer and fewer results. In these areas we \nhave reached the point of dramatically diminishing returns.\n  If we cannot achieve zero risk--and most scientists I talk to tell me \nthat nature and this world is not a zero risk environment--does this \nmean we should stop writing regulations to protect our health and \nenvironment? No. Not at all. It simply means we cannot afford to \nregulate unwisely, as if we were going to achieve a zero risk, absolute \nperfection ideal, without regard to costs.\n  The current effort before us today in this body is to pass regulatory \nreform. Foremost, it is to ensure that regulation is done wisely. Those \nof us who are pushing for reform believe that knowledge, scientific \nknowledge and common sense, are important parts of wisdom. If we are \ngoing to spend $160 billion on the environment, we think everyone \nshould get a better understanding of what kinds of risks we are \nprotecting against, the benefits of specific regulations and the cost \nof those regulations.\n  The real tragedy of this is that our desire for perfection will \nbankrupt us and divert our efforts away from more significant risks. \nEvery day of every year, real people die because we have misallocated \nour resources. One study conducted at the Harvard Center for Risk \nAnalysis has shown that if EPA did a better job of prioritizing the \nresources consumed by a sample of 90 average regulations, 1,200 \nneedless deaths would be avoided. That is just 90 rules at just 1 \nagency.\n  Across the Government, this same study showed that by using common \nsense and getting the most bang for the buck, we could save tens of \nthousands of additional people every year without imposing any \nadditional cost on our cities or businesses. These are the real victims \nof the status quo. The complaints of how this bill might lead to \nsomeone being exposed to some increased theoretical risk pale in \ncomparison to the deaths that occur every day because we have spent our \nresources responding to the latest media scare instead of basing our \ndecisions on sound science and cost-benefit analysis.\n  Those on the other side who are exposed to regulatory reform--there \nare some who are opposed to any kind of regulatory reform, they like it \njust the way it is--like to trout out the phoney scare stories of the \nvictims of E. coli food poisoning. They know that this bill contains \nclear safeguards for regulations that protect us from food poisoning. \nBut the other side does not say much about those who are inquired or \nkilled every year because we waste resources on trival risks, instead \nof focusing on the real health and safety risks. These are the victims \nwho are left with no hope if the Glenn-Chafee amendment passes.\n  The Dole-Johnston substitute has three simple goals: we want \nGovernment regulators and the Congress to be more accountable for their \nactions. We want Government regulators to be honest. And we want them \nto use a little common sense.\n  Central to increased accountability are the congressional review and \ntailored judicial review provisions of this bill.\n  Judicial review of the Regulatory Flexibility Act was the third \nhighest vote-getter at a recent White House conference. Let me take \njust a moment to explain why this is important.\n  The Regulatory Flexibility Act, for those who are not familiar with \nthe terminology, refers to a measure passed in 1980 by Congress. It was \nsupposed to give a break to small business by telling agencies that \nthey had to be flexible in passing regulations that deal with small \nbusiness. They were supposed to conduct a regulatory flexibility \nanalysis to see if there are other ways of getting the same job done if \nit affected small business.\n  Unfortunately, the problem was that Congress in its wisdom--and I \napologize for the oxymoron--struck any kind of judicial enforcement out \nof the Regulatory Flexibility Act. So what happened? Every time the \nAdvocacy Council and the SBA went to another agency and said, ``You did \nnot comply with the Reg Flex Act,'' or a small business went in and \nsaid ``You did not comply with the Reg Flex Act,'' the answer in too \nmany cases was, ``Tough. There is nothing you can do about it.''\n  There we see the provisions of the Glenn-Chafee amendment making \njudicial review almost ineffective, totally ineffective in many \ninstances, if there is only a show of cost-benefit analysis. We do not \nwant to make that same mistake again. We put in an appropriate judicial \nreview for reg flex, and on decisions such as cost-benefit analysis.\n  The judicial review provisions of S. 343 will provide a much-needed \ncheck on the actions of agencies, without subjecting rules to judicial \nscrutiny of minute procedural steps. This provision strikes the right \nbalance between accountability and a desire not to clog up Federal \ncourts.\n  The bill provides for greater congressional accountability by \nincluding the provisions of the Nickles-Reid Congressional Review Act \npassed by the Senate 100 to 0. There are two important changes. First, \nthe period for congressional review is extended from 45 to 60 days. \nSecond, the threshold for rules whose effectiveness is delayed during \nthe congressional review period is tied to the overall definition of a \nmajor rule.\n  The second goal of the bill is more honesty in the pronouncements of \nthe Federal Government. S. 343 would for the first time require Federal \nagencies, not only to tell us what they know, but also to tell us what \nthey do not know, when it comes to assessing risks. EPA would no longer \nbe able to hide the ball from the public in their analysis of \nregulations. From now on, Federal agencies will have to come clean on \nthe assumptions they make and the quality of the science they use in \nmaking regulatory decisions. This is a provision that ought to be \ncalled truth in regulating legislation. I expect and hope that as a \nresult of this legislation, many so-called risks that EPA tries to \nregulate will turn out--like the alar scare--to be based more on fear \nthan fact. After passage of this legislation, if sound science \nindicates that a significant risk needs to be addressed, then, of \ncourse, we must support sensible and cost-effective regulations. That \nis what this is all about, making sure that we get regulations focused \non the design to get rid of those risks.\n  This bill is also about a return to common sense in regulating. \nFederal agencies spend too much time focusing on the small risks and \nnot enough time on the big risks. This legislation would go a long way \ntoward fixing that. This bill directs agencies to set priorities with \nthe goal of achieving the greatest net reduction in risk with the \npublic and private sector resource expended, and to incorporate those \npriorities in the agency budget, regulatory agenda, and enforcement and \nresearch activities. As I mentioned last week, over the last several \nyears in the Appropriations Committee, the ranking member \n\n[[Page S 10114]]\non the HUD-VA Subcommittee, Senator Mikulski, and I, have been pushing \nagencies to use comparative risk assessments to prioritize their \nbudgets to focus on the biggest risks. The National Academy of Public \nAdministration recently released a report to the Committee on the EPA \nentitled ``Setting Priorities and Getting Results.'' One of its top \nrecommendations was to ``Use comparative risk analysis to inform the \nselection of priorities and the development of specific program \nstrategies.'' It only makes sense that agencies use their resources to \ntackle the worst problems facing the country. Sound like common sense, \nbut the sad fact is that is not what's happening today.\n  The bill includes an additional way to bring some common sense to \nregulatory decisions--cost-benefit analysis. The basic idea is a simple \none. We should spend more resources and effort on big problems and less \non small problems--that is cost-benefit analysis, that is what is so \nscary to the opponents of this bill. We say that in meeting the \nrequirements of existing laws, Government agencies should pick a \nregulatory solution with costs that are justified by the benefits. It \nseems astounding to me--and I think it would to most people in \nAmerica--that today Government regulators write rules for the rest of \nus without an established procedure to evaluate costs and benefits, but \nfrankly that is what is happening. And it is even more astounding that \nsome people have been using emotional appeals to generate irrational \nfears of this commonsense approach that all of us use in our everyday \nlives.\n  Finally, the bill repeals the Delaney clause, one of the worst \nexamples of regulation with no basis in sound sciences. Public health \nprotections are maintained with a replacement provision that allows \nregulation unless there is only a negligible or insignificant \nforeseeable risk to human health. American farmers will no longer be \nhamstrung from using safe and effective crop protection products simply \nbecause our technology lets us measure parts per trillion or parts per \nquadrillion.\n  We have had testimony before our committee from scientists, including \nthe President's own Science Advisory Board, saying the Delaney \namendment is no longer good science. The Delaney amendment cannot be \njustified in a time and day when we are able to measure the most minute \nparts, parts per trillion or even quadrillion. This is not sound \nscience they have told us. It is time to get the Delaney amendment off \nthe books.\n  Mr. President, the Dole/Johnston substitute will help small business \nthat are hamstrung by Government redtape. That is why it has the \noverwhelming support of the small business community, including the \nNational Federation of Independent Business, the Small Business \nLegislative Council, National Small Business United, and other small \nbusiness groups.\n  I would ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the \nend of my remarks, several letters of support for the bill from these \nsmall businesses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, small business is not alone in its support \nof this bill. The Dole/Johnston substitute will also help the farmer \nwho cannot use products that good science shows have no risk to health. \nSmall towns will have less to fear from arbitrary pronouncements from \nWashington. I have a letter from the National Association of Towns and \nTownships that has written me in particular support of the language in \nthe bill pertaining to the judicial review of the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act. You see, these towns know that for too long, \nGovernment agencies have ignored the impact of regulations on small and \nrural communities. They are counting on this legislation to force \nGovernment agencies to obey the law and minimize the impact of \nregulations on small communities.\n  The Dole/Johnston substitute will bring some much needed \naccountability to the faceless regulators sitting in their Washington \noffice buildings cranking out the stream of new rules. It will also \nbring accountability to Congress, where some of the blame lies for \nthose regulations. It brings sunshine and openness to the way the \nGovernment analyzes and talks about health risk, to give us a more \nhonest discussion of the problems facing us.\n  Finally, it brings some common sense to the decisions that the \nbureaucrats make. Just like every family in America who looks at the \ncosts and benefits of going on vacation or buying a smoke detector, \nGovernment regulators are going to have to take a hard look at the cost \nand benefits of their actions.\n  The claims made by some of the extremist pressure groups that this \nlegislation will harm the environment are simply false. By grounding \nour health and safety rules on sound science we can avoid wasting our \nmoney on phantom risks. By dealing with the worst problems first, and \nspending our resources wisely, this bill will help afford a safer and \ncleaner environment for us and our children.\n  In contrast, the Glenn/Chafee amendment ensures that we will continue \non our present course, the flood waters of regulations will rise ever \nhigher and more and more small and large businesses will drown in the \nflood. Make no mistake, a vote for this amendment is a vote against \nsmall business, a vote against common sense, and ultimately a vote \nagainst the environment--because unless we reform the way we do \nbusiness we will continue to waste our resources on trivial risks, and \nhave nothing left over for the very real health, safety, and \nenvironmental problems that call for commonsense solutions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS--1995 WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON SMALL BUSINESS  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Rank                           No./Issue                          Votes\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.....  224 Independent Contractors.............................    1471\n2.....  214 Meals & Entertainment Expense.......................    1444\n3.....  183 Regulatory Flexibility Act..........................    1398\n4.....  218 Estate Tax Repeal...................................    1385\n5.....  87 Health Care Reform...................................    1371\n        *63 Superfund Reform....................................   1371*\n7.....  91 Pension Reform.......................................    1369\n8.....  265 NII/Intellectual Property/SIC Code..................    1358\n9.....  51 Environmental Enforcement............................    1342\n10....  200 Tort Reform.........................................    1332\n11....  121 Association Export Programs.........................    1329\n12....  194 Agency Enforcement Reform...........................    1328\n13....  406 SBIR/Patient Capital................................    1292\n14....  144 Unfair Competition..................................    1285\n15....  78 100% Health Care Deduction...........................    1283\n16....  5 Pension Investments...................................    1279\n17....  9 Bank Lending Incentives...............................    1275\n18....  385 Tax Equity..........................................    1258\n19....  286 SBA Survival........................................    1249\n20....  34 Home Office Deduction................................    1239\n21....  129 Export/Import Bank Financing........................    1181\n22....  57 Regulatory Takings/Brown Fields......................    1118\n23....  115 Intellectual Property Protection....................    1080\n24....  242 Capital Gains.......................................    1054\n25....  164 Davis-Bacon/Service Contract Act....................    1046\n        188 Paperwork & Regulatory Reform.......................    1046\n27....  41 Entrepreneurial Education............................    1035\n28....  369 OSHA Reform.........................................    1030\n29....  24 SCOR.................................................    1027\n30....  14 Secondary Market for S.B.

Christopher Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: I am writing to support your efforts to \n     insure that the strongest possible judicial review language \n     is included in the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform bill. The \n     promise of regulatory reform will not be fulfilled if the \n     council of the self appointed guardians of bureaucratic \n     baloney is followed regarding amendments to ``reg flex''. \n     Many of those who have criticized the direction you are \n     headed with the Regulatory Flexibility Act and with your \n     reading of how it interacts with the Administrative \n     Procedures Act are only vaguely aware of the purposes or \n     processes of either law. I urge you to hold fast to the \n     course you have set--a course laid out in clear language by \n     the Regulatory Flexibility Act to fit regulations to the \n     ability of small entities to comply with them.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Michael O. Roush,\n\n                                  Director of Federal Governmental\n     Relations--Senate.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                           Small Business Legislative Council,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the Small Business \n     Legislative Council (SBLC), I wish to express our strong \n     support for the ``compromise version'' of regulatory relief \n     legislation. We believe it is an important step forward on \n     behalf of the small business community.\n       At the recent White House Conference for Small Business, \n     several of the top 10 recommendations included suggestions to \n     improve the regulatory process. We note that several of those \n     recommendations are addressed within the compromise version \n     of the regulatory relief legislation.\n       While the delegates to the conference did not rank the \n     proposals, the number three \n\n[[Page S 10115]]\n     vote-getter at the conference was a call to amend the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act to add judicial review. We note that the \n     compromise version of the regulatory relief legislation \n     includes strong language to provide the judicial review \n     necessary to ensure that agencies comply fully with the \n     Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n       The Small Business Legislative Council (SBLC) is a \n     permanent, independent coalition of nearly one hundred trade \n     and professional associations that share a common commitment \n     to the future of small business. Our members represent the \n     interests of small businesses in such diverse economic \n     sectors as manufacturing, retailing, distribution, \n     professional and technical services, construction, \n     transportation, tourism, and agriculture. For your \n     information, a list of our members is enclosed.\n       We at the Small Business Legislative Council look forward \n     to working with you to see this legislation passed and \n     ultimately enacted into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John S.

     National Small Business United\n\n                                   Washington, DC., June 28, 1995.\n     Senator Christopher Bond,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: National Small Business United is \n     extremely pleased with your efforts to pass into law S.B. \n     343. Ever since the original passage of the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act, small businesses have expected the federal \n     government to offer more flexibility when imposing federal \n     regulations on small businesses. Unfortunately, agencies have \n     not been held accountable to this act. It did not provide for \n     judicial review which is so essential to its implementation.\n       The language which you have submitted to this bill will be \n     most beneficial to small businesses across the United States. \n     It is high time that Congress and the President act to \n     provide small businesses with the opportunity to hold our \n     federal government accountable for the regulations they \n     impose on small business. Your leadership on this issue is \n     most helpful and NSBU is grateful for your efforts.\n       Having just participated in the 1995 White House Conference \n     on Small Business, I am aware that this issue was number \n     three (3) on the final list of recommendations to the \n     President and to Congress. Small business owners who were \n     delegates to that conference want real reform. Your language \n     will deliver a pragmatic response to their recommendation.\n       Now is not a time to compromise on this issue. It is too \n     important to job creation and the growth of the small \n     business community.\n       Thank you for your leadership. NSBU will do all it can to \n     support your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 John Paul Galles,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                  National Roofing\n\n\n                                      Contractors Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 5, 1995.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bond: The National Roofing Contractors \n     Association (NRCA) applauds your excellent language providing \n     judicial review for the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 \n     (Reg Flex) in the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of \n     1995, S. 343.\n       NRCA is an association of roofing, roof deck and \n     waterproofing contractors. Founded in 1886, it is one of the \n     oldest associations in the construction industry and has over \n     3,500 members represented in all 50 states. NRCA contractors \n     are small, privately held companies, and our average member \n     employs 35 people with annual sales of $3 million.\n       Reg Flex requires that federal agencies analyze the impact \n     their regulations would have on small business before they go \n     into effect and minimize that impact. But with no judicial \n     review, agencies disregard it. If an agency head certifies \n     that a regulation will have no significant economic impact on \n     small business, the agency can ignore Reg Flex.\n       For example, OSHA's new Fall Protection Standard, Subpart \n     M, requires all persons working above six feet to have either \n     a safety harness on, safety nets, or scaffolding with a \n     walkway and a guardrail. We estimate its impact to be at \n     least $250 million annually; OSHA's estimate is $40 million \n     annually, and the agency goes on to state that the standard \n     will not have a significant impact upon a substantial number \n     of small entities.\n       Your judicial review language for Reg Flex would put a stop \n     to this kind of agency non-compliance, and NRCA would oppose \n     any effort to weaken it.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Craig S. Brightup,\n\n                                                       Director of\n                                             Government Relations.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have not had an opportunity yet to speak on the \nbills before us, most specifically S. 343. For many days now I have \nlistened as the Senate has been debating what are two \n\n[[Page S 10116]]\nmajor regulatory reform bills. They are complex and detailed and some \nhave said boring. But one way or another they will touch the life of \nvirtually every American citizen.\n  The fact is that regulations serve an important purpose in our \nsociety. But as with all laws, they have to be balanced against other \ncompeting needs, and reexamined from time to time in order to remain \neffective.\n  I happen to be a great fan of the Senator from Louisiana. I believe \nhe is a sound thinker. He is an effective leader, and he has played a \nmajor role in the debate on these issues. I respect him. I also respect \nthe majority leader, whose bill this is, as a seasoned, experienced \nSenator who understands the impact of regulations upon the community \nregulated.\n  As we address the issue of regulatory reform, I think certain \nconsiderations should guide us in the process.\n  First and foremost, public health and safety must be the paramount \nconcern. And we have heard that concern voiced over and over in the \ndebate over breast cancer, over E. coli, and over a myriad of other \nregulatory programs.\n  Second, Government regulations should not strangle business and \ncommerce but should seek to encourage economic growth as much as \npossible. That is often easier said than done, particularly in the \nlargest State in the Union where problems are severe and often \nbusinesses will seek to choose an easier way and leave the State.\n  But the bottom line is: regulations have to make sense. Finding the \nright balance will be the determining factor as to whether we are \nsuccessful in this effort.\n  California has a huge stake in this bill both from a public safety \nperspective and an economic perspective.\n  We have the biggest air pollution problem in the Nation. Children \ntoday, born in the Los Angeles basin, suffer from a 10 to 15 percent \ndecrease in lung function compared with children in other areas as a \nresult of air quality.\n  California has 96 Superfund sites, the second largest number in the \ncountry--that is almost two major toxic waste dumps for every county in \nour State. In 1990, I had occasion to visit one of them. It is a place \ncalled Iron Mountain mine, near Redding, that had been owned by a \nchemical company and had been mined for various minerals. There were \nholes in this mountain, some the size of 30-story office buildings. \nWhen it rained, water interspersed with the chemicals producing \nsulfuric acid which then drained out onto the banks of the Trinity \nRiver actually metallizing some of the banks. This Superfund site is \nnow in the process of being cleaned up. So I am very pleased that the \nportion of the legislation impacting Superfund sites has been removed \nfrom the bill.\n  Santa Monica Bay, one of the most beautiful areas in the country and \na premier tourist attraction in my State, has been contaminated with \nheavy metals and DDT to such an extent that the public is often warned \nnot to eat fish caught there. I remember when I first went to live in \nLos Angeles, I went into a restaurant and ordered sand dabs and the \nwaiter said, ``Don't order sand dabs; they are bottom-feeding fish and \nthey are caught in the Santa Monica Bay, and the bay is polluted.''\n  Economically, California's unemployment rate, though beginning to \nimprove, is still two percentage points above the national average. We \nare still struggling to climb out of the recession and cope with \ncontinued defense downsizing.\n  So the last thing California businesses need is unnecessary or \ncumbersome regulations that drive up costs and drive out jobs.\n  So I have listened with great care to this debate, and I have had the \nprivilege of discussing certain of my concerns with the Senator from \nLouisiana. But the bottom line and the one that I have reached is that \nthe Glenn-Chafee bill contains the best and most balanced approach to \nregulatory reform.\n  I would like to address what I believe are the primary weaknesses in \nthe Dole-Johnston legislation.\n  In the area of cost-benefit, I believe the Dole-Johnston legislation, \nin a sense, throws the baby out with the bathwater. Cost-benefit \nanalyses are supposed to weigh cost and benefit and then allow for the \nbest alternative to be chosen.\n  The Dole-Johnston bill does not do that--it simply requires choosing \nthe least-cost alternative. That does not always make sense, and it \ncould have unfortunate results.\n  Let me give you some examples.\n  Seatbelts in the front seat. If the standards in the Dole-Johnston \nbill were applied to seatbelts, I am told by the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration that they would probably not be able to \nrequire both lap and shoulder belts in cars.\n  That is because, even though having both lap and shoulder belts save \nlives, the lap belt alone is the least-cost alternative.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield at that point?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Senator is going to have a number of points to \nrespond to. He might want to listen to them all first. If I could \nfinish, I would appreciate it.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Sure.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Seatbelts in the back seat. They would also not be able to require \nseatbelts in the back seat.\n  Because 90 percent of those killed in automobiles are people in the \nfront seat, rear-seat fatalities are not likely to meet the statistical \nthreshold that would allow the agency to require seatbelts in the back. \nMy source for this information is the Department of Transportation's \ngeneral counsel's office.\n  Airbags. If airbags were not already required by law, which they are, \nit is unclear under Dole-Johnston whether airbags could be required.\n  Again, this is because airbags, even though they are much safer, are \nalso more costly than manual seatbelts or lap and shoulder belts. And \nagain, the least cost alternative would have to be chosen.\n  Airline flight data recorders. This is the black box that we all read \nabout when a plane goes down. If the standards of the Dole-Johnston \nbill were applied to airline flight data recorders, the FAA tells me \nthat it might not be able to require flight data recorders on airlines.\n  This is because flight data recorders do not necessarily reduce \nimmediate risks. Instead, they provide valuable information which can \ngreatly enhance airline safety in the future.\n  The Glenn-Chafee bill, I believe, is far preferable. Unlike the Dole-\nJohnston bill, the Glenn-Chafee bill requires a rigorous cost-benefit \nanalysis and permits both costs and benefits to be weighed \nintelligently, with public health and safety given its full and proper \nweight in the equation.\n  Now let me talk about petitions. The Dole-Johnston bill's petition \nprocess would allow special interests to challenge new rules and reopen \nexisting rules, giving them unprecedented power to jam up the process.\n  By some estimates, the Dole-Johnston bill would allow 80 to 100 new \nreasons for challenging an agency rule. My source is attorneys who deal \nwith these matters. With 80 to 100 new reasons for challenging an \nagency rule, agencies will be forced to divert their resources--their \ntime, their staff, their dollars--to respond to these petitions.\n  Dole-Johnston would open the door to hundreds of additional lawsuits, \nincreasing the volume and complexity of Federal litigation--some want \nthat--and further clogging the court system.\n  This is one of the main reasons why the Justice Department strongly \nopposes this bill.\n  Let me give an example of some possible results.\n  Commuter airline safety. In recent months, there have been three \ncrashes of commuter airlines in which a total of 40 people have been \nkilled. Following a fatal commuter airline accident in December 1994, \nthe Secretary of Transportation proposed new commuter airline safety \nregulations.\n  More and more people are flying commuter airlines. Having completed \ntheir own cost-benefit and risk-analysis assessment, the FAA is close \nto finalizing these new, urgently needed safety standards.\n  Again, the general counsel of the Department of Transportation \ninforms us that they will be faced with a Hobson's choice. Let me give \nyou an example. They are nearly ready to finalize. The language in \nDole-Johnston would derail these efforts and force the FAA to either \nstart over in order to comply with the specific least-cost and risk-\nassessment criteria in S. 343, or proceed \n\n[[Page S 10117]]\nwith the new regulations, knowing they will likely be challenged and \nheld up in court for years.\n  So, in other words, the FAA would be challenged that they do not meet \nthe specific new cost-benefit requirements or they could delay and redo \nthe cost-benefit and the risk assessment. But if they move ahead, as \nunder the present legislation, as they are prepared to do, they run \nthis jeopardy.\n  Let me talk for a moment about an automatic sunset. My understanding \nof the legislation is that once a petition is accepted, the agency has \na 3-year review period to review the rule. If an agency is unable to \ncomplete this review, a sunset of the rule would result. So the \narbitrary deadline of 3 years is a trigger for sunsetting some of these \nregulations.\n  This could result in an automatic sunset of important health and \nsafety rules. Let me give you some examples.\n  Automobile fuel efficiency standards.\n  Food labeling regulations--which have served to educate consumers.\n  Does every Member in this body remember food labeling regulations \nwere very much contested by the industries affected, but they are now \npart of every product? People respect them, use them, and I think they \nare effective.\n  Regulations to ensure the safety of children's toys, cribs, bed \nclothing.\n  The Glenn-Chafee bill, on the other hand, accomplishes regulatory \nreview of existing rules without creating regulatory gridlock. It \nrequires agencies to review existing rules every 10 years, without \nallowing special interests to dictate the workload of Federal agencies \nwhose mission is to protect public health and safety.\n  One of the major criticisms of the Dole-Johnston bill is that it is \ntoo ambiguous. Let me tell you what I mean by this.\n  Let us take the issue of the supermandate.\n  From the language of Dole-Johnston and a recent amendment, it is \nstill unclear what will happen when the bill's requirements conflict \nwith requirements in existing statutes.\n  Although the new amendment states that Dole-Johnston's requirements \nshould not override existing statutory requirements, which will be \ngiven more weight? What legally does the word ``override'' actually \nmean?\n  Would the least-cost requirement trump the health-based standards of \nthe Clean Air Act?\n  What is the impact on annual farm programs? Because the Department of \nAgriculture currently uses greatest-net-benefit criteria and not the \nleast-cost alternative required under Dole-Johnston, it throws open the \nquestion of who can participate, what the terms of participation are, \nand what the costs will be.\n  The Dole-Johnston bill leaves these questions up to the courts.\n  Let us take the issue of judicial review.\n  According to the Justice Department, eight different sections of the \nbill provide separate statutory grounds for judicial review. The \nJustice Department in its letter to Senator Dole lists the sections. \nEven the Justice Department is unsure about how these provisions would \nrelate to each other.\n  Moreover, the ambiguous language could mean that the courts will be \ncalled upon to evaluate scientific and technical steps in cost-benefit \nanalyses and risk assessments, issues outside of the realm of expertise \nof judges.\n  Let us take the issue of emergeney exemptions.\n  Another problem with ambiguity in Dole-Johnston is its definition of \nan emergency.\n  For example, the bill refers to actions to protect public health and \nsafety or natural resources, but the Department of Agriculture has \nraised with us questions about how Dole-Johnston would affect an \nemergency such as infestation of the Mediterranean fruit fly.\n  Let me explain why. The Department of Agriculture believes the \nemergency provisions are sufficiently ambiguous and relate to health \nand safety, not to economic emergency.\n  Now, the Medfly in California is a major problem. Parts of the State \nhave been quarantined because of the Medfly. But it is really an \neconomic emergency because the farmers lose their entire crop when a \nMedfly is found. And emergency actions periodically have to be taken, \nsuch as tree stripping, aerial spraying, and so on. It is unclear under \nDole-Johnston whether the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service \ncould act quickly enough to take the necessary steps to protect the \neconomic interests of agriculture from pest infestations.\n  The inability to act quickly could cost agriculture millions of \ndollars in destruction of crops and loss of export markets.\n  Let me conclude.\n  I support regulatory reform that solves problems that have been \nidentified in the regulatory system, not one that creates more \nproblems.\n  I support reform that puts public health and safety first.\n  And I support reform that makes the Federal Government more efficient \nand effective.\n  I do not believe the Dole-Johnston bill meets that test. I do not \nbelieve it is really regulatory reform. It does not simplify the \nprocess. Instead, I believe it will burden the agencies so that they \ncannot do their job. And as the Justice Department has warned, it will \nburden the courts significantly. I simply cannot support it.\n  Many regulations are essential to protect public health, safety, and \nthe environment.\n  I remember when we had the worst air in Los Angeles. I lived in \nsouthern California for 5 years, and I remember when I went outside, my \neyes burned and teared. The air quality is better now, and that is \nbecause of clean air regulations. They have been hard on hundreds of \nbusinesses, no question about it. But you have to consider, what is the \ncost of 15 to 20 percent of youngsters born in the Los Angeles Basin \nhaving reduced lung capacity and, therefore, a shortened span of life. \nHow do you measure that cost?\n  The San Francisco Bay area is now the largest metropolitan area of \nthe country that complies with the clean air standards. In the early \n1970's, I served on the air board. Even major oil companies have told \nme that the air regulations have worked.\n  Nobody should think that Glenn-Chafee is a copout, a soft bill, or \nthat it will not do the job. The Glenn-Chafee bill is a very tough \nbill.\n  It represents real regulatory reform, without unjustifiably burdening \nthe agencies or clogging the court system.\n  The Glenn-Chafee bill requires cost-benefit analysis for all major \nrules, just where we should be. It requires risk assessments for all \nmajor rules related to environment, health, and safety, just where we \nshould be.\n  It requires peer review of cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessments, just where we should be.\n  It accounts for the special needs of small businesses, allowing small \nentities to petition for judicial review of compliance with the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act.\n  It requires public disclosure and openness in the regulatory process.\n  And it limits judicial review to determine: First, whether a rule is \nmajor; and, second, whether a final rule is arbitrary or capricious.\n  Most importantly, the Glenn-Chafee bill cuts redtape while retaining \nthe role of Government in protecting public health, safety, and the \nenvironment.\n  I believe the Glenn-Chafee substitute is a good bill, and I intend to \nsupport it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia has raised eight different points. There is a full, \ncomplete, definitive and, I believe, unassailable answer to each of \nthese. If the Senator will allow me, I will tell her why in each of \nthese instances, the information she has been given is dead, flat \nwrong.\n  You know, Mr. President, there is a saying that ``There is none that \nis so blind as he who will not see.'' I think we have, on behalf of \nsome of these agencies that have been advising my friend from \nCalifornia, a terminal blindness.\n  Let us start with No. 1. We are told again that the Dole-Johnston \nbill requires the least-cost alternative. Mr. President, here is the \nlanguage.\n\n       Least cost alternative, or if scientific, technical, or \n     economic uncertainties, or nonquantifiable benefits to \n     health, safety, or the environment identified by the agency \n     in the rulemaking record make a more costly alternative * * * \n     appropriate or in the public interest * * * they can do so.\n\n  Mr. President, what could fit more perfectly into these kinds of \nbenefits \n\n[[Page S 10118]]\nthan shoulder belts, back-seat seatbelts, and airbags? As my friend \nfrom California says, an airbag is ``much safer but more costly.''\n  Now, I ask my friend, what is ambiguous about that? It is just as \nplain as the nose on your face. If it is good for safety, even though \nit is not quantifiable--because the value of a human life is, by its \nnature, nonquantifiable--you can do it.\n  Black boxes on airplanes. Mr. President, the same thing.\n  Now, how do my colleagues continue to say that this language requires \nthe least-cost alternative?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Since the Senator asked and my colleagues continue to ask \nthat question, let me try to answer that question: It is because we \nhave repeatedly, over and over again, said that if the benefits to \nhealth and safety or the environment are quantifiable, your exception \ndoes not apply.\n  Now, what sense does it make to say that if the benefits to health, \nsafety, and the environment can be quantified, that then we have to go \nwith least cost, even though a slight additional cost would give much \ngreater benefits?\n  Now, I have never understood why the Senator from Louisiana insists \non the word ``nonquantifiable benefits.'' We have gone over and over \nthat issue.\n  That is the answer to the question.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. It is because, Mr. President, the definitions in \nsection 621 state clearly that the term ``benefit'' means the \nreasonably identifiable significant, favorable effects, quantifiable \nand nonquantifiable.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Except that is limited by the Senator's language in \nsubsection (b). When it comes to the least costly alternative, the \nSenator does not say ``benefit'' which is, in fact, defined somewhere \nelse. It is limited to nonquantifiable benefit.\n  That is a question which has been raised for the last week, and for \nthe life of me, I do not understand why the word ``benefit\" means \nquantifiable or nonquantifiable for the purposes of the act generally, \nbut when it comes to the least-cost requirement, it is only the \nnonquantifiable benefits which are going to be an exception. That is \nthe answer to the Senator's question.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, let me ask my friend from Michigan, it \nis right there in the definition of section 621. If we took that word \n``nonquantifiable'' out, would the Senator then agree with me that it \ndoes not require least cost, that this discretion is there? Or is this \njust another one of the ghosts, once we get out of here there are more \nghosts to be found?\n  Will this solve the provision?\n  Mr. LEVIN. It solves one of three decisional criteria raised by my \ngood friend from Louisiana. It addresses one of the remaining \ndecisional criteria issues. These have been described, I think, in \nfairness. I think my friend would say that we have set forth in a \ndocument the difficulties with the definition ``decisional criteria,'' \nand this is one, I believe, if my memory is correct, one of three which \nhave been very precisely specified. I think it does address the one \nspecific one of the three we have raised.\n  For instance, another exception, if my friend----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President I want to keep this discussion to a \nquestion, and not a speech.\n  Again, the question is, what is the value of a human life? It is, in \nmy view, very clearly by nature nonquantifiable. That is the reason for \nputting in the language.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Would the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The point I was trying to make is the back seat \nseatbelts are quantifiable. Therefore, it would not apply.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. This is for health, for life.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. But it is quantified in that only 10 percent of the \npeople die in the back seat. The problem is in the front seat.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. There are thousands of people who die in automobile \naccidents and many whose death could be prevented by back seat \nseatbelts. That is a nonquantifiable value.\n  We do not have to get least cost. The very idea that we say we have a \nrule that would save a lot of lives, that we have to go to the least \ncost which is front seat instead of back seat, I submit to my friend, \nis patently absurd.\n  Mr. BOND. Will the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BOND. I wonder if the Senator is aware that Prof. John Graham, of \nthe Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, who is an expert on risk \nassessment, started off his analysis by finding that a regulation \nrequiring airbags, for example, was precisely the kind of regulation \nthat was worth the cost, and that Professor Graham is currently or has \njust concluded a session with the media next door to the Chamber, \npointing out that the Dole-Johnston bill precisely does meet the \ncriteria which he developed in the Harvard Center for Risk Assessment \nas developed for determining what are reasonable regulations and, in \nfact, has stated that the Dole-Johnston substitute does permit the kind \nof analysis which would lead to the kind of life-saving regulations \nsuch as the requirement for airbags.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. It is absolutely true. Professor Graham has testified \nbefore our committee. Of course it allows for that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Briefly.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator raises a question. If there are 823 lives \nsaved, according to a cost-benefit analysis, for the cost of $1 \nmillion, is that quantified or not quantified?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Generally for the life, for the 20th or 30th time, the \nvalue of the life is not quantifiable by its nature.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The definition in the bill says that ``if the \nnonquantifiable benefits to health, safety, or the environment \nidentified by the agency,'' et cetera.\n  The number of lives in my hypothetical is very, very precise and is \nquantified. Now, since the agencies are likely to read that cost-\nbenefit analysis and they have said that the number of lives saved is \nquantified in my hypothetical, therefore, it would not be eligible for \nthis exception. Again, for the life of me, I do not understand why the \nSenator from Louisiana in his bill insists on the word \n``nonquantifiable benefit'' when the word ``benefits'' as defined \ngenerally, is both quantifiable and nonquantifiable, and where if, in \nfact, benefits are quantified, it would seem to me it would be \nessential we allow the same exemption as when they are nonquantified.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I have given the answer to that \nquestion. I will give it again.\n  It is because the definition of section 621 includes both \nquantifiable and nonquantifiable and because life is, by its very \nnature, not quantifiable in value, although we may count up the number \nof lives.\n  Point No. 2, my friend from California says the petition process \nwould open up 80 to 100 new reasons why attorneys could challenge \nrules.\n  Not so, Mr. President. There is one single standard, which is that \nyou must show a substantial likelihood that the existing rule does not \nmeet the standards of this bill, which means that the benefits do not \njustify the cost. It is one standard. You have one chance to do it in \nthe 180-day period. It is just as clear as it can be. I do not know \nwhere the 80 to 100 new reasons--I suspect that there are some lawyers \nwho were told that they are against this bill, and go make up reasons, \nand they did not do a very good job of making them up.\n  Point No. 3--I hope my friend from California is listening--commuter \nairlines, 40 people killed, they are ready to finalize the order, and \nthey would have to start over.\n  Now, Mr. President, last week we put in an amendment specifically to \ndeal with this question. If the notice of proposed ruling making was \nout by April 1, they are not covered by these requirements--not covered \nby these requirements. We had a long debate, and we accepted the \namendment.\n  Now, Mr. President, these commuter airline proposals were out long, \nlong before April 1. Now, does my friend from California understand \nthat? Did someone say that amendment does not cover this?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If the Senator was asking me a question, let me \nanswer it with this question back to the Senator.\n  Are they still subject to the petition process?\n  \n[[Page S 10119]]\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. They are subject to a petition process, but that does \nnot--the Senator said that they are ready to finalize, and they have to \nstart over again, the rule would go into effect.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. But they would have to face the challenge, because \nthe cost-benefit risk assessment that they were doing is different from \nthe one that would be required.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No, they do not have to do a cost-benefit or a risk \nassessment if their notice of proposed rulemaking was out before April \n1. It is just as clear as it can be.\n  Let me finish answering these questions from the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  My friend from California says there is an automatic sunset. If she \nwould look at the section on page 33, that is section 623, it provides \nthat, if a rule is likely to terminate and the agency needs additional \ntime, and terminating the rule is not in the public interest, and the \nagency has not expeditiously completed its review, you not only can get \nup to an additional 2 years, but you can get a court order to tell them \nto complete the rule or to do other needful things.\n  I do not know where this automatic sunset comes from. It is not an \nautomatic sunset. It is just not. And the words are clear.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n  Mr. GLENN. But if the time came for the rule to expire? Let us say we \nare reviewing the rule, the existing rule, and the time came and went \npast for the review of that rule. It could sunset at that point unless \nyou asked for this extension.\n  Then, if you ask for the extension, let us say it was granted; let us \nsay it was extended. Then, when you run out of that time period, it \nwould in fact sunset.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If everybody wants the rule to sunset it can sunset. \nYou can terminate a rule today.\n  Mr. GLENN. Here is what we do on Glenn-Chafee. We say at the end of \nthat time period the agency has to either approve the rule or start the \nrulemaking process to repeal it. And that lets all public comment come \nin, which is a much fairer process than just running out a couple of \nextensions and guillotining the whole thing.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. There is virtually no difference between this 2-year \nextension provision of the Dole-Johnston amendment and in the Glenn-\nChafee substitute.\n  Mr. GLENN. No, I disagree with that.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. You provide for the court to use section 706 of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act in order to give the needful review. We \nprovide that the court of appeals grant such equitable relief as is \nappropriate. If anything, ours is broader than yours.\n  The point is, it is not an automatic sunset. It is just not. It may \nsunset, that is if everybody wants it to sunset. But if anybody cares, \nthey can petition the court.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I just read the section on its face? Will the \nSenator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Termination of the rules, page 34:\n\n       If the head of an agency has not completed the review of a \n     rule by the deadline established in the schedule published or \n     modified pursuant to subsection (b) and (c), the head of the \n     agency shall not enforce the rule and the rule shall \n     terminate by operation of law as of such date.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. But now if the Senator will look over on the previous \npage, subsection (3),\n\n       An interested party may petition the U.S. Court of Appeals \n     for the District of Columbia to extend the period for review \n     of a rule on the schedule for up to 2 years, and to grant \n     such equitable relief as is appropriate.\n\n  To be sure, if nobody cares, if the agency head wants the rule to \nterminate and the whole world wants it to terminate and nobody cares, \nnobody files a petition--yes. But that is a whole lot different from \nsaying that this thing automatically sunsets.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield on that point? Is the Senator \nthen willing to amend his bill to say if anybody petitions a court at \nany time opposing sunset, that then it will not sunset? Just the act of \npetitioning a court? Because the Senator said ``if nobody cares.''\n  It seems to me that is quite, quite different from what is in the \nbill, which says: Sure, if you go to a court and get an order that says \nit does not sunset it will not sunset.\n  But that is not the obvious meaning of the word sunset.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. It is quite clear. It is a low barrier. You have to \nshow the rule is likely to terminate, the agency needs additional time, \nthat terminating the rule would not be in the public interest, and that \nthe agency has not expeditiously completed its review.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is for the extension. I am not referring to the \nextension. I am talking about after the 2 years runs out, if a court \nhas not ordered that rule to continue it expires.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Right.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The court has had a chance to review this and has given \nsuch orders as are necessary, which might be--I guess what the court \nwould order is a schedule. Public comments to be completed by such and \nsuch a time. Final rule by such and such a time. They have full and \ncomplete discretion.\n  There may be some rules that, upon review by the court, should \nterminate. But it is not automatic. You have a chance to go to court to \nget that rule extended.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I think I have answered that. Let me move on.\n  Mr. LEVIN. This is a different question. Can the court extend the \nperiod for review beyond 2 years?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No. They have already had--first of all, they have had \n1 year after the expiration--I mean after the effective date of the \nact. They have had 3 years minimum initially, plus they have had these \n2 years--that is 6 years. They cannot extend it beyond 6 years. But \nthey can make such orders to continue the rule as is necessary.\n  Now, my friend from California says the supermandate language is \nambiguous. For the life of me, Mr. President, the supermandate language \nwe said was unnecessary in the first place because the bill is clear \nand I believe it is. But at the behest of all the people who said we \nhave to have supermandate language, we adopted the language using their \nword. ``Override'' was not our word, it was the word of others.\n  It says, now, ``nothing in this section shall be construed to \noverride any statutory requirements including health, safety and \nenvironmental requirements.''\n  For the life of me I do not know what you do to please the opponents \nof this provision. We first accept the principle and put it in the \nbill, and it is clear. But, oh, no, they find an ambiguity.\n  We come back and put in the precise language, the override language \nthat they want, and it is still not good enough.\n  Mr. President, what can we do to satisfy the opponents of this bill? \nIf that language is not good enough--tell me what is. It is incredible.\n  Judicial review language, Mr. President--my friend from California \nsays that you ought to have review of the final agency action to \ndetermine whether it is arbitrary and capricious and that is the only \npurpose for which risk assessment and cost-benefit can be considered.\n  I invite my friend from California to look at the language. That is \nexactly--exactly what it says. If you can find an ambiguity in these \nwords we will change them, because there is no ambiguity in those \nwords.\n  There is a lot of ambiguity in the Glenn substitute and I can show \nyou exactly where that ambiguity is. But there is no ambiguity in that. \nIt adopts exactly and precisely what the Senator says. Those studies \ncan be used solely--``solely for the purpose of determining whether the \nfinal agency action is arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of \ndiscretion.''\n  Where is the ambiguity in that language? I am at a loss to \nunderstand.\n  I can show the Senator where the ambiguity in the Glenn-Chafee \nlanguage is, but there is clearly not any here.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator will yield on that question?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I will.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Because the Justice Department has set forth the ambiguity \nin the words ``failure to comply.''\n  The question is whether or not those words refer to the procedural \nirregularities which could occur in the cost-benefit analysis or in the \nrisk assessment. \n\n[[Page S 10120]]\n\n  Their letter dated July 11, 1995, is a pretty serious source, the \nJustice Department. They say on page 2 in a letter to Senator Dole that \nthere remain two basic problems which create the potential for \nlitigation under section 625.\n\n       First, section 625 provides that failure to comply--they \n     underline the words ``with the.'' They now substitute the \n     words ``the rules pertaining to cost-benefit and risk \n     analysis.''\n\n  If, in fact, that is not what the Senator's language----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. ``Failure to comply with the rules pertaining to the cost-\nbenefit and risk analysis.'' Again, they insert as to what they believe \nyou are intending, that failure may be considered by the court solely \nfor the purpose of determining whether the final agency action is \narbitrary or capricious or an abuse of discretion.\n\n       When this section is read in conjunction with the \n     extraordinarily detailed and proscriptive requirements for \n     risk assessment and cost-benefit analyses contained elsewhere \n     in the bill, it is clear that the alleged failure to comply \n     with any of those requirements will be the subject of \n     litigation. Petitioners will surely argue that failure to \n     comply with the extensive procedural requirements is itself \n     arbitrary and capricious.\n\n  That is the Justice Department. That is a pretty solid source of a \nquestion. Since the Senator asked, ``Where is the question?'' There it \nis.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. They do not say why it is. I must say that this letter \nfrom the Justice Department gives me real pause to consider what the \nquality of our people in the Justice Department is because there is no \nambiguity here. They simply say it. They make an unsupported statement \nand anybody can say anything. But you cannot read out this the word \n``solely.'' They just read it out. They go on to say--you will notice \nthat the letters says not that ``solely'' is not there but that it will \nbe the subject of litigation.\n  It is like when I used to practice law, Mr. President. Somebody would \ncome in and say, ``Can I sue somebody about such and such?'' And I \nwould say, ``Sure. You can sue. But the courts are not going to grant \nthe subject of your suit.'' You know, you can summons up the witches \nfrom the briny deep. But will they come? No. They will not come. They \nwill not. Alleging something that is clear in the four corners of the \nstatute does not mean it has any substance. If they are going to sue on \nthat, let me tell you. They are going to sue on Glenn-Chafee because \nGlenn-Chafee is ambiguous.\n  Let me finish these two other points, and then I want to ask a \nquestion.\n  Mr. LEVIN. May I ask a narrow question of my friend?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Let me return to this in just a moment. I will engage \nyou when I finish these two other things.\n  My friend from California says that the emergency regulations here \nare not clear, that they are ambiguous. The first time I heard that \nraised--honestly, to say that you cannot deal with the medfly, that \nsomehow that escapes health, safety, or the environment, Mr. President, \nif medfly is not included in the environment, I do not know what is; or \nunder health. I mean we are talking about something that could destroy \nall the fruit in California. And that does not have anything to do with \nhealth? Who are these people over in the Agriculture Department telling \nyou that fruit does not have anything to do with health? I mean what \nkind of contorted, convoluted logic, to say that fruit does not have \nanything to do with health? I mean it is clear, Mr. President. I mean \nthese people who oppose risk assessment are looking for ghosts, and \nfinding them everywhere. And you find one ghost, you say what does it \ntake to fix that ghost? You are given the language they want, and they \ncome back and say, ``Ah ha. But that language is ambiguous.'' The \nsupermandate language which was unnecessary in the first place which \nsaid for a second time in words that the opponents suggested and know \nit is somehow ambiguous, I mean this is a no-win situation. We have to \nface the fact that some people are opposed to risk assessment.\n  Now my friend from Michigan finds ambiguity in this. I now have the \nGlenn-Chafee language here. I would like to ask him how this last \nlanguage differs from our language when our language says that you may \nconsider final agency action to determine whether it is arbitrary and \ncapricious. You did, by the way, have in the Record the risk analysis \nand cost-benefit, did you not? Is that required?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. All right. How does this differ from what we have said?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think the difference is in the preceding language. The \ndifference is in the preceding language in Glenn-Chafee which, if an \nanalysis assessment had been performed, the courts shall review to \ndetermine whether the analysis or assessment conformed to the \n``particular requirements.'' I am wondering whether or not my friend \nfrom Louisiana might be willing to add that same language into his \nbill.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. In the first place, I think it is ambiguous. What are \n``particular requirements''? That to me means a de minimis test. Words \nare supposed to mean something. It means something different than \n``conformed to the requirements of this chapter.''\n  So when it says ``particular requirements,'' I would assume that \nmeans that you need not deal with the technical----\n  Mr. LEVIN. ``Specific.''\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. ``Individual,'' but you look at the requirements of the \nchapter.\n  Would not that be fair?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Look at the ``specific requirements.'' But my question is \nsince that is a narrowing language that is intended--I do not believe \nmy friend from Louisiana has too much objection to it--assuming that \none little issue can be addressed, does the Senator from Louisiana have \na problem with adding that narrowing language to his bill?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I think it does not narrow.\n  These two proposals, I believe--you have to read them In pari \nmateria. What I get from this last sentence is that this is a review. \nYou have ``judicial review of the agency action.''\n  I submit to you that review is under section 706 of the \nAdministrative Procedures Act. If it is not, tell me under what \nstandard it is reviewed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think that is correct.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I believe that is correct.\n  Under that section, the courts have adopted the following standard, \nthat the procedural errors ``were so serious and related to matters of \nsuch central relevance to the rule that there is a substantial \nlikelihood that the rule would have been significantly changed if such \nerrors had not been made.''\n  So that has been the interpretation under 706 by the courts, that the \nprocedural errors ``were so serious and related to matters of such \ncentral relevance to the rule that there is a substantial likelihood \nthat the rule would have been significantly changed if such errors had \nnot been made.''\n  That interpretation is a narrowing interpretation where the new \nlanguage----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. There may be a court interpretation of that. But you \nhave under your amendment a review of subsection (d), ``without \nobservance of the procedure required by law.'' According to what you \nhave said, you are going to review the procedure because that is what \nsubsection (d) says. We do limit under our amendment. Our amendment is \nlimited specifically to whether the final agency action is ``arbitrary \nand capricious.'' That is much narrower than that which you state. It \nis at least ambiguous.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am wondering, relevant to the answer that I gave the \nSenator, whether or not the Senator is willing to incorporate that \nnarrowing language?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No. I say the answer is no for the third time. And the \nreason is that it is not narrowing. It is expanding, and it is \nambiguous.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am referring here though now to the interpretation of \nsection 706. You see, that has been interpreted. It has been \ninterpreted as I just read. The language of the Senator from Louisiana \nhas not so been interpreted yet, and is open to a much more expansive \ninterpretation.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Look. That is precisely the same. That is an additional \ninterpretation. ``Arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion.'' That \nis the standard that we bring forward. We leave out ``otherwise not in \naccordance with law'' because we wanted to leave out the procedural \nreview. \n\n[[Page S 10121]]\n\n  That is one of the most litigated and judicially interpreted phrases \nin all of the annals of judicial review. And it is the same precise and \nexact standard which you claim is provided in your review.\n  You see the only difference between yours and ours, we both use \n``arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion.'' But you have \n``observance of procedure required by law.'' But you claim that either \nthat is meaningless or that your language takes it away. So I say it \nadds nothing to it other than ambiguous.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The difference though again is that the Senator's bill has \nnew language which has not interpreted failure to comply whereas the \nlanguage, as the Senator points to in our bill, has been interpreted in \na way which is significantly narrower than--may I say--what the Justice \nDepartment feels is likely or could be interpreted into the words \n``failure to comply.''\n  That is the difference, that there is a new test, failure to comply, \nin the Senator's language and has not been made the subject of the kind \nof review under the Administrative Procedures Act.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. We say, ``Failure to comply may be used solely for the \npurpose of determining whether that is arbitrary and capricious,'' and \nthat differs not at all from what you have said. You allow for a review \nof procedures. What does it mean in subsection (d) when you state \n``without observance of the procedure required by law''?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator agree that the words ``failure to comply \nwith'' intend to refer to the rules pertaining to cost-benefit and to \nrisk analysis? That is the intention of the Senate?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Look, we have a whole big section there that speaks for \nitself, of course, that means the risk analysis and cost-benefit, and \nit means peer review. And, as I said earlier, there will be times when \nprocedural defects, if someone calls them that, might throw the whole \nrule out.\n  Suppose it is a regulation on second-hand smoke. If all the \nscientists were from the tobacco industry, it would be fundamentally \nunfair and the scientific judgment would be important. And if I were \nthe judge I would throw it out, even though that is a failure to comply \nbecause it would render the whole thing as an abusive discretion and \narbitrary and capricious.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield for just a moment?\n  The Senator had one question he asked, his first question for the \nlist of 80 to 100 reasons. I have 144, some of which have been \nremedied. I would like to enter this into the Record, if I may.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Sure. I think that may have been put into the Record \nearlier. I think that was put into the Record earlier this morning.\n  I believe we might check with Mr. Weiss.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes, I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I ask the Senator, is it accurate that section 625 has \nto do with jurisdiction and judicial review?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Section 625. The answer is yes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. And with regard to any question such as the one that \nthe Senator from Michigan raised pertaining to jurisdiction and \njudicial review, would that section apply?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Would it apply?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. With regard to the questions of to what judicial review \nwill pertain, would that be the governing section, section 625?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. You mean judicial review under titles II and III of \ncost-benefit analysis?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The answer is yes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. The question has arisen as to the language ``failure to \ncomply'' and how that might relate to some other section. I share the \nconcern of the Senator from Louisiana and bemusement really as to why \nour friends refuse to read the rest of that sentence. Instead of \nreading the rest of the sentence in which that phrase is contained, \nother sections are referred to.\n  Is it not true that it is ``failure to comply with this subsection \nmay be considered by the Court solely for the purpose of determining \nwhether or not the final agency action is arbitrary and capricious,'' \net cetera?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The Senator is correct. And the critics read out of \nthat statute the word ``solely,'' and they find ghosts everywhere. But \n``solely'' means solely, and it is right there in the language. For the \nlife of me, I cannot understand where people find ambiguity in it other \nthan they are looking for it.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I compliment the Senator in his attempt to deal with \nthis issue. It is as if someone would say that the Senator's desk is \nyellow, and you can argue that it is not, and someone else can argue \nthat it is. But there comes a point at which you want to throw up your \nhands, I am sure, because you are dealing with clear language, and I \nfail to see how anyone could misinterpret this. It has only to do with \nfinal agency action. Is that correct?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. And if there is a phrase or a couple of words within \nthat provision that our friends think may in some way be ambiguous in \ninterpreting another section or another phrase in another section of \nthe statute, would still not section 625 be the ruling section as far \nas what judicial review is? It is a judicial review question we are \nconcerned with here, is it not?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That is exactly right.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I share the Senator's real perplexity as to what the \nconfusion is with regard to the review in that section. It is clear \nthat it cannot be considered independently, that you cannot take--you \ncan look at a cost-benefit analysis or a risk assessment independently \nand provide your own independent judgment on that, but it can only go \ninto the final rule in making a determination as to whether or not the \nfinal rule is arbitrary and capricious, et cetera. Is that correct?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Exactly and precisely. My friend from Tennessee puts it \nvery well.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I am reminded, I tell my friend from Tennessee, of the \nold quotation from Groucho Marx, who said, ``Politics is the art of \nlooking for trouble, finding it everywhere, and applying to it the \nwrong solutions.''\n  Mr. THOMPSON. And most of it finds its way into legislation, I \nventure to say.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. With this bill, the opponents look for ghosts and \ntrouble everywhere, they find it everywhere, and they apply to it the \nwrong solutions.\n  Mr. President, this language is clear, and I do not care who says \notherwise. Show me where that is unclear. As I say to my friend from \nMichigan, his interpretation of his judicial review provision is \nexactly what ours says. His gives with the left hand a procedural \nreview, takes it away with the right hand in ambiguous language, and \ninterprets that with court cases which he says are clear. But we \nobviate the problem for any of that by simply saying there is no \nprocedural review. He has a procedural review in his proposal. We do \nnot have that in ours. That is why ours is preferable. It is clearer. \nIt is free of all ambiguity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nbipartisan regulatory reform bill introduced by Senators Glenn and \nChafee. Unlike the more radical Dole-Johnston proposal, this \nlegislation would make much-needed reforms to the regulatory process \nwithout jeopardizing the health and safety of American families.\n  There is widespread agreement about the need for regulatory reform. \nNobody wants to see American businesses, our engine of economic growth, \nhampered by unnecessary regulations. We must constantly monitor Federal \nagencies to ensure that the rules they issue are narrowly tailored and \nrationally enforced.\n  In some instances today, this is unfortunately not the case. Many \nresidents of my home State of Connecticut have told me about \nregulations that are not working well. And we have all heard stories \nabout regulations that seem to defy commonsense. The answer, however, \nis to change nonsensical regulations and implement some common sense \nreforms. We should not overreact by bringing the Government's ability \nto protect American families and workers to a grinding halt. \n\n[[Page S 10122]]\n\n  In my view, President Clinton has done an outstanding job in this \narea. As part of their ongoing effort to reinvent government, he and \nthe Vice President ordered all Government agencies to carefully examine \ntheir regulatory processes and put all the regulations they have issued \nunder the microscope. Their instructions have been to keep what works \nand eliminate or fix what does not.\n  In February, the President announced the first benefits from this \neffort. The administration dramatically changed the Federal \nGovernment's approach to small businesses. Paperwork requirements were \ncut in half, and regulators were told to take a more practical approach \nto enforcement by stressing compliance over punishment.\n  As part of this effort, the Food and Drug Administration has \nimplemented some major reforms. The FDA eliminated 600 pages of \nburdensome regulations. The agency also made changes to its review \nprocess to help consumers get high-quality drugs and medical devices \nmore quickly and more cheaply. These results are impressive, and soon \nother agencies will be announcing much-needed reforms.\n  Of course, there is a limit to what the Administration can do on its \nown. Since many regulations result from statutes passed by Congress, \nCongress must also act. Earlier this year, we made a good bipartisan \nstart by passing the Regulatory Transition Act. It would provide a 45-\nday period during which Congress could review new regulations and \npotentially reject rules through a resolution of disapproval.\n  Once that process is in place, Congress would better be able to \nfulfill its mission of regulatory oversight. But we also need to make \nimprovements to ensure that the regulatory process works properly \nbefore rules are issued. That is why I have cosponsored the Glenn-\nChafee bill. In my view, the bill does a much better job of \nrationalizing regulations while protecting American families than the \nmore drastic proposals by Senators Dole and Johnston.\n  The Glenn-Chafee substitute is a tough, fair regulatory reform bill. \nIt is not a catch-all for special interests. It would give agencies the \nresponsibility to determine a schedule to review all major rules in a \ntimely manner, and there would be no automatic sunset. Finally, \njudicial review would be more limited in scope, therefore preventing an \ninundation of frivolous challenges from overwhelming the courts.\n  Many Senators have taken to the floor to highlight burdensome and \nridiculous regulations. The Senator from Utah has even given us a top \nten list.\n  I would suggest that it is always easier to ridicule what does not \nwork than it is to point out what does. It is a simple, and often \neffective, rhetorical tool to string together isolated abuses to give \nthe impression that they are the rule, rather than the exception.\n  I want to break from this practice, however, and speak about some of \nthe success stories. American lives are strengthened and saved every \nday by good, sound regulations. ``Regulation'' has become a dirty word \nin some quarters, but we should remember what a regulation is: the \nmeans by which the law is implemented and enforced. Regulation is the \ntool the government uses to execute the people's will, as expressed \nthrough their elected representatives in Congress.\n  Sound regulations have saved countless lives and prevented numerous \ninjuries in the workplace, on the highways, in the air, and in the \nhome. These regulation have also saved millions of dollars saved in \nmedical costs, lost wages and reduced productivity from injury. They \nhave also immeasurably improved our quality of life.\n  I can speak to one example in particular. Since the passage of the \nClean Water Act in 1972, water pollution control programs have been \nable to greatly improve our water quality everywhere, including in the \nLong Island Sound. The current water quality of the sound is directly \nattributable to these pollution control programs, which have been \neffective in the face of increasing population and activities in and \naround the sound.\n  Environmental cleanup in the sound has led to increased tourism, \nincreased property values, new industry and a better economy. However, \nthe Long Island Sound cleanup is not finished. In fact, today it faces \nnew challenges from residential, commercial, and recreational \ndevelopment. It is crucial that pollution control programs remain in \nforce for the sake of the sound and those who live around it.\n  I fear that continued attempts to clean up the sound would be \nundermined by the Dole-Johnston bill. In fact, the legislation could \nactually turn the clock back and reverse years of progress.\n  I am also troubled by other provisions and their impact on Americans' \nhealth and safety. The Dole-Johnston bill is still ambiguous about what \nwould become of rules currently in the pipeline--those that have been \nissued but have not yet taken effect. The bill is also unclear as to \nwhether agencies would have to go back and redo risk assessment to \ncomply with the complicated risk assessment provision.\n  I also worry about the impact of this bill on the Occupational Safety \nand Health Administration's ability to prevent workplace injuries and \ndeaths. OSHA is already unable to fulfil its mandate in a timely \nfashion. It took the agency 10 years, for example, to issue rules \nensuring that workers would know about the dangers of the toxic \nchemicals in their workplace. These delays would grow immeasurably \nworse if, under this bill's provisions, we build even more bureaucratic \ndelay into the system. In the meantime, countless workers could be hurt \nunnecessarily.\n  While, I appreciated some changes made to the Dole-Johnston bill, I \nwas equally disappointed that other amendments to strengthen meat \nsafety, OSHA and safe drinking water standards failed. No one should \nhave to live in fear of illness or death from the E. coli bacteria or \ntainted water. In 1993, Milwaukee drinking water became tainted and \nmore than 100 people were killed and 400,000 people became sick. We do \nnot want to do anything here that would limit our ability to prevent \nsuch tragedies in the future.\n  I hope that in the coming days we can achieve a bipartisan consensus \non regulatory reform. I believe that the Glenn-Chafee bill provides the \nbest framework for these efforts, and I urge my colleagues to support \nits intent.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \ntemporarily the Glenn-Chafee amendment to offer an amendment by myself, \nSenator Hatfield, and Senator Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, what is the subject of this amendment?\n  Mr. SIMON. We are talking about regulations that we have passed that \ndo not make much sense. We passed a law that among other things \nprohibited Members of Congress from writing recommendations. If you \nhave a member of your staff who wants to get a civil service job, it is \nagainst the law for you to write a letter of recommendation. If we see \na page here doing a great job, we cannot write a letter of \nrecommendation. This simply permits us to do that, and I hope it could \nbe disposed of without great debate.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SIMON. I will be pleased to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I am familiar with the general problem. \nOf course, all of us have run into this. I am less familiar with the \nsolution, and I am totally ignorant of whether the committees of \njurisdiction have had a chance to look at it and whether they approve \nor disapprove. I wonder if the Senator could withhold to a later status \nin this bill and see if this can be cleared. I see Senator Roth. I do \nnot know whether that is within his committee of jurisdiction. Perhaps \nhe can speak to it.\n  Mr. ROTH. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I \nrespectfully request that the Senator from Illinois withdraw his \nrequest.\n  First of all, the amendment he is proposing is not germane to the \nlegislation before us. It does represent a very considerable change in \nour civil service rules that are worthy of review. But I hope that \nrather than bringing it up at this time, this is a matter that could be \nreviewed by the Governmental Affairs Committee which has jurisdiction \nover the matter.\n\n[[Page S 10123]]\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, with all due respect, I do not think the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, which created this law, is likely to \nrepeal it. But I have talked to a number of my colleagues, and I think \nthe sentiment in this body is overwhelming that we made a mistake.\n  Let me tell you how I happened to get into this. This is a letter I \nwrote to Donna Shalala about a person who lives in an apartment \nbuilding where we live:\n\n       Dear Donna: I am enclosing a resume for Dennis Gowie who \n     was a hospital administrator in Washington, DC until the new \n     administration here took over.\n       I do not know him well, but he lives in the same apartment \n     building that Jeanne and I live in, and he makes an excellent \n     impression and has a superior background.\n       I don't know where or if you are able to use someone with \n     his background in your administration, but I think his \n     background is so rich in the health care administration field \n     that he is worthy of consideration.\n           Cordially.\n\n  I got the letter back with a letter saying I violated the law. A \nlobbyist, any lobbyist, can send a letter of recommendation for anyone, \nbut if you have somebody working on your staff who is doing a good job \nand you want to send a letter of recommendation for a civil service job \nfor that person, that is a violation of the law. We are in the process \nof talking about regulations that are ridiculous. This is a law that is \nridiculous that is a regulation on us. I think we ought to get rid of \nit. I think this is a good time to do it. I am not trying to impose \nmyself in the middle of this particular amendment, and I might say to \nmy colleague from Ohio, I strongly support his amendment. But if I may \nask my colleague from Delaware, if I were to ask unanimous consent to \nhave this up on the floor of the Senate after the Glenn-Chafee \namendment is disposed of, would that be satisfactory?\n  Mr. ROTH. Let me answer the distinguished Senator this way. As he \nknows, we are having a very serious, a very important discussion on \njudicial review. So I think it would be unhelpful to suddenly turn to a \nmatter that is not even directly related to the legislation before us.\n  Second, I think we all agree this legislation on regulatory reform is \namong the most important legislation that shall come before us this \nyear. For that reason, it concerns me if we begin to add amendments--\nthis would be the first--that are not related.\n  I would be happy to assure the distinguished Senator from Illinois \nthat we would be happy to take a hard look at this in committee. I have \nhad a number of people mention the problems, the concern it causes \nthem, but I think if we are going to change it--and perhaps we should--\nthen it should be done in a manner that is most constructive under the \ncircumstances, rather than being done on an unrelated piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, frankly, it is not satisfactory to me to \nhave the committee take a hard look at it. I want to get a vote on it. \nWe have crafted this very carefully, I want to assure my colleagues. In \nterms of it not being germane, the Senator from Delaware and I have \nvoted for a thousand amendments that are not germane to legislation \nthat is up. It is in a peripheral way germane.\n  I will change my unanimous consent request, Mr. President. I ask \nunanimous consent that when the Chafee amendment is disposed of, the \nSimon-Hatfield-Reid amendment be up for consideration at that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, why does the Senator not give us a \nlittle time to work this issue? I personally have no objection to this. \nRather than seal in a nongermane amendment at this point--that may be \ntonight--we may be able to make some progress on some other amendments \ntonight. If my friend will withhold, he will have a right to bring up \nhis amendment at some other time.\n  (Mr. GRAMS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, because I am interested in adopting this, \nand I am not trying to cause problems on the floor, I will withhold my \nrequest at this point. But I want to assure my colleagues on the floor, \nI am going to bring this amendment up one way or another on this bill \nbefore it passes.\n  If I may add one other point, Mr. President, and I say to my \ncolleague from Delaware, as well as Senator Glenn from Ohio, if there \nis some wording here that needs improvement, I am not wedded to this \nwording. We think we have drawn it very carefully. But if there is \nsomething that is not prudent here, what we say is that where there is \non the basis of personal knowledge or records of the person furnishing \nwe can make an evaluation of the work performance, ability, aptitude, \ngeneral qualifications, valuation of character, loyalty, or suitability \nof such individual. I think those are the kind of things that should \nnot present a problem. I hope we will do this.\n  Let me just add, I am leaving this body. This is going to have a lot \nmore to do with the future of Senator Roth and Senator Thompson and the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Minnesota than it will for Paul \nSimon. But I want to be free if I have a good staff person or I know \nsomeone would be good for a job, to write a letter of recommendation. \nMy experience is those letters do not mean that much, but at least I \ncan get it off my chest. I want to have the right to write that letter \nand not just leave that right to lobbyists and others.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I would like to address the subject of \njudicial review which my colleagues have been so eloquently discussing \nthis morning. I think this, first of all, goes to the very heart of \nthis legislation, because we can pass all of the requirements and all \nof the commonsense proposals that we want, but if it is left totally in \nthe hands of the bureaucracy to decide whether or not they want to \ncomply with it or how they want to comply with it, then it is \nmeaningless. In other words, if there is not some semblance of judicial \nreview, even for the most egregious conduct and outrageous decisions, \nit is, indeed, meaningless.\n  Mr. President, this is a nation of laws, not of men and women, the \nbedrock of our country. Legislation gives tremendous authority to the \nexecutive branch. That is what this body, that is what the Congress of \nthe United States does on a daily basis: It gives great authority to \nthe executive branch to implement the laws that are passed.\n  The bureaucracy, the administrative agencies--and I do not use that \nterm derogatorily--but the bureaucracy works in that regard in adopting \nregulations to implement the laws that we pass. This is an awesome \nauthority that we give to the executive branch.\n  We have seen in times past in this country, and other nations, that \npower does tend to corrupt. Executive branch authority has to be looked \nat carefully; it has to be looked at constantly. Goodness knows, this \nbody, in my brief observation, seldom has the opportunity for effective \noversight.\n  The Senator from Ohio made a very impressive statement on more than \none occasion concerning the regulations of one particular regulation \npertaining to the Clean Water Act--I believe, effluent emissions--where \nhe said that from the well to the ceiling of this Chamber is 42\\1/2\\ \nfeet, and those documents would go all the way from the well to the \nceiling three times--three stacks of documents for one regulation.\n  I am not sure the Senator would share the same conclusion that I \nwould share from that. But, obviously, we do not have the time nor the \ninclination to go back and revisit the laws and revisit the \nregulations, certainly, that have been passed up until this time. What \nwe can do is establish some rules of the road, interject some \ncommonsense ways for the agencies to justify future rules, future \nregulations.\n  Now, this authority that we give the executive branch is proper and \nappropriate in our constitutional scheme. That is what it is all about. \nWe are supposed to have oversight of that. I think anyone who has spent \nany time here at all must acknowledge that that is a very tenuous \nsituation at best in terms of effective oversight. We must look \nprospectively.\n  So we have a system where citizens who are affected by this \nlegislation, not just depending on Congress, but citizens affected by \nthis legislation can come into court and say basically, ``We are not \nbeing treated right.'' That is all judicial review means. They come \ninto the third branch of Government, \n\n[[Page S 10124]]\nan independent branch of Government--the judiciary--to make a \ndetermination as to whether or not the citizen, the private concern, is \nbeing treated right.\n  We can talk about special interests and all of that in a pejorative \nway, but there are a lot of small businesses out there, a lot of \nindividuals, there are a lot of public interest groups who take \nadvantage of judicial review on a daily basis. It is not just the \ncorporate fat cats who are sitting back out there to be labeled as \nspecial interest to whom this is important. It is important to \neverybody. It is important to every citizen. And it is really strange \nand inappropriate, I think, if we carve out one or two little pieces in \nthis entire administrative framework that we are dealing with here and \nsay everyone has the opportunity to come into court except these \nparticular individuals, or except in these particular circumstances, \nbecause we place so much confidence in the nameless, faceless \nadministrators who come up with these analyses, or these rules, that we \nreally effectively do not want any judicial review in this particular \narea.\n  Mr. President, I do not share the confidence that the opponents of \nDole-Johnston seem to have in the agencies. They do a lot of good work \non many occasions. But we cannot give that kind of authority, \nunchecked, unreviewed, to anybody, including them.\n  We hear a lot of talk about a ``lawyer's dream.'' We are concerned \nnow that we are going to create new causes of action, we are going to \nprovide a new access for somebody coming into court. I share that \nconcern across the board. I think that in times past we have not paid \nenough attention to that fact. But it is a strange occurrence for us to \nall of a sudden be concerned about that in the middle of this debate, \nwhen we are trying to bring some commonsense reform to this regulatory \nmaze that is costing every American family $6,000 a year, because this \nbody, the Congress of the United States, as a whole, are the reasons \nfor the litigation explosion in the Federal system.\n  It is the laws that we create, giving judicial review almost on every \noccasion, that create all of the litigation and all of the new regs, \nand we could not fill in this Chamber with all of the legislation that \nwe have passed that give people new causes of action and new motivation \nto come to court, and new ways to burden the Federal court system. If \nyou have a civil case anymore in the Federal court system, and many \nplaces in this country, you may as well forget about it for a good long \nwhile. Under the speedy justice acts, criminal cases take precedence. \nAnd that is because of what we have done here in this body. Not only do \nwe constantly create new causes of action in this body, but on many \noccasions we finance it ourselves. We not only say you can come into \ncourt and get judicial review, which effectively is being denied, I \nsubmit, by the Glenn-Chafee amendment, but we have created all sorts of \nlegislation where the Government will either pay the attorney's fees, \nor there are attorney's fees shifting. In other words, what could be \nmore of an inducement to people to bring lawsuits and to come with new \nlitigation than to say you are going to get your attorney's fees paid \nfor? Yet, we do that time and time again. We are the cause of all of \nthat.\n  There are the civil rights cases, which we are familiar with; Fair \nHousing Act, Fair Labor Standards Act; Age Discrimination in Employment \nAct of 1967; Equal Credit Opportunity Act; Civil Service Rehabilitation \nAct; Individuals With Disabilities Act; Religious Freedom Restoration \nAct; Violence Against Women Act. There are awards for attorney's fees \nin tax cases that we give to citizens if they prevail in certain tax \ncases. Awards for attorney's fees we give in certain lawsuits against \nthe States, and in certain lawsuits against judges. We not only give \nthem a cause of action, and we not only give them judicial review, we \nsee that their attorney's fees are paid.\n  There was the Federal Contested Elections Act; Government Employees \nRights Act of 1991; Equal Access to Justice Act; Freedom of Information \nAct and Privacy Act; Government in the Sunshine Act; Whistleblower \nProtection Act of 1989; Civil Service Reform Act of 1978; NEPA; \nCommodity Exchange Act; Packers and Stock Yards Act; Perishable \nAgricultural Commodity Act; Federal Crop Insurance Act, Animal Welfare \nAct; Agricultural Unfair Trade Practices Act; Plant Variety; \nImmigration and Naturalization Act; National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration Act; National Defense Authorization Act; Bankruptcy Act; \nFederal Home Loan Bank Act; Home Owners Loan Act; Housing Act of 1959.\n  These are all acts not only where we are creating new causes of \naction and giving people access to the court, in addition giving them \njudicial review, but we are seeing that their attorney's fees get paid \nif they prevail. That is a very loose definition.\n  I will continue: National Housing Act; Federal Credit Union Act; \nFederal Deposit Insurance Act; Bank Holding Company Act; Bank Tying \nAct--whatever that is--Farm Credit Amendments Act; Real Estate \nSettlement Procedures Act; International Banking Act; Expedited Funds \nAvailability Act.\n  Mr. President, there are hundreds. I will not take the Senate's time \nwith reading all of them. But there are literally hundreds of pieces of \nlegislation that this body has created where not only do we create new \ncauses of action and provide judicial review; no question is usually \never raised about full judicial review. All of these are important \nsubjects. I am not saying they were bad legislation in every case; \ncertainly not. I am just saying that it is mighty strange that in the \nmiddle of all of this, when we want to say let us supply a little \ncommon sense to the regulatory process, let us require a cost-benefit \nanalysis, just put down on paper whether the benefits justify the \ncosts--as we have seen here, we are not talking about a money situation \nhere. Benefits are defined as social benefits, as well as economic \nbenefits. Costs are defined as social costs--social costs, as well as \neconomic costs; not only direct benefits and direct costs, but indirect \nbenefits and indirect costs. What could give an agency more discretion \nthan dealing with something that might be described as an indirect \nsocial benefit? That is great leeway.\n  Yet, we want to limit judicial review when they make these \ncommonsense assessments that we say since we cannot and will not go \nback to the 3-foot stack of regulations and deal with them, which is \nwhat we really ought to do, we are going to at least try to apply some \ncommonsense standards as far as we go forward. That is all this is \nabout. Judicial review is the norm. It is the way it ought to be. The \nAdministrative Procedures Act provides broad, broad discretion and \njudicial review. We keep talking about this explosive litigation \nsituation that is going to develop from all of this.\n Not so. We create no new causes of action with the Dole-Johnston bill.\n\n  The judicial review is already contained in the substantive \nlegislation. I must say, it seems in times past when we gave authority \nto an agency, we have readily granted judicial review. But when we are \nputting certain restrictions on an agency and making them justify what \nthey do, some seem to want no judicial review.\n  The opponents say not only too much litigation; second-guessing \nscientific opinions, the rulemakers will be tied up in knots. Well, the \nSenator from Louisiana, I think, has very, very effectively addressed \nmost of those. I share his concern that if something is repeated long \nenough, saying that it will cause an explosion in litigation and that \nwill tie the courts up in knots, some people will get to believe it. It \nis just not true. Repeating it does not make it true.\n  Section 625, no new causes of action. Final agency action is the only \nthing that can be looked at. Cost-benefit analysis will be included in \nthe directive. Only if the final agency action is arbitrary or \ncapricious will it be overturned. In other words, no independent \nsecond-guessing or analysis of the cost-benefit analysis. It is just a \npart of the picture. It is part of the overall picture, and it can be \nconsidered. It can be looked at.\n  Mr. President, I submit that this provision is narrower than the law \nis now. Traditionally, any procedure defect can be appealed and be a \nground for upsetting the agency action. Here it is only if it is a part \nof an overall review, if the final agency action is arbitrary and \ncapricious. It cannot be considered independently. Under the old law if \nsomething was faulty, if the cost-benefit analysis was faulty, that \nkind of a \n\n[[Page S 10125]]\ndefect would be reviewable and enough to overturn the opinion.\n  Actually, it seems to me that as far as this new cost-benefit is \nconcerned, we have a narrower scope review than we traditionally have \nfor other defects in the process. Of course, 706 is just the same as \nunder the Administrative Procedure Act that we have been dealing with \nfor so many years, except with section (F).\n  As I understand it, we have to look at (E) in conjunction with that. \nIt is a substantial evidence test in (E), substantial support test in \n(F). Substantial evidence test, as I understand it, where there is a \nrecord administrative law judge, substantial evidence test is something \nthat has been applied now for years and years on the record, and I \nthink the thinking with (F) is apply that to the rulemaking process, \nthe same kind of review, substantial support test, and do we want a \nrule that does not have support in the record in the rulemaking, \nsubstantial support? It is not a de novo review by any stretch of the \nimagination. The court must show deference to what the agency has done \nunder that kind of scheme.\n  Will there be more litigation? I submit certainly not. I submit \nnobody knows, certainly. Nobody knows. There is always litigation. \nThere always will be litigation. Trying to pinpoint the cause for a \nparticular lawsuit cause of action is a fruitless process.\n  I submit a very good case could be made for the proposition that it \nwill result in less litigation, Mr. President, instead of more, because \nnow at least the courts have some fairly objective criteria to look at.\n  Cost-benefit analysis: Do the benefits justify the costs? Are the \ncosts justified by the benefits? I think it could go to make better \nrules. I think the agencies have been engaging in this process all \nalong, anyway, in some rough form.\n  Any rule that we put down, certainly, I hope that agencies would \nconsider how much benefit are we going to get out of this and what will \nit cost? By putting it down somewhere--with the tremendous prejudice in \nfavor of the agency action going in, the tremendous hurdles a \npetitioner has to overcome--putting it down somewhere and having \ndeveloped some case law on the subject, and it becoming more objective, \nI submit that people would be less likely to attack it because it is \nless nebulous than it has been in times past.\n  Will there be more litigation? There is very limited interlocutory \nreview. Now, if an agency decides that something is not a major rule, \nit does not meet the $100 million threshold, then there is review under \nthose circumstances. But I think the Senator from Louisiana hit it on \nthe head. It looks to me to be in the interests of both sides, if the \ndetermination is made that it is not a major rule, to go ahead and get \nthat resolved.\n  Otherwise, we go on through the process, all the way to the end, get \nto the final rulemaking, get there, then an appeal is taken. Then if it \nis determined it was, in fact, a major rule, have to go all the way \nback, and it affects everything that has been done, and you have to \nstart back from scratch.\n  This is not a problem, interlocutory situation, that gives the \npetitioner some great advantage.\n  What about second-guessing scientific study and that sort of thing? I \nsubmit, Mr. President, that right now we have courts in a position \nunder the arbitrary and capricious standard and all the other standards \nunder 702 that courts are making some kind of rough determination on \nscientific principles of some kind, scientific analysis, totally \nunequipped in many cases, I am sure, to do it. But under the Dole-\nJohnston bill, we have peer review. We actually have an opportunity for \nthe experts to come in and interject their analysis into the process.\n  Again, my understanding is that this is nothing new in the well-\ncrafted rules and procedures that are done now under current law. Peer \nreview is not a stranger--National Academy of Science--and the agencies \nare well equipped to do this peer review. They are well equipped to do \nthe cost-benefit analysis. There is nothing new with regard to that. \nNow they must do it in every instance where we have a major rule.\n  So the courts now are having to deal with this scientific evidence \ntest. Actually, this legislation will assist the court because of the \nadditional peer review. The courts will not be second-guessing the \nagency's actions here. I share with the proponents of the Glenn-Chafee \nsubstitute that we do not want to be able to have people come in and \ntie up legitimate rulemaking functions at the drop of a hat and stop \neverything in its tracks. Nobody is propounding that.\n  What is being done here, it looks to me, the problem with it, it is \nsuch a modest proposal, it is such a modest first step to interject an \nelement of common sense into a process that I think just about \neverybody in this country has concluded has gone too far. Every once in \na while things gets out of hand. We have to get back toward the middle \nof the road a little bit. I think that is what this legislation does in \na very modest way.\n  Increased delay, tie the court in knots--it is simply not in the \nlegislation. These objections cannot be identified and pinpointed with \nregard to any particular section in this legislation in the Dole-\nJohnston amendment. Under ordinary circumstances, you cannot get a \nstay, you cannot come in, you cannot file a lawsuit and stop the \nproceedings. That simply does not happen except in rare circumstances.\n  What are those circumstances? Same old, traditional circumstances \nthat we have already had in other situations. That is, if a petitioner \ncan overcome the very high burden of proving that he is likely to \nprevail ultimately in the case, if the petitioner can show that he will \nsuffer irreparable injury, not just injury but irreparable injury, if \nhe can show it is in the public interest, if he can do all of those \nthings, he might stay the proceedings for a while. Would we not want \nhim to?\n  If petitioners can show that they are likely to prevail, that they \nare going to suffer irreparable injury, is there anything wrong, within \nthat limited circumstance, with being able to have a stay? It is a \nvery, very rare situation, indeed, where that would come into play. So \nthere is no tying up of the courts. There is no stopping of the courts. \nThere is no keeping the forward move of the rule from making progress.\n  What are the hurdles? Look at a situation that a petitioner has. Look \nat what a petitioner has to go through in order to challenge a rule.\n  First of all, you have the definition of benefit and the definition \nof costs that we referred to a little bit earlier. I think we need to \ngo back to that, because I think we get away from that. The definition \napplies throughout for both subchapter 2 and 3. The definitions are \nruling. The definitions are standard, and apply every time these terms \nare used anywhere in the act. It says:\n\n       The term ``benefit'' means the reasonable, identifiable, \n     significant favorable effects including social, \n     environmental, health and economic effects that are expected \n     to result directly or indirectly from implementation of a \n     rule or other agency action.\n\n  So, when people talk about seatbelts, or people talk about food, and \npeople talk about all those things that are vital concerns to all of \nus--certainly you can consider the noneconomic benefits. You can \nconsider the social benefits. You can consider the environmental \nbenefits. You can consider all of the health benefits. And, if an \nagency does a halfway decent job of addressing that and putting it down \non paper, look at the hurdles that a petitioner has to overcome in \norder to challenge that. Consider the court's natural hesitancy to \nsecond guess an agency under those circumstances; a natural hesitancy \nto second guess technical evaluations.\n  Then you have the harmless error rule. Suppose you go through all \nthat. OK, the agency messed up. OK, even by the loosest definition of \nbenefit or cost, the benefits did not outweigh the costs so the \npetitioner has crossed that first hurdle. Then he has to get by the \nharmless error rule, and that is no mean feat. That has been with us \nfor a long time. It has made a lot of agency actions prevail in \ncircumstances they otherwise would not.\n  So, those are the hurdles that a petitioner has. Now, under the Glenn \nsubstitute, first of all, for something that has to do with judicial \nreview I am struck by the consistency of what is not subject to \njudicial review. I think we have five sections here and in four of them \nthe emphasis is on what is not subject. \n\n[[Page S 10126]]\n\n  Section 623(a): ``Shall not be subject to judicial review in \nconnection with,'' et cetera.\n  ``(b) shall not be subject to judicial review in any manner''\n  ``(d) court shall not review to determine whether,'' et cetera.\n  ``(e) shall not be subject to judicial consideration separate and \napart,'' et cetera.\n  I will go into the details of all this later. But is it not strange \nthat in something that is supposed to deal with judicial review, that \nthe entire emphasis seems to be on what is not subject to judicial \nreview? It looks like we are leaving a very, very narrow window indeed.\n  Let us look at the provisions of the Glenn-Chafee substitute. In the \nfirst place you have (b), ``any determination by designee of the \nPresident or the director that a rule is or is not a major rule shall \nnot be subject to judicial review in any manner.'' It just stops in its \ntracks, if I understand it correctly. That can just stop everything in \nits tracks right there.\n  It says in (e) that ``a determination by an agency that it is not a \nmajor rule shall be set aside by a reviewing court on clear and \nconvincing evidence.'' But who gets to decide last? If an agency made \nthis determination and the President or the director made a subsequent \ndetermination, or contemporaneous determination, would that not be the \nend of it?\n  In other words, the executive branch has total discretion, it looks \nto me like, in determining whether or not the process goes forward in \nterms of cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment or whatever, because \nthey can decide, no matter how clear it is to most people that it meets \nthe $100 million threshold--they could just say that it does not and \nnobody can review that. Nobody can question that.\n  Indeed, ``If a cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment required \nunder this chapter has been wholly omitted for any major rule, a court \nshall vacate the rule and remand the case for further consideration.''\n  In other words, if you have what has been decided and what has been \ndetermined is a major rule, therefore under the law requiring the \nagency to make the cost-benefit analysis, but the agency just says I am \nnot going to do it, they suffer the severe penalty of having the court \nsimply remand it back to them for further consideration. I do not know \nwhat happens if they do the same thing again and the court remands it \nback again, and again and again.\n  The rest of it I think the Senator from Louisiana has addressed. It \nis essentially very similar to the Dole-Johnston bill in that basically \nit is still an arbitrary and capricious test. I did not even mention \nthat in the hurdles that a petitioner has to overcome, which is a very, \nvery tough test for a petitioner to have to overcome to prove that \nsomething is arbitrary and capricious.\n  So, Mr. President, I think it just comes down to whether or not you \nwant to do anything about this problem. I think it comes down to \nwhether or not you want risk assessment, you want to have a cost-\nbenefit analysis. Because, if you do, it cannot possibly mean anything. \nIt would be totally meaningless unless you have more of a redress for \npeople who are aggrieved.\n  I might point out, in this legislation business, it seems to me we \noften go off on the basis of whose ox is being gored at the moment. \nWhat if you had a President who did not like any rules? Should we cut \noff people, public interest groups, whatever, from judicial review and \npetitioning and doing what they would want to do in order to get \neffective rules passed and make sure they are not just dismissed out of \nhand and erroneous determinations as to whether or not something is a \nmajor rule? Some President could decide everything is going to be a \nmajor rule, no matter how minuscule it is. If he was really an enemy of \nrules and regulations, he could just decide everything is going to go \nbe a rule and make everyone go through the process.\n  It is a two-way street if we look at it that way, and I urge the \nDole-Johnston amendment does that. It is a modest proposal to try to \nget our arms around, in some way, and make some progress towards \ninterjecting some simple, some commonsense principles into this \nregulatory mess that we have gotten ourselves into and do not seem to \nknow how to get out of that is costing the American taxpayers' $6,000 \nper year per family and going up. And then get on about the business of \npassing laws that will be subject to real oversight. I think that is \none of the most important provisions of this bill. I think it gives us \nanother look at these rules that are going to be passed, now, and give \nus really an opportunity to focus on our oversight responsibility.\n  We do pretty good at turning these laws out but it seems to me like \nwe wake up a few years down the road and get a deluge of citizens \ncoming in here saying you did not know it at the time but look what you \nhave done to us. And then it is too late to do anything about the \nregulatory mess we have created.\n  We have an opportunity here to do something about that and I urge the \ndefeat of the Glenn-Chafee amendment and the adoption of the Dole-\nJohnston amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we finally have, as the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee said, the opportunity to legislate an end to the \nunnecessarily costly consequences of Federal Government regulations.\n  This legislation that has been introduced by the Majority Leader, \nwhich I am cosponsoring, will make it necessary to consider the cost \neffectiveness of regulations that seek to manage the risks to health, \nsafety, and our environment. In short, it will help ensure that the \nbenefits derived from Federal regulatory actions justify their cost.\n  The Federal regulatory burden has become too heavy and too expensive. \nThere are several recent studies that confirm this. One is a March 1995 \npublication of the Harvard School of Public Health which analyzed 200 \nFederal programs and revealed that many highly cost-effective programs \nwere not fully implemented, while other highly cost-ineffective \nprograms were widely implemented. It suggested that a reallocation of \nresources to more cost-effective programs could save an additional \n60,000 lives per year at no increased cost to taxpayers or to the \nprivate sector. The conclusion was that we could save the same number \nof lives, but with a $31 billion annual savings to the American people.\n  In an American Enterprise Institute policy paper, Christopher DeMuth \nhas described Federal regulations this way, and I quote:\n\n       They are much more costly than all the domestic \n     discretionary spending programs of the Federal Government \n     combined. Regulatory agencies can tax and spend freely in \n     pursuit of environmental quality, product safety, and other \n     regulatory goals, and the costs they impose are free of the \n     budget and appropriations controls that constrain spending \n     programs.\n\n  That is the end of the quote.\n  The Heritage Foundation's ``A Citizens Guide to Federal Regulation'' \nestimates that the cost of Federal regulation to the economy exceeds \n$500 billion, or about $5,000 per household each year. EPA has \nestimated that environmental regulations alone in 1990 cost the U.S. \neconomy about $115 billion. As a result of the Clean Air Act amendments \nand other new requirements, spending by business on environmental \nprotection is expected to exceed $200 billion annually within 5 years.\n  In 1993, the President's National Performance Review estimated that \ncomplying with Federal regulations cost the private sector $430 billion \nper year. This is almost 10 percent of the gross national product.\n  One of the more frequently cited economists on the costs of \nregulation, Thomas Hopkins of the Rochester Institute, has estimated \nthe direct Federal regulatory burden for 1994 to be approximately $630 \nbillion.\n  So whatever estimate you choose, it is a big one. The burden is \nenormous and, without action on our part, it is only going to get \nbigger.\n  One sector of our economy that has come under special pressure from \nenvironmental and related Federal regulations is American agriculture. \nExcessive regulation of agriculture has become in some instances \ncounterproductive to our efforts to maintain the safety and integrity \nof the U.S. food supply.\n  Some Federal regulations not only impose unnecessary and burdensome \ncosts on farmers, but they make our farm and food products less \ncompetitive in world markets. The Delaney clause, for example, enacted \nin 1958, \n\n[[Page S 10127]]\nhas been strictly interpreted and enforced in such a way that it has \nimposed enormous expenses and burdens while providing very little \nbenefit to the public. In many instances, the Delaney clause has become \nan obstacle to the implementation of sensible food safety policy \nbecause it has prohibited the use of production efficiencies that pose \nlittle or no risk to the public.\n  This problem was compounded by the 1992 Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals ruling which invalidated the EPA's negligible risk \ninterpretation of the Delaney clause and required a zero risk \ninterpretation that threatens to restrict the use of up to 80 widely \nused crop protection tools. These tools are important in the production \nof a safer, abundant, and affordable U.S. food supply.\n  EPA Administrator Carol Browner has acknowledged that the pesticides \naffected by this recent court decision pose no risk to public health. \nLynn Goldman, Assistant Administrator of the EPA, has admitted that the \nDelaney clause is an outdated approach for protecting consumers from \npesticide residues and that the loss of selected pesticide uses may \naffect the price or seasonal availability of particular commodities.\n  Furthermore, in 1993, the EPA stated that the potential economic \nimpact of a strict interpretation of the Delaney clause could reach $1 \nbillion per year.\n  In rice-producing States, like my State of Mississippi, uncontrolled \nrice plant diseases can lower crop yields by 75 to 80 percent. The \nfungicide benomyl, which is used to control rice blast on 15 to 30 \npercent of the rice acres in the southeastern States, is the only \nfungicide registered for that purpose. Under a strict interpretation of \nthe Delaney clause, EPA intends to prohibit the use of benomyl on rice. \nThis will result in higher costs to farmers and consumers and will \nprovide no real improvement in food safety.\n  Mr. President, the outdated Delaney clause rests on a flawed premise. \nIt assumes that a carcinogen at any level of exposure can cause cancer. \nBecause of recent advances in research, we know that premise is wrong. \nWith current technologies that allow the detection of minute quantities \nof potential carcinogens that were previously undetectable, the number \nof substances subject to the Delaney clause expands with every advance \nin analytical chemistry. We are now able to discover in food previously \nundetectable trace levels of materials used in production and \ndistribution that are not added to food in any conventional sense, yet \nare food additives under the law.\n  Reform of the Delaney clause, as provided for in this legislation, is \nessential to preserving a safe, abundant, and affordable U.S. food \nsupply. And it is long overdue.\n  Numerous other excessive and costly regulatory burdens imposed on \nAmerican agriculture will also be relieved by this legislation. In a \nrecent Washington Times op-ed article, I described several examples \nwhere the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Interior, and \nother Federal agencies have gone beyond the intent of Congress in the \nregulatory requirements imposed on agriculture.\n  The Farm Bureau Federation estimates that U.S. agricultural interests \nspend between $18 and $20 billion per year complying with Federal \nregulations. This amounts to roughly 35 percent of total net farm \nincome in our country.\n  The Delaney clause, and all the other Federal regulations, that are \nsqueezing the American farmer and food industries must be subjected to \na reasonable, fair, and sound science-based assessment of the real \nrisks to safety, health and the environment.\n  While such reform will help the entire economy, it will help U.S. \nagriculture in particular, and it will reduce costs to consumers \nwithout endangering their health or our environment.\n  Mr. President, the American people want reasonable reform of the \ncurrent regulatory system. This legislation provides such reform, and I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n  I also ask, Mr. President, unanimous consent that the op-ed article I \nmentioned be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, April 4, 1995]\n\n                           (By Thad Cochran)\n\n                     Regulatory Relief for Farmers\n\n       The regulators have run amok in America and nowhere have \n     things gotten more out of control than on the farm.\n       As long as the two key ingredients in food production \n     remain land and water, agriculture will be in the eye of the \n     environmental storm. But it is not--and has never been--a \n     struggle between pro- and anti-environmental forces. As \n     entrepreneurs whose very livelihood rests on the careful \n     stewardship of an ecological system, farmers have long \n     supported measures to protect our natural resources. But \n     those same farmers, who are already up against the \n     uncertainties of the weather and heavy foreign government \n     subsidies, now increasingly have to ``do battle'' with \n     regulators in Washington.\n       The reason? Because in too many cases, regulators at the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture, the Interior Department and other agencies have \n     gone far beyond the intent of Congress.\n       In an effort to produce a better coordinated approach, EPA \n     has combined, or ``clustered,'' certain air and water \n     standards. The goal of avoiding incompatible and \n     contradictory rules is laudable. But the result is another \n     case of regulatory overkill.\n       EPA's ``cluster rule'' for the pulp and paper industry is \n     the most costly environmental rulemaking ever proposed for a \n     single industry. It is estimated that compliance with this \n     rule will cost more than $11 billion despite the solid \n     progress already made by forest and paper companies. The \n     industry, for example, without the cluster rule has reduced \n     dioxin in effluent by 92 percent since 1988.\n       The treatment of wetlands is another case in point. Despite \n     a recent Memorandum of Agreement among several federal \n     agencies, the process of defining a wetland and delineating \n     sites remains confusing and contentious. Farmers now \n     dutifully file requests for permits to make modifications to \n     portions of their own property that have been designated \n     wetlands. Almost half of the applications filed for a permit \n     involve an impact on less than one acre.\n       Bob Floyd of Muncie, Ind., had a ``wetland'' mysteriously \n     appear on his property when a local business accidentally cut \n     a drainage pipe.\n      Federal regulators swooped in to protect this ``wetland'' \n     and forced the 80-year-old farmer to stop farming. Because \n     of this wetland area (which has since dried up), Mr. Floyd \n     may have to sell the land his family had farmed for a \n     half-century.\n       This might be funny if it were an isolated incident. But it \n     is not. At a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing in \n     February, witness after witness came forward with examples of \n     farmers tangled in red tape, thousands of dollars incurred in \n     filling out forms and family farms being threatened by the \n     Endangered Species Act or the Clean Water Act or some other \n     regulatory requirement.\n       The American Farm Bureau Federation estimates that U.S. \n     agricultural interests spend between $18 billion and $20 \n     billion per year complying with federal regulations. To put \n     things in perspective, that figure is roughly 35 percent of \n     total net farm income in the United States. If this estimate \n     is correct, and if anything it is probably low, farmers spend \n     $2 complying with government mandated regulations for every \n     $1 they receive in price supports.\n       Clearly, things have gotten seriously out of hand. \n     Fortunately, the utter frustration with this and other \n     problems manufactured in Washington was powerfully \n     communicated through the elections last November.\n       Congress is now under new management--and a wide range of \n     issues, including the need for regulatory relief, are being \n     addressed. Last month the Senate Government Affairs Committee \n     reported two bills (S343 and S291) which would require \n     federal regulatory agencies to prepare a cost-benefit \n     analysis (for major regulations) and incorporate that \n     analysis into the rulemaking process. Before new rules could \n     take effect, federal agencies would have to (1) determine \n     that the benefits outweigh the costs, and (2) determine that \n     the proposed rule will provide a greater benefit to society \n     than any other alternatives.\n       If this all sounds like plain old common sense, the \n     similarity is intentional. We have gotten to the point in \n     this country where farm and landowners are almost considered \n     guilty until they can prove their innocence. The burden of \n     proof should be on the regulator and the place to start is to \n     require the regulators to prove that the rules are necessary, \n     that they benefit the public at large and generally pass the \n     common-sense test.\n       All this is compounded by overlapping, and in some cases \n     competing, jurisdictions among federal agencies. It is common \n     for a farm enterprise or agriculture business to have to deal \n     simultaneously with the EPA, the Army Corps of Engineers, the \n     Transportation Department, the Agriculture Department, the \n     Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and others.\n       There is a groundswell of support in Congress to slow the \n     regulatory machine until Washington can ``get its act \n     together.'' The House of Representatives has already passed a \n     bill to place a moratorium on significant regulations, \n     retroactive to November of last year. A week ago, the Senate \n     passed legislation giving Congress 45 days to review proposed \n     major regulations. The Senate bill establishes a ``fast \n     track'' review process and provides that any regulation can \n     be blocked if both the House and Senate disapprove it \n\n[[Page S 10128]]\n     within the 45-day time frame. The congressional review would apply not \n     only to any future rulemaking but retroactively to any \n     significant regulation issued since Nov. 20, 1994.\n       Obviously, the differing House and Senate bills will have \n     to be reconciled in conference; but it is clear we are going \n     to restrain the regulators.\n       Even though commodity prices generally were solid last \n     year, net farm income is at its lowest point in a decade. If \n     American agriculture is to prosper, it will have to increase \n     productivity and capture new foreign markets. That is a \n     challenge under normal circumstances. But it will be almost \n     impossible if the American farmer, increasingly tangled in a \n     destructive web of red tape, is forced to spend a third of \n     his net income complying with government rules. \n     Unfortunately, that is the track we are on in this country. \n     It is a course that I and many others in Congress are \n     determined to reverse.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  It is a pleasure to rise today to discuss with you an opportunity to \nprovide relief from many of the threats to the safety, security, and \nwell-being of those individuals who populate our urban centers. Our \ncities today, especially our inner cities, have become areas of \nhopelessness and decay and despair.\n  Consider these facts:\n  America's urban areas suffer a murder every 22 minutes, a robbery \nevery 49 seconds, an aggravated assault every 30 seconds. In a survey \nof first and second graders in Washington, DC, the Nation's capital, 31 \npercent reported having witnessed a shooting; 39 percent said they had \nseen dead bodies; 40 percent of low-income parents worry a lot about \ntheir children being shot, compared to 10 percent of all parents who \nworry about their children being shot; 1 out of every 24 black males in \nthis Nation, 1 out of every 24 black males in America, will have his \nlife ended by a homicide.\n  A report in the New England Journal of Medicine stated that a young \nblack man living in Harlem is less likely to live until the age of 40 \nthan a young man in Bangladesh, perhaps the poorest country on Earth.\n  The roots of these pathologies are various. They are at least partly \ncultural, partly economic, and partly social. These challenges, these \nproblems, are about values. They are about knowing right from wrong. \nBut they also have something to do with hope and meaning. For too many \nof our inner city residents today, hope and meaning and opportunity, \nare unknown words of uncertain origins. Many people are born, live, and \ndie without ever knowing what it is like to have a job, to feed a \nfamily, and to fulfill their dreams.\n  In a number of the high schools in central cities, for example, the \ndropout rate rises as high as 80 percent. In 1990, 81 percent of young \nhigh school dropouts living in distressed urban areas were unemployed. \nIn that same year, more than 40 percent of all adult men in the \ndistressed inner cities of America did not work, while a significant \nnumber worked only sporadically or part time. Today, half of all \nresidents of distressed neighborhoods live below the federally defined \npoverty threshold. In 1993, that was $14,763 for a family of four.\n  Why do we have these problems in our inner cities? Well, as I have \nindicated, there are a variety of reasons. But I submit that one of the \nsignificant reasons for all of these facts is what I would call a \nregulatory redlining of our urban centers, a series of pervasive \nregulations promulgated by a variety of agencies that have literally \ndriven jobs from the center of America's urban environments. As a \nmatter of fact, the older the site is, the longer there has been \nindustry, the longer there has been manufacturing, and the longer there \nhas been industrial activity, the less likely the site is to qualify \nwith and escape from the kind of onerous regulations which drive away \njobs in those settings.\n  As well meaning as many regulations may have been, the reality is \nthat they have been incredibly destructive of opportunity in our inner \ncities.\n  Now, there is a great debate about regulation and the regulatory \nburden in America. But the people who live in our inner cities bear not \nonly their portion of the $600 billion in regulatory costs that are \nbuilt into our products, they also experience and sustain a cost of \nregulation which is substantially higher in many circumstances. It is a \ncost of lost opportunity. It is a cost of poor health. It is a cost of \nthe lack of personal security and safety. It is truly a major \nchallenge.\n  This last year, I had the opportunity to spend days during the year \nworking in different settings around the country. I was delighted to \nwork in one manufacturing concern in the city of St. Louis. It was \ncalled the Anpaul Window Co. They make windows for home construction, \nfor remodeling as well as new construction. It is a thriving business, \nabout 40 employees, one of those small business Horatio Alger stories \nthat inspire us all.\n  I noted when I went to spend my day there making windows with its \nwork force, that well over half the employees are minorities. It was a \ngood work force, very productive. The business was thriving. As a \nmatter of fact, it was growing. And it became clear that the success of \nthe business was going to be a part of its downfall, because they \nneeded to expand. And they could not expand on their site in St. Louis \nbecause of regulations. There were four EPA test wells around the \nfacility, and the owner said he would not take that facility on a bet. \nHe simply could not expand on that site.\n  So in order to expand--and I should also mention that the building \nhad been designated as historic and the doorways were not wide enough--\nthe owner of the business had to move from the city, in the urban \ncenter of St. Louis, where the challenges are strong and the \npathologies are very pervasive, where we have all the problems that \nattend the urban core of America's cities. And in order to grow and in \norder to be what they wanted the business to be, they had to move the \nbusiness to a suburban setting 50 miles from St. Louis.\n  I thought to myself, here is the Federal Government, which should be \nfinding a way for the people in the very heart of our cities, who have \nfamilies in need of the income and support, who have young minds that \nneed the example of working parents, who have the potential but do not \nhave the productivity, actually working against economic stability. And \nI thought the reason we do not have the productivity is too frequently \nthe onerous rules and regulations that have finally accumulated at the \ncore of our urban centers. Regulations that were designed to promote \nhealth and safety and well-being, have redlined development out of our \nurban centers and have sent development and jobs packing to the green \nfields of suburbia. They have left an empty, hollow core in the urban \ncenters of America and have defined a circumstance where 1 in 24 black \nmales will probably be shot at some time during his life, according to \nthe statistics we read.\n  I thought to myself, these are well-intentioned regulations, the \nregulations about cleanup and the fact that you should be able to eat \nthe dirt in order to avoid being poisoned by contamination. But the \ntruth of the matter is that the regulations in these older parts of \nMissouri's cities and of America's cities drive development out of the \nplace where we need development most.\n  They do so with very interesting and laudable concerns about the \nenvironment and about health and safety. But, frankly, the statistics \ntell us that the individuals who are poor and inhabitants of our urban \ncenters have a lot more to worry about in lead poisoning from a .38 \nthan they do from other contaminating sources. And the truth of the \nmatter is we have to find a way to bring jobs back into our cities. The \nrisks associated with unemployment are very substantial, they are much \ngreater than the risks associated with a door that may be 36 instead of \n38 inches wide, or do not comply with a particular statute. The risk of \nbeing shot in a drive-by shooting is much more pressing and demanding \nand challenging than the risk of being contaminated by dirt beneath the \nparking lot, especially dirt which was contaminated in some previous \nindustrial experiment.\n  Under the guise of noise abatement, we have merely exchanged the \nsounds of productivity for the sounds of silent factories. The crack of \ncocaine has been the sound of productivity in our cities' centers. The \nwail of a family in the wake of a siren, the echoing clang \n\n[[Page S 10129]]\nof a cell door--those are the sounds that have abated the noise of \nfactories, and I think we need to look carefully at what the \ncomparative risks are in these cases.\n  We literally have a substantial group of people in this country at \nthe core of our urban centers and in our cities, whose opportunities \nhave been diminished, whose safety has been impaired, whose health has \nbeen undermined, whose security has been threatened, and whose \nlongevity has been shortened because of well-meaning but misapplied \nregulations.\n  Our challenge is to find a way to make our urban centers places where \npeople can thrive again. But inappropriate, or excessive regulation, \nwithout understanding the real risks that exist in the center of our \ncities, make that a very serious challenge.\n  That is why I am going to be proposing an amendment to this \nRegulatory Reform Act which I will entitle ``The Urban Regulatory \nRelief Zone'' amendment. This amendment will provide an opportunity for \nthe mayor of a city, any city over 200,000, to appoint an Economic \nDevelopment Commission. This commission would have the chance to assess \nregulations which impair the health, safety, and well-being of the \ncitizens by keeping jobs out of the zone; and to weigh whether or not \nabatement and waiver of those regulations could give rise to an influx \nof opportunity which would provide an improvement in the health, an \nimprovement in the security, an improvement in the education, and an \nimprovement in the longevity of the individuals in that zone.\n  I very seriously hope that these commissions of economic development \nwould have a view toward mobilizing the resources, not just as it \nrelates to the Federal Government and Federal regulations, but as they \nwould relate to State and local regulations as well.\n  It is time for us to understand that regulations, sometimes \nmisapplied, have effectively redlined development out of our inner \ncities and subjected our inner-city population to a set of risks that \nare far greater than the risks which the regulations sought to abate. \nIt is time to empower cities to apply for such waivers. It is time to \nsay to the cities, ``We will let you help make a decision here about \nwhat the real well-being of your citizenry is.''\n  Then the commission would send that waiver application to the Federal \nGovernment and ask that the approval from an appropriate agency be made \nin order to protect the city from further harm. In my judgment, this is \na chance for us to change the way in which regulation has literally \ncreated a crisis, or participated in the creation of a crisis, at the \ncenter of American cities. We can no longer afford regulations which \nredline American cities away from development.\n  We have to give cities a chance to say to individuals: ``You can come \nin here, you don't have to be responsible for all the past sins of \nprior incarnations of industry here; you don't have to make sure the \ndirt under your parking lot could be eaten by an individual for his or \nher entire 70 years of existence. We want to have you here because we \nknow that an employed person is safer than an unemployed person; an \nemployed person, the statistics tell us, is healthier than an \nunemployed person; that employed people are far less likely to be \nkilled in drive-by shootings than unemployed individuals; that where \nthere is economic vitality and industry, there is a far greater chance \nthat the young people will persist in their education, avoiding the \ndropout situation; and that we will upgrade what happens in our very \ninner cities.''\n  I believe that it is time for us to look at those regulatory concerns \nas it relates to the well-being of the individuals in the areas in \nwhich those regulations are imposed. Where there are impositions of \nregulations which actually undermine the safety, undermine the \nsecurity, undermine the employability of individuals, where the \nimposition of a regulation does not enhance safety or security or \nhealth or well-being or longevity, it should be an option that the \nEconomic Development Commission of that particular urban center could \nsubmit an application to the Federal Government and say, ``Why don't we \nabate this particular requirement, because in so doing, it will elevate \nthe opportunity of our citizens to be productive, to be healthy, to be \nsecure and safe, to be examples in their community for the kind of \nindustry and productivity which will inspire young people to stay in \nschool and inspire individuals to have hope and to understand the \nmeaning which can change the destiny of the inner cities of America.''\n  Mr. President, I thank you for this opportunity. I look forward to \nsubmitting the urban regulatory relief zone amendment to this \nlegislation in the hours ahead, and I hope that we will have the good \njudgment to share with the people of the United States the opportunity \nto make sound decisions about improving the standing of those who are \nat peril in our inner cities, the core of our largest urban centers. \nAnd I hope that we will give them the opportunity to get relief when \nthat relief will increase their likelihood for safety, for health, for \nsecurity, for productivity and for longevity.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, we have talked about other costs, we have \ntalked about complexities, we have talked about the costs of business, \nwe have talked about costs of everything except costs to the Federal \nGovernment of this legislation. It seems to me that in any \nconsideration of this legislation, that has to be taken into account.\n  I do not know exactly what it will cost the taxpayers for the Dole-\nJohnston bill to be carried out by the agencies as it stands right now. \nBut I would like to read a letter to the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Hatch, from the Executive Office of the President, \nOffice of Management and Budget on July 7. It applies to the original \nDole bill. There have been some changes made since this letter was \nwritten, but I think the changes that were made make it even more \nexpensive. But I would like to read this letter in its entirety, \nbecause I think it is extremely important that everyone understand \nexactly what it is we are getting into.\n  Alice Rivlin, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, writes \nas follows:\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On April 26, 1995, the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee reported S. 343, the ``Comprehensive Regulatory \n     Reform Act of 1995,'' for floor consideration. The \n     Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill, if \n     enacted, would impose additional discretionary costs of at \n     least $180 million annually. We have worked over the last \n     several weeks with both the program and the budget offices of \n     agencies with major regulatory programs, in order to arrive \n     at our own estimate of the potential costs of the bill as \n     reported by the Judiciary Committee.\n       CBO indicated in its analysis that few of the agencies had \n     sufficient time to determine the additional costs that the \n     bill would impose. Further, it assumed that the sole feature \n     of S. 343 that would make issuing new regulations more costly \n     was the lowering of the threshold for cost-benefit analysis \n     to $50 million. Our request to the agencies, however, asked \n     them to consider not only the lowering of the threshold but \n     also the many additional analytic steps, such as risk \n     assessment and peer review, that S. 343 would require \n     agencies to undertake in situations where they are not now \n     carried out. In addition, our analysis, unlike CBO's, \n     contemplated the additional costs that S. 343 would impose, \n     both by significantly expanding existing litigation \n     opportunities and by substantially expanding the coverage and \n     the requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act. Our \n     analysis, unlike CBO's, also included the costs involved in \n     implementing the many new petition processes that S. 343 \n     would create for reviewing existing regulations.\n       Based on our more extensive analysis, we have arrived at a \n     cost figure that is significantly larger than CBO's. Our \n     preliminary estimate is that S. 343, as reported by the \n     Judiciary Committee, could impose discretionary costs of \n     approximately $1.3 billion annually and consume the time of \n     approximately 4,500 full-time employees. Although there have \n     been some modifications made to the bill since it was \n     reported by the Judiciary Committee, we believe this \n     information remains useful in light of CBO's estimate.\n       I hope this information is useful to you as S. 343 \n     approaches the floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Alice Rivlin,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S 10130]]\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On April 26, 1995, the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee reported S. 343, the ``Comprehensive Regulatory \n     Reform Act of 1995,'' for floor consideration.

Rivlin,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, let me further comment on this. In the bill \nas it originally came out, CBO estimated $180 million. OMB analyzes \nwhat would occur here with the additional petition processes and so on, \nand after canvassing some of the agencies, as Director Rivlin says, as \nmuch information as they could get, estimates that it would cost about \n$1.3 billion and with 4,500 full-time employees.\n  Let me point something out. Their analysis was based on the $50 \nmillion base, and since that time, the Nunn amendment, which was added \nto this, adds a substantial number of regulations that would have to be \nreviewed. In the original legislation that was addressed by Director \nRivlin, major rules would probably have been somewhere between 200 and \n500, something like that. We do not know exactly, of course.\n  Now, under Glenn-Chafee, the major rules are estimated to be between \n100 and 200. With the Nunn amendment addition, the estimate is to go up \nto between 500 and 800 rules that would have to be reviewed. The Rivlin \nestimate from CBO of $1.3 billion in annual costs and the time of \napproximately 4,500 full-time employees to comply with S. 343 was made \nbefore the Nunn amendment on small business was passed. So that at \nleast doubles the number of rules that would have to go back for \nreconsideration, with all the analysis that goes along with that.\n  I know that just the number of rules cannot be equated directly to a \nspecific budget figure. But I think it is fair to say that the cost of \nthe bill will be similar to the cost of the Dole bill, as it emerged \nfrom the Judiciary Committee, which is $1.3 billion. You have to add \nonto that the estimate of approximately doubling the number of rules \nand regulations that would have to be reviewed again, if you add the \nadditional requirement of review put forward by the Nunn amendment. I \nam not saying it would double that $1.3 billion, but it certainly it is \ngoing to add a considerable amount onto it. I think it would probably \nadd at least half to it. I do not base that on anything except to say \nthat if you double the number of rules, we should add another $400 or \n$500 million onto that $1.3 billion. It seems that would be logical.\n  The point I am making is that we do not get this for free. We want \nregulatory reform. But at the same time, a vote for the Dole-Johnston \nbill is a vote to spend a minimum of $1.3 billion, by OMB estimates, in \nadditional Government paperwork. What reform. That is not much of a \nreform, it seems to me.\n  So I think we have to think about this. We have not provided anywhere \nin this legislation for that $1.3 billion annually that would be \nrequired, nor for the 4,500 full-time employees. We are in the process, \nas a result of the President's national performance review, of reducing \nthe civil service rolls in this country, and doing pretty well with \nthat reduction, also. They are trying to cut down 272,000 civil service \npositions over a 4-year period. The last count I had, as of about 30 \ndays ago, we had actually reduced around 110,000 and are on schedule to \nprobably accomplish that full 272,900 reduction by the end of this \nyear. That comes at a time when, at least in these departments, we are \ngoing to have some 4,500 additional FTE's just to carry out the \nanalysis that would be required by the Dole-Johnston bill, at a cost of \nabout $1.3 billion, and that was before the Nunn amendment took the \nthreshold way down, and probably, as near as we can estimate, doubled \nthe number of reviews that would have to be made.\n  So I think, as we consider this, we want to consider whether we are \nalso going to up the appropriation, whether that would be required, \nwhether we are going to up the number of FTE's to do the job that would \nbe required on this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would just observe that the additional \ncost identified by the distinguished Senator from Ohio as applying to \nthe Dole amendment would also apply to the Glenn-Chafee amendment. My \nreason for stating that is that the threshold for a major rule in the \nDole-Johnston amendment has been increased to $100 million. That, of \ncourse, is exactly the same as the threshold for the Glenn-Chafee bill.\n  I also point out that there is no question, at least in my judgment, \nthat the Nunn-Coverdell amendment--the amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Democrat from Georgia--would also be offered to amend the \nGlenn-Chafee bill if it were believed that that legislation was going \nto successfully move forward.\n  So, in large part, either proposal will face some increased cost. As \nI say, in my judgment, it would be in somewhat the same ballpark. But I \nthink the important point to understand is the cost of the current \nregulatory maze of the private sector and local government. It is \nestimated that the current regulatory requirements cost this country \nsomething like $600 billion a year,\n a very substantial amount.\n\n  It is further estimated that this roughly breaks down to a cost of \n$6,000 per American family. Again, a very substantial cost to the \ntypical American family.\n  One of the goals of the legislation that we all on both sides of the \naisle are in support of in either amendment, agree that regulatory \nreform is critically important. One of the principal purposes of our \nlegislation is to get a better bang for the buck.\n  Hopefully, we can do even a better job in providing clean air and \nclean water, at a lesser cost, because of the regulatory reforms we are \nproposing.\n  While it may be there may be some additional cost on the Federal \nGovernment, that should be more than substantially offset by the \nbenefits and lesser costs that will be experienced by the private \nsector.\n  For that reason, while it is true that regulatory reform may result \nin some additional cost to the Federal Government, that is \nsubstantially true of both proposals, whether one is supporting the \nDole-Johnston amendment or the Glenn-Chafee.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the bill before \nthe Senate, S. 343, and the vote that will \n\n[[Page S 10131]]\noccur at 6 o'clock p.m., a little more than half an hour from now, \nasking that we invoke cloture on this bill.\n  Mr. President, the last week has seen an intensive debate and a very \nthorough debate on not just the bill but on the values and ideals and \nprocesses that underlie our whole regulatory process.\n  While I feel from my perspective that we have made some progress, at \nleast by my standards, have improved the bill, I intend to vote against \ncloture because I still believe that this bill, as amended, so \nfundamentally alters the regulatory process and increases the obstacles \nand hurdles within that process, that it does damage to the laws--the \npublic health, consumer protection, environmental protection laws--that \nunderlay those regulations.\n  Mr. President, this has been, I think, a very important debate in \nwhich, in general terms, all Members here in the Chamber have expressed \nour support of two basic goals. One is to acknowledge that the \nregulatory process in many ways has grown top heavy.\n  Senator Hatch has given the list of the bottom 10 regulations which \noften seem silly and off the mark. Senators Glenn and Kerry and others \nhave occasionally set the record straight on some of those bottom 10.\n  The underlying point of Senator Hatch's list, I think, is agreed to \nby everyone here, which is that in some sense our regulatory process \nhas become too complicated. It takes too long to render decisions. It \noften costs more than it should cost.\n  I think we also have another set of values that we share. This is \nwhere we part company. Some think the reforms of the regulatory process \nget in the way of the protective goals of the underlying environmental \nprotection, consumer protection, public health and safety laws that \ngenerate those regulations.\n  Remember, the regulations do not arise out of nowhere. They arise, \nfor the most part, out of laws that we adopt. We adopt those laws \nbecause we are responding to problems. We are, in the best exercise of \ngovernmental authority, making judgments about certain threats to the \nwell-being of people in this country that they cannot protect \nthemselves from.\n  In some measure, in our increasingly complicated world--much more \ncomplicated than when this country was founded--we have extended what \nwe lawyers like to call the police power of the State to encompass not \njust the traditional prohibitions of criminal acts and punishment for \ncommission of those acts, but to protect people from being assaulted, \nfor instance, by toxic chemicals in the air or in the water, substances \nthat, if you listen to the public health experts--and they are credible \nones--can do as much damage to people as criminals can.\n  So we have adopted this law to protect people, whether it was against \nfood poisoning or protecting children from iron toxicity, whether it is \nto ensure that mammography done in this country is safe and reliable, \nwhether it is to protect us against the now legendary cryptosporidium, \na microscopic parasite found in drinking water. This is why we adopt \nregulations. I hope this debate has reminded us of those underlying \npurposes.\n  It seems to me S. 343, as amended, continues to present serious \nobstacles to the realization of those protective goals. I must say \nthat, as I go around the State of Connecticut, I find that one of the \naspects of our Government that people I speak to most support, even \nthough they are upset about much else that we do here, is the work we \ndo to protect the environment, to conserve the great natural resources \nthat the good Lord has given this country and, in fact, this world, to \nprotect them from threats that they cannot see in the water they drink, \nin the food they eat.\n  They want us to continue to do this. And I am convinced that in the \nlayers of hurdles--in the petition process set up within S. 343, as \namended, in the decisional criteria, these four very high hurdles that \nregulations, protective regulations will have to jump over in order to \nstay valid, in the judicial review process, and so much else that is in \nthis bill--that though the bill has been improved, it still needs to be \nimproved more, or we will inadvertently, I believe--I hope \nunintentionally--have made it much more difficult for Government to \nprotect people from threats to their health and safety and well-being \nthat they cannot protect themselves from.\n  The best way to describe and explain all this is with concrete \nexamples, and let me give a few. The Clean Air Act requires that the \nstandards for air quality be set at a level to provide protection of \npublic health with an adequate margin of safety. I would guess, if we \nasked constituents in our district whether they want us, when it comes \nto protecting public health, their health, from pollution in the air--\nwhether they want us to do that with an adequate margin of safety, they \nwould say yes. Sure, people are cost conscious. Obviously, they are \ncost conscious. But when it comes to their health, their parents' \nhealth, their children's health, I think they would want us to err on \nthe side of that health, not on the side of the cost to the source of \nthe pollution.\n  Acting on guidance from Congress, the Environmental Protection Agency \nhas set the standards for air quality, public health, at levels which \nerr on the side of caution, at levels which do protect not just average \npeople but also sensitive subgroups of the public such as the elderly, \nwho are less able, because their bodies are older, to withstand \npollution in the air; persons who have more respiratory problems; or \nchildren; or such as subgroups in the population who already are ill \nfor one reason or another--they may have asthma, they may have heart \ndisease. They are particularly vulnerable to dirty, polluted, toxic \nair.\n  Although the statute on its face, the Clean Air Act, does not \nprohibit consideration of costs, EPA, for 25 years, has implemented the \nstatute based on health protection and health protection alone. And the \ncourts have upheld EPA's approach.\n  For example, one of the pollutants that EPA regulates is sulfur \ndioxide, which comes from coal-burning utilities and smelters \nprimarily. EPA long ago determined that its standard for sulfur dioxide \nemissions in the air should be set, not just to protect the average \ngroup of healthy Americans, but to protect asthmatics as well.\n  There has been a 40 percent increase in asthma in our country in the \nlast decade. That is a topic for another discussion as to why that has \nhappened. My internists at home in New Haven said to me that he sees \nwhat he is calling an epidemic of asthma, particularly among kids. The \nstandard EPA sets is at a level to protect asthmatics. The Clean Air \nAct requires that EPA periodically review this standard. And, under the \nbill before us, S. 343, as amended, industry--that is source of \npollution who feel they are adversely affected by this sulfur dioxide \nstandard--can petition to have the standard reviewed under the new \ndecisional criteria, those four high hurdles that I have talked about.\n  I respectfully suggest that the likely result, under this series of \ndecisional criteria, would be that despite the long history I have \ntalked about and the court decisions, EPA could no longer set the \nstandard for sulfur dioxide at the level to protect as much public \nhealth and as many people in our country, including those with asthma \nand respiratory problems, as they do now.\n  Instead, it would be required to look at the benefits from avoiding \nmedical treatment for asthmatics and weigh those against the compliance \ncosts imposed on the sources of the pollution, the smelters and other \nfacilities.\n  Inevitably, this will mean that the standard will not be set at a \nlevel that will protect the asthmatics who are protected now. And that \nis a lot of people. That is millions of people. It is our kids. It is \nour spouses. It is our parents. For the first time, the degree to which \nEPA is permitted to set these standards for air quality based on health \nprotection would be compromised. And even if EPA could avoid this \nstrict cost-benefit weighing part of the test that I have just \ndescribed, one of the other sections of the decisional criteria is the \nleast-cost section, which says that you have to do what you are \nsupposed to do at the least cost possible, would require a weighing of \ncosts which, again, would compromise the health-based standard but, \nmore to the point, compromise the health of a lot of people in this \ncountry. \n\n[[Page S 10132]]\n\n  Finally, because I see other colleagues on the floor, let me give a \nspecific example of why the second decisional criteria, the least-cost \nalternative, could significantly reduce protection of public health and \nthe environment.\n  In 1991 EPA conducted a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of \noptions for the rule it was issuing that dealt with lead in drinking \nwater--lead in drinking water. When you open the tap and drink the \nwater, what about the lead in it? Several options had been suggested \nranging from simply telling people to run their water before drinking \nit, which reduces the problem in some but not all cases, and depends on \nassuring that, for instance, children and others will run the water for \na couple of minutes before drinking.\n  Mr. President, I do not know about your kids--they are younger than \nmine--but I do not think mine will run a tap for a few minutes before \ndrinking.\n  Other alternatives for dealing with lead in water, drinking water, \nwould require universal use of a corrosion-inhibiting chemical and the \nreplacement of all lead-contaminated pipes or setting an ``at-the-tap'' \nstandard for lead. So there were three or four alternatives available \nto EPA for dealing with this problem, the real public health problem of \nlead in drinking water.\n  EPA conducted a detailed cost-benefit analysis for three alternative \nrules, all of which had benefits greater than costs. EPA chose the \nmiddle-of-the-road option, requiring some but not all water utilities, \nwater companies, to use a corrosion-inhibiting chemical and requiring \nreplacement of the worst lead pipes, but over a 22-year schedule to \nphase it in.\n  It is very likely that under S. 343, if it is adopted as amended, the \nleast-cost alternative would have been to issue a much more limited \nchemical treatment rule.\n  Under the alternative selected by EPA, the benefits have been \nenormous. For a little more expenditure, we have received and obtained \nmuch greater health benefits, assuring, according to public health \nexperts, that thousands of children would not have elevated blood lead \nlevels and others with vulnerability to lead because of heart \nconditions would be saved, quite literally, from heart attacks.\n  That EPA middle of the road rule had far, far greater benefits than \nthe least-cost alternative that would be driven by S. 343, as amended, \nin terms of public health--and that means children have higher blood \nlead levels, they lower IQ's. It is pretty hard to calculate the cost \nof that, but in my opinion it is incalculable.\n  EPA would simply not have been able to adopt the sensible midcourse \nalternative it selected if we adopted the bill as amended. That would \nnot have made good common sense and obviously it would not have made \ngood public health.\n  Mr. President, I see other colleagues on the floor. I will yield the \nfloor. But to say again what I said, at the beginning, we have made \nsome progress on this bill. But there is a way to go before we \naccomplish both real regulatory reform and cut down the red tape, which \nall of us want to do, and the Glenn-Chafee bill does very sensibly. But \nwhat we have not done yet is assure that the public health, \nenvironmental protection, and consumer protection, which generated the \nadoption of the laws that gave birth to these regulations, are going to \ncontinue to be adequately protected. And until that is so, I will vote \nas I will in a short while against cloture on this bill.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Rhode Island wants \nto go forward for a few minutes. I ask unanimous consent that he \nproceed for 4 minutes, and that I then be recognized for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Thank you. I want to thank the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts for permitting me to go for 2 minutes.\n  I would like to make a couple of points. One of the major objections \nto the Johnston bill is the so-called judicial review. We have dealt \nwith the language of the Johnston bill and judicial review before. What \nis the language that is so objectionable? It is in section F. It says, \n``The reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action \nfindings or conclusions found to be without substantial support in the \nrulemaking file viewed as a whole.''\n  That is complicated. But it is a very high standard to meet. It is \nvery, very difficult. And what it means for those who are implementing \nthe rule--any of the agencies, whether it is EPA or whatever it is--it \nis very hard for them to have a rule that cannot be thrown out by the \ncourts under this definition. We have done this before.\n  In 1982, Senator Bumpers had an amendment that came out of the \ncommittee when we were doing regulatory reform in that year, which had \nexactly the same language that we--I and others on this side--are \nobjecting to, and that Senator Hatch and others put into this bill.\n  So we had a Republican administration. We had a Republican Senate, \nand that group--the administration and the Republican Senate--\nvigorously objected to the language that was in that bill, the so-\ncalled ``Bumpers language,'' which is exactly the same as the Hatch \nlanguage today.\n  So Senator Bumpers came up with an amendment. He changed that \nobjectionable language. And the Vice President of the United States, on \nFebruary 23, 1982, George Bush, wrote the letter.\n\n       Dear Dale: We have received your proposed amendments to S. \n     1080 and the explanation of those amendments. We believe that \n     these changes, as explained by what would be legislative \n     history, are significant improvements.\n\n  On and on he goes.\n  So the language that I am objecting to, and others who will not \nsupport cloture tonight, is the exact same language that a Republican \nadministration, that a Republican Senate, objected to in 1982. It was \nobjectionable then, it is just as objectionable now.\n  I do hope that cloture will not prevail.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a request?\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield for a request.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts that I be permitted to speak a \nfew words on this before cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GLENN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, would we \nstill have the vote at 6 o'clock?\n  Mr. HATCH. Oh, yes.\n  Mr. GLENN. We have both leaders who wish to speak.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right. I will be short. We want to allow enough \ntime for both Senators to have a few remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague from Rhode \nIsland for his comments, and also the Senator from Connecticut, who in \na detailed fashion has summarized why this bill is not prepared to be \npassed on by the Senate, and why colleagues sought to oppose cloture at \nthis point.\n  Mr. President, this bill flies directly contrary in its current form \nto the principles espoused by Philip Howard in ``The Death of Common \nSense,'' and to the whole concept of reform. Reform is supposed to \ncreate simplicity. It is supposed to create fairness. It is supposed to \nreduce the paperwork and reduce the opportunities for litigation.\n  This bill in its current form is a lawyer's and an accountant's \ndream.\n  Mr. President, here is list of 88 new opportunities for litigation in \nthe Dole-Johnston bill before us. This bill is supposed to simplify. We \nkeep hearing in the U.S. Senate about how there is too much litigation. \nHowever, there is no such opportunity for litigation in the current law \nfor these items. But under this bill, here are the opportunities for \nlitigation--88 new opportunities--for lawyers to dream up ways they can \ncome into court. This is not speculative. This is by the very language \nwritten in this bill.\n  For instance, section 622, (c)(2)(C)(1), ``Did the agency adequately \nidentify alternatives that require no government acts?''\n\n[[Page S 10133]]\n\n  If somebody wants to sue suggesting that they did not, all they have \nto do is make the claim, come into court, and that review will take \nplace.\n  ``Did the agency adequately describe attempts to verify quality, \nreliability and relevance of science?'' Section 622, (d)(2)(A)?\n  I can go through the entire bill where, because they are opening up \nprocedure to review--not just substance but procedure--you are going to \ntie up an agency in court.\n  Mr. President, they will come back and say, ``No, no, no, we do not \nwant the procedure to be reviewed.'' And they will suggest that there \nis language here that precludes that.\n  I respectfully say that is not the case; there is sufficient \nambiguity that lawyer-legislators on both sides are arguing about it. \nAnd the question is, therefore, if their intent is not to create that \navenue of judicial review, if their intent is to do as they say, to \npreclude it, then why do we not make it clear in this legislation? \nEvery attempt to try to make it clear has been rebuffed.\n  So I respectfully suggest that, just as in the area of least cost \nalternative where they suggest that there is not a rigid rule \nprecluding judgment and discretion by the agency head, there will be \nsort of discretion. We are saying no. The language of this bill \nprovides a rigidity, and we do not want that rigidity in this \nparticular legislation.\n   In addition, I would like to point out that in today's Washington \nPost, there was an article that talked about being buried by paperwork. \nIt had the amounts of money, and how the regulatory paper trail leads \nnowhere. But interestingly enough, almost every dollar in this article \nwas in the SEC and the IRS, both of which are exempted under the Dole-\nJohnston bill.\n  So the very place where you find the problem, they have exempted it. \nThen they come in and say, well, there is $500 billion worth of cost to \nour economy. Yet the GAO has shown that study is totally faulty, that \nin point of fact there is only about $225 billion total cost to a $1.6 \ntrillion economy. All the additional costs that they throw into their \npot are costs that are related to what we call transfer payments and \nprocess costs that have nothing to do with the regulatory process \nitself.\n  So, Mr. President, if we want to simplify, which we do, you have an \nalternative. It is the Glenn-Chafee, or Chafee-Glenn bill. It is \nsimilar to a bill that came out of committee 15 to nothing in a \nbipartisan form. That is a bill which has review. It is a bill which \nhas a cost-benefit analysis. It is a bill that has risk assessment. But \nit does not create a rigid rule that denies discretion or judgment to \nthe agency heads who deal with these issues.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield at that point?\n  Mr. KERRY. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Is the Senator aware that the original Roth bill that \ncame out of committee unanimously, as the Senator says, required a \nreview of rules?\n  Mr. KERRY. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. This is the exception. There is no rule that needs to \nbe reviewed, unless the agency head wishes to in his sole discretion, \nand that is not reviewable.\n  Mr. KERRY. The Senator is not only aware of it, but that is the \nstandard which we would embrace in this bill. But because of the \njudicial review standard that the Senator from Louisiana is pressing \nand because of the petition process which the Senator from Louisiana is \npressing, we totally inundate the agencies.\n  What is going to happen here, Mr. President, is that a process that \nis supposed to simplify is going to swamp the agencies. The EPA \ncurrently has a very clear graph that shows how many hours go into \nrulemaking from business. Business currently spends about 70,000 hours \nputting together the reports for the process of rulemaking. Under this \nprocess, you are going to triple or quadruple the amount of industry \ninput. You are going to at least double the governmental input, and \nthere will be no commensurate increase in resources or budget.\n  The effect will be they will be swamped, because there is a clever \nlittle clause in here that says if you do not get your review done in 3 \nyears, we are going to throw the rule out. So first they swamp the \nagency. Then they provide a whole bunch of opportunities for \nlitigation. And they say if you have not performed your responsibility \nwithin that span of time, which is impossible, we throw the rule out \nanyway. That is stripping America of 25 years of effort to try to have \na reasonable process of regulation.\n  I wish to give all colleagues time here, but I just say, Mr. \nPresident, I am prepared to vote for a reasonable reform bill that has \na reasonable judicial review standard, a reasonable cost-benefit \nanalysis and risk-assessment approach, but that does not tie the \nGovernment in knots and that does not take the current 1-page \nAdministrative Procedure Act approach to rulemaking and add an \nadditional 64 new pages from the Dole-Johnston bill.\n  That is not simplification. That is not reform. That is an \nopportunity for lawyers to have a field day in court and to prevent us \nfrom ever having a rule that addresses the public safety and health \nneeds and environmental needs of this country.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, what 343 requires is that when there is a \nmajor rule, if there is going to be litigation, it has to be the whole \nrule. It cannot be nit-picked to death as has been suggested under the \nlanguage there. And every major rule is litigated now. So there is \nnothing to those arguments that have been argued here.\n  With regard to what Senator Chafee said, Senator Johnston does, \nindeed, amend section 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act to apply \nthe ``substantial evidence test'' to informal--notice and comment--\nrulemaking.\n  I wish to point out that this test is hardly novel. It has been \ncodified in the Administrative Procedure Act for almost 50 years--\nsection 706(2)(E)--as the standard to apply in adjudicatory \nrulemakings.\n  Moreover, Congress has in specific statutes required the substantial \nevidence test for informal rulemakings since the late 1960's. Just some \nexamples include the Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1970 and the \nMagnuson-Moss FTC Improvement Act of 1975.\n  In 1981, the Administrative Conference of the United States \nrecommended that section 706 of the APA be amended to include a \nsubstantial evidence test for informal rulemakings. That was \nrecommendation No. 81-2. The Administrative Law Section of the American \nBar Association made a similar recommendation in 1986.\n  Also, in 1981, the Senate approved the Bumpers amendment to S. 1080, \nthe precursor to present S. 343 that passed the Senate 94 to 0 in 1982. \nThat amendment's language applying the substantial evidence test to \ninformal rulemakings is virtually similar to the language of Dole-\nJohnston. I might add that the American Bar Association strongly \nrecommended including the substantial evidence test for informal \nrulemakings in S. 343.\n  The substantial evidence test is the appropriate standard for \njudicial review when examining whether the factual basis of the rule \njustifies the rulemaking. Contrary to assertions made by some of my \ncolleagues, the substantial evidence test is not so stringent as to \nimpede the implementation of rules.\n  It is now recognized that the substantial evidence test is the \nfunctional equivalent of the standard arbitrary and capricious test. \nIndeed, a number of courts and legal commentators have concluded that, \nwhen applied to court review of factual conclusions made by agencies, \nthe distinction between the substantial evidence test and the arbitrary \nand capricious standard is largely semantic.--Association of Data \nProcessing Service Organizations v. Board of Governors, 745 F.2d 677, \n684 (1984) (and cases cited therein).\n  Nonetheless, adoption of this test is important because it is the \nappropriate standard for courts to employ when reviewing factual \ndeterminations. In other words, the substantial evidence standard aids \nthe court in determining whether an agency abused its discretion in \npromulgating a rule.\n  I notice the distinguished majority leader is here.\n  Mr. President, just let me say this. Despite all of the hysterical \nrhetoric \n\n[[Page S 10134]]\nthat we have heard on this bill, this bill is simply a commonsense \nbill. It is a reasonable effort to rationalize the regulatory process. \nMeaningful regulations in the areas of health, safety, and environment \nare important and necessary. This bill does nothing to repeal or change \nneeded and reasonable regulations. All this bill does is require a \nreasonable process whereby we ensure that the benefits from these \nregulations justify the costs. We have a Government out of control. \nThis is a modest attempt to try to get it back into control, and I hope \neverybody will vote for cloture on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know that we are about ready to cast \nthe vote. I will be very brief.\n  As we have said over and over throughout the debate today and over \nthe course of the last several days, the fact is that there has been a \nvery good debate about a number of extraordinarily complex issues, \nissues that ought to be aired, issues that ought to be raised in the \ncontext of both regulatory reform and public safety.\n  We have done that. We have offered amendments. We have had a good \ndebate. There have been very few quorum calls. There is no filibuster. \nI hope all colleagues consider this vote very carefully and vote \nagainst cloture this afternoon.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that 38 amendments, so far, have been \noffered--38 amendments over the last 7 days or so. Of the 38 amendments \nthat were offered, 24 of those amendments were offered by proponents--\n24 of them. Only 14 of the 38 amendments which have been offered have \nbeen offered by those who are not supporters of the legislation. Of \nthose, 7 were adopted, 3 were rejected by a 2-vote margin, 2 were \nwithdrawn, 1 was the only one to lose by more than 10 votes, and 1 is \npending right now, the Glenn-Chafee substitute.\n  So if you take the substitute away, 13 amendments are all the \namendments that have been offered on our side to date. And of those, \nvery few were rejected--in fact, only one was rejected--by more than 10 \nvotes.\n  I think the point of all this is very clear. We are making a good-\nfaith effort to try to work through this issue in a meaningful way. \nEven if the substitute is declared germane, as I understand it has \nbeen, there are a number of additional relevant amendments, amendments \nthat we have been waiting to offer, amendments that we hope to be able \nto propose at some point in the not-too-distant future, most likely \neven with time agreements. We are willing to do that, but if we are \ngoing to be able to offer those amendments, invoking cloture now would \npreclude a lot of Members from having the right to do so.\n  So I urge our colleagues to oppose cloture, recognize that we are not \nfilibustering, we are not extending debate unnecessarily, recognize \nthat the amendments that have been offered in large measure have been \noffered by those on the other side, and recognize as well that as \ncomplicated as this is, it is imperative we continue to try to work \nthrough the bill, as difficult as it may be.\n  I believe we can do it. I am still optimistic that we can accommodate \nall Senators in trying to achieve our objective of reaching some \nultimate compromise on this legislation and vote in a bipartisan \nmanner. But we cannot do that today; we cannot do that by cutting off \ndebate. We cannot do that by precluding Senators' rights to offer \namendments as they have been doing now for about a week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, tonight we take the first step toward \nbringing this important debate to a close.\n  Despite all the horror stories, despite all the distortions, despite \nthe desperate attempts to shift the focus of this debate, I want to \nmake very clear that I intend to fulfill the mandate given to us by the \nAmerican people--and bring some common sense to the regulatory process \nand get the Government off our backs.\n  On one side of this debate stand the defenders of the status quo. \nRegulatory reform is a direct threat to their smug assumption that \nWashington knows best and that it cannot do any better. The defenders \nof the status quo can only win by delay and distortion.\n  On the other side of this debate stand those Senators--and I must \npoint out that we have Republicans and Democrats--who understand that \nwe have to provide relief to American families and small businesses who \nbear the burden of overregulation. We understand we can do so in ways \nthat protect health and safety.\n  Though I do not really expect to close off debate tonight, it is \nimportant to understand that we intend to win, and that it is our \nobligation to pass meaningful regulatory relief, not just some watered \ndown version that accomplishes nothing.\n  Therefore, if cloture is not invoked tonight, we will vote again on \ncloture tomorrow. And if we do not succeed at that time, we will vote \nagain to close debate on Wednesday.\n  The issues at stake are too important. Unfortunately, those issues \nhave often been obscured by those like Ralph Nader and President \nClinton who repeatedly make basic factual errors about this bill.\n  The reality is not so hard to understand:\n  This bill has been amended over 100 times, incorporating comments and \nsuggestions from the Clinton administration and Democrat and Republican \nMembers;\n  This bill largely codifies President Clinton's Executive order on the \nregulatory process;\n  This bill incorporates whole sections of S. 1080, a bill passed \nunanimously in the Senate in 1982;\n  And perhaps most important, this bill includes close to 20 different \nprotections for health, safety, and the environment.\n  These are the facts. Those facts--as opposed to the twisted version \nreported by the media--suggest that those who oppose our reforms have \nsome explaining to do. Those who seek to stall reform will have to \nanswer to the American people.\n  And in the end, I am confident that we can pass this bill with broad \nbipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, I would be very willing to sit down with the \nDemocratic leader and figure out how we could bring this matter to a \nconclusion tomorrow or even on Wednesday. But this is the seventh or \neighth day we have been on this bill. It is a very important bill. Many \nof the amendments offered by proponents were in response to requests \nfrom those who opposed the bill--this would make it better, this is a \ncompromise, work it out. There have been a number of amendments. In \nfact, we took a major amendment of the Senator from Ohio, who was \nprepared to debate it for 2 hours. We said we will take it. It is the \nsunshine amendment, a major amendment.\n  We have taken a number of amendments. We have addressed the 180 days \nproblem. We have addressed a number of major problems, as I understand \nit.\n  So now there are 267 amendments pending at the desk, first- and \nsecond-degree amendments--267 or 260-some. How do you finish a bill \nwith that many amendments? In fact, it is worse than the tax bill where \nsometimes you have 80 or 100 amendments. And I must say some of those \namendments are on this side so they are not just coming from that side. \nI do not want to leave that impression. Most are coming from that side \nbut some are coming from this side.\n  We thought last week, or last Thursday or Friday, according to our \nlist--not everybody would tell us what their amendments were--there \nwere probably two or three on this side and five or six on the other \nside, including the major substitute which we are on right now.\n  I do not want to shut off anybody. If we cannot get cloture, we \ncannot get cloture, we will not have regulatory reform. That is not a \nthreat, but if you just take out the calendar--there are already people \ncomplaining about not getting a full August recess and there are \nprobably going to be more and more complaints as we get closer to \nAugust 4. I would like to accommodate most people to get out at least a \npart of August. But if we want to spend more time on this bill than we \nshould, do not be coming around to the majority leader saying, ``Oh, \nyou can't take away our August recess.''\n  I do not want to take away anything. I have a lot of places I can go \nin August, would like to go in August, other than Iowa and New \nHampshire.\n  [Laughter.] \n\n[[Page S 10135]]\n\n  We are not going to get cloture. We have four or five absentees. We \nhave two or three who have not seen the light on this side yet, maybe \nfour. But despite all the horror stories, despite all the distortions \nand despite the desperate attempt to shift the focus of this debate--in \nfact, the President said on Saturday on the radio show if you adopt \nthis bill, there are going to be more air crashes. And this is the same \nPresident a week ago who said we should be more civil, we should not \nmake statements like this, we should treat everybody with civility. And \nhe charges Republicans, on a bill like this, with air crashes, dirty \nmeat, dirty water, dirty air, two or three other things. He did not \nhave much time on the air. He mentioned three or four ridiculous, \nludicrous, exaggerated statements like that.\n  We think we have made a lot of progress. We think this is a \nbipartisan effort. If I have missed something somewhere along the line, \nthen I think we should try to address it. I am willing at any time to \nset down a schedule of amendments to finish this bill. I am ready to \nvote tomorrow morning, tomorrow noon on the big substitute. Maybe that \nis one way. Once we determine how that is going to come out, maybe that \nwill move the debate.\n  I think we may as well vote. We do not have the votes. Those who are \nnot ready for regulatory reform will vote ``no.'' Those who are will \nvote ``aye.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/17/senate-section/article/S10086-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Had Senator Pressler been here \nfor the vote, he would have voted to invoke cloture.\n  (At the request of Mr. Dole, the following statements were ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n\n                         explanation of absence\n\n Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent during \nrollcall vote No. 309 on the motion to invoke cloture on the Dole-\nJohnston substitute amendment to S. 343, the comprehensive regulatory \nreform bill. Had I been present for the vote, I would have voted in the \naffirmative.\n  I was unable to be here for the vote due to a number of travel \nproblems that occurred on my flights from Sioux Falls to Washington, \nDC. Specifically, the aircraft that was to have taken me from Sioux \nFalls to Minneapolis was kept on the ground due to mechanical problems. \nThe delay, in fact, forced me to take a later flight on another plane. \nI was further delayed at Minneapolis due to weather surveillance. I \nregret this series of flight delays prevented me from being present \nduring the cloture vote earlier this evening.\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to explain my \nabsence from the floor during Senate vote No. 309 to invoke cloture on \nS. 343. I was necessarily detained on my return flight to Washington, \nDC, due to severe weather conditions causing flight delays. Had I been \npresent for vote No. 309, I would have voted ``aye.''\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of Majority \nLeader Dole's regulatory reform package, I am delighted to have this \nopportunity to discuss the many benefits to be gained from its \nenactment. For perhaps the first time, we are confronting the \nastoundingly sensible idea that the regulations we impose at the \nFederal level should reflect risk-assessment and cost-benefit analyses. \nThese important tools will ensure that limited dollars are spent on \nsolving our most serious problems and in turn will return the greatest \nresults.\n  Throughout this debate, we have been treated to a barrage of rhetoric \nfrom naysayers, the opponents of common-sense regulating. Those in \nfavor of realistic balance have been portrayed as coldhearted \ncalculators determined to destroy the environment, eradicate the safe \nworkplace, and jeopardize the health of every American.\n  Mr. President, that simply is not true.\n  Regulations imposed by the Federal Government should bear a direct \nrelationship to the potential risk to public health, safety, and the \nenvironment. They should also reflect a significant benefit for the \ncosts incurred.\n  Those dual considerations form the centerpiece of the Dole-Johnson \nsubstitute.\n  The measure directs Federal agencies to conduct a cost-benefit \nanalysis for major regulations, defined as having a gross annual \neconomic impact of $50 million in reasonably quantifiable direct and \nindirect costs. Where appropriate, standardized risk assessments \nreflecting the best available science also would be conducted, with \npublic participation and peer review. Since many speakers have preceded \nme, I will not belabor the specific provisions of this package.\n  Earlier this year, the Environment and Public Works Committee, on \nwhich I have served for 9 years, held a hearing on the impact of \nregulatory reform \n\n[[Page S 10136]]\nproposals on environmental and other statutes. That hearing confirmed a \nglaring certainty: Federal agencies are not using the discretion at \ntheir disposal to adequately consider or appropriately weigh costs and \nbenefits. Burdensome Government regulations are imposing significant \ncosts on our national economy, our productivity, and our ability to \ncompete in the global marketplace. To reverse that trend, we must \ninclude cost-containment features and regulatory impact analyses \nwhenever any new Federal regulation is considered. Agencies should be \nrequired to include sound science before they promulgate rules and \nregulations anew; the public should be allowed to petition for the \nreview of risk assessments made by agencies.\n  Mr. President, less regulation will not result in less protection for \nthe public if our dollars are used efficiently. On the contrary, the \nnet effect of using sound science and real risk assessment to \nprioritize regulations would be more real protection. Best of all, that \nenhanced protection of health and safety would be cost-effective.\n  We are all aware that life will always involve some risk--we cannot \nand should not attempt to protect everyone from every possible degree \nof risk. Instead, we must prioritize on the basis of definitive risk \nfactors. Each rule must be carefully scrutinized; choices must be based \non relative risks and associated costs.\n  My interest in regulatory reform has been honed further by my \nmembership on another committee--Agriculture.\n  I am deeply concerned with the economic health of the agriculture \ncommunity, especially that of the family farmer. One of the most \ndebated issues concerning agriculture and agricultural chemicals today \nis the so-called Delaney clause. Under its restrictions, pesticide \nresidues found in processed foods are considered food additives. The \nDelaney clause prohibits the inclusion of any chemicals or additives in \nprocessed foods, including pesticides and inert ingredients, which have \nbeen found to be carcinogenic in humans or animals.\n  Ironically, the very good intention of the Delaney clause--to protect \nconsumers from unsafe exposure to chemicals which might induce cancer--\nis being subverted. Technological advances which make it possible to \ndetect trace compounds in parts per trillion and greater have made the \nzero risk standard of the Delaney clause unreasonable. The very \nscientific advancements which should be enhancing consumer safety are \ninstead hindering. It would be far more reasonable to institute a \nnegligible risk standard. For carcinogens, such a standard would \nrepresent an upper-bound risk of 1 in 1 million over a lifetime, \ncalculated using conservative risk assessment methods. Again, we are \ntalking about a matter of sensible risk assessment.\n  Mr. President, listening to this debate, I have had to ask myself why \nanyone would not want to see beneficial rules and regulations, which \nprotect from real risk while outweighing their costs. At a time when \nbudgetary constraints are a serious priority, we should--we must--spend \nthose scarce dollars wisely. Regulations associated with high levels of \nrisk undoubtedly may be expensive to comply with, but if they are \ndeemed necessary to protect the national health, safety, and the \nenvironment, the compliance costs will be money well spent.\n  However, excessive rules and regulations associated with minimal \npublic risk amounts to hunting fleas with an elephant gun. It is \nneither fair nor reasonable to ask the taxpayers to bear such expense.\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I hope we can now agree on a time to vote on \nthe substitute. We have had a lot of debate on the substitute. I hope \nwe can reach an agreement before we depart, with the managers, on when \nwe can vote on the Glenn substitute--hopefully tomorrow morning or by \nnoon tomorrow.\n  There will be no more votes tonight. I think the first thing we want \nto do is have a vote on the substitute and perhaps we can reach some \nagreement on that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that I may have a few moments to \nspeak as in morning business to introduce a bill and make a few \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Stevens pertaining to the introduction of S. 1043 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/17/senate-section/article/S10135-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          U.S. POSTAL SERVICE\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there has been much discussion lately \nabout the future of the U.S. Postal Service. Should the Postal Service \nbe freed from current statutory restrictions in order to become more \ncompetitive? Should the Postal Service be privatized?\n  Many observers believe there are problems which need to be resolved \nin order for the Postal Service to continue into the next century. \nUnfortunately, there is not a consensus on the solutions to the \nproblems--and, indeed, not everyone agrees that there are problems \nwhich require changes in current law.\n  As part of the ongoing review of the Postal Service, I received a \npaper written by Murray Comarow. Mr. Comarow served as the Executive \nDirector of President Johnson's Commission on Postal Reorganization in \nthe late 1960's and was a Senior Assistant Postmaster General.\n  In the paper he urges the appointment of a nonpartisan commission to \nanalyze the root causes of the Postal Service's problems and recommend \nchanges. He suggests that perhaps the Postal Rate Commission and the \nrequirement for binding arbitration with employee unions be eliminated, \nand that the Postal Service should have the ability to close small, \nunprofitable post offices if service could be maintained through other \nmeans such as leasing space in local businesses.\n  In addition, Mr. Comarow observes that the monopoly on first-class \nletters as well as universal service at a uniform price should be \nmaintained. However, the Postal Service should be able to compete for \nlarge contracts and offer experimental services, and he does not \nbelieve that employees should be given the right to strike--a right not \npossessed by any other Federal employees.\n  Mr. President, I do not here pass judgment on the conclusions reached \nby Mr. Comarow, but he provides an historical reference and raises some \nissues which ought to be considered during any debate on the future of \nthe Postal Service. In the interest of reducing costs, I will not ask \nunanimous consent that the text of Mr. Comarow's paper be reprinted in \nthe Congressional Record. Copies of the complete paper can be obtained \nby contacting Mr. Comarow directly at 4990 Sentinel Drive, No. 203, \nBethesda, MD, 20816-3582.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Again, Mr. President, I do not think the Senate is in \norder for my friend to speak, any more than it was when I was speaking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senate will come \nto order.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/17/senate-section/article/S10136-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10136-S10137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           HEMOPHILIA AND HIV\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the Institute of Medicine--or IOM--last \nThursday released the findings of a major investigation into how \nAmerica's hemophilia community came to be decimated by the HIV virus. \nIt is a very sad and compelling story.\n  In the early 1980's, America's blood supply was contaminated with \nHIV. Many Americans have become HIV-positive by transfusions of the \nHIV-tainted blood.\n  One particular group of Americans has been extremely hard-hit by this \n\n\n[[Page S 10137]]\npublic health disaster. There are approximately 16,000 Americans who \nrequire lifelong treatment for hemophilia, a genetic condition that \nimpairs the ability of blood to clot effectively.\n  In the early 1980s, more than 90 percent of the Americans suffering \nfrom severe hemophilia were infected by the HIV virus--more than 90 \npercent, an absolutely unbelievable figure.\n  That is a major human tragedy. I believe we should look to the IOM \nreport released last Thursday for answers as to the level of Federal \nGovernment culpability for this disaster.\n  Last Wednesday, on this floor, I discussed three questions that I \nbelieved were going to be addressed in the IOM report.\n  First, did the Federal agencies responsible for blood safety show the \nappropriate level of diligence in screening the blood supply?\n  Second, did the Federal agencies move as quickly as they should have \nto approve blood products that were potentially safer?\n  Third, did the Federal Government warn the hemophilia community, when \nthe Government knew--or should have known--that there were legitimate \nconcerns that the blood supply might not be safe?\n  Mr. President, if the answer to any of these three key questions is \nno, it seems to me it should be clear that the Federal Government had \nnot met its responsibilities in this area. As a result, the Federal \nGovernment would have a clear duty to provide some measure of relief to \nthe people with hemophilia who have been infected with the HIV virus.\n  Mr. President, today the report is in.\n  The answer to each of these questions is, in fact, no.\n  Question 1. Did the Federal agencies responsible for blood safety \nshow the appropriate level of diligence in screening the blood supply? \nThe report's answer is ``No.''\n  In January 1983, scientists from the Centers for Disease Control \nrecommended that blood banks use donor screening and deferral to \nprotect the blood supply. According to this report, ``it was \nreasonable''--based on the scientific evidence available in January \n1983--``to require blood banks to implement these two screening \nprocedures.''\n  The report says that ``federal authorities consistently chose the \nleast aggressive option that was justifiable'' on donor screening and \ndeferral.\n  The report's conclusion is:\n\n       The FDA's failure to require this is evidence that the \n     agency did not adequately use its regulatory authority and \n     therefore missed opportunities to protect the public \n     health.''\n\n  By January 1983, epidemiological studies by the Centers for Disease \nControl strongly suggested that blood products transmitted HIV. First \nof all, it was becoming clear that blood recipients were getting AIDS--\neven though the recipients were not members of a known high-risk group. \nSecond, the epidemiological pattern of AIDS was similar to that of \nanother blood-borne disease--hepatitis.\n  According to the report, these two facts should have been enough of a \ntip-off to the public health authorities. As early as December 1982, \nthe report says,\n\n       (p)lasma collection agencies had begun screening potential \n     donors and excluding those in any of the known risk groups.\n\n  The report says that Federal authorities should have required blood \nbanks to do the same.\n  Question 2: Did the Federal agencies move as quickly as they should \nhave to approve blood products that were potentially safer? Again, the \nreport's answer is ``No.''\n  The report says that certain heat treatment processes--processes that \ncould have prevented many cases of AIDS in the hemophilia community--\ncould have been developed earlier than 1980.\n\n       In the interval between the decisions of early 1983 and the \n     availability of a blood test for HIV in 1985, public health \n     and blood industry officials became more certain that AIDS \n     among hemophiliacs and transfused patients grew. As their \n     knowledge grew, these officials had to decide about recall of \n     contaminated blood products and possible implementation of a \n     surrogate test for HIV. Meetings of the FDA's Blood Product \n     Advisory Committee in January, February, July and December \n     1993 offered major opportunities to discuss, consider, and \n     reconsider the limited tenor of the policies.\n\n  I say again, Mr. President: ``Major opportunities,'' major \nopportunities to change the course of the government's blood-protection \npolicies.\n  The report continues:\n\n       For a variety of reasons, neither physicians . . . nor the \n     Public Health Service agencies actively encouraged the plasma \n     fractionation companies to develop heat treatment measures \n     earlier.\n       Despite these opportunities and others to review new \n     evidence and to reconsider earlier decisions, blood safety \n     policies changed very little during 1983.\n\n  Mr. President, I cannot avoid agreeing with the conclusion of this \nreport: ``(T)he unwillingness of the regulatory agencies to take a lead \nrole in the crisis'' was one of the key factors that ``resulted in a \ndelay of more than 1 year in implementing strategies to screen donors \nfor risk factors associated with AIDS.''\n  Question 3. Did the Federal Government warn the hemophilia community, \nwhen the Government knew--or should have known--that there were \nlegitimate concerns that the blood supply might not be safe?\n  The report's answer is ``No.''\n  According to the report, ``a failure of (government) leadership may \nhave delayed effective action during the period from 1982 to 1984. This \nfailure led to less than effective donor screening, weak regulatory \nactions, and''--this is the key, Mr. President--``insufficient \ncommunication to patients about the risks of AIDS.''\n  As a result, Mr. President, and I am again quoting from the report: \n``individuals with hemophilia and transfusion recipients had little \ninformation about risks, benefits, and clinical options for their use \nof blood and blood products.'' The response of ``policymakers'' was \n``very cautious and exposed the decision makers and their organizations \nto a minimum of criticism.''\n  In effect, Mr. President, the inertial reflex of bureaucratic caution \nled to a serious failure to protect the public health. That really is \nthe bottom line.\n  The Americans suffering from hemophilia were relying on their \ngovernment to exercise due care about the safety of the blood supply. \nIt is my view, in light of the very important report released today, \nthat the Government failed to meet its responsibilities to the \nhemophilia community.\n  It is therefore my intention to introduce, in the coming days, \nlegislation that will offer some measure of relief to those who have \nbeen seriously harmed by this governmental failure.\n  I have had a discussion with my colleague from Florida, Senator \nGraham, who has been a leader in this area, who has been working for a \nlong time with the hemophilia community and those who have been \nimpacted by this horrible tragedy. And I would expect to be working \nwith him in the future in regard to legislation to be introduced.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/17/senate-section/article/S10136-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10137-S10146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, as I have listened to the debate and \neditorializing surrounding the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act I am \nstruck by the extreme rhetoric and baseless accusations made by \nopponents of this legislation. If you were to believe all that has been \nsaid, you would be convinced that this bill would undermine all of our \nhealth and safety protections. You would also believe that the Clinton \nadministration has dramatically reformed the regulatory process during \nits 2 years in office. Well, Mr. President, nothing could be further \nfrom the truth.\n  Let us first examine the Clinton administration's record on \nregulatory reform. Despite rhetoric claiming support for a more \nreasonable approach to regulation, Federal regulatory activity has \nsignificantly increased during the past 2 years. In November 1994, the \nadministration itself identified over 4,300 new rulemakings underway \nthroughout the Federal Government--4,300 new ones working their way \nthrough the process.\n  The Institute for Regulatory Policy recently studied EPA regulations \nissued by the Clinton administration. \n\n[[Page S 10138]]\nThis study examined all EPA proposed and final rules published in the \nFederal Register during the second 6 months after President Clinton's \nregulatory reform Executive order took effect. Based on an analysis of \n222 rulemakings, the study found that only six rulemakings offered a \ndetermination that there was a compelling public need for regulation. \nThat is 6 out of 222 regulations. Only six of them were worth the paper \nthey were printed on. This demonstrates that the benefits justify the \ncost of the regulations on only six.\n  To put Federal regulation in historical perspective, during the \n1960's, the Federal Register--where regulations are published--devoted \napproximately 170,000 pages to Federal regulatory requirements for that \ndecade. In the 1970's, this number jumped to approximately 475,000 \npages. During the early 1980's, President Reagan achieved a significant \nreduction in the growth of regulations. Unfortunately, at the end of \nPresident Clinton's first year in office, the number of Federal \nRegister pages reached the highest annual level since 1980.\n  Once you strip away the rhetoric and look at the facts, it is clear \nwho stands on the side of restraining our runaway bureaucracy and who \nseeks to defend the status quo. And the bureaucracy is and has run \naway. It is clear who stands on the side of protecting individual \nliberties and who stands on the side of handing-over unchecked \npolitical power to unelected bureaucrats. It is clear who stands on the \nside of increased economic growth and economic opportunity, and who \nwould allow our economy and our opportunities as a free people to be \nstrangled by redtape.\n  Although the legislative language of this bill can be complex and \nconfusing, it is really based on a handful of easily-understandable \ncommonsense principles.\n  First, the bill would require agencies to conduct risk assessment. \nRisk assessment is a scientific process that requires regulators to \nevaluate and compare the risks of different activities in order to \nfocus regulations and scarce Federal dollars on those activities posing \nthe greatest threat to consumers. Too often in the past, regulations \nhave been aimed at issues identified through media attention rather \nthan sound science.\n  Second, this bill would require cost-benefit analysis to ensure that \nagencies do not impose undue burdens on the public. The premise of \ncost-benefit analysis is simple. Before an agency issues a regulation, \nit should be required to systematically measure the benefits of the \nregulation and compare them to the costs. Such an analysis allows a \nmore accurate understanding of the regulatory burden imposed on \nconsumers by the Federal Government.\n  Finally, the Dole-Johnston substitute amendment permits judicial and \ncongressional review of various agency determinations. Opponents of \nthese provisions claim that they will lead to gridlock. I claim that \nsuch reviews are essential to hold unelected bureaucrats accountable to \nthe American people for the rules and regulations which they would \nimpose on us. Can you imagine anything more ridiculous than an \nunelected bureaucrat not being held subject to judicial and legislative \nreview?\n  I would like to give an example of how Government infringement upon \nprivate property rights in the form of uncompensated regulatory takings \ncan have negative environmental impacts. I would like to illustrate \nthis problem by talking about the case of a constituent of mine, Mr. \nBen Cone, of Ivanhoe, NC, who has been mentioned previously during \ndebate on this bill.\n  Mr. Cone owns 8,000 acres of timber land in North Carolina. Over the \nyears, Ben Cone has deliberately managed much of his land in such a way \nso as to attract wildlife to his property. Mr. Cone has actively and \nintentionally created wildlife habitat. Through selective logging and \nlong rotation cycles. Mr. Cone has been very successful in his efforts, \nattracting many species to his land--from wood duck and quail to black \nbear and deer.\n  Mr. Cone has also provided habitat for the red-cockaded woodpecker, \nan endangered species.\n  In response, the Federal Government has placed a large portion of his \nland off limits to logging. The value of his land has been reduced by \napproximately $2 million. This has taught Mr. Cone a lesson: He should \nno longer manage his land in such a way that would attract the red-\ncockaded woodpecker if he wants to be able to use it.\n  In other words, if he allows the trees to mature, he simply cannot \ncut them because of the red-cockaded woodpeckers. So what he is doing \nand can do is cut the trees that they do not inhabit and ultimately \nthey will go away.\n  I believe the case of Ben Cone and the central issue at stake in this \nlegislation is about preserving fundamental liberties under our \nconstitutional system of checks and balances. In short, our problem is \none of limited accountability. It is about who regulates the \nregulators. And it is about whether the executive branch alone should \noversee our massive Federal bureaucracy or whether Congress and the \nFederal courts should have a greater role in this process.\n  I firmly believe that the Congress and the courts should have the \nmajor role in regulating the bureaucracy.\n  I believe that one of the lessons of our experiment with big \nGovernment in the last half of this century is that agencies tend to \ntake on a life of their own. Despite the efforts of various Presidents \nto rein in agencies, they have continued to grow in size, cost, and \npower. We have ceded increasing power and control over our lives to a \n``fourth branch'' of Government which has consistently resisted efforts \nto be held accountable.\n  The time is long overdue to increase oversight of agencies by the \njudicial and legislative branches of Government. Perhaps such oversight \nwill in some instances result in a slowdown in the implementation of \nsome regulations. And if it does, that is exactly what we need and what \nthe country needs.\n  Some will say that such a slowdown is intolerable. I believe it is \nabsolutely essential to preserve our hard-won constitutional liberties \nand freedoms to have such review.\n  I oppose the Glenn-Chafee substitute, which I believe fails to \naddress many of the central issues in regulatory reform. Therefore, I \nstrongly support the Dole-Johnston substitute amendment and urge its \nadoption.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe the Domenici amendment has \nbeen set aside so that the Senate could consider the Glenn substitute \nto the whole bill. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I further understand Senator Glenn on the Democrat side \nand Senator Roth on the Republican side have no objection to my getting \nunanimous consent that my amendment now be in order and the Glenn \namendment remain as is but that we dispose of the Domenici amendment \ntonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may call for the regular order and \nthat will bring the amendment in order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I call for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question now is the Domenici \namendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1784 to Amendment No. 1533\n\n (Purpose: To facilitate small business involvement in the regulatory \n              development process, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send a substitute to the desk in \nbehalf of myself and Senators Bond, Bingaman, Abraham, Cohen, \nHutchison, and Roth, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the clerk will \nreport the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for himself, \n     Mr. Bond, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Cohen, Mrs. \n     Hutchison, and Mr. Roth, proposes an amendment numbered 1784 \n     to amendment No. 1533.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note that a number of other Senators \nhad \n\n[[Page S 10139]]\ncosponsored the original Domenici small business advocacy bill, but \nsince I have changed it I have not had time to ask them if they want to \nbe cosponsors, and so I am going to send to the desk a list of the \ncosponsors and ask that overnight Senators' offices decide whether they \nwant to be original cosponsors, in which event tomorrow I would seek \nunanimous consent that they be made original cosponsors as if I had \ndone it this evening.\n  Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Bond, the chairman of the \nSmall Business Committee, for offering a package of amendments to the \noriginal Domenici small business advocacy representation amendment, and \nthen I wish to thank Senator Glenn and Senator Roth for their \ncooperation and Senator Johnston and his staff. I think we have now \ncrafted a measure that will be accepted this evening by the Senate, and \nI feel very proud of the amendment because I think ultimately the cry \nby small business across this land that they ought to be somewhat \ninvolved, albeit it in an informal way, in the development of \nregulations that affect them, both before they are finalized and after \nthey are finalized, will have been accomplished.\n  Last year, five agencies including Small Business, EPA, and OSHA held \nsmall business forums on regulatory reform, and this report is their \nfindings, findings and recommendations of the industry working groups.\n  In that document, which was put together by the executive branch of \nGovernment, the small business people recited over and over again that \nthe inability of small business owners to comprehend overly complex \nregulations and those that are overlapping and inconsistent and \nredundant was a major problem. They continued to state over and over \nthe need for agency regulatory officials to understand the nuances of \nthe regulated industry and the compliance constraints of small \nbusiness. They stated over and over that the need for more small \nbusiness involvement in the regulatory development process, \nparticularly during the analytic risk assessment and preliminary \ndrafting stages, was imperative if in fact we were going to have \ncommonsense regulations.\n  So let me once again read the conclusion of this very large group of \nsmall business people: The need for more small business involvement in \nthe regulatory development process during analytic risk assessment and \npreliminary stages is of utmost importance.\n  What we have done in this compromise measure, which many have \nparticipated in drafting, is we have complied with a number of the \nWhite House Conference on Small Business final recommendations which \nare included in this document. I will make those a part of the Record. \nI will just recite a few of the 60 recommendations to the President and \nthe Congress. I am going to cite just four of them and they are in \nhere, in this amendment:\n\n       Input from small business representatives should be \n     required in any future legislation, policy development, and \n     regulation making affecting small business.\n       Congress shall enact legislation . . . to include the \n     following: require all agencies to simplify language and \n     forms required for use by small business . . . and eliminate \n     duplicate regulations from multiple Government agencies.\n       Require agencies to assemble information through a single \n     source on all business related government programs, \n     regulations, reporting requirements, and key federal \n     contact's names and phone numbers.\n       Congress shall enact legislation to include the following: \n     Require all agencies provide a cooperative/consulting \n     regulatory environment that follows due process procedures \n     and that they be less punitive and more solution oriented.\n\n  These are the highlights concerning regulations from the final 60 \nrecommendations the delegates made to the President. They were among \nhundreds of grass-roots ideas the delegates voted on.\n  The delegates felt so strongly about the recommendations I just read, \nthat they received an overwhelming number of votes.\n  The President's own welcoming letter to the delegates states, ``Small \nbusinesses are the heart of America. We look to you for our new best \nideas * * *'' My amendment will implement these ideas.\n  Mr. President, what we have accomplished in the first part of this \namendment, which will then be followed by the ombudsman legislation \nthat Senator Bond, chairman of the Small Business Committee, has put \nin, small business panels will come into play in each of the States and \nthe small business advocate within Small Business will get them \ntogether on an informal basis with five or six of the lead Government \nofficials who work in this area of regulation, and together they will \ngo over the regulatory problems that are coming up on regulations as we \ndefine them in this bill.\n  This means that if this works, for the first time in history as part \nof our Government we will recognize in each State the need for small \nbusiness, that is, the Small Business Administration, which some people \nwonder what do they do for business in general, they will now go out \nand pick six small business people, men or women, generally from our \nStates, and they will work with them regarding the regulatory \nactivities that are taking place that are approaching finalization. \nThere is plenty of time to get it done because these regulations take a \nlong time. It is not intended to be formal. It is a real bona fide \neffort to see if cooperation and partnership can be generated by \nstatute law which will bring small business people into direct contact \nwith those who are preparing regulations, all under the auspices of the \nSmall Business Administration and its advocates bringing this together.\n  There are some technical issues I need not mention but that are part \nof this which I think will make it work. Essentially, it will depend on \nwhether the bureaucrats want to listen to small business. But at least \nthey will be given a chance to participate in what is happening in the \nregulatory process. I look for some good things to come from it, not \nbecause they will get their way all the time, because nobody expects \nthat, but I think they will have the kind of input so they will not in \na few years be telling us that small business does not know what the \nregulatory process is all about, what they are doing to them and then \nthe regs are without commonsense.\n  Small businesses panels will be responsible for providing technical \nguidance for issues impacting small businesses, such as applicability, \ncompliance, consistency, redundancy, readability, and any other related \nconcerns that may affect them.\n  They will then provide recommendations to the appropriate agency \npersonnel responsible for developing and drafting the relevant \nregulations.\n  The panels will be chaired by a senior official of the agency and \nwill include staff responsible for development and drafting of the \nregulation, a representative from OIRA, a member of the SBA Advocate \nOffice, and up to six representatives from small businesses especially \naffected.\n  The panel will have a total of 45 days each to meet and develop \nrecommendations before a rule is promulgated or before a final rule is \nissued. Forty-five days, in the context of rules that are years in \ndevelopment, is not a delay.\n  In fact, these agencies know months in advance that they will be \npreparing these regulations. Sometime during this period, the agencies \ncan seek these panels' advice\n  This will allow the actual small business owners, or their \nrepresentative associations, to have a voice in the massive regulatory \nprocess that affects them so much.\n  Finally, this amendment will also provide for a survey to be \nconducted on regulations. This idea is analogous to what the private \nsector routinely practices.\n  A customer survey, contracted and conducted with a private sector \nfirm, will sample a cross-section of the affected small business \ncommunity responsible for complying with the sampled regulation.\n  I believe that this panel, working together so all viewpoints are \nrepresented, will be the crux of reasonable, consistent and \nunderstandable rulemaking.\n  Further, my amendment enjoys the support of the National Federation \nof Independent Business.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment will help reduce \ncounterproductive, unreasonable Federal regulations at the same time it \nis helping to foster the nonadversarial, cooperative relationships that \nmost agree is long overdue between small businesses and Federal \nagencies.\n  Mr. President, a second part of this amendment would greatly aid \nsmall \n\n[[Page S 10140]]\nbusinesses as they deal with these seemingly endless Federal \nregulations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to Senator Bond who wants to talk \nabout the second part of the amendment, and then I assume Senator Glenn \nwill speak and we will, hopefully, have the Senate adopt the amendment \nthis evening.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair and my distinguished friend from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. President, I will abide by the suggestion that we keep this short \nbecause I do believe, first, thanks are in order to Senator Domenici \nfor the concept of this amendment. I was pleased to join with him on \nadding provisions with respect to the ombudsmen, but sincere thanks to \nSenator Glenn, Senator Levin and their staffs because they made very \nhelpful and constructive suggestions that we think can improve the \nworking of these provisions.\n  The part of the amendment which I had earlier introduced legislation \non provides a means for small businesses who feel that they are being \nabused by a particular regulator to get some relief without having to \nrisk heightening the animosity of that particular regulator by going \nthrough the Small Business Advocacy Council in the Small Business \nAdministration. This, we think, will respond to the many complaints we \nhave heard in hearings we had in New Mexico, in my State, and other \nplaces around the country, where they think the enforcement is \nexcessive.\n  There was a suggestion by the Senator from Michigan that we have the \nappointment of the regional small business regulatory fairness board by \nthe SBA Administrator so it would not be burdensome, having to go \nthrough Presidential and congressional leadership appointment. I think \nthat improves the bill.\n  I express my appreciation to the managers on both sides for their \nhelp in getting this amendment through. I really think this is going to \nbe a significant step forward for small business. As Senator Domenici \nhas pointed out, small business has expressed their frustration with \nregulations. Now they will have an opportunity to sit in on the \ncrafting of the regulations.\n  They will also have a place to go if they are treated unfairly by \nparticular regulators or the particular agencies. I hope that there \nwill not be a need for the small business ombudsmen. I hope that with \nthe establishment of this procedure, there will be a strong push and a \ngreater effort on behalf of all agencies to become servers of the \nbusinesses and the people they regulate and the people of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about the need for the \nDomenici-Bond-Bingaman amendment. This amendment opens a new front in \nour fight against oppressive, onerous, and overly meddlesome Government \nregulations. This new front will, for the first time, take the fight \noutside the beltway and attack regulations and agencies where they \nimpact people in their day-to-day lives.\n  Since the election, there has been tremendous activity in reforming \nthe way Federal agencies develop and issue regulations, and I have been \ndeeply involved in this effort as cochair of the regulatory relief task \nforce. S. 343 is so important because it makes fundamental changes in \nthe way Government regulations are developed. It is vitally important \nif we are to reduce the flood of runaway regulations. And it is \nparticularly important for small business to add meaningful judicial \nenforcement provisions to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and I am very \npleased to see the strong reforms of the Reg Flex Act in this bill.\n  So far, most of our efforts have focused on changing the way agencies \nenact regulations. The Domenici-Bond-Bingaman amendment begins to \nreform the way Government officials enforce Federal regulations. After \nall, most people, most small business people, do not have the time to \nconcern themselves with the process of reviewing and commenting on \nproposed and final rules in the Federal Register. Small businesses have \nto deal with regulations when the regulator shows up on the doorstep to \ninspect their facility or to enforce a new Federal mandate. As I have \ntaken the Senate Small Business Committee around the country, I have \nheard numerous horror stories about burdensome regulations. But as I \nhave listened and learned from business men and women with real life \nproblems, I have become increasingly convinced that the enforcement of \nregulations is a problem as troublesome as the regulations themselves.\n  The Domenici-Bond-Bingaman amendment will begin to make \nfundamental changes in the way regulatory agencies think about small \nbusiness. It should be every regulatory agency's mission to encourage \ncompliance by making rules easier to understand and by not enforcing \ntheir regulations in a way that unnecessarily frustrates law-abiding \nsmall businesses. This is the essence of President Clinton's call for \nGovernment regulators to treat small businessmen as clients and not \ncriminals, partners not adversaries. In fact, the administration should \nsupport this amendment. It establishes a type of performance-based \nstandard for regulators that the Vice President has talked about in the \nnational performance review. This allows the customers--small \nbusiness--to rate the regulators.\n  The Domenici-Bond-Bingaman amendment is designed to give \nsmall businesses a place to voice complaints about excessive, unfair, \nor incompetent enforcement of regulations. It sets up regional Small \nBusiness and Agriculture ombudsmen through the Small Business \nAdministration's offices around the country to give small businesses \nassurance that their confidential complaints and comments will be \nrecorded and heard. These ombudsmen also will coordinate the activities \nof volunteer Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards, made up of \nsmall business people from each region. These Boards will be able to \nreport on and make recommendations about troublesome patterns of \nenforcement activities. Any small business that is subject to an \ninspection or enforcement action will have the chance to rate and \ncritique the inspectors or lawyers they deal with. In dealing with \nsmall businesses today, agencies seem to assume that every one is a \nviolator of their rules, trying to get away with something. Some \nagencies do a good job of fulfilling their legal mandate while \nassisting small business, but many agencies seem stuck in an \nenforcement mentality where everyone is presumed guilty until proven \ninnocent. I think we should let small businesses compare their dealings \nwith one agency to dealing with another so the abusive agencies or \nagents can be weeded out and exposed. Agencies should be trying to see \nwho can fulfill their statutory mandate in a way that helps and \nempowers small business.\n  This is an important amendment. It has the strong support of small \nbusiness. I believe it will help to bring about a more cooperative \nrelationship between regulators and small business. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  In recent weeks, we have heard from the President about all the ways \nhe is going to reduce the burdens of Government regulations. I commend \nhim for recognizing the forces at work in Congress and responding \nquickly to it. He has found a parade and now is hustling to get in \nfront of it, as a good politician will do. Presidential directives and \nagency policies can change as often as the weather, though, and I want \nthe comfort of knowing that Congress has passed a law that permanently \nchanges the enforcement attitudes of Federal regulators so small \nbusiness can get on with what they do best, creating jobs and driving \nthe engine of America's economy.\n  I appreciate the willingness of the managers to accept the measure.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Domenici-Bond \namendment.\n  In 1980, Congress enacted the Regulatory Flexibility Act in \nrecognition of the fact that Government regulations have a \ndisproportionate impact on small business. In that act we asked \nGovernment agencies to take this fact into account in issuing \nregulations. Today, some 15 years later, it is generally accepted that \nthe 1980 act has been an ineffective response to a growing problem.\n  The pending amendment is an effective remedy. It flashes out what two \nagencies--EPA and OSHA--must do to take the concerns of small business \n\n[[Page S 10141]]\ninto account. It formalizes a dialog between small business and those \nagencies which, I am sure, will be helpful to both. With this \namendment, these agencies can no longer brush aside the legitimate \nconcerns of small business. There is a real difference in how \nregulations impact a conglomerate and a sole proprietor.\n  Fifteen years ago we notified agencies that they should recognize \nthis difference and gave them discretion. But that discretion has not \nbeen exercised as it should have been. So no Congress must respond with \nmore precise direction.\n  This amendment embodies a second major component. It establishes \nregional small business ombudsmen to solicit and receive comments from \nsmall businesses regarding enforcement activities of Federal agencies \nand periodically evaluate how responsive agencies have been to small \nbusiness concerns.\n  This amendment impresses me as an appropriate solution to the \nconcerns of small business. The requirements of the pending amendment \nregarding the issuance of rules pertain only to two agencies and, \nthere, only formalize what should now be taking place--a dialog between \nsmall business and the agencies.\n  Mr. President, Government must be made sensitive to the regulatory \nburden on small business. Small business is the backbone of America--a \ncrucial provider of jobs, a wellspring of entrepreneurial innovation, \nand a central part of the American dream. I congratulate Senators \nDomenici and Bond for their efforts to help America's millions of small \nbusiness owners, their employees, and their families.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the small business advocacy review \npanels that are created by this amendment should make the regulatory \nprocesses of OSHA and the Environmental Protection Agency more user \nfriendly and, in a sense, bring small business and those two regulatory \nagencies into some kind of cooperative spirit where heretofore they \nseemed to have kind of thrived on being adversarial.\n  I want to thank Senator Hatch who is managing this bill for helping \nus get our amendment to this point. I understand he, too, is going to \nexpress a willingness to accept it. I thank him for that. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend and colleague \nfrom New Mexico and compliment him for his amendment. We are prepared \nto accept this amendment at this point, and I believe the other side is \nas well.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I want to comment briefly on the amendment \noffered by Senator Domenici.\n  First of all, I do want to recognize his concerns regarding the \nability of small businesses to have a role in the regulatory process. \nLike all other Americans, their voices should be heard.\n  I also want to acknowledge the charges made by Senators Domenici and \nBond and their staffs to address concerns raised by myself and others, \nincluding Senator Levin.\n  I am pleased that the sponsors have done away with the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act [FACA] exemption. I will have more to say about \nthe importance of FACA when I offer my amendment to strike the FACA \nexemption for the risk assessment peer review panels in the underlying \nDole-Johnston bill. In fact, we spent a whole day discussing FACA on \nthe floor last August when we eliminated such exemptions in the health \ncare bill.\n  I am also glad that the role of the small business designated \nrepresentatives has changed somewhat--they will be primarily to furnish \ninformation to the review panel.\n  Second, I am glad that we were able to straighten out the definition \nof rules for when these panels come into play, so it mirrors the \nlanguage in the underlying bill.\n  Third, I am pleased that we have clarified that any information made \navailable to the small business designated representatives will also be \npublicly accessible. They will not be privy to any information that \nother citizens will not be able to access.\n  Fourth, regarding the surveys which may be ordered, we not only will \nknow the results, but also the cost paid by taxpayers to undertake \nthem.\n  Having said this, let me also voice my concerns over some of the \nprovisions in the amendment.\n  Let me be clear: we are giving one special interest--no matter how \nmeritorious their cause--a leg up over all other citizens in the \nregulatory process.\n  These small business review panels will come into play even prior to \nthe issuance of a notice of proposed rulemaking. That is a marked \ndeparture from current practice.\n  We don't have special review panels to hear from labor interests \nprior to issuance of regulatory proposals. Workers will have an \ninterest--perhaps their safety or lives depend on it--in presenting \ntheir views, also.\n  We do not have teachers giving their comments prior to the \npromulgation of a rulemaking notice for an education proposal by the \nDepartment of Education.\n  I understand what the proponents of this amendment are trying to do. \nIt is important to reach out and consult with those of our citizens who \nwill be most affected by a proposed rule. I do not disagree with the \nprinciple, and I am a strong supporter of small business, but I support \nworkers and teachers too, and we are not giving them equivalent access.\n  Second, I am concerned about the survey these review panels may order \nto assess the impact of a final rule. We hear alot about government \nredtape and the endless burden of paperwork.\n  But now we are going to have an agency contracting with a private \nsector firm to do an assessment--from a cross-section of affected small \nbusinesses--which, it would seem to me, will add to the burden of \npaperwork that the Paperwork Reduction Act is supposed to reduce. I \nhope OMB reviews any such survey proposal carefully.\n  I understand the sponsor will not request a roll call vote. On that \nbasis, I will not oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. President, we are going to accept this. It is my intention to do \nthat. I want to recognize the concerns of Senator Domenici regarding \nthe ability of small business to have a role in the regulatory process. \nTheir voices should be heard. There were changes made that took care of \nsome of our problems with FACA, in particular, the Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act, which requires a balance on certain committees, and so \non.\n  I will have some more to say about that later on, not in regard to \nthis particular amendment, but to the underlying bill. There are some \nproblems still in that area.\n  I have expressed some concerns about how this might be applied to \nother speciality areas that we have some concern about, but that is of \nno concern in this particular area. We may want to address some of that \nlater.\n  With that, I will be glad to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 1784 to amendment No. 1533.\n  So the amendment (No. 1784) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on agreeing to \namendment No. 1533, as amended.\n  So the amendment (No. 1533), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1785 to Amendment No. 1487\n\n (Purpose: To repeal the Medicare and Medicaid coverage data bank, and \n                          for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk for and on \nbehalf of Senators McCain and \n\n[[Page S 10142]]\nLieberman and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] for Mr. McCain, for \n     himself and Mr. Lieberman, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1785 to amendment No. 1487.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment, insert the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC.   . REPEAL OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID COVERAGE DATA BANK.\n\n       (a) Repeal.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 13581 of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1993 is hereby repealed.\n       (2) Application of the social security act.--The Social \n     Security Act shall be applied and administered as if section \n     13581 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (and \n     the amendments made by such section) had not been enacted.\n       (b) Study and Report.--\n       (1) Study.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the \n     ``Secretary'') shall conduct a study on how to achieve the \n     objectives of the data bank described in section 1144 of the \n     Social Security Act (as in effect on the day before the date \n     of the enactment of this Act) in the most cost-effective \n     manner, taking into account--\n       (A) the administrative burden of such data bank on private \n     sector entities and governments,\n       (B) the possible duplicative reporting requirements of the \n     Health Care Financing Administration in effect on such date \n     of enactment, and\n       (C) the legal ability of such entities and governments to \n     acquire the required information.\n       (2) Report.--The Secretary shall report to the Congress on \n     the results of the study described in paragraph (1) by not \n     later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment which is cosponsored by \nSenator Lieberman and Senator Kyl would eliminate a large and \nunjustified administrative burden imposed on employers by an ill-\nconsidered piece of legislation passed 2 years ago. Specifically, it \nwould repeal the Medicare and Medicaid Coverage Data Bank, section \n13581 of OBRA 1993, a law that is extremely expensive, burdensome, \npunitive, and in my view, entirely unnecessary.\n  The data bank law requires every employer who offers health care \ncoverage to provide substantial and often difficult-to-obtain \ninformation on current and past employees and their dependents, \nincluding names, Social Security numbers, health care plans, and period \nof coverage. Employers that do not satisfy this considerable reporting \nobligation are subject to substantial penalties, possibly up to \n$250,000 per year or even more if the failure to report is found to be \ndeliberate.\n  The purported objective of the data bank law is to ensure \nreimbursement of costs to Medicare or Medicaid when a third party is \nthe primary payor. This is a legitimate objective. However, if the \nobjective of the data bank is to preserve Medicare and Medicaid funds, \nwhy is it necessary to mandate information on all employees, the vast \nmajority of whom have no direct association with either the Medicare or \nMedicaid Program?\n  Last year, I introduced S. 1933 to repeal the Medicare and Medicaid \nCoverage Data Bank. Unfortunately, this bill did not pass in the 103d \nCongress, in part because of a questionable Congressional Budget Office \nanalysis that estimated that the data bank would save the Federal \nGovernment about $1 billion. In contrast, the General Accounting Office \nfound that ``as envisioned, the data bank would have certain inherent \nproblems and likely achieve little or no savings to the Medicare and \nMedicaid Programs.'' Still, due primarily to the fiction that the data \nbank would save money, S. 1933 was not enacted last year.\n  The GAO report on the data bank law also found that employers are not \ncertain of their specific reporting obligations, because HCFA has not \nprovided adequate guidance. Much of the information which is required \nis not typically collected by employers, such as Social Security \nnumbers of dependents and certain health insurance information. Some \nemployers have even questioned whether it is legal for them under \nvarious privacy laws to seek to obtain the required information.\n  The GAO report further found that employers are facing significant \ncosts in complying with the reporting requirements, including the costs \nof redesigning their payroll and personnel systems. It cites one \ncompany with 44,000 employees that would\n have costs of approximately $52,000 and another company with 4,000 \nemployees that would have costs of $12,000. Overall, the American \nPayroll Association estimated last year that this requirement will cost \nbetween $50,000 and $100,000 per company.\n\n  I would add that the reporting requirement applies only to employers \nthat provide health insurance coverage to their employees. It is \nunconscionable that we are adding costs and penalties to those who have \nbeen most diligent in providing health coverage to their employees. The \nlast thing that the Federal Government should do is impose \ndisincentives to employee health care coverage, which is one of the \nunintended consequences of the data bank law.\n  Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the data bank law is that its \nenormous costs have little or no corresponding benefit. The GAO report \nconcluded that ``The additional information gathering and record \nkeeping required by the data bank appears to provide little benefit to \nMedicare or Medicaid in recovering mistaken payments.'' This is in part \nbecause HCFA is already obtaining this information in a much more \nefficient manner than that required under OBRA 1993.\n  Foe example, OBRA 1989 provides for HCFA to periodically match \nMedicare beneficiary data with Internal Revenue Service employment \ninformation--the data match program. Also, HCFA directly asks \nbeneficiaries about primary payor coverage. To the extent that the data \nbank duplicates these efforts, any potential savings will not be \nrealized. It is clearly preferable to require HCFA to use the \ninformation it already has than to require the private sector to \nprovide duplicative information.\n  The GAO report found that ``the data match not only can provide the \nsame information [as the Data Bank] without raising the potential \nproblems described above, but it can do so at less cost.'' It also \nrecognized that both the data match and data bank processes rely too \nmuch on an after-the-fact recovery approach, and recommended enhancing \nup-front identification of other insurance and avoiding erroneous \npayments. In this regard, it documented that HCFA has already initiated \nthis prospective approach.\n  For these and other reasons, the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources appropriations report last year contained language \nprohibiting the use of Federal funds for developing or maintaining the \ndata bank. However, this provision by itself did not revoke the \nrequirement that covered entities must still provide the required \ninformation on the health coverage of current and former employees and \ntheir families. This would have resulted in the bizarre situation in \nwhich covered employers would have had to report the information, but \nthere would have been no data bank to process or retrieve it.\n  Finally, in response to the public outcry about this Federal mandate, \nthe Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA] indicated that it will \nnot be enforcing the data bank's reporting requirements in fiscal year \n1995. It stated that in light of the refusal of Congress to fund the \ndata bank, ``we have agreed to stay an administrative action to \nimplement the current requirements, including the promulgation of \nreporting forms and instructions. Therefore, we will not expect \nemployers to compile the necessary information or file the required \nreports. Likewise, no sanctions will be imposed for failure to file \nsuch reports.''\n  This was a major step in the right direction. However, the data bank \nand its reporting requirements are still in the law and are still \nscheduled to be implemented in the next fiscal year. Consequently, this \nyear I have reintroduced my data bank repeal bill, S. 194. I have \nrecently been informed that the CBO has revised its scoring to \nrecognize that the data bank would not save the Federal Government any \nmoney. This removed the only argument in favor of the data bank and the \nonly major impediment to its repeal.\n\n[[Page S 10143]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Federal Government continues to impose substantial \nfinancial burdens on the private sector without fully accepting its \nshare of the burden to implement a program. We should once again expect \nthe worst case scenario to occur: employers will provide the required \ninformation at substantial administrative burden, there will be no data \nbank in which to make use of it, and even if a data bank were funded \nand established, the information stored could not be used efficiently \nto save Medicare or Medicaid funds.\n  I do not want this repeal to be construed, in any way, as opposition \nto HCFA obtaining the information it needs to administer the Medicare \nand Medicaid Programs efficiently, and obtaining reimbursement from \nthird-party payors when appropriate. To assure that HCFA has the \ninformation it needs, the bill also requires the Secretary of HHS to \nconduct a study and report to Congress on how to achieve the purported \nobjectives of the data bank in the most cost-effective manner possible.\n  The Secretary's study would have to take into consideration the \nadministrative costs and burden on the private sector and the \nGovernment of processing and providing the necessary information versus \nthe benefits and savings that such reporting requirements would \nproduce. It must also consider current HCFA reporting requirements and \nthe ability of entities to obtain the required information legally and \nefficiently.\n  Too often, Congress considers only the cost savings to the Federal \nGovernment of legislation while ignoring costs to other parties. The \nMedicare and Medicaid Data Bank is a case in point. Congress required \ninformation on millions of employees to save the Federal Government \nmoney. Yet, it will cost employers more money to comply than the \nGovernment saves. Congress must stop passing laws that impose large, \nunjustified administrative burdens on other entities. It must consider \nthe impact of its actions on the whole economy and not just on the \nGovernment.\n  In summary, the reporting requirement for the Medicare and Medicaid \nData Bank is duplicative, burdensome, ineffective, and unnecessary. The \nGAO has characterized it as creating ``an avalanche of unnecessary \npaperwork for both HCFA and employers.'' It penalizes employers who \nprovide health care benefits to their workers--exactly the opposite \ngoal we should be pursuing. The data bank should be repealed and a more \ncost-effective approach should be found to ensure that Medicare and \nMedicaid are appropriately reimbursed by primary payors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from \nthe Coalition on Employer Health Coverage Reporting and the Medicare/\nMedicaid Data Bank, the ERISA Industry Committee [ERIC] and the \nNational Federation of Independent Business be printed in the Record. \nThey represent the numerous associations, organizations, and individual \nemployers that continue to demand repeal of this law. Their message is \nclear. The Federal Government must stop imposing unjustified burdens on \nthe private sector.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 The ERISA Industry Committee,\n\n                                                    July 11, 1995.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: We understand that you are planning to \n     offer a floor amendment to S. 343, the Comprehensive \n     Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, to repeal the requirement that \n     employers report certain health coverage information to the \n     Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) for use by the \n     Medicare and Medicaid Data Bank. The members of the ERISA \n     Industry Committee (ERIC) strongly support your amendment.\n       The ERISA Industry Committee is a non-profit employer \n     association committed to the advancement of the employee \n     retirement, health and welfare benefit plans of America's \n     major employers. ERIC represents the employee benefits \n     interests of more than 125 of the nation's largest employers. \n     As sponsors of health, disability, pension, savings, life \n     insurance, and other welfare benefit plans directly covering \n     approximately 25 million plan participants and beneficiaries, \n     ERIC's members provide coverage to about 10 percent of the \n     U.S. population.\n       The reporting requirement was created by OBRA'93, P.L. 103-\n     66, ERIC's analysis has concluded that the employer reporting \n     requirement neither successfully addresses HCFA's concerns \n     regarding the prevention of mistaken primary payments nor \n     justifies the enormous reporting burdens it imposes on \n     employers. Therefore, its repeal is consistent with the \n     laudable goal of reducing unnecessary and inappropriate \n     regulation.\n       ERIC is committed to working with you and others to find \n     alternative means to address HCFA's secondary payer \n     enforcement and compliance needs that do not impose \n     disproportionate financial and administrative burdens on \n     employers. In particular, the multiple sources of data and \n     data collection vehicles already available to HCFA should be \n     fully implemented rather than imposing massive new reporting \n     burdens on employers.\n       In conclusion, we applaud your efforts to repeal this \n     onerous reporting requirement and urge your colleagues in the \n     Senate to support your amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Mark J.

On behalf of the Coalition's \n     members, I would like to express their support for your \n     amendment.\n       The Coalition on Employer Health Coverage Reporting and the \n     Medicare/Medicaid Data Bank consists of more than 90 \n     assocations, organizations and individual employers working \n     together since January 1994 in a joint effort to repeal the \n     reporting requirement.\n       The reporting requirement was created by OBRA'93, P.L. 103-\n     66. The Coalition's analysis (summary attached) concluded \n     that the employer reporting requirement neither successfully \n     addresses HUFA's concerns regarding the prevention of \n     mistaken primary payments nor justifies the enormous \n     reporting burdens it imposes on employers.\n\n[[Page S 10144]]\n\n       We applaud your efforts to repeal this onerous reporting \n     requirement and urge your colleagues in the Senate to support \n     your amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Anthony J.

Therefore, the data bank reporting requirement \n     should be repealed as soon as possible.\n     \\1\\ Beginning January 1, 1994, current law requires employers \n     to report the health insurance coverage status of employees \n     and their dependents to a data bank to be administered by \n     HCFA. This reporting requirement was created by OBRA '93 \n     (P.L. 103-66). HCFA has indefinitely suspended implementation \n     of the data bank because Congress has not appropriated any \n     funds for that purpose. The coalition strongly supported the \n     Appropriation Committees' decision not to appropriate funds \n     for data bank implementation. Employers remain subject to the \n     statutory obligation to collect and report the data, however, \n     so repeal of the reporting requirement is still urgently \n     needed.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Unreasonable costs imposed on employers: The administrative \n     and financial burden imposed on employers by full compliance \n     with the reporting requirement is enormous. A significant \n     portion of the information to be reported to the data bank is \n     not currently maintained by most employers for any business \n     purpose. In many cases this information will have to be \n     compiled manually (i.e., most employers do not have payroll \n     systems and computer data bases that are designed to collect \n     and maintain this required information) at tremendous cost.\n       GAO determines that the data bank won't work: On May 6, \n     1994, Leslie Aronovitz testified on behalf of the General \n     Accounting Office (GAO) before the Senate Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs that ``the enormous administrative \n     burden the data bank would place on HCFA and the nation's \n     employers. . . likely would do little or nothing to enhance \n     current efforts to identify those beneficiaries who have \n     other health insurance coverages.'' The basis for GAO's \n     conclusions is discussed in detail in a report, ``Medicare/\n     Medicaid Data Bank Unlikely to Increase Collections From \n     Other Insurers,'' prepared at the request of Senator Joseph \n     Lieberman and released the same day.\n       Coalition's analysis supports GAO's conclusions: The data \n     bank's employer reporting requirement will not solve HCFA's \n     secondary payer enforcement problems--despite the massive \n     administrative burdens and expenses it imposes on employers--\n     for the following reasons:\n       In many cases it is impossible for employers to fully \n     comply with the reporting requirement. Collection of such \n     information from employees is even harder for employers than \n     it is for the government to obtain it directly from Medicare \n     and Medicaid beneficiaries. Obtaining information about \n     dependents, in particular, will be very difficult, time \n     consuming, expensive, and in many cases impossible--\n     especially for employers with high work force turnover. \n     Further, employers' ability to collect certain information \n     (e.g., dependents' social security numbers) may be limited by\n      privacy laws. Collection of information in cases where \n     employers contribute to, but do not administer, Taft-\n     Hartley multi-employer health plans will also be \n     difficult, if not impossible.\n       Requiring employers to collect the data for HCFA is \n     incredibly inefficient. Only a minute amount of the \n     information employers must collect and report will be of any \n     use to the data bank because only a small fraction (less than \n     5 percent) of employees and their dependents are Medicare or \n     Medicaid beneficiaries. In effect, more than 95 percent of \n     employers' effort will be wasted because the data collected \n     will be irrelevant to secondary payer enforcement.\n       The data bank won't improve secondary payer enforcement in \n     any case. The data to be reported by employers was intended \n     to be matched against government records in an effort to \n     identify (after the fact) mistaken reimbursements for health \n     care services by Medicare and Medicaid. But in many cases the \n     data reported by employers will still not be sufficient to \n     enable HCFA (by its own admission) to identify or prevent \n     mistaken payments. Moreover, it is unlikely HCFA would be \n     able to process any relevant information it did receive fast \n     enough to meet applicable claims filing deadlines and recover \n     mistaken payments.\n       Data bank compounds ``Pay-and-chase'' inefficiencies: \n     Mistaken primary payments by Medicare and Medicaid most often \n     result from health care providers billing the wrong parties. \n     Yet HCFA's secondary payer enforcement efforts are based on a \n     ``pay-and-chase'' strategy--reconciling mistaken payments \n     with employers (not providers) years after the fact. The data \n     bank reporting requirement does not alter this ``pay-and-\n     chase'' strategy significantly because of the time delay \n     implicit in the collection and processing of the information \n     to be reported to the data bank.\n       Better alternatives are available: To date the federal \n     government has not made effective use of relevant and more \n     timely information it already receives or could obtain from \n     sources other than the data bank in order to prevent mistaken \n     payments before they occur. For example, HCFA already \n     receives or could obtain much of the same information when \n     claims are filed by health care providers. This is because \n     the UB-92 and other claim forms require secondary payer \n     information to be included on the form. In fact, secondary \n     payer information has been sent to HCFA for years, but HCFA \n     has not been successful at fully incorporating this \n     information into its systems. HCFA has also been unable to \n     take full advantage of additional information it receives or \n     could obtain from other sources, such as new beneficiary \n     questionnaires. Rather than overwhelm HCFA with new data that \n     the agency can't effectively utilize, it makes more sense to \n     help HCFA manage the information it already has or could \n     readily obtain.\n       Compelling arguments for repeal: The preceding analysis \n     suggests several compelling arguments for repealing the data \n     bank reporting requirement, including:\n       Employers' compliance costs will far outweigh (by orders of \n     magnitude) any potential government savings. For all of the \n     reasons discussed above and in the GAO's 1994 report, the \n     data bank reporting requirement will generate little or no \n     additional savings for the federal government despite tens of \n     millions of dollars in annual employer compliance costs.\n       The data bank reporting requirement compounds rather than \n     solves the inherent inefficiency of HCFA's ``pay-and-chase'' \n     enforcement efforts. HCFA's enforcement efforts instead \n     should be focused on preventing mistaken claims before they \n     occur by requiring health care providers to bill the proper \n     parties.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               National Federation\n\n\n                                      of Independent Business,\n\n                                                    July 12, 1995.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the over 600,000 members \n     of the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), I \n     am writing to strongly support the McCain-Lieberman amendment \n     to repeal the Medicare and Medicaid Data Bank. This data bank \n     is nothing short of another regulatory and paperwork \n     nightmare for America's already overburdened small \n     businesses.\n       Unless repealed, this provision will require employers to \n     report detailed health insurance coverage information for \n     more than 140 million individuals--including employees, \n     retirees and their dependents. Information from the Health \n     Care Financing Administration (HCFA) suggests these \n     statistics will be useless 98 percent of the time.\n       Ironically, the government currently receives much of the \n     information the data bank would mandate. Through better \n     management of current resources, and with information \n     gathered through the study your amendment directs the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services to undertake, we \n     believe the federal bureaucracy can avoid this costly and \n     time consuming burden altogether.\n       Thanks for your continued leadership on behalf of small \n     business. We look forward to working with you to pass this \n     important anti-paperwork amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Donald A.

Mr. President, I understand that both sides have approved \nthis amendment and will agree to its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  So the amendment (No. 1785) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I think we are about ready to shut the \nSenate down in just a minute or so. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Missouri \nwould like to send an amendment to the desk.\n\n[[Page S 10145]]\n\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1786 to Amendment No. 1487\n  (Purpose: To provide for the designation of distressed areas within \n  qualifying cities as regulatory relief zones and for the selective \n            waiver of Federal regulations within such zones)\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1786 to amendment No. 1487.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following new title:\n\n               ``TITLE II--URBAN REGULATORY RELIEF ZONES\n\n     SECTION 201. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Urban Regulatory Relief Zone \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the likelihood that a proposed business site will \n     comply with many government regulations is inversely related \n     to the length of time over which a site has been utilized for \n     commercial and/or industrial purposes in the past, thus \n     rendering older sites in urban areas the sites most unlikely \n     to be chosen for new development and thereby forcing new \n     development away from the areas most in need of economic \n     growth and job creation; and\n       (2) broad Federal regulations often have unintended social \n     and economic consequences in urban areas where such \n     regulations, among other things--\n       (A) offend basic notions of common sense, particularly when \n     applied to individual sites;\n       (B) adversely impact economic stability;\n       (C) result in the unnecessary loss of existing jobs and \n     businesses;\n       (D) undermine new economic development, especially in \n     previously used sites;\n       (E) create undue economic hardships while failing \n     significantly to protect human health, particularly in areas \n     where economic development is urgently needed in order to \n     improve the health and welfare of residents over the long \n     term; and\n       (F) contribute to social deterioration to such degree that \n     high unemployment, crime, and economic and social problems \n     create the greatest risk to the health and well-being of \n     urban residents.\n\n     SEC. 203. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are to--\n       (1) enable qualifying cites to provide for the general \n     well-being, health, safety and security for their residents \n     living in distressed areas by empowering such cities to \n     obtain selective relief from Federal regulations that \n     undermine economic stability and development in distressed \n     areas within the city; and\n       (2) authorize Federal agencies to waive the application of \n     specific Federal regulations in distressed urban areas \n     designated as Urban Regulatory Relief Zones by an Economic \n     Development Commission--\n       (A) upon application through the Office of Management and \n     Budget by an Economic Development Commission established by a \n     qualifying city pursuant to section 205; and\n       (B) upon a determination by the appropriate Federal agency \n     that granting such a waiver will not substantially endanger \n     health or safety.\n\n     SEC. 204.

A bill to require Congress to specify the source of \nauthority under the U.S. Constitution for the enactment of laws, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n    LEGISLATION REQUIRING SPECIFICATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two pieces of \nlegislation. One is a bill and the other is a resolution. The effect of \neach is to require that every law that passes through this Chamber \nexplicitly state the constitutional authority pursuant to which it is \nbeing enacted.\n  I believe this requirement will help this body by giving us occasion \nto pause and reflect on whether the legislation we are considering is \nin fact within the province of the national government.\n  It will also help the American people evaluate our work, keeping in \nmind the question of constitutionality as well as the immediate policy \nquestions presented by the bill.\n  And it may discourage us, at least at the margin, from adopting \nlegislation outside our proper sphere of authority and responsibility.\n  All these factors would enhance our citizenry's freedom and make it \neasier for them to exercise their self-governing authority at the State \nand local level--the level closest to the people.\n  Mr. President, it has become commonplace to observe that the \nelections of 1994 showed the voters' frustration with big government. \nIt seems clear to me that the American people feel that the Federal \nGovernment is interfering too much in their lives.\n  Whether through costly and ineffective Federal programs fraught with \nmicro-managing mandates, business regulations that increase prices and \ncost jobs, environmental controls that forbid farmers to use their own \nland in a reasonable fashion, or workplace rules that forbid workers \nfrom saving fellow workers from danger, the people have had enough of \nWashington-knows-best programs.\n  And I believe the people are right to be concerned about a government \nthat considers everything in life to be a proper subject for Federal \nlegislation. We are in danger in this country of instituting a kind of \nsoft despotism that will crush our democratic liberty under the weight \nof well-intentioned but overzealous regulations and programs. Intended \nto serve the people, these laws may enslave them by taking away too \nmuch of their natural freedom of action.\n  That is not the National Government that our Framers envisioned. \nClearly there are areas where the Federal Government should intervene \nto protect people's health, safety and rights. But there must likewise \nbe areas in which the Federal Government cannot intervene in regulating \nthe peoples' lives.\n  The Framers of our Constitution believed they had devised a system \nthat would separate these areas from each other. They thought that one \nof the powerful limitations on the National Government would be the \nprinciple that the Congress could exercise only the limited, enumerated \npowers granted it by the people and set out in the Constitution.\n  That principle was made clear in the original Constitution, which \ngave Congress not general legislative authority but only ``all \nlegislative powers herein granted.'' And it was emphasized by the \nadoption of the 10th amendment in the Bill of Rights, which states that \n``The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, \nnor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States \nrespectively, or to the people.''\n  Until this last term the Supreme Court for decades had not struck \ndown a law as outside Congress's powers. As a result many people \nclaimed that the principle that Congress has only limited enumerated \npowers is a dead letter. But our everyday experience shows otherwise. \nEverybody knows that we do not turn to the National Government for help \nwith most problems in our everyday lives. We turn to family members, \nfriends, doctors, community or volunteer organizations, and churches; \nor to local government officials, such as school teachers, police men \nand women, and others.\n  The 1994 congressional elections were in large measure about the size \nof government. And in my view, Mr. President, those elections made one \nthing very clear: The belief that our National Government should have \nonly limited powers remains alive in the hearts of the people.\n  The most important efforts of this Congress have been undertaken to \nrespond to the people's demand for prompt and serious action to return \nthe National Government to its proper functions.\n  The budget that we have been debating for the past few days is the \nfirst in many years to take that responsibility very seriously.\n  The regulatory reform legislation currently on the floor is similarly \nan effort to impose reasonable and meaningful restrictions on the \ninterventions of regulatory bureaucracies in our lives.\n  The proposals to abolish Cabinet Departments will likewise get the \nNational Government out of areas where it does not belong.\n  It is in this context that we should consider the Supreme Court's \ndecision a few months ago in United States versus Lopez and the rather \nmodest legislative proposals I am introducing today. In Lopez, the \nSupreme Court for the first time in 60 years struck down an act of \nCongress as exceeding the powers granted it in the Constitution. The \nCourt ruled that a Federal law about guns in schools was beyond \nCongress' powers because its connection to commerce was too remote.\n  Now I think there are few higher priorities than reversing the \naccelerating decline of our schools into armed camps. But, not \nsurprisingly, so do the States, which is why almost all of them already \nhave laws addressing this problem.\n \n[[Page S 10148]]\n\n  Thus this important case is not about whether we should have guns in \nschools, but about whether policing the schools is principally the \nresponsibility of parents, local governments and States, or the \nresponsibility of Congress. The Court correctly found that the Framers \ndid not assign us that responsibility--which is just as well, since I \nhave no idea how we could possibly be in a position to figure out what \nis needed in every locality in the country.\n  The Court's opinion does signal something of a change in approach by \nthe Court to issues of this type. But it is always dangerous to read \ntoo much into an individual Supreme Court decision. Moreover, the Court \ndid not give much indication, other than something of a change in \nattitude, about how it would be approaching future cases.\n  I do not think we should be disappointed about this. After all, we in \nCongress's new majority should not leave it to the Supreme Court to do \nall of the thinking on this subject. The courts, Congress, and the \nPresident working together expanded government to its present \ndimensions. A similar cooperative effort by all three branches will \nlikely be needed to re-establish our central government's status as a \ngovernment of limited powers.\n  This will be no easy task. But it is our duty to make limited \ngovernment as much of a reality in the lives of Americans and American \nculture 30 years from now as the notion of inexorable expansion was \nuntil Ronald Reagan's election as President and the election of the \ncurrent Congress.\n  We have begun the difficult task of restoring ordered liberty in a \nnumber of ways in this Congress. Our efforts toward a balanced budget \npromise to return our Government to fiscal responsibility; to make us \nrecognize our duty to pay our bills and refrain from burdening our \nchildren with massive debts.\n  Our regulatory reform measures promise to rein in government agencies \nby forcing them to conduct real cost-benefit analyses, based on sound \nscience. In this way regulation will be reduced and limited to those \nthat actually will promote the public good.\n  Our steps toward elimination of unnecessary Cabinet Departments \npromise to reduce government's interference with our daily lives. By \neliminating unneeded Departments we will eliminate bureaucrats' drive \nto justify their jobs by finding new areas to regulate.\n  I do not for a minute equate the proposals I am introducing today \nwith these other efforts. I do believe however, that a requirement that \nwe include a statement of what power, granted it by the Constitution, \nCongress is using in enacting every piece of legislation, will play a \nmodest role in assisting our ongoing reexamination of the role and \nlimits of the National Government.\n  This requirement will perform three important functions.\n  First, it will encourage us to pause and reflect about where the law \nwe are considering enacting fits within the constitutional allocation \nof powers between the Federal Government and the States.\n  As Justices Kennedy and O'Connor noted in their concurrence in Lopez, \nthat is one of our important responsibilities:\n\n       It would be mistaken and mischievous for the political \n     branches to forget that the sworn obligation to preserve and \n     protect the Constitution in maintaining the federal balance \n     is their own in the first and primary instance.\n  A statement of constitutional authority also will put Congress' view \nof its constitutional authority on the record for the people to judge. \nThis will spur further useful reflection on our part and open up the \npossibility of conversation with the people on the subject of Federal \npowers.\n  Finally, such a statement also will help the courts evaluate the \nlegislation's constitutionality. Legislation that falls within our \nenumerated powers will more likely be upheld if it contains an explicit \nstatement of its constitutional authority. As important, we will be \nless likely to allow laws or regulations that overstep proper \nconstitutional bounds to pass out of this Chamber.\n  In this way we will protect the liberties of our people, the \nprerogatives of our States and local communities, and the structure of \nlimited government bequeathed to us by our Founders. We will, then, \ndefend that constitutional structure designed to foster virtue in the \npeople, discipline in the government and peace and prosperity in the \nnation.\n  I urge your support of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1039\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 \nto provide for an expanded Federal program of hazard mitigation, \nrelief, and insurance against the risk of catastrophic natural \ndisasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n                    NATURAL DISASTER PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Alaska has three times more earthquakes \nthan California. Since 1938, Alaska has had at least nine quakes of 7.4 \nmagnitude or more on the Richter scale. Alaska's 1965 Good Friday \nearthquake was one of the world's most powerful, at the magnitude of \n9.2 on the Richter scale.\n  Senator Inouye and I have been studying this matter. We find that \nover the last two decades Federal taxpayers have paid out over $140 \nbillion in aid following earthquakes.\n  Before 1989, the United States had never experienced a disaster \ncosting more than $1 billion in insured losses. Since then, we have had \nnine disasters that have cost more than $1 billion.\n  Today, Senator Inouye and I introduced a bill to try and reduce the \ncost to the Federal Government of earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods.\n  First, the bill will reduce Federal costs by expanding the use and \navailability of private insurance. The bill also disqualifies those who \ndo not buy private insurance from long-term Federal disaster \nassistance.\n  Second, the bill will provide incentives to improve the ability of \nbuildings to withstand disasters and, in doing so, will reduce the risk \nof injury to people. As one expert put it: ``It is buildings, not \nearthquakes, that kill people.''\n  And, third, the bill will create a national, privately funded \ncatastrophic insurance pool to shoulder the risk of very large \ndisasters.\n  Mr. President, the more private insurance individuals buy, the less \ndisaster relief Federal taxpayers must pay. For instance, if this bill \nhad been in place before Hurricane Andrew and California's Northridge \nearthquake, it would have reduced Federal costs by at least $5 billion.\n  Not only will the bill help reduce the costs to the Federal taxpayer, \nit will \n\n[[Page S 10149]]\nmake insurance more available for those in States with higher risk of \ndisaster.\n  Alaska has three times more quakes than California. Since 1938, \nAlaska has had at least nine quakes of 7.4 magnitude or more on the \nRichter scale. Alaska's 1964 Good Friday quake was one of the world's \nmost powerful at a magnitude of 9.2. I lived through that quake. The \nearth shook for 7 minutes. Most quakes last under 2 minutes. For \nexample, California's Northridge quake lasted about 30 seconds.\n  The Alaska quake destroyed the economic bases of entire communities. \nWhole fishing fleets, harbors, and canneries were lost. The shaking \ngenerated catastrophic tidal waves. Petroleum storage tanks ruptured \nand the contents caught fire. Burning oil ran into the bay and was \ncarried to the waterfront by the large waves. These waves of fire \ndestroyed docks, piers, and small-boat harbors. The effects of the 1964 \nquake were felt as far away as San Diego and Hawaii. Total property \ndamage was $311 million in 1964 dollars. Experts predict that a quake \nthis size in the lower 48 would kill thousands and cost up to $100 \nbillion.\n  About 100 miles off Alaska's coast and 10,000 feet below the sea, the \nocean floor is moving eastward. This drifting floor meets the North \nAmerican seabed at what is called the Yakataga seismic gap. Scientists \npredict that during our lifetimes, it is likely the seabed will move, \ngenerating a major quake and a huge tsunami.\n  Today, seismic instruments detect between 90 and 120 earthquakes per \nweek in Alaska. Of these, 1 to 3 quakes per week can be felt by people. \nIn May, the citizens of Anchorage awoke in the middle of the night to \nan earthquake that measured 5.5 on the Richter scale.\n  It is a mistake, however, to believe that the threat of a major quake \nis confined to California or Alaska.\n  Some of America's largest earthquakes have occurred in Tennessee and \nMissouri along the New Madrid fault. In the last century, four quakes, \nmeasuring up to 8.6 on the Richter Scale, struck that area. The shaking \nrang church bells in Boston 1,000 miles away.\n  Should a quake of that size hit this area today, FEMA estimates the \ndamage at $52 billion. One expert noted that the impact of a major \nquake in the central United States. today would only be exceeded in \ndevastation by a general nuclear attack on the Central Mississippi \nValley.\n  This bill is also important for areas prone to hurricanes and floods.\n  Only 20 percent of the homes in flood plains today have the flood \ninsurance required by current law.\n  Damage in Florida from Hurricane Andrew was 30 to 40 percent higher \nbecause building codes were not properly enforced. The bill will \nincrease the use of private insurance coverage for hurricanes and \nfloods. It will also improve the structures we live in to reduce damage \nfrom these hazards before they occur.\n  I hope we can move quickly on this bill this year.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce the \nreintroduction of the Natural Disaster Protection Act [NDPA] in an \neffort to create a comprehensive Federal strategy for disaster \npreparation and planning. I hope that many of my colleagues will join \nSenator Stevens and me as cosponsors, so that we can ensure that this \nbill is considered by the full Senate at the earliest possible \nopportunity. Time, however, is working against us.\n  Since our original legislation was introduced in the last Congress, \nwe have experienced time and time again why the bill is so urgently \nneeded. The earthquake which struck Los Angeles in January 1994 is now \nrated the second most costly disaster in United States history, adding \nmore than $11 billion to the Federal debt and saddling its victims, \nmost of whom were uninsured, with even greater losses. The tragic \nearthquake in Kobe, Japan, and the recent California and Midwest floods \nare just two further examples of nature's unpredictability.\n  This issue is very important to me particularly since Hurricane Iniki \nstruck my State in 1992, causing several billion dollars in damage and \nwidespread economic disruption. Unfortunately, there are millions of \nAmericans who know firsthand about the destruction and suffering caused \nby these terrible events.\n  What troubles me most is that the worst could still be ahead of us. \nThe U.S. Weather Service predicts that this year's hurricane season, \nwhich began a few weeks ago, could be worse than 1992, the year of \nHurricanes Andrew and Iniki. I am deeply concerned that we are not \nprepared for another major natural disaster. That is why we are \nrenewing our effort to enact major disaster policy reform.\n  We simply must insist that all segments of Government, not to mention \ninsurers and homeowners, are doing all that is prudently possible to \nprevent losses before they occur and to reduce the long term costs of \ndisasters to Federal taxpayers. We need better enforcement of building \ncodes, more thorough mitigation plans, and a funding mechanism that is \nboth predictable and adequate. We must make sure our citizens are \nprotected with adequate insurance so that those at greatest risk from \nhurricanes, earthquakes, and floods do not end up totally dependent on \ndisaster relief. We must also be certain that such an insurance system \nis capable of withstanding the worst-possible catastrophes. The NDPA \naccomplishes these aims and does so with a program that is totally \nself-funding.\n  This bill advocates private insurance as an alternative to costly \nFederal relief. It also creates a national disaster fund to assure the \navailability of private insurance before and after a major disaster and \npromotes better building practices and increased planning for \ncatastrophes. This legislation would encourage States and local \ngovernments to adopt building codes and the type of mitigation \nstrategies I mentioned, and it would provide them with funds derived \nfrom private industry, not the Federal Government, to implement those \nmeasures. The bill would substantially increase participation in \ninsurance programs for the perils homeowners face and provide for a \nFederal backstop of the private insurance market in the event of a \nmega-catastrophe which could result in extreme devastation and economic \ndisruption.\n  The new bill improves upon last year's legislation by relying \nprimarily on the private sector to address insurance availability \nissues and by modifying Federal disaster assistance programs to reduce \nthe share of disaster relief borne by U.S. taxpayers.\n  The NDPA enjoys the support of numerous State and local government \nofficials, and organizations representing homeowners, consumers, \nemergency management and response personnel, realtors, lenders, and the \ninsurance industry. It is clear that Members of Congress are beginning \nto recognize the problem we face in dealing with these catastrophic \nevents and want to do something about it.\n  Must we wait until another disaster on the scale of the Japanese \nearthquake strikes here in America before we do something? We are \ncommitted to bringing this important matter before the entire Senate at \nthe earliest possible opportunity. We need to act now, before it is too \nlate. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to join Senator Stevens and me \nin cosponsoring this bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. KASSEBAUM (for herself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Pell, and Mr. Simon):\n  S. 1044. A bill to amend title III of the Public Health Service Act \nto consolidate and reauthorize provisions relating to health centers, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n              THE HEALTH CENTERS CONSOLIDATION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce with \nSenators Kennedy, Jeffords, Pell, and Simon, the Health Centers \nConsolidation Act of 1995. This legislation consolidates and \nreauthorizes the community and migrant health center programs, the \nhealth care for the homeless program and the health services for \nresidents of public housing program as one streamlined, flexible \nprogram authority.\n  These programs play a vital role in ensuring access to health care \nservices for millions of medically-underserved Americans. Consolidating \nthe current, often duplicative authorities will simplify grant \napplication and recordkeeping requirements, freeing up time and money \nbetter spent on expanding \n\n[[Page S 10150]]\naccess to care. The legislation provides the enhanced program \nflexibility necessary to respond to the unique challenges of providing \nhealth care services to medically underserved populations.\n  This legislation also substantially strengthens the ability of health \ncenters to respond to our nation's changing health care environment \nthrough the development of provider networks and health plans to \nimprove access to better-coordinated, more cost-effective services. The \nability to form networks and health plans, including managed care \nplans, is particularly important as states are increasingly moving \ntheir Medicaid beneficiaries into managed care plans.\n  Finally, the Health Centers Consolidation Act responds to the unique \nchallenges of delivering health care services in rural areas. The \nlegislation authorizes and focuses the current rural health outreach \ngrant program on the formation of provider networks, including \ntelemedicine networks, to strengthen the rural health care delivery \nsystem, encourage the consolidation and coordination of services on a \nlocal and regional basis, and bring access to specialized services to \nremote rural areas.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Coats):\n  S. 1045. A bill to amend the National Foundation on the Arts and the \nHumanities Act of 1965, the Museum Services Act, and the Arts and \nArtifacts Indemnity Act to privatize the National Foundation on the \nArts and the Humanities and to transfer certain related functions, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                   THE NEA AND NEH PRIVATIZATION ACT\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I introduce my bill to privatize \nthe National Foundation for the Arts and the Humanities. I have sent a \ndetailed memo to all my colleagues regarding this bill, which I would \nlike to enter into the Record. The memo sets forth my reasons for \ndesigning a privatization plan, how it will work, and why I believe it \nwill work.\n  Here's a quick summary: Controversy and anger have swirled around the \nEndowments virtually since their creation. On one side we have \nconstituents who are upset that their tax dollars are subsidizing work \nthat they find aggressively offensive. This includes the work of \nMapplethorpe, funded by the NEA, as well as the National History \nStandards, funded by the NEH. On the other side we have artists and \nwriters who believe the Government is engaging in censorship when their \ngrant proposals are denied or their projects are edited.\n  The Endowments' troubles are not recent phenomena and they show no \nsign of dissipating anytime soon.\n  If we cannot re-create the NEA and NEH in a way that gets the \nGovernment out of the vortex of this maelstrom, at some point, the NEA \nor the NEH are going to fund one more project so objectionable that the \nAmerican people are going to take the matter out of our hands. And then \nthe endowments are going to be re-created right out of existence.\n  My bill provides for the gradual privatization of the endowments over \na 5-year period. It will reduce the budgets of the Endowments by 20 \npercent each year during that period, and also specifically allows the \nEndowments to use a portion of their budgets for the express purpose of \npromoting private fundraising activities during the phase-out period. \nAt the end of the 5 years, the Endowment's charter with the Federal \nGovernment will end. Finally, as a further inducement to private-\nfundraising, my bill includes a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nendorsing changes in the Tax Code to spur charitable giving to the arts \nand humanities.\n  The ``Endowments''--or, as I envision, the ``American Endowment for \nthe Arts and Humanities''--will then be free of Government control \neither as censors or as tax collectors for controversial artists.\n  I am confident that private national foundations in support of the \narts and humanities can succeed. The people we have heard from in \nsupport of the NEA and NEH--art enthusiasts, philanthropists, actors, \nand singers--will want to contribute to private arts and humanities \nfoundations. Assuming their belief in a national organization \nsupporting the arts and humanities is as ardent as they claim when they \nlobby Congress, there will be a wellspring of support for private \nendowments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my ``Dear Colleague'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 1995.\n     Re Privatizing the NEA and NEH: The right way to get \n         government out of arts.\n\n       Dear Colleague: I invite you to cosponsor my legislation to \n     privatize the National Endowment for the Arts and the \n     National Endowment for the Humanities.\n       It is beyond dispute that the arts and humanities are of \n     unparalleled importance to a civilized nation. Unfortunately, \n     the federal government's current method of ``supporting'' the \n     arts is neither substantial nor fair. Amid all the critical \n     accounts on both sides of the debate over the Endowments, it \n     seems to have been lost that these agencies actually \n     contributed surprisingly little to the arts or the humanities \n     in this country.\n       However sincere is Mary Chapin Carpenter's suggestion that \n     the ``Arts are as important as school lunches . . .,'' a \n     majority of citizens simply do not agree with this view. In a \n     time of extreme pressures on the federal budget, the NEA and \n     NEH's appropriations simply cannot be a priority expenditure. \n     For this reason alone (putting the Mapplethorpe and the \n     national history standards controversies et. al. aside) there \n     needs to be a plan to reduce the taxpayer's role in these \n     national endowments.\n       This attached memorandum outlines the Abraham legislation \n     to privatize the national endowments for the arts and \n     humanities.\n       If you would like to cosponsor this legislation, please \n     contact Ann Coulter at 4-3807.\n           Sincerely,\n     Spencer Abraham.\n                                                                    ____\n\n I. The National Endowment For The Arts And The National Endowment For \n                    The Humanities: Current Problems\n\n\n A. the national endowment for the arts and the national endowment for \n              the humanities are organizations in trouble\n\n       It is clear that the NEA and NEH are in trouble. They are \n     in trouble because many people question the need to spend the \n     taxpayers' money on such non-vital programs. Further, in this \n     era of budget austerity where funding for many social \n     programs is being significantly reduced, it is difficult to \n     rationalize full funding for the NEA and NEH. Finally, the \n     activities of the NEA and NEH run against the sensitivities \n     of many American taxpayers who are opposed to seeing their \n     dollars fund projects that they find objectionable. It is \n     this latter concern that has come into focus in recent weeks.\n       Shortly before the first scheduled Labor Committee mark-up \n     of the NEA and NEH, there were several critical news accounts \n     of the summer schedule at ``Highways,'' an NEA-funded \n     performance art center in California. The theater's brochure \n     listed acts intended ``to push the right wing into spiritual \n     contortions.'' Performances included ``Dyke Night,'' \n     described as ``our series of hot nights with hot dykes,'' and \n     ``Boys `R' Us,'' similarly billed as ``our continuing series \n     of hot summer nights with hot fags.'' Another number, titled \n     ``Not For Republicans,'' included a comedienne's discourse on \n     ``sex with Newt Gingrich's mother.''\n       The NEA's response to public criticism of this NEA grant? \n     ``[Highways] is consistent with the Endowment's \n     Congressionally-mandated mission of fostering `mutual respect \n     for the diverse beliefs and values of all persons and \n     groups,' '' wrote the current NEA Chairperson, Jane \n     Alexander, in a letter to various Senators dated June 26, \n     1995. Alexander went on to describe her alarm, not at \n     Highways' ``Ecco Lesbo-Ecco Homo'' summer program, but at \n     criticisms leveled at these NEA-funded performances: ``I am \n     concerned that once again the Endowment is being criticized \n     for supporting an institution that serves its community \n     well--this time, one that supports the work of homosexual and \n     minority artists . . . .'' She dismissed criticisms of the \n     ``sex with Newt Gingrich's mother'' routine as being \n     politically motivated: ``I am also concerned that we are \n     being criticized for Highways having presented comedienne \n     Marga Gomez because her stand-up routine pokes fun at the \n     current Congressional leadership.''\n       While much of the public objects to taxpayer-supported \n     performances like these, that is not the only quarter from \n     which opposition to federal funding of the NEA has come. The \n     Progressive Policy Institute, for example, (an offshoot of \n     the Democratic Leadership Council) stated in its 1993 \n     ``Mandate for Change'' that there should be ``no federal \n     role'' in the arts. In a Lou Harris poll taken in January, \n     1995, the NEA was at the top of the list of federal programs \n     Americans would like abolished--ahead of the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development, Public Broadcasting Service, \n     and the Energy Department. (43% of respondents wanted the \n     Endowment eliminated.)\n       Long before the ``Ecco Lesbo-Ecco Homo'' summer program at \n     Highways, there was Mapplethorpe and ``Piss Christ'' and the \n     performance art of Karen Finley and Ron Athey, to name just a \n     few of the more notorious NEA-funded projects. Provocations \n     like these may be a small percentage overall, \n\n[[Page S 10151]]\n     but each such sensational affront adds to the growing list of people \n     irrevocably opposed to the Endowment. Citizens who are \n     offended by having their tax revenues supporting the likes of \n     Mapplethorpe do not forget that offense just because the \n     Endowment manages to avoid funding another offensive project \n     for a short while. And Chairman Alexander's reaction to this \n     latest public outcry demonstrates pretty clearly that the NEA \n     is out of touch with the public's concerns.\n       The NEH is no less out of touch with the public whose tax \n     dollars it consumes. Through less outrageous--and less \n     suitable for sound-bites--the NEH's projects may well have a \n     longer lasting impact than the NEA's, because they infect \n     American education rather than only its art museums and \n     theaters. The national history standards released last \n     January by a group at UCLA were the product of an NEH grant. \n     Though intended to improve the education of all United States \n     students, so objectionable were the standards that, before \n     the ink was dry, 99 Senators voted in favor of a Sense of the \n     Senate resolution denouncing the standards.\n       Perhaps there are still enough votes in the Congress to \n     save the NEA and the NEH in their present form for a few more \n     years. But that will not end the disquietude and rancor \n     surrounding the agencies. And that will do nothing to prevent \n     any new NEA or NEH-funded affronts, each one adding to the \n     growing list of citizens opposed to the Endowments. Sooner or \n     later the Endowments are going to fund one more project so \n     offensive that the public will rise up and demand their \n     elimination. And then, there will be no time to assemble an \n     alternative mechanism to fund the arts and humanities on a \n     national level. Many of our States have arts and humanities \n     institutions that are not going to be able to survive a \n     withdrawal of federal funds cold turkey.\n       We shirk our obligation to the arts and humanities as well \n     as our obligation to the people if we refuse to acknowledge \n     that these are federal programs teetering toward abolition. \n     Now is the time to reconfigure the agencies in a way that is \n     built to last. The following proposal does just that. The \n     proposed bill combines a gradual phase-out of direct federal \n     funding with inducements to privatization, such as earmarking \n     a portion of the funds for private fundraising and proposing \n     additional tax incentives for charitable gifts to the arts \n     and humanities.\n                     b. halfway measures won't work\n\n       One thing that the history of the endowments proves is that \n     no matter who runs the organizations, maddening government \n     grants to the arts will continue to be made. Virtually since \n     the Endowment's first grant in 1965, the organization has \n     inspired opposition. In 1967, Congressional hearings were \n     held in response to public outcry over NEA-funded projects. \n     More recently, controversies in the late eighties begot not \n     quietude, but the Ron Athey performance \\1\\ in 1994--long \n     after ``Piss Christ.'' Endowment supporters are whistling \n     past the Endowments' graveyards if they operate on the \n     assumption that the affronts can be entirely eliminated with \n     a series of statutory restrictions. There will be more \n     controversies. Those interested in the NEA have considered a \n     variety of modifications to the Endowment's granting \n     authority intended to circumvent the problems. Across the \n     board and without question, these are doomed to failure.\n     \\1\\ Athey's performance consisted of slicing the back of \n     another man with razors, blotting the blood, and sending the \n     bloodied towels over audience members' heads. This caused \n     some consternation among the audience members, many of whom \n     fled the room. Athey and, it was assumed, his artistic \n     companion, are HIV-positive.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       1. Eliminating Individual Grants, For Example, Will Not \n     Stem Offensive Projects. A number of the more notorious \n     Endowment-supported projects have, in fact, been made \n     possible by Endowment grants to museums and other \n     institutions, rather than directly to the offending artists \n     themselves. These include NEA grants to the Walker Art Center \n     in Minneapolis and to P.S. 122, a theater in New York City, \n     both of which used NEA grant money to fund Ron Athey's \n     performance. In addition, the Whitney Museum of Art in New \n     York used a portion of its $200,000 NEA grant to sponsor \n     ``Abject Art: Repulsion and Desire in Art,'' which exhibited \n     excrement, dead animals, and similar objects to make the \n     artistic statement of: degrading the purity of an art museum. \n     These exhibits and others will not be affected by a ban on \n     individual grants.\n       2. Block Granting Endowment Money To The States Also Fails \n     To Prevent The Use Of Federal Dollars On Dubious Or \n     Potentially Objectionable Art. Indeed, many of the \n     institutions which have taken part in controversial projects \n     are also recipients of monies allocated by state arts \n     councils. Thus, for example, both the Walker and Whitney \n     Museums have been the beneficiaries of state and municipal \n     arts funding, the latter receiving $134,952 from the New York \n     State government and $5,000 from the city government in 1994. \n     Since New York will undoubtedly continue to receive a \n     disproportionate amount of Endowment money, taxpayers in \n     Tennessee, Ohio, and Illinois will essentially be subsidizing \n     art in New York. There is no reason to think New York State \n     arts panels will suddenly begin to use Endowment money only \n     to fund that which will play in Peoria.\n       3. An Across-The-Board Reduction In The NEA and NEH's \n     Budgets Doesn't Make Sense. Some have suggested punishing the \n     NEA and NEH for their irresponsible funding projects by \n     cutting the Endowments' budgets by some arbitrary percentage. \n     But the NEA and NEH are either beneficial in their current \n     structures or they aren't. The better solution is to attempt \n     to preserve both a national arts foundation and a national \n     humanities foundation at appropriate funding levels, but \n     without requiring the taxpayers' involuntary contributions.\n       4. Direct Federal Funding Of The Arts Forces The Federal \n     Government Into The Thankless Role Of Playing Either Censor \n     On One Hand Or Obscenity-Promoter On The Other. Since the \n     actual monetary value of NEA funding is virtually negligible \n     compared to private giving to the arts, the principal \n     argument for Endowment grants is their tremendous influence. \n     This, however, is a risky role. On one side we have \n     constituents who are upset that its tax dollars are \n     subsidizing work that they find aggressively offensive. And \n     it bears repeating that since 1967--two years after the NEA's \n     creation--its grants have been inciting controversy.\n       On the other side we have artists who believe the \n     government is engaging in censorship. One recipient of NEA \n     grants, Leonard Koscianski, has written that the NEA \n     ``excludes whole categories of art . . . from serious \n     consideration,'' citing watercolors as one of the categories \n     that has received very few NEA grants. Moreover, the NEA was \n     recently forced to settle a case for $252,000 brought by four \n     performance artists--Karen Finley, John Fleck, Holly Hughes, \n     and Tim Miller--who claimed they had been denied Endowment \n     grants on political grounds. Many other artists will not even \n     apply for an NEA grant because of the paperwork involved. \n     Reed Zitting, an instructor of theater arts and design at the \n     Interlochen School at Michigan, has observed that the \n     bureaucratic necessities of governments are antithetical to \n     the creative processes of art.\n       5. The More The Congress Tries To Respond To Taxpayer \n     Complaints About Their Money Funding Obscene Art--By Imposing \n     A Variety Of Restrictions On Endowment Grants--The More \n     Artists Will Have Legitimate Grounds To Complain About \n     Federal Government Censorship. Rules such as requiring \n     theaters to submit a complete and immutable schedule of the \n     entire season's events are unworkable, excessive and \n     intrusive. Another proposal has been to jettison seasonal \n     grants altogether. While that measure would provide the \n     federal government with a needed measure of control over \n     government grant money, it would also deprive an important \n     segment of the arts community of any grant money whatsoever. \n     It is simply impossible for the federal government to design \n     an organization to fund the arts staffed with federal \n     bureaucrats that does not in some sense engage in censorship \n     through its regulation. It doesn't help that the NEA has a \n     tin ear with respect to the public's concerns with projects \n     such as Highways' ``Ecco Lesbo-Ecco Homo'' summer program. \n     Furthermore, the much vaunted power of an NEA grant places \n     the federal government in a highly questionable role: Why \n     should the federal government be the arbiter of what is and \n     is not art and which artists will be famously successful and \n     which will wait tables?\n  c. the federal government's direct funding of the nea and neh also \nsubjects it to claims of discrimination by certain states and areas of \n                              the country\n\n       Some states' citizens are clearly short-changed by the \n     federal government's current distribution of NEA and NEH \n     grant money. In 1994, for example, New York City alone \n     received about 15% of the NEA's total budget, about 10-20 \n     times the amount the NEA gave certain states. Further, many \n     believe that rural areas are short changed by the Endowments. \n     Privately-funded Endowments remove the government as the \n     decisionmaker--and the federal taxpayer as the funding \n     source--from a selection process that inevitably strikes some \n     as unfair.\n\n                  II. How the Abraham Bill Would Work\n\n\n       a. moving toward privately funded endowments for the arts\n\n       Private Endowments awarding grantees money from private \n     donors will preserve the good things about the Endowment such \n     as the imprimatur of a national organization and the \n     financial support for the arts and humanities. Meanwhile, \n     though, the government will be out of the business of using \n     taxpayer money either to support obscenity or to censor \n     artists.\n       The Abraham bill would reduce the budgets of the Endowments \n     gradually over a five year period and also would allow the \n     Endowments to use a portion of their budgets for the express \n     purpose of promoting private fundraising activities during \n     the phase-out period.\n       At the end of five years, the Endowments' charter with the \n     federal government would end. The ``Endowments''--or as we \n     suggest, ``the American Arts and Humanities Endowment''--\n     would then be free of government bureaucrats either as \n     censors or as tax collectors for the arts. The newly free \n     arts and humanities organizations could reconfigure \n     themselves as a single tax deductible organization, as two \n     separate organizations, or in any manner their private boards \n     of directors deem desirable.\n\n\n     b. a progressive decrease in the nea and neh's federal budgets\n\n       Using the 1995 fiscal year appropriations as the base line, \n     the Endowment's budgets \n\n[[Page S 10152]]\n     would be reduced by twenty percent each year over a five year period. \n     This approach permits a gradual, orderly transition from \n     government-sponsored organs to private entities.\n       1. A Specific Set-Aside For Fundraising. In addition to \n     these absolute decreases, the Endowments will be authorized \n     to use an amount of their appropriations equal to 10% of the \n     cut amount for fundraising purposes alone. This amounts to 2% \n     of each Endowment's 1995 appropriation the first year, 4% the \n     second year, and so on. Thus, for example, in the first year \n     the NEH will be permitted over $3.5 million (2% of $175 \n     million) federal dollars for the sole purpose of encouraging \n     private fundraising on behalf of the humanities endowment.\n       2. Tax Incentives For Donations To The Arts and Humanities. \n     Finally, the bill would include a Sense-of-the-Senate \n     resolution proposing a return to tax deductions for \n     nonitemizers, elimination of the cap on deductions for \n     charitable contributions, and other tax benefits for \n     charitable donations. Since amending the Tax Code to \n     encourage charitable giving is not within the purview of the \n     Labor Committee, the Sense-of-the-Senate resolution appended \n     to the Endowment Privatization bill would simply make the \n     point that the Committee favors creating additional tax \n     incentives for charitable giving to the arts and humanities \n     (and all 501(c)(3)s), in lieu of direct government funding of \n     the NEA and NEH.\n\n                   III. The Abraham Proposal Can Work\n\n\na. although raising money is always hard, the nea and neh budgets are a \n    very small part of the nation's total arts and humanities budget\n\n       Some have expressed doubt that private donations can take \n     up the slack in government funding. It bears mentioning at \n     the outset then, that the NEA and NEH do not, in fact, \n     constitute a significant proportion of funding for the arts \n     and humanities in this country. It is difficult to isolate \n     ``the humanities'' for calculating private donations because \n     it encompasses such a wide range of prospective \n     philanthropies--museums, colleges and universities, music \n     academics, writing workshops, to name a few. Private \n     donations to the arts, however, are easily quantifiable.\n       In 1993, private giving to the arts totalled $9.57 billion. \n     Meanwhile, the NEA's total budget for 1995 is $167.4 million. \n     Thus, private giving to the arts in this country dwarfs the \n     NEA's contribution 50 times over. Not only does the NEA's \n     total annual funding of the arts amount to less than 1.7% of \n     private donations to the arts, but it is also less than the \n     states' contributions to the arts. In 1994, state \n     legislatures gave $265 million to the arts. Perhaps the more \n     striking comparison is to the annual operating budget of the \n     Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City. Its \n     budget for 1995 is almost twice that of the NEA's: $316 \n     million. Moreover, looked at from the perspective of the \n     recipient arts organization, the NEA's contributions are \n     still relatively insignificant. Thus, for example, the \n     sources of income for all the country's nonprofit theaters \n     breaks down as follows:\nB. LEAVING THE TAXPAYER OUT OF THE EQUATION DOES NOT REDUCE A NATIONAL \n                         ENDOWMENT'S PRESTIGE.\n\n       Since the actual monetary value of arts and humanities \n     funding provided by the NEA and NEH is very small compared to \n     private giving to the arts, the principal argument for NEA \n     and NEH grants is their glamour--the imprimatur of excellence \n     an Endowment grant provides. According to NEA Chairman Jane \n     Alexander, ``[T]he prestige of getting a grant from the \n     Endowment is often critical in leveraging legislatures to \n     provide additional funding.'' The prestige associated with a \n     grant from a national arts organization will not be lost \n     under a privately-funded Endowment. Indeed, the glamour of an \n     NEA grant will most likely expand because of the private \n     interests involved: Corporate sponsors will want to publicize \n     the results of their philanthropy--as will the privately-\n     funded Endowment itself, in order to attract more private \n     dollars.\n\n\n          C. WAYS TO PRIVATELY FUND A NATIONAL ENDOWMENT . . .\n\n       1. The Federal Government Can Still Play An Important Role. \n     There are several ways the federal government can help \n     private endowments succeed without direct contributions. \n     These include:\n       (a.) Tax Code Revisions Designed To Generally Stimulate \n     Charitable Giving Or Specifically Aid The New Foundations. A \n     variety of possible tax code changes could greatly enhance \n     private giving to the new foundations. Possible approaches \n     are:\n       Reinstituting tax deductions for nonitemizers, as was \n     permitted until the Tax Reform Act of 1986;\n       Elimination of the caps on charitable deductions; and\n       Instituting a tax credit of $50--$100 for charitable \n     donations to the newly-created private endowments.\n       (b.) Government Leaders' Involvement In National \n     Fundraising Efforts. Even if the government is not directly \n     funding the NEA and NEH, government officials can play a role \n     in helping the new endowments succeed. For example, a series \n     of Washington fundraising events featuring the President or \n     other highranking government officials can serve as a spur to \n     donations by major donors. Another option would be \n     fundraising appeal letters from prominent arts supporters in \n     government. Finally, government leaders who back the arts can \n     play a very helpful role recruiting major benefactors for the \n     Endowments.\n       2. Other Private Fundraising Efforts Have Unlimited \n     Potential. Besides the things the government can do to \n     support private Endowments, there is a role for private \n     organizations, individuals and corporations as well. Many \n     organizations will be able to raise money for a private NEA \n     and NEH through a wide array of activities. It also includes \n     several innovative ideas devised as potential unique sources \n     of funding for the endowments by those seeking a solution to \n     this situation.\n       Below are some ideas to be explored. This list is by no \n     means exclusive but it nonetheless illustrates the private \n     fundraising opportunities that have been used by other \n     charitable causes and which could be employed effectively for \n     the benefit of a private arts and humanities national \n     endowment.\n       (a.) Fundraising Events.--The actors, artists and musicians \n     who have publicly declared their avid commitment to the NEA \n     and NEH could conduct special concerts or benefits to support \n     the private endowments. Individual entertainers as well as \n     groups of entertainers routinely hold such benefits for \n     various charities and causes. Such star-supported events \n     certainly seem plausible when the beneficiaries are the arts \n     and\n      humanities. Moreover, now that cable television and pay-per-\n     view has penetrated such a substantial percentage of \n     America's households, the potential income from a \n     televised pay-per-view benefit concert featuring some of \n     the greats who have campaigned on behalf of the NEA (Garth \n     Brooks, Kenny G., Michael Bolton, etc.) is phenomenal. \n     Consider this: pay-per-view sports events such as \n     Wrestlemania and heavyweight championship boxing matches \n     bring in receipts of over $50 million.\n       (b.) Special Event Revenues.--Each year, during various \n     televised award ceremonies celebrating the arts such as the \n     Oscars, Emmys, Tonys, and so on, one hears a great deal of \n     support expressed for the NEA and NEH. These programs, which \n     are built around the appearance of entertainers who \n     frequently use these opportunities on camera to promote \n     funding for the endowments, are hugely profitable and \n     generate sizeable revenues for the networks that broadcast \n     them. In light of this--the question is, why not let the \n     Endowments receive some of the profits from these shows? If \n     the artists and entities who make these shows feasible want \n     to help the endowments, these shows constitute a great \n     vehicle.\n       As an alternative to the endowments receiving a share of \n     the profits from these programs, the artists who appear on \n     them and the academies who support such events could simply \n     turn the shows into pay-per-view programs from which the \n     endowments could receive virtually all of the net profits. \n     This year, for example, the Academy Awards show drew a world-\n     wide audience of over 500 million. If only 5% of that \n     audience was still willing to pay to watch the Oscars in the \n     amount that households across America pay to watch a second-\n     run movie on pay-per-view ($4.95 in the Washington metro \n     area) the Endowments could generate gross revenue of over \n     $100 million from the Oscars show alone! Add to that similar \n     revenues from such shows as the Emmy Awards, the Tony Awards, \n     the Country and Western Music Awards and the Grammys and \n     we're talking about total revenue greater than the current \n     funding for the NEA or the NEH.\n       (c.) Other Collaborative Efforts.--In addition to benefit \n     concerts and awards programs, there are other collaborative \n     efforts through which those who care deeply about the arts--\n     the artists themselves--can make privately funded endowments \n     work. The ``We Are The World'' recording is a good example of \n     the collaborative good that charitable causes can engender. \n     That recording brought together 45 music superstars to record \n     a single song; the resulting single, album, video, television \n     and radio specials, merchandise and associated enterprises \n     raised over $60 million for ``U.S.A. For Africa.'' In that so \n     many recording artists are supporters of the National Arts \n     and Humanities Endowments, private entities supporting the \n     arts and humanities would seem to be a natural beneficiary of \n     such collective philanthropy. Certainly, if the musicians who \n     have appeared before Congress to promote the Endowments (the \n     aforementioned Garth Brooks, Kenny G. Michael Bolton etc.) \n     were themselves to collaborate and recruit others for a \n     single recording each year or two, the private Endowments' \n     fundraising events would be hugely successful.\n       (d.) Paybacks for Commercially Successful Grants/Events.--\n     On occasion, the NEA and NEH have funded projects that become \n     great commercial successes, earning the grantee far more than \n     the amount of the original grant. When this happens, the \n     grantee could be required to reinvest some portion of the \n     proceeds back in the Endowment in return for the original \n     grant money. NEH-sponsored tourism events, for example, have \n     allowed grant recipients to reap financial benefits. \n     According to the NEH's own review, an endowment-sponsored \n     exhibit called ``The Age of Rubens'' at the Toledo Museum of \n     Art brought in approximately 226,000 visitors benefiting the \n     whole geographic region. Similarly, individual NEA and NEH \n     grantee who are able to bring their creative works to \n     lucrative markets like Broadway have some \n\n[[Page S 10153]]\n     moral debt to make the catalyst of their success--NEA and NEH support--\n     more widely available to other artists.\n       (e.) Traditional Major Donor Fund Raising.--In addition to \n     the ideas listed above, the new private endowments would also \n     be the beneficiaries of traditional philanthropic efforts \n     that other major institutions receive. Certainly, a national \n     organization charged with supporting the nation's arts and \n     humanities would attract large corporate and individual \n     donors who will want to be part of such prestigious \n     organizations. Since private giving to the arts in this \n     country already exceeds $9 billion a year, an increase of \n     just 1% in this base of support would establish a strong \n     funding foundation for the private endowments.\n\n                             IV. Conclusion\n\n       Through a five-year privatization of the NEA and NEH, the \n     Abraham bill permits the growth of private giving to the arts \n     (with government-supported fundraising during the \n     transition). The Abraham approach also proposes tax \n     incentives for charitable donations to create broad-based \n     opportunity for private giving; reinstatement of tax \n     deductions for non-itemizers may very well engender increased \n     funding of the arts.\n       More importantly though, privatization has the distinct \n     advantage of allowing the citizenry to direct those funds \n     more efficiently and without controversy. Simply decreasing \n     federal funding of the Endowments or providing for increased \n     block grants to the states fails to resolve the fundamental \n     problem associated with today's NEA and NEH. By contrast, \n     privatization removes the government from the unwinnable task \n     of balancing censorship and obscenity, once and for all.\n       Federal bureaucracies on every level are being scaled back \n     or eliminated entirely. Government programs, particularly \n     non-essential ones like the NEA and NEH, that can be replaced \n     with privately-run entities, must be. The manifest support \n     from an array of celebrities and arts patrons for the arts \n     and humanities makes clear that a reconstituted NEA and NEH \n     will thrive. In short, a privately-funded ``American \n     Endowment for the Arts'' and an ``American Endowment for the \n     Humanities'' can provide as much support for artists and \n     writers without the attendant, ongoing disputes faced by a \n     government-managed entity.\n       The people we have heard from in support of the NEA and \n     NEH--art enthusiasts, philanthropists, actors, and singers--\n     will want to contribute to private arts and humanities \n     foundations. Assuming their belief in a national organization \n     supporting the arts and humanities is an ardent as they claim \n     when they lobby Congress, there will be a wellspring of \n     support for private endowments.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/17/senate-section/article/S10147-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10147-S10153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Dole, Mr. Brown, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \n        DeWine, Mr. Kyl, and Mr. Kempthorne):\n  S. 1039. A bill to require Congress to specify the source of \nauthority under the U.S. Constitution for the enactment of laws, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n    LEGISLATION REQUIRING SPECIFICATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two pieces of \nlegislation. One is a bill and the other is a resolution. The effect of \neach is to require that every law that passes through this Chamber \nexplicitly state the constitutional authority pursuant to which it is \nbeing enacted.\n  I believe this requirement will help this body by giving us occasion \nto pause and reflect on whether the legislation we are considering is \nin fact within the province of the national government.\n  It will also help the American people evaluate our work, keeping in \nmind the question of constitutionality as well as the immediate policy \nquestions presented by the bill.\n  And it may discourage us, at least at the margin, from adopting \nlegislation outside our proper sphere of authority and responsibility.\n  All these factors would enhance our citizenry's freedom and make it \neasier for them to exercise their self-governing authority at the State \nand local level--the level closest to the people.\n  Mr. President, it has become commonplace to observe that the \nelections of 1994 showed the voters' frustration with big government. \nIt seems clear to me that the American people feel that the Federal \nGovernment is interfering too much in their lives.\n  Whether through costly and ineffective Federal programs fraught with \nmicro-managing mandates, business regulations that increase prices and \ncost jobs, environmental controls that forbid farmers to use their own \nland in a reasonable fashion, or workplace rules that forbid workers \nfrom saving fellow workers from danger, the people have had enough of \nWashington-knows-best programs.\n  And I believe the people are right to be concerned about a government \nthat considers everything in life to be a proper subject for Federal \nlegislation. We are in danger in this country of instituting a kind of \nsoft despotism that will crush our democratic liberty under the weight \nof well-intentioned but overzealous regulations and programs. Intended \nto serve the people, these laws may enslave them by taking away too \nmuch of their natural freedom of action.\n  That is not the National Government that our Framers envisioned. \nClearly there are areas where the Federal Government should intervene \nto protect people's health, safety and rights. But there must likewise \nbe areas in which the Federal Government cannot intervene in regulating \nthe peoples' lives.\n  The Framers of our Constitution believed they had devised a system \nthat would separate these areas from each other. They thought that one \nof the powerful limitations on the National Government would be the \nprinciple that the Congress could exercise only the limited, enumerated \npowers granted it by the people and set out in the Constitution.\n  That principle was made clear in the original Constitution, which \ngave Congress not general legislative authority but only ``all \nlegislative powers herein granted.'' And it was emphasized by the \nadoption of the 10th amendment in the Bill of Rights, which states that \n``The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, \nnor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States \nrespectively, or to the people.''\n  Until this last term the Supreme Court for decades had not struck \ndown a law as outside Congress's powers. As a result many people \nclaimed that the principle that Congress has only limited enumerated \npowers is a dead letter. But our everyday experience shows otherwise. \nEverybody knows that we do not turn to the National Government for help \nwith most problems in our everyday lives. We turn to family members, \nfriends, doctors, community or volunteer organizations, and churches; \nor to local government officials, such as school teachers, police men \nand women, and others.\n  The 1994 congressional elections were in large measure about the size \nof government. And in my view, Mr. President, those elections made one \nthing very clear: The belief that our National Government should have \nonly limited powers remains alive in the hearts of the people.\n  The most important efforts of this Congress have been undertaken to \nrespond to the people's demand for prompt and serious action to return \nthe National Government to its proper functions.\n  The budget that we have been debating for the past few days is the \nfirst in many years to take that responsibility very seriously.\n  The regulatory reform legislation currently on the floor is similarly \nan effort to impose reasonable and meaningful restrictions on the \ninterventions of regulatory bureaucracies in our lives.\n  The proposals to abolish Cabinet Departments will likewise get the \nNational Government out of areas where it does not belong.\n  It is in this context that we should consider the Supreme Court's \ndecision a few months ago in United States versus Lopez and the rather \nmodest legislative proposals I am introducing today. In Lopez, the \nSupreme Court for the first time in 60 years struck down an act of \nCongress as exceeding the powers granted it in the Constitution. The \nCourt ruled that a Federal law about guns in schools was beyond \nCongress' powers because its connection to commerce was too remote.\n  Now I think there are few higher priorities than reversing the \naccelerating decline of our schools into armed camps. But, not \nsurprisingly, so do the States, which is why almost all of them already \nhave laws addressing this problem.\n \n[[Page S 10148]]\n\n  Thus this important case is not about whether we should have guns in \nschools, but about whether policing the schools is principally the \nresponsibility of parents, local governments and States, or the \nresponsibility of Congress. The Court correctly found that the Framers \ndid not assign us that responsibility--which is just as well, since I \nhave no idea how we could possibly be in a position to figure out what \nis needed in every locality in the country.\n  The Court's opinion does signal something of a change in approach by \nthe Court to issues of this type. But it is always dangerous to read \ntoo much into an individual Supreme Court decision. Moreover, the Court \ndid not give much indication, other than something of a change in \nattitude, about how it would be approaching future cases.\n  I do not think we should be disappointed about this. After all, we in \nCongress's new majority should not leave it to the Supreme Court to do \nall of the thinking on this subject. The courts, Congress, and the \nPresident working together expanded government to its present \ndimensions. A similar cooperative effort by all three branches will \nlikely be needed to re-establish our central government's status as a \ngovernment of limited powers.\n  This will be no easy task. But it is our duty to make limited \ngovernment as much of a reality in the lives of Americans and American \nculture 30 years from now as the notion of inexorable expansion was \nuntil Ronald Reagan's election as President and the election of the \ncurrent Congress.\n  We have begun the difficult task of restoring ordered liberty in a \nnumber of ways in this Congress. Our efforts toward a balanced budget \npromise to return our Government to fiscal responsibility; to make us \nrecognize our duty to pay our bills and refrain from burdening our \nchildren with massive debts.\n  Our regulatory reform measures promise to rein in government agencies \nby forcing them to conduct real cost-benefit analyses, based on sound \nscience. In this way regulation will be reduced and limited to those \nthat actually will promote the public good.\n  Our steps toward elimination of unnecessary Cabinet Departments \npromise to reduce government's interference with our daily lives. By \neliminating unneeded Departments we will eliminate bureaucrats' drive \nto justify their jobs by finding new areas to regulate.\n  I do not for a minute equate the proposals I am introducing today \nwith these other efforts. I do believe however, that a requirement that \nwe include a statement of what power, granted it by the Constitution, \nCongress is using in enacting every piece of legislation, will play a \nmodest role in assisting our ongoing reexamination of the role and \nlimits of the National Government.\n  This requirement will perform three important functions.\n  First, it will encourage us to pause and reflect about where the law \nwe are considering enacting fits within the constitutional allocation \nof powers between the Federal Government and the States.\n  As Justices Kennedy and O'Connor noted in their concurrence in Lopez, \nthat is one of our important responsibilities:\n\n       It would be mistaken and mischievous for the political \n     branches to forget that the sworn obligation to preserve and \n     protect the Constitution in maintaining the federal balance \n     is their own in the first and primary instance.\n  A statement of constitutional authority also will put Congress' view \nof its constitutional authority on the record for the people to judge. \nThis will spur further useful reflection on our part and open up the \npossibility of conversation with the people on the subject of Federal \npowers.\n  Finally, such a statement also will help the courts evaluate the \nlegislation's constitutionality. Legislation that falls within our \nenumerated powers will more likely be upheld if it contains an explicit \nstatement of its constitutional authority. As important, we will be \nless likely to allow laws or regulations that overstep proper \nconstitutional bounds to pass out of this Chamber.\n  In this way we will protect the liberties of our people, the \nprerogatives of our States and local communities, and the structure of \nlimited government bequeathed to us by our Founders. We will, then, \ndefend that constitutional structure designed to foster virtue in the \npeople, discipline in the government and peace and prosperity in the \nnation.\n  I urge your support of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1039\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 \nto provide for an expanded Federal program of hazard mitigation, \nrelief, and insurance against the risk of catastrophic natural \ndisasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n                    NATURAL DISASTER PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Alaska has three times more earthquakes \nthan California. Since 1938, Alaska has had at least nine quakes of 7.4 \nmagnitude or more on the Richter scale. Alaska's 1965 Good Friday \nearthquake was one of the world's most powerful, at the magnitude of \n9.2 on the Richter scale.\n  Senator Inouye and I have been studying this matter. We find that \nover the last two decades Federal taxpayers have paid out over $140 \nbillion in aid following earthquakes.\n  Before 1989, the United States had never experienced a disaster \ncosting more than $1 billion in insured losses. Since then, we have had \nnine disasters that have cost more than $1 billion.\n  Today, Senator Inouye and I introduced a bill to try and reduce the \ncost to the Federal Government of earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods.\n  First, the bill will reduce Federal costs by expanding the use and \navailability of private insurance. The bill also disqualifies those who \ndo not buy private insurance from long-term Federal disaster \nassistance.\n  Second, the bill will provide incentives to improve the ability of \nbuildings to withstand disasters and, in doing so, will reduce the risk \nof injury to people. As one expert put it: ``It is buildings, not \nearthquakes, that kill people.''\n  And, third, the bill will create a national, privately funded \ncatastrophic insurance pool to shoulder the risk of very large \ndisasters.\n  Mr. President, the more private insurance individuals buy, the less \ndisaster relief Federal taxpayers must pay. For instance, if this bill \nhad been in place before Hurricane Andrew and California's Northridge \nearthquake, it would have reduced Federal costs by at least $5 billion.\n  Not only will the bill help reduce the costs to the Federal taxpayer, \nit will \n\n[[Page S 10149]]\nmake insurance more available for those in States with higher risk of \ndisaster.\n  Alaska has three times more quakes than California. Since 1938, \nAlaska has had at least nine quakes of 7.4 magnitude or more on the \nRichter scale. Alaska's 1964 Good Friday quake was one of the world's \nmost powerful at a magnitude of 9.2. I lived through that quake. The \nearth shook for 7 minutes. Most quakes last under 2 minutes. For \nexample, California's Northridge quake lasted about 30 seconds.\n  The Alaska quake destroyed the economic bases of entire communities. \nWhole fishing fleets, harbors, and canneries were lost. The shaking \ngenerated catastrophic tidal waves. Petroleum storage tanks ruptured \nand the contents caught fire. Burning oil ran into the bay and was \ncarried to the waterfront by the large waves. These waves of fire \ndestroyed docks, piers, and small-boat harbors. The effects of the 1964 \nquake were felt as far away as San Diego and Hawaii. Total property \ndamage was $311 million in 1964 dollars. Experts predict that a quake \nthis size in the lower 48 would kill thousands and cost up to $100 \nbillion.\n  About 100 miles off Alaska's coast and 10,000 feet below the sea, the \nocean floor is moving eastward. This drifting floor meets the North \nAmerican seabed at what is called the Yakataga seismic gap. Scientists \npredict that during our lifetimes, it is likely the seabed will move, \ngenerating a major quake and a huge tsunami.\n  Today, seismic instruments detect between 90 and 120 earthquakes per \nweek in Alaska. Of these, 1 to 3 quakes per week can be felt by people. \nIn May, the citizens of Anchorage awoke in the middle of the night to \nan earthquake that measured 5.5 on the Richter scale.\n  It is a mistake, however, to believe that the threat of a major quake \nis confined to California or Alaska.\n  Some of America's largest earthquakes have occurred in Tennessee and \nMissouri along the New Madrid fault. In the last century, four quakes, \nmeasuring up to 8.6 on the Richter Scale, struck that area. The shaking \nrang church bells in Boston 1,000 miles away.\n  Should a quake of that size hit this area today, FEMA estimates the \ndamage at $52 billion. One expert noted that the impact of a major \nquake in the central United States. today would only be exceeded in \ndevastation by a general nuclear attack on the Central Mississippi \nValley.\n  This bill is also important for areas prone to hurricanes and floods.\n  Only 20 percent of the homes in flood plains today have the flood \ninsurance required by current law.\n  Damage in Florida from Hurricane Andrew was 30 to 40 percent higher \nbecause building codes were not properly enforced. The bill will \nincrease the use of private insurance coverage for hurricanes and \nfloods. It will also improve the structures we live in to reduce damage \nfrom these hazards before they occur.\n  I hope we can move quickly on this bill this year.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce the \nreintroduction of the Natural Disaster Protection Act [NDPA] in an \neffort to create a comprehensive Federal strategy for disaster \npreparation and planning. I hope that many of my colleagues will join \nSenator Stevens and me as cosponsors, so that we can ensure that this \nbill is considered by the full Senate at the earliest possible \nopportunity. Time, however, is working against us.\n  Since our original legislation was introduced in the last Congress, \nwe have experienced time and time again why the bill is so urgently \nneeded. The earthquake which struck Los Angeles in January 1994 is now \nrated the second most costly disaster in United States history, adding \nmore than $11 billion to the Federal debt and saddling its victims, \nmost of whom were uninsured, with even greater losses. The tragic \nearthquake in Kobe, Japan, and the recent California and Midwest floods \nare just two further examples of nature's unpredictability.\n  This issue is very important to me particularly since Hurricane Iniki \nstruck my State in 1992, causing several billion dollars in damage and \nwidespread economic disruption. Unfortunately, there are millions of \nAmericans who know firsthand about the destruction and suffering caused \nby these terrible events.\n  What troubles me most is that the worst could still be ahead of us. \nThe U.S. Weather Service predicts that this year's hurricane season, \nwhich began a few weeks ago, could be worse than 1992, the year of \nHurricanes Andrew and Iniki. I am deeply concerned that we are not \nprepared for another major natural disaster. That is why we are \nrenewing our effort to enact major disaster policy reform.\n  We simply must insist that all segments of Government, not to mention \ninsurers and homeowners, are doing all that is prudently possible to \nprevent losses before they occur and to reduce the long term costs of \ndisasters to Federal taxpayers. We need better enforcement of building \ncodes, more thorough mitigation plans, and a funding mechanism that is \nboth predictable and adequate. We must make sure our citizens are \nprotected with adequate insurance so that those at greatest risk from \nhurricanes, earthquakes, and floods do not end up totally dependent on \ndisaster relief. We must also be certain that such an insurance system \nis capable of withstanding the worst-possible catastrophes. The NDPA \naccomplishes these aims and does so with a program that is totally \nself-funding.\n  This bill advocates private insurance as an alternative to costly \nFederal relief. It also creates a national disaster fund to assure the \navailability of private insurance before and after a major disaster and \npromotes better building practices and increased planning for \ncatastrophes. This legislation would encourage States and local \ngovernments to adopt building codes and the type of mitigation \nstrategies I mentioned, and it would provide them with funds derived \nfrom private industry, not the Federal Government, to implement those \nmeasures. The bill would substantially increase participation in \ninsurance programs for the perils homeowners face and provide for a \nFederal backstop of the private insurance market in the event of a \nmega-catastrophe which could result in extreme devastation and economic \ndisruption.\n  The new bill improves upon last year's legislation by relying \nprimarily on the private sector to address insurance availability \nissues and by modifying Federal disaster assistance programs to reduce \nthe share of disaster relief borne by U.S. taxpayers.\n  The NDPA enjoys the support of numerous State and local government \nofficials, and organizations representing homeowners, consumers, \nemergency management and response personnel, realtors, lenders, and the \ninsurance industry. It is clear that Members of Congress are beginning \nto recognize the problem we face in dealing with these catastrophic \nevents and want to do something about it.\n  Must we wait until another disaster on the scale of the Japanese \nearthquake strikes here in America before we do something? We are \ncommitted to bringing this important matter before the entire Senate at \nthe earliest possible opportunity. We need to act now, before it is too \nlate. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to join Senator Stevens and me \nin cosponsoring this bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. KASSEBAUM (for herself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Pell, and Mr. Simon):\n  S. 1044. A bill to amend title III of the Public Health Service Act \nto consolidate and reauthorize provisions relating to health centers, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n              THE HEALTH CENTERS CONSOLIDATION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce with \nSenators Kennedy, Jeffords, Pell, and Simon, the Health Centers \nConsolidation Act of 1995. This legislation consolidates and \nreauthorizes the community and migrant health center programs, the \nhealth care for the homeless program and the health services for \nresidents of public housing program as one streamlined, flexible \nprogram authority.\n  These programs play a vital role in ensuring access to health care \nservices for millions of medically-underserved Americans. Consolidating \nthe current, often duplicative authorities will simplify grant \napplication and recordkeeping requirements, freeing up time and money \nbetter spent on expanding \n\n[[Page S 10150]]\naccess to care. The legislation provides the enhanced program \nflexibility necessary to respond to the unique challenges of providing \nhealth care services to medically underserved populations.\n  This legislation also substantially strengthens the ability of health \ncenters to respond to our nation's changing health care environment \nthrough the development of provider networks and health plans to \nimprove access to better-coordinated, more cost-effective services. The \nability to form networks and health plans, including managed care \nplans, is particularly important as states are increasingly moving \ntheir Medicaid beneficiaries into managed care plans.\n  Finally, the Health Centers Consolidation Act responds to the unique \nchallenges of delivering health care services in rural areas. The \nlegislation authorizes and focuses the current rural health outreach \ngrant program on the formation of provider networks, including \ntelemedicine networks, to strengthen the rural health care delivery \nsystem, encourage the consolidation and coordination of services on a \nlocal and regional basis, and bring access to specialized services to \nremote rural areas.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Coats):\n  S. 1045. A bill to amend the National Foundation on the Arts and the \nHumanities Act of 1965, the Museum Services Act, and the Arts and \nArtifacts Indemnity Act to privatize the National Foundation on the \nArts and the Humanities and to transfer certain related functions, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                   THE NEA AND NEH PRIVATIZATION ACT\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I introduce my bill to privatize \nthe National Foundation for the Arts and the Humanities. I have sent a \ndetailed memo to all my colleagues regarding this bill, which I would \nlike to enter into the Record. The memo sets forth my reasons for \ndesigning a privatization plan, how it will work, and why I believe it \nwill work.\n  Here's a quick summary: Controversy and anger have swirled around the \nEndowments virtually since their creation. On one side we have \nconstituents who are upset that their tax dollars are subsidizing work \nthat they find aggressively offensive. This includes the work of \nMapplethorpe, funded by the NEA, as well as the National History \nStandards, funded by the NEH. On the other side we have artists and \nwriters who believe the Government is engaging in censorship when their \ngrant proposals are denied or their projects are edited.\n  The Endowments' troubles are not recent phenomena and they show no \nsign of dissipating anytime soon.\n  If we cannot re-create the NEA and NEH in a way that gets the \nGovernment out of the vortex of this maelstrom, at some point, the NEA \nor the NEH are going to fund one more project so objectionable that the \nAmerican people are going to take the matter out of our hands. And then \nthe endowments are going to be re-created right out of existence.\n  My bill provides for the gradual privatization of the endowments over \na 5-year period. It will reduce the budgets of the Endowments by 20 \npercent each year during that period, and also specifically allows the \nEndowments to use a portion of their budgets for the express purpose of \npromoting private fundraising activities during the phase-out period. \nAt the end of the 5 years, the Endowment's charter with the Federal \nGovernment will end. Finally, as a further inducement to private-\nfundraising, my bill includes a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nendorsing changes in the Tax Code to spur charitable giving to the arts \nand humanities.\n  The ``Endowments''--or, as I envision, the ``American Endowment for \nthe Arts and Humanities''--will then be free of Government control \neither as censors or as tax collectors for controversial artists.\n  I am confident that private national foundations in support of the \narts and humanities can succeed. The people we have heard from in \nsupport of the NEA and NEH--art enthusiasts, philanthropists, actors, \nand singers--will want to contribute to private arts and humanities \nfoundations. Assuming their belief in a national organization \nsupporting the arts and humanities is as ardent as they claim when they \nlobby Congress, there will be a wellspring of support for private \nendowments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my ``Dear Colleague'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 1995.\n     Re Privatizing the NEA and NEH: The right way to get \n         government out of arts.\n\n       Dear Colleague: I invite you to cosponsor my legislation to \n     privatize the National Endowment for the Arts and the \n     National Endowment for the Humanities.\n       It is beyond dispute that the arts and humanities are of \n     unparalleled importance to a civilized nation. Unfortunately, \n     the federal government's current method of ``supporting'' the \n     arts is neither substantial nor fair. Amid all the critical \n     accounts on both sides of the debate over the Endowments, it \n     seems to have been lost that these agencies actually \n     contributed surprisingly little to the arts or the humanities \n     in this country.\n       However sincere is Mary Chapin Carpenter's suggestion that \n     the ``Arts are as important as school lunches . . .,'' a \n     majority of citizens simply do not agree with this view. In a \n     time of extreme pressures on the federal budget, the NEA and \n     NEH's appropriations simply cannot be a priority expenditure. \n     For this reason alone (putting the Mapplethorpe and the \n     national history standards controversies et. al. aside) there \n     needs to be a plan to reduce the taxpayer's role in these \n     national endowments.\n       This attached memorandum outlines the Abraham legislation \n     to privatize the national endowments for the arts and \n     humanities.\n       If you would like to cosponsor this legislation, please \n     contact Ann Coulter at 4-3807.\n           Sincerely,\n     Spencer Abraham.\n                                                                    ____\n\n I. The National Endowment For The Arts And The National Endowment For \n                    The Humanities: Current Problems\n\n\n A. the national endowment for the arts and the national endowment for \n              the humanities are organizations in trouble\n\n       It is clear that the NEA and NEH are in trouble. They are \n     in trouble because many people question the need to spend the \n     taxpayers' money on such non-vital programs. Further, in this \n     era of budget austerity where funding for many social \n     programs is being significantly reduced, it is difficult to \n     rationalize full funding for the NEA and NEH. Finally, the \n     activities of the NEA and NEH run against the sensitivities \n     of many American taxpayers who are opposed to seeing their \n     dollars fund projects that they find objectionable. It is \n     this latter concern that has come into focus in recent weeks.\n       Shortly before the first scheduled Labor Committee mark-up \n     of the NEA and NEH, there were several critical news accounts \n     of the summer schedule at ``Highways,'' an NEA-funded \n     performance art center in California. The theater's brochure \n     listed acts intended ``to push the right wing into spiritual \n     contortions.'' Performances included ``Dyke Night,'' \n     described as ``our series of hot nights with hot dykes,'' and \n     ``Boys `R' Us,'' similarly billed as ``our continuing series \n     of hot summer nights with hot fags.'' Another number, titled \n     ``Not For Republicans,'' included a comedienne's discourse on \n     ``sex with Newt Gingrich's mother.''\n       The NEA's response to public criticism of this NEA grant? \n     ``[Highways] is consistent with the Endowment's \n     Congressionally-mandated mission of fostering `mutual respect \n     for the diverse beliefs and values of all persons and \n     groups,' '' wrote the current NEA Chairperson, Jane \n     Alexander, in a letter to various Senators dated June 26, \n     1995. Alexander went on to describe her alarm, not at \n     Highways' ``Ecco Lesbo-Ecco Homo'' summer program, but at \n     criticisms leveled at these NEA-funded performances: ``I am \n     concerned that once again the Endowment is being criticized \n     for supporting an institution that serves its community \n     well--this time, one that supports the work of homosexual and \n     minority artists . . . .'' She dismissed criticisms of the \n     ``sex with Newt Gingrich's mother'' routine as being \n     politically motivated: ``I am also concerned that we are \n     being criticized for Highways having presented comedienne \n     Marga Gomez because her stand-up routine pokes fun at the \n     current Congressional leadership.''\n       While much of the public objects to taxpayer-supported \n     performances like these, that is not the only quarter from \n     which opposition to federal funding of the NEA has come. The \n     Progressive Policy Institute, for example, (an offshoot of \n     the Democratic Leadership Council) stated in its 1993 \n     ``Mandate for Change'' that there should be ``no federal \n     role'' in the arts. In a Lou Harris poll taken in January, \n     1995, the NEA was at the top of the list of federal programs \n     Americans would like abolished--ahead of the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development, Public Broadcasting Service, \n     and the Energy Department. (43% of respondents wanted the \n     Endowment eliminated.)\n       Long before the ``Ecco Lesbo-Ecco Homo'' summer program at \n     Highways, there was Mapplethorpe and ``Piss Christ'' and the \n     performance art of Karen Finley and Ron Athey, to name just a \n     few of the more notorious NEA-funded projects. Provocations \n     like these may be a small percentage overall, \n\n[[Page S 10151]]\n     but each such sensational affront adds to the growing list of people \n     irrevocably opposed to the Endowment. Citizens who are \n     offended by having their tax revenues supporting the likes of \n     Mapplethorpe do not forget that offense just because the \n     Endowment manages to avoid funding another offensive project \n     for a short while. And Chairman Alexander's reaction to this \n     latest public outcry demonstrates pretty clearly that the NEA \n     is out of touch with the public's concerns.\n       The NEH is no less out of touch with the public whose tax \n     dollars it consumes. Through less outrageous--and less \n     suitable for sound-bites--the NEH's projects may well have a \n     longer lasting impact than the NEA's, because they infect \n     American education rather than only its art museums and \n     theaters. The national history standards released last \n     January by a group at UCLA were the product of an NEH grant. \n     Though intended to improve the education of all United States \n     students, so objectionable were the standards that, before \n     the ink was dry, 99 Senators voted in favor of a Sense of the \n     Senate resolution denouncing the standards.\n       Perhaps there are still enough votes in the Congress to \n     save the NEA and the NEH in their present form for a few more \n     years. But that will not end the disquietude and rancor \n     surrounding the agencies. And that will do nothing to prevent \n     any new NEA or NEH-funded affronts, each one adding to the \n     growing list of citizens opposed to the Endowments. Sooner or \n     later the Endowments are going to fund one more project so \n     offensive that the public will rise up and demand their \n     elimination. And then, there will be no time to assemble an \n     alternative mechanism to fund the arts and humanities on a \n     national level. Many of our States have arts and humanities \n     institutions that are not going to be able to survive a \n     withdrawal of federal funds cold turkey.\n       We shirk our obligation to the arts and humanities as well \n     as our obligation to the people if we refuse to acknowledge \n     that these are federal programs teetering toward abolition. \n     Now is the time to reconfigure the agencies in a way that is \n     built to last. The following proposal does just that. The \n     proposed bill combines a gradual phase-out of direct federal \n     funding with inducements to privatization, such as earmarking \n     a portion of the funds for private fundraising and proposing \n     additional tax incentives for charitable gifts to the arts \n     and humanities.\n                     b. halfway measures won't work\n\n       One thing that the history of the endowments proves is that \n     no matter who runs the organizations, maddening government \n     grants to the arts will continue to be made. Virtually since \n     the Endowment's first grant in 1965, the organization has \n     inspired opposition. In 1967, Congressional hearings were \n     held in response to public outcry over NEA-funded projects. \n     More recently, controversies in the late eighties begot not \n     quietude, but the Ron Athey performance \\1\\ in 1994--long \n     after ``Piss Christ.'' Endowment supporters are whistling \n     past the Endowments' graveyards if they operate on the \n     assumption that the affronts can be entirely eliminated with \n     a series of statutory restrictions. There will be more \n     controversies. Those interested in the NEA have considered a \n     variety of modifications to the Endowment's granting \n     authority intended to circumvent the problems. Across the \n     board and without question, these are doomed to failure.\n     \\1\\ Athey's performance consisted of slicing the back of \n     another man with razors, blotting the blood, and sending the \n     bloodied towels over audience members' heads. This caused \n     some consternation among the audience members, many of whom \n     fled the room. Athey and, it was assumed, his artistic \n     companion, are HIV-positive.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       1. Eliminating Individual Grants, For Example, Will Not \n     Stem Offensive Projects. A number of the more notorious \n     Endowment-supported projects have, in fact, been made \n     possible by Endowment grants to museums and other \n     institutions, rather than directly to the offending artists \n     themselves. These include NEA grants to the Walker Art Center \n     in Minneapolis and to P.S. 122, a theater in New York City, \n     both of which used NEA grant money to fund Ron Athey's \n     performance. In addition, the Whitney Museum of Art in New \n     York used a portion of its $200,000 NEA grant to sponsor \n     ``Abject Art: Repulsion and Desire in Art,'' which exhibited \n     excrement, dead animals, and similar objects to make the \n     artistic statement of: degrading the purity of an art museum. \n     These exhibits and others will not be affected by a ban on \n     individual grants.\n       2. Block Granting Endowment Money To The States Also Fails \n     To Prevent The Use Of Federal Dollars On Dubious Or \n     Potentially Objectionable Art. Indeed, many of the \n     institutions which have taken part in controversial projects \n     are also recipients of monies allocated by state arts \n     councils. Thus, for example, both the Walker and Whitney \n     Museums have been the beneficiaries of state and municipal \n     arts funding, the latter receiving $134,952 from the New York \n     State government and $5,000 from the city government in 1994. \n     Since New York will undoubtedly continue to receive a \n     disproportionate amount of Endowment money, taxpayers in \n     Tennessee, Ohio, and Illinois will essentially be subsidizing \n     art in New York. There is no reason to think New York State \n     arts panels will suddenly begin to use Endowment money only \n     to fund that which will play in Peoria.\n       3. An Across-The-Board Reduction In The NEA and NEH's \n     Budgets Doesn't Make Sense. Some have suggested punishing the \n     NEA and NEH for their irresponsible funding projects by \n     cutting the Endowments' budgets by some arbitrary percentage. \n     But the NEA and NEH are either beneficial in their current \n     structures or they aren't. The better solution is to attempt \n     to preserve both a national arts foundation and a national \n     humanities foundation at appropriate funding levels, but \n     without requiring the taxpayers' involuntary contributions.\n       4. Direct Federal Funding Of The Arts Forces The Federal \n     Government Into The Thankless Role Of Playing Either Censor \n     On One Hand Or Obscenity-Promoter On The Other. Since the \n     actual monetary value of NEA funding is virtually negligible \n     compared to private giving to the arts, the principal \n     argument for Endowment grants is their tremendous influence. \n     This, however, is a risky role. On one side we have \n     constituents who are upset that its tax dollars are \n     subsidizing work that they find aggressively offensive. And \n     it bears repeating that since 1967--two years after the NEA's \n     creation--its grants have been inciting controversy.\n       On the other side we have artists who believe the \n     government is engaging in censorship. One recipient of NEA \n     grants, Leonard Koscianski, has written that the NEA \n     ``excludes whole categories of art . . . from serious \n     consideration,'' citing watercolors as one of the categories \n     that has received very few NEA grants. Moreover, the NEA was \n     recently forced to settle a case for $252,000 brought by four \n     performance artists--Karen Finley, John Fleck, Holly Hughes, \n     and Tim Miller--who claimed they had been denied Endowment \n     grants on political grounds. Many other artists will not even \n     apply for an NEA grant because of the paperwork involved. \n     Reed Zitting, an instructor of theater arts and design at the \n     Interlochen School at Michigan, has observed that the \n     bureaucratic necessities of governments are antithetical to \n     the creative processes of art.\n       5. The More The Congress Tries To Respond To Taxpayer \n     Complaints About Their Money Funding Obscene Art--By Imposing \n     A Variety Of Restrictions On Endowment Grants--The More \n     Artists Will Have Legitimate Grounds To Complain About \n     Federal Government Censorship. Rules such as requiring \n     theaters to submit a complete and immutable schedule of the \n     entire season's events are unworkable, excessive and \n     intrusive. Another proposal has been to jettison seasonal \n     grants altogether. While that measure would provide the \n     federal government with a needed measure of control over \n     government grant money, it would also deprive an important \n     segment of the arts community of any grant money whatsoever. \n     It is simply impossible for the federal government to design \n     an organization to fund the arts staffed with federal \n     bureaucrats that does not in some sense engage in censorship \n     through its regulation. It doesn't help that the NEA has a \n     tin ear with respect to the public's concerns with projects \n     such as Highways' ``Ecco Lesbo-Ecco Homo'' summer program. \n     Furthermore, the much vaunted power of an NEA grant places \n     the federal government in a highly questionable role: Why \n     should the federal government be the arbiter of what is and \n     is not art and which artists will be famously successful and \n     which will wait tables?\n  c. the federal government's direct funding of the nea and neh also \nsubjects it to claims of discrimination by certain states and areas of \n                              the country\n\n       Some states' citizens are clearly short-changed by the \n     federal government's current distribution of NEA and NEH \n     grant money. In 1994, for example, New York City alone \n     received about 15% of the NEA's total budget, about 10-20 \n     times the amount the NEA gave certain states. Further, many \n     believe that rural areas are short changed by the Endowments. \n     Privately-funded Endowments remove the government as the \n     decisionmaker--and the federal taxpayer as the funding \n     source--from a selection process that inevitably strikes some \n     as unfair.\n\n                  II. How the Abraham Bill Would Work\n\n\n       a. moving toward privately funded endowments for the arts\n\n       Private Endowments awarding grantees money from private \n     donors will preserve the good things about the Endowment such \n     as the imprimatur of a national organization and the \n     financial support for the arts and humanities. Meanwhile, \n     though, the government will be out of the business of using \n     taxpayer money either to support obscenity or to censor \n     artists.\n       The Abraham bill would reduce the budgets of the Endowments \n     gradually over a five year period and also would allow the \n     Endowments to use a portion of their budgets for the express \n     purpose of promoting private fundraising activities during \n     the phase-out period.\n       At the end of five years, the Endowments' charter with the \n     federal government would end. The ``Endowments''--or as we \n     suggest, ``the American Arts and Humanities Endowment''--\n     would then be free of government bureaucrats either as \n     censors or as tax collectors for the arts. The newly free \n     arts and humanities organizations could reconfigure \n     themselves as a single tax deductible organization, as two \n     separate organizations, or in any manner their private boards \n     of directors deem desirable.\n\n\n     b. a progressive decrease in the nea and neh's federal budgets\n\n       Using the 1995 fiscal year appropriations as the base line, \n     the Endowment's budgets \n\n[[Page S 10152]]\n     would be reduced by twenty percent each year over a five year period. \n     This approach permits a gradual, orderly transition from \n     government-sponsored organs to private entities.\n       1. A Specific Set-Aside For Fundraising. In addition to \n     these absolute decreases, the Endowments will be authorized \n     to use an amount of their appropriations equal to 10% of the \n     cut amount for fundraising purposes alone. This amounts to 2% \n     of each Endowment's 1995 appropriation the first year, 4% the \n     second year, and so on. Thus, for example, in the first year \n     the NEH will be permitted over $3.5 million (2% of $175 \n     million) federal dollars for the sole purpose of encouraging \n     private fundraising on behalf of the humanities endowment.\n       2. Tax Incentives For Donations To The Arts and Humanities. \n     Finally, the bill would include a Sense-of-the-Senate \n     resolution proposing a return to tax deductions for \n     nonitemizers, elimination of the cap on deductions for \n     charitable contributions, and other tax benefits for \n     charitable donations. Since amending the Tax Code to \n     encourage charitable giving is not within the purview of the \n     Labor Committee, the Sense-of-the-Senate resolution appended \n     to the Endowment Privatization bill would simply make the \n     point that the Committee favors creating additional tax \n     incentives for charitable giving to the arts and humanities \n     (and all 501(c)(3)s), in lieu of direct government funding of \n     the NEA and NEH.\n\n                   III. The Abraham Proposal Can Work\n\n\na. although raising money is always hard, the nea and neh budgets are a \n    very small part of the nation's total arts and humanities budget\n\n       Some have expressed doubt that private donations can take \n     up the slack in government funding. It bears mentioning at \n     the outset then, that the NEA and NEH do not, in fact, \n     constitute a significant proportion of funding for the arts \n     and humanities in this country. It is difficult to isolate \n     ``the humanities'' for calculating private donations because \n     it encompasses such a wide range of prospective \n     philanthropies--museums, colleges and universities, music \n     academics, writing workshops, to name a few. Private \n     donations to the arts, however, are easily quantifiable.\n       In 1993, private giving to the arts totalled $9.57 billion. \n     Meanwhile, the NEA's total budget for 1995 is $167.4 million. \n     Thus, private giving to the arts in this country dwarfs the \n     NEA's contribution 50 times over. Not only does the NEA's \n     total annual funding of the arts amount to less than 1.7% of \n     private donations to the arts, but it is also less than the \n     states' contributions to the arts. In 1994, state \n     legislatures gave $265 million to the arts. Perhaps the more \n     striking comparison is to the annual operating budget of the \n     Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City. Its \n     budget for 1995 is almost twice that of the NEA's: $316 \n     million. Moreover, looked at from the perspective of the \n     recipient arts organization, the NEA's contributions are \n     still relatively insignificant. Thus, for example, the \n     sources of income for all the country's nonprofit theaters \n     breaks down as follows:\nB. LEAVING THE TAXPAYER OUT OF THE EQUATION DOES NOT REDUCE A NATIONAL \n                         ENDOWMENT'S PRESTIGE.\n\n       Since the actual monetary value of arts and humanities \n     funding provided by the NEA and NEH is very small compared to \n     private giving to the arts, the principal argument for NEA \n     and NEH grants is their glamour--the imprimatur of excellence \n     an Endowment grant provides. According to NEA Chairman Jane \n     Alexander, ``[T]he prestige of getting a grant from the \n     Endowment is often critical in leveraging legislatures to \n     provide additional funding.'' The prestige associated with a \n     grant from a national arts organization will not be lost \n     under a privately-funded Endowment. Indeed, the glamour of an \n     NEA grant will most likely expand because of the private \n     interests involved: Corporate sponsors will want to publicize \n     the results of their philanthropy--as will the privately-\n     funded Endowment itself, in order to attract more private \n     dollars.\n\n\n          C. WAYS TO PRIVATELY FUND A NATIONAL ENDOWMENT . . .\n\n       1. The Federal Government Can Still Play An Important Role. \n     There are several ways the federal government can help \n     private endowments succeed without direct contributions. \n     These include:\n       (a.) Tax Code Revisions Designed To Generally Stimulate \n     Charitable Giving Or Specifically Aid The New Foundations. A \n     variety of possible tax code changes could greatly enhance \n     private giving to the new foundations. Possible approaches \n     are:\n       Reinstituting tax deductions for nonitemizers, as was \n     permitted until the Tax Reform Act of 1986;\n       Elimination of the caps on charitable deductions; and\n       Instituting a tax credit of $50--$100 for charitable \n     donations to the newly-created private endowments.\n       (b.) Government Leaders' Involvement In National \n     Fundraising Efforts. Even if the government is not directly \n     funding the NEA and NEH, government officials can play a role \n     in helping the new endowments succeed. For example, a series \n     of Washington fundraising events featuring the President or \n     other highranking government officials can serve as a spur to \n     donations by major donors. Another option would be \n     fundraising appeal letters from prominent arts supporters in \n     government. Finally, government leaders who back the arts can \n     play a very helpful role recruiting major benefactors for the \n     Endowments.\n       2. Other Private Fundraising Efforts Have Unlimited \n     Potential. Besides the things the government can do to \n     support private Endowments, there is a role for private \n     organizations, individuals and corporations as well. Many \n     organizations will be able to raise money for a private NEA \n     and NEH through a wide array of activities. It also includes \n     several innovative ideas devised as potential unique sources \n     of funding for the endowments by those seeking a solution to \n     this situation.\n       Below are some ideas to be explored. This list is by no \n     means exclusive but it nonetheless illustrates the private \n     fundraising opportunities that have been used by other \n     charitable causes and which could be employed effectively for \n     the benefit of a private arts and humanities national \n     endowment.\n       (a.) Fundraising Events.--The actors, artists and musicians \n     who have publicly declared their avid commitment to the NEA \n     and NEH could conduct special concerts or benefits to support \n     the private endowments. Individual entertainers as well as \n     groups of entertainers routinely hold such benefits for \n     various charities and causes. Such star-supported events \n     certainly seem plausible when the beneficiaries are the arts \n     and\n      humanities. Moreover, now that cable television and pay-per-\n     view has penetrated such a substantial percentage of \n     America's households, the potential income from a \n     televised pay-per-view benefit concert featuring some of \n     the greats who have campaigned on behalf of the NEA (Garth \n     Brooks, Kenny G., Michael Bolton, etc.) is phenomenal. \n     Consider this: pay-per-view sports events such as \n     Wrestlemania and heavyweight championship boxing matches \n     bring in receipts of over $50 million.\n       (b.) Special Event Revenues.--Each year, during various \n     televised award ceremonies celebrating the arts such as the \n     Oscars, Emmys, Tonys, and so on, one hears a great deal of \n     support expressed for the NEA and NEH. These programs, which \n     are built around the appearance of entertainers who \n     frequently use these opportunities on camera to promote \n     funding for the endowments, are hugely profitable and \n     generate sizeable revenues for the networks that broadcast \n     them. In light of this--the question is, why not let the \n     Endowments receive some of the profits from these shows? If \n     the artists and entities who make these shows feasible want \n     to help the endowments, these shows constitute a great \n     vehicle.\n       As an alternative to the endowments receiving a share of \n     the profits from these programs, the artists who appear on \n     them and the academies who support such events could simply \n     turn the shows into pay-per-view programs from which the \n     endowments could receive virtually all of the net profits. \n     This year, for example, the Academy Awards show drew a world-\n     wide audience of over 500 million. If only 5% of that \n     audience was still willing to pay to watch the Oscars in the \n     amount that households across America pay to watch a second-\n     run movie on pay-per-view ($4.95 in the Washington metro \n     area) the Endowments could generate gross revenue of over \n     $100 million from the Oscars show alone! Add to that similar \n     revenues from such shows as the Emmy Awards, the Tony Awards, \n     the Country and Western Music Awards and the Grammys and \n     we're talking about total revenue greater than the current \n     funding for the NEA or the NEH.\n       (c.) Other Collaborative Efforts.--In addition to benefit \n     concerts and awards programs, there are other collaborative \n     efforts through which those who care deeply about the arts--\n     the artists themselves--can make privately funded endowments \n     work. The ``We Are The World'' recording is a good example of \n     the collaborative good that charitable causes can engender. \n     That recording brought together 45 music superstars to record \n     a single song; the resulting single, album, video, television \n     and radio specials, merchandise and associated enterprises \n     raised over $60 million for ``U.S.A. For Africa.'' In that so \n     many recording artists are supporters of the National Arts \n     and Humanities Endowments, private entities supporting the \n     arts and humanities would seem to be a natural beneficiary of \n     such collective philanthropy. Certainly, if the musicians who \n     have appeared before Congress to promote the Endowments (the \n     aforementioned Garth Brooks, Kenny G. Michael Bolton etc.) \n     were themselves to collaborate and recruit others for a \n     single recording each year or two, the private Endowments' \n     fundraising events would be hugely successful.\n       (d.) Paybacks for Commercially Successful Grants/Events.--\n     On occasion, the NEA and NEH have funded projects that become \n     great commercial successes, earning the grantee far more than \n     the amount of the original grant. When this happens, the \n     grantee could be required to reinvest some portion of the \n     proceeds back in the Endowment in return for the original \n     grant money. NEH-sponsored tourism events, for example, have \n     allowed grant recipients to reap financial benefits. \n     According to the NEH's own review, an endowment-sponsored \n     exhibit called ``The Age of Rubens'' at the Toledo Museum of \n     Art brought in approximately 226,000 visitors benefiting the \n     whole geographic region. Similarly, individual NEA and NEH \n     grantee who are able to bring their creative works to \n     lucrative markets like Broadway have some \n\n[[Page S 10153]]\n     moral debt to make the catalyst of their success--NEA and NEH support--\n     more widely available to other artists.\n       (e.) Traditional Major Donor Fund Raising.--In addition to \n     the ideas listed above, the new private endowments would also \n     be the beneficiaries of traditional philanthropic efforts \n     that other major institutions receive. Certainly, a national \n     organization charged with supporting the nation's arts and \n     humanities would attract large corporate and individual \n     donors who will want to be part of such prestigious \n     organizations. Since private giving to the arts in this \n     country already exceeds $9 billion a year, an increase of \n     just 1% in this base of support would establish a strong \n     funding foundation for the private endowments.\n\n                             IV. Conclusion\n\n       Through a five-year privatization of the NEA and NEH, the \n     Abraham bill permits the growth of private giving to the arts \n     (with government-supported fundraising during the \n     transition). The Abraham approach also proposes tax \n     incentives for charitable donations to create broad-based \n     opportunity for private giving; reinstatement of tax \n     deductions for non-itemizers may very well engender increased \n     funding of the arts.\n       More importantly though, privatization has the distinct \n     advantage of allowing the citizenry to direct those funds \n     more efficiently and without controversy. Simply decreasing \n     federal funding of the Endowments or providing for increased \n     block grants to the states fails to resolve the fundamental \n     problem associated with today's NEA and NEH. By contrast, \n     privatization removes the government from the unwinnable task \n     of balancing censorship and obscenity, once and for all.\n       Federal bureaucracies on every level are being scaled back \n     or eliminated entirely. Government programs, particularly \n     non-essential ones like the NEA and NEH, that can be replaced \n     with privately-run entities, must be. The manifest support \n     from an array of celebrities and arts patrons for the arts \n     and humanities makes clear that a reconstituted NEA and NEH \n     will thrive. In short, a privately-funded ``American \n     Endowment for the Arts'' and an ``American Endowment for the \n     Humanities'' can provide as much support for artists and \n     writers without the attendant, ongoing disputes faced by a \n     government-managed entity.\n       The people we have heard from in support of the NEA and \n     NEH--art enthusiasts, philanthropists, actors, and singers--\n     will want to contribute to private arts and humanities \n     foundations. Assuming their belief in a national organization \n     supporting the arts and humanities is an ardent as they claim \n     when they lobby Congress, there will be a wellspring of \n     support for private endowments.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/17/senate-section/article/S10147-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 295\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from \nColorado [Mr. Brown] was added as a cosponsor of S. 295, a bill to \npermit labor management cooperative efforts that improve America's \neconomic competitiveness to continue to thrive, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 304\n\n  At the request of Mr. Santorum, the name of the Senator from Hawaii \n[Mr. Inouye] was added as a cosponsor of S. 304, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the transportation fuels tax \napplicable to commercial aviation.\n\n\n                                 S. 457\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, his name was added as a cosponsor of \nS. 457, a bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to update \nreferences in the classification of children for purposes of United \nStates immigration laws.\n  At the request of Mr. Simon, the name of the Senator from Utah [Mr. \nBennett] was added as a cosponsor of S. 457, supra.\n\n\n                                 S. 789\n\n  At the request of Mr. Chafee, the name of the Senator from Utah [Mr. \nHatch] was added as a cosponsor of S. 789, a bill to amend the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 to make permanent the section 170(e)(5) rules \npertaining to gifts of publicly-traded stock to certain private \nfoundations, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 920\n\n  At the request of Mr. Pressler, the name of the Senator from Iowa \n[Mr. Harkin] was added as a cosponsor of S. 920, a bill to assist the \npreservation of rail infrastructure, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 959\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Minnesota \n[Mr. Grams] was added as a cosponsor of S. 959, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage capital formation through \nreductions in taxes on capital gains, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 968\n\n  At the request of Mr. McConnell, the names of the Senator from New \nHampshire [Mr. Smith], the Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], and the \nSenator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] were added as cosponsors of S. 968, \na bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to prohibit the import, \nexport, sale, purchase, and possession of bear viscera or products that \ncontain or claim to contain bear viscera, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1009\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the name of the Senator from Iowa [Mr. \nGrassley] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1009, a bill to prohibit the \nfraudulent production, sale, transportation, or possession of \nfictitious items purporting to be valid financial instruments of the \nUnited States, foreign governments, States, political subdivisions, or \nprivate organizations, to increase the penalties for counterfeiting \nviolations, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1028\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the names of the Senator from Maine \n[Mr. Cohen], the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson], the Senator from \nWest Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller], and the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. \nKerrey] were added as cosponsors of S. 1028, a bill to provide \nincreased access to health care benefits, to provide increased \nportability of health care benefits, to provide increased security of \nhealth care benefits, to increase the purchasing power of individuals \nand small employers, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1533\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato his name was added as a cosponsor of \namendment No. 1533 proposed to S. 343, a bill to reform the regulatory \nprocess, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/17/senate-section/article/S10153-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 152--STATEMENT OF CONSTITUTIONALITY REQUIREMENT\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

MORATORIUM ON REGULATIONS; CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW.\n\n       (a) Reporting and Review of Regulations.--\n       (1) Reporting to congress and the comptroller general.--\n       (A) Before a rule can take effect as a final rule, the \n     Federal agency promulgating such rule shall submit to each \n     House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General a report \n     containing--\n       (i) a copy of the rule;\n       (ii) a concise general statement relating to the rule; and\n       (iii) the proposed effective date of the rule.\n       (B) The Federal agency promulgating the rule shall make \n     available to each House of Congress and the Comptroller \n     General, upon request--\n       (i) a complete copy of the cost-benefit analysis of the \n     rule, if any;\n       (ii) the agency's actions relevant to section 603, section \n     604, section 605, section 607, and section 609 of Public Law \n     96-354;\n       (iii) the agency's actions relevant to title II, section \n     202, section 203, section 204, and section 205 of Public Law \n     104-4; and\n       (iv) any other relevant information or requirements under \n     any other Act and any relevant Executive Orders, such as \n     Executive Order 12866.\n       (C) Upon receipt, each House shall provide copies to the \n     Chairman and Ranking Member of each committee with \n     jurisdiction.\n       (2) Reporting by the comptroller general.--\n       (A) The Comptroller General shall provide a report on each \n     significant rule to the committees of jurisdiction to each \n     House of the Congress by the end of 12 calendar days after \n     the submission or publication date as provided in section \n     104(b)(2). The report of the Comptroller General shall \n     include an assessment of the agency's compliance with \n     procedural steps required by subparagraph (B) (i) through \n     (iv).\n       (B) Federal agencies shall cooperate with the Comptroller \n     General by providing information relevant to the Comptroller \n     General's report under paragraph (2)(A) of this section.\n       (3) Effective date of significant rules.--A significant \n     rule relating to a report submitted under paragraph (1) shall \n     take effect as a final rule, the latest of--\n       (A) the later of the date occurring 45 days after the date \n     on which--\n       (i) the Congress receives the report submitted under \n     paragraph (1); or\n       (ii) the rule is published in the Federal Register;\n       (B) if the Congress passes a joint resolution of \n     disapproval described under section 104 relating to the rule, \n     and the President signs a veto of such resolution, the \n     earlier date--\n       (i) on which either House of Congress votes and fails to \n     override the veto of the President; or\n       (ii) occurring 30 session days after the date on which the \n     Congress received the veto and objections of the President; \n     or\n       (C) the date the rule would have otherwise taken effect, if \n     not for this section (unless a joint resolution of \n     disapproval under section 104 is enacted).\n       (4) Effective date for other rules.--Except for a \n     significant rule, a rule shall take effect as otherwise \n     provided by law after submission to Congress under paragraph \n     (1).\n       (5) Failure of joint resolution of disapproval.--\n     Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (3), the \n     effective date of a rule shall not be delayed by operation of \n     this title beyond the date on which either House of Congress \n     votes to reject a joint resolution of disapproval under \n     section 104.\n       (b) Termination of Disapproved Rulemaking.--A rule shall \n     not take effect (or continue) as a final rule, if the \n     Congress passes a joint resolution of disapproval described \n     under section 104.\n       (c) Presidential Waiver Authority.--\n       (1) Presidential determinations.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section (except subject to paragraph (3)), \n     a rule that would not take effect by reason of this title may \n     take effect, if the President makes a determination under \n     paragraph (2) and submits written notice of such \n     determination to the Congress.\n       (2) Grounds for determinations.--Paragraph (1) applies to a \n     determination made by the President by Executive order that \n     the rule should take effect because such rule is--\n       (A) necessary because of an imminent threat to health or \n     safety or other emergency;\n       (B) necessary for the enforcement of criminal laws; or\n       (C) necessary for national security.\n       (3) Waiver not to affect congressional disapprovals.--An \n     exercise by the President of the authority under this \n     subsection shall have no effect on the procedures under \n     section 104 or the effect of a joint resolution of \n     disapproval under this section.\n       (d) Treatment of Rules Issued at End of Congress.--\n       (1) Additional opportunity for review.--In addition to the \n     opportunity for review otherwise provided under this title, \n     in the case of any rule that is published in the Federal \n     Register (as a rule that shall take effect as a final rule) \n     during the period beginning on the date occurring 60 days \n     before the date the Congress adjourns sine die through the \n     date on which the succeeding Congress first convenes, section \n     104 shall apply to such rule in the succeeding Congress.\n       (2) Treatment under section 104.--\n       (A) In applying section 104 for purposes of such additional \n     review, a rule described under paragraph (1) shall be treated \n     as though--\n       (i) such rule were published in the Federal Register (as a \n     rule that shall take effect as a final rule) on the 15th \n     session day after the succeeding Congress first convenes; and\n       (ii) a report on such rule were submitted to Congress under \n     subsection (a)(1) on such date.\n       (B) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to affect \n     the requirement under subsection (a)(1) that a report must be \n     submitted to Congress before a final rule can take effect.\n       (3) Actual effective date not affected.--A rule described \n     under paragraph (1) shall take effect as a final rule as \n     otherwise provided by law (including other subsections of \n     this section).\n       (e) Treatment of Rules Issued Before This Act.--\n       (1) Opportunity for congressional review.--The provisions \n     of section 104 shall apply to any significant rule that is \n     published in the Federal Register (as a rule that shall take \n     effect as a final rule) during the period beginning on \n     November 20, 1994, through the date on which this Act takes \n     effect.\n       (2) Treatment under section 104.--In applying section 104 \n     for purposes of Congressional review, a rule described under \n     paragraph (1) shall be treated as though--\n       (A) such rule were published in the Federal Register (as a \n     rule that shall take effect as a final rule) on the date of \n     the enactment of this Act; and\n       (B) a report on such rule were submitted to Congress under \n     subsection (a)(1) on such date.\n       (3) Actual effective date not affected.--The effectiveness \n     of a rule described under paragraph (1) shall be as otherwise \n     provided by law, unless the rule is made of no force or \n     effect under section 104.\n       (f) Nullification of Rules Disapproved by Congress.--Any \n     rule that takes effect and later is made of no force or \n     effect by the enactment of a joint resolution under section \n     104 shall be treated as though such rule had never taken \n     effect.\n       (g) No Inference to be Drawn Where Rules Not Disapproved.--\n     If the Congress does not enact a joint resolution of \n     disapproval under section 104, no court or agency may infer \n     any intent of the Congress from any action or inaction of the \n     Congress with regard to such rule, related statute, or joint \n     resolution of disapproval.\n\n     SEC. 104. CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL PROCEDURE.\n\n       (a) Joint Resolution Defined.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``joint resolution'' means only a joint \n     resolution introduced during the period beginning on the date \n     on which the report referred to in section 103(a) is received \n     by Congress and ending 45 days thereafter, the matter after \n     the resolving clause of which is as follows: ``That Congress \n     disapproves the rule submitted by the ____ relating to ____, \n     and such rule shall have no force or effect.''. (The blank \n     spaces being appropriately filled in.)\n       (b) Referral.--\n       (1) In general.--A resolution described in paragraph (1) \n     shall be referred to the committees in each House of Congress \n     with jurisdiction. Such a resolution may not be reported \n     before the eighth day after its submission or publication \n     date.\n       (2) Submission date.--For purposes of this subsection the \n     term ``submission or publication date'' means the later of \n     the date on which--\n       (A) the Congress receives the report submitted under \n     section 103(a)(1); or\n       (B) the rule is published in the Federal Register.\n       (c) Discharge.--If the committee to which is referred a \n     resolution described in subsection (a) has not reported such \n     resolution (or an identical resolution) at the end of 20 \n     calendar days after the submission or publication date \n     defined under subsection (b)(2), such committee may be \n     discharged from further consideration of such resolution in \n     the Senate upon a petition supported in writing by 30 Members \n     of the Senate and in the House upon a petition supported in \n     writing by one-fourth of the Members duly sworn and chosen or \n     by motion of the Speaker supported by the Minority Leader, \n     and such resolution shall be placed on the appropriate \n     calendar of the House involved.\n       (d) Floor Consideration.--\n       (1) In general.--When the committee to which a resolution \n     is referred has reported, or when a committee is discharged \n     (under subsection (c)) from further consideration of, a \n     resolution described in subsection (a), it is at any time \n     thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the \n     same effect has \n\n[[Page S 10156]]\n     been disagreed to) for a motion to proceed to the consideration of the \n     resolution, and all points of order against the resolution \n     (and against consideration of resolution) are waived. The \n     motion is not subject to amendment, or to a motion to \n     postpone, or to a motion to proceed to the consideration of \n     other business. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the \n     motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in order. If \n     a motion to proceed to the consideration of the resolution is \n     agreed to, the resolution shall remain the unfinished \n     business of the respective House until disposed of.\n       (2) Debate.--Debate on the resolution, and on all debatable \n     motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited \n     to not more than 10 hours, which shall be divided equally \n     between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. A \n     motion further to limit debate is in order and not debatable. \n     An amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or a motion to \n     proceed to the consideration of other business, or a motion \n     to recommit the resolution is not in order.\n       (3) Final passage.--Immediately following the conclusion of \n     the debate on a resolution described in subsection (a), and a \n     single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if \n     requested in accordance with the rules of the appropriate \n     House, the vote on final passage of the resolution shall \n     occur.\n       (4) Appeals.--Appeals from the decisions of the Chair \n     relating to the application of the rules of the Senate or the \n     House of Representatives, as the case may be, to the \n     procedure relating to a resolution described in subsection \n     (a) shall be decided without debate.\n       (e) Treatment if Other House Has Acted.--If, before the \n     passage by one House of a resolution of that House described \n     in subsection (a), that House receives from the other House a \n     resolution described in subsection (a), then the following \n     procedures shall apply:\n       (1) Nonreferral.--The resolution of the other House shall \n     not be referred to a committee.\n       (2) Final passage.--With respect to a resolution described \n     in subsection (a) of the House receiving the resolution--\n       (A) the procedure in that House shall be the same as if no \n     resolution had been received from the other House; but\n       (B) the vote on final passage shall be on the resolution of \n     the other House.\n       (f) Constitutional Authority.--This section is enacted by \n     Congress--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is \n     deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of a resolution described in \n     subsection (a), and it supersedes other rules only to the \n     extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the \n     procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and \n     to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that \n     House.\n\n     SEC. 105. SPECIAL RULE ON STATUTORY, REGULATORY AND JUDICIAL \n                   DEADLINES.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the case of any deadline for, relating \n     to, or involving any rule which does not take effect (or the \n     effectiveness of which is terminated) because of the \n     enactment of a joint resolution under section 104, that \n     deadline is extended until the date 12 months after the date \n     of the joint resolution. Nothing in this subsection shall be \n     construed to affect a deadline merely by reason of the \n     postponement of a rule's effective date under section 103(a).\n       (b) Deadline Defined.--The term ``deadline'' means any date \n     certain for fulfilling any obligation or exercising any \n     authority established by or under any Federal statute or \n     regulation, or by or under any court order implementing any \n     Federal statute or regulation.\n\n     SEC. 106. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this title--\n       (1) Federal agency.--The term ``Federal agency'' means any \n     ``agency'' as that term is defined in section 551(1) of title \n     5, United States Code (relating to administrative procedure).\n       (2) Significant rule.--The term ``significant rule''--\n       (A) means any final rule that the Administrator of the \n     Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within the \n     Office of Management and Budget finds--\n       (i) has an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or \n     more or adversely affects in a material way the economy, a \n     sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the \n     environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or \n     tribal governments or communities;\n       (ii) creates a serious inconsistency or otherwise \n     interferes with an action taken or planned by another agency;\n       (iii) materially alters the budgetary impact of \n     entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the \n     rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or\n       (iv) raises novel legal or policy issues arising out of \n     legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles \n     set forth in Executive Order 12866;\n       (B) does not include any agency action that establishes, \n     modifies, opens, closes, or conducts a regulatory program for \n     a commercial, recreational, or subsistence activity relating \n     to hunting, fishing, or camping.\n       (3) Final rule.--The term ``final rule'' means any final \n     rule or interim final rule. As used in this paragraph, \n     ``rule'' has the meaning given such term by section 551 of \n     title 5, United States Code, except that such term does not \n     include any rule of particular applicability including a rule \n     that approves or prescribes for the future rates, wages, \n     prices, services, or allowances therefor, corporate or \n     financial structures, reorganizations, mergers, or \n     acquisitions thereof, or accounting practices or disclosures \n     bearing on any of the foregoing or any rule of agency \n     organization, personnel, procedure, practice or any routine \n     matter.\n\n     SEC. 107.

APPLICABILITY; SEVERABILITY.\n\n       (a) Applicability.--This title shall apply notwithstanding \n     any other provision of law.\n       (b) Severability.--If any provision of this title, or the \n     application of any provision of this title to any person or \n     circumstance, is held invalid, the application of such \n     provision to other persons or circumstances, and the \n     remainder of this title, shall not be affected thereby.\n\n     SEC. 109. EXEMPTION FOR MONETARY POLICY.\n\n       Nothing in this title shall apply to rules that concern \n     monetary policy proposed or implemented by the Board of \n     Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open \n     Market Committee.\n\n     SEC. 110. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This title shall take effect on the date of the enactment \n     of this Act and shall apply to any rule that takes effect as \n     a final rule on or after such effective date.\n                     TITLE II--TERM GRAZING PERMITS\n\n     SEC. 201. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Agriculture (referred to in this title \n     as the ``Secretary'') administers the 191,000,000-acre \n     National Forest System for multiple uses in accordance with \n     Federal law;\n       (2) where suitable, one of the recognized multiple uses for \n     National Forest System land is grazing by livestock;\n       (3) the Secretary authorizes grazing through the issuance \n     of term grazing permits that have terms of not to exceed 10 \n     years and that include terms and conditions necessary for the \n     proper administration of National Forest System land and \n     resources;\n       (4) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary \n     has issued approximately 9,000 term grazing permits \n     authorizing grazing on approximately 90,000,000 acres of \n     National Forest System land;\n       (5) of the approximately 9,000 term grazing permits issued \n     by the Secretary, approximately one-half have expired or will \n     expire by the end of 1996;\n       (6) if the holder of an expiring term grazing permit has \n     complied with the terms and conditions of the permit and \n     remains eligible and qualified, that individual is considered \n     to be a preferred applicant for a new term grazing permit in \n     the event that the Secretary determines that grazing remains \n     an appropriate use of the affected National Forest System \n     land;\n       (7) in addition to the approximately 9,000 term grazing \n     permits issued by the Secretary, it is estimated that as many \n     as 1,600 term grazing permits may be waived by permit holders \n     to the Secretary in favor of a purchaser of the permit \n     holder's permitted livestock or base property by the end of \n     1996;\n       (8) to issue new term grazing permits, the Secretary must \n     comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \n     U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and other laws;\n       (9) for a large percentage of the grazing permits that will \n     expire or be waived to the Secretary by the end of 1996, the \n     Secretary has devised a strategy that will result in \n     compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n     and other applicable laws (including regulations) in a timely \n     and efficient manner and enable the Secretary to issue new \n     term grazing permits, where appropriate;\n       (10) for a small percentage of the grazing permits that \n     will expire or be waived to the Secretary by the end of 1996, \n     the strategy will not provide for the timely issuance of new \n     term grazing permits; and\n       (11) in cases in which ranching operations involve the use \n     of a term grazing permit issued by the Secretary, it is \n     essential for new term grazing permits to be issued in a \n     timely manner for financial and other reasons.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to ensure that \n     grazing continues without interruption on National Forest \n     System land in a manner that provides long-term protection of \n     the environment and improvement of National Forest System \n     rangeland resources while also providing short-term certainty \n     to holders of expiring term grazing permits and purchasers of \n     a permit holder's permitted livestock or base property.\n\n     SEC. 202. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Expiring term grazing permit.--The term ``expiring term \n     grazing permit'' means a term grazing permit--\n       (A) that expires in 1995 or 1996; or\n       (B) that expired in 1994 and was not replaced with a new \n     term grazing permit solely because the analysis required by \n     the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 \n     et seq.) and other applicable laws has not been completed.\n\n[[Page S 10157]]\n\n       (2) Final agency action.--The term ``final agency action'' \n     means agency action with respect to which all available \n     administrative remedies have been exhausted.\n       (3) Term grazing permit.--The term ``term grazing permit \n     means a term grazing permit or grazing agreement issued by \n     the Secretary under section 402 of the Federal Land Policy \n     and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1752), section 19 of \n     the Act entitled ``An Act to facilitate and simplify the work \n     of the Forest Service, and for other purposes'', approved \n     April 24, 1950 (commonly known as the ``Granger-Thye Act'') \n     (16 U.S.C. 580l), or other law.\n\n     SEC. 203.

ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL AND JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\n       The issuance of a new term grazing permit under section \n     203(a) shall not be subject to administrative appeal or \n     judicial review.\n\n     SEC. 205. REPEAL.\n\n       This title is repealed effective as of January 1, 2001.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                   KENNEDY AMENDMENTS NOS. 1732-1741\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY submitted 10 amendments intended to be proposed by him to \namendment No. 1487 proposed by Mr. Dole to the bill S. 343, supra;

and\n       (B) should not undermine other safety standards.\n       (3) advances in science and technology since the Delaney \n     Clause was originally enacted in 1958 have prompted the need \n     to refine the standards in current law with respect to \n     pesticide residues, and may have limited the appropriateness \n     of such standards with respect to food additives and animal \n     drugs;\n       (4) the Delaney Clause should be replaced by a contemporary \n     health-based standard that takes into account--\n       (A) the right of the American people to safe food;\n       (B) the conclusions of the National Academy of Sciences \n     concerning the special susceptibility of infants and children \n     to the effects of pesticide chemicals and the cumulative \n     effect of the residues of such pesticide chemicals on human \n     health;\n       (C) the importance of a stable food supply and a sound \n     agricultural economy; and\n       (D) the interests of consumers, farmers, food \n     manufacturers, and other interested parties; and\n       (5) prior to the end of the first session of the 104th \n     Congress, after appropriate consideration by the committees \n     of jurisdiction, the Senate should enact legislation to \n     reform the Delaney Clause.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1733\n\n       On page 71, strike out lines 13 through 23, and redesignate \n     the remaining subsections and cross references thereto \n     accordingly.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1734\n\n       On page 71, strike out lines 15 through 16, and insert the \n     following: ``Testing.--In applying the proviso in section \n     409(c)(3)(A), or in applying section 512(d)(1) or \n     721(b)(5)(B), of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1735\n\n       On page 71, strike out lines 15 through 17, and insert the \n     following: ``Testing.--In applying section 409(c)(3)(A) or \n     512(d)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A) and 360b(d)(1)),''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                           Amendment No. 1736\n\n       On page 71, strike out lines 15 through 17, and insert the \n     following: ``Testing.--In applying the proviso in section \n     409(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A)),''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1737\n\n       On page 71, strike out lines 15 through 17, and insert the \n     following: ``Testing.--In applying the proviso in section \n     409(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A)) with respect to pesticides,''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1738\n\n       On page 71, line 23, insert before the period the \n     following: ``: Provided, That this subsection shall not take \n     effect until the Secretary of Health and Human Services and \n     the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency have \n     certified that the implementation of this subsection will not \n     place at risk the long-term health of infants and children''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1739\n\n       On page 71, line 23, insert before the period the \n     following: ``: Provided, That this subsection shall not take \n     effect until the Secretary of Health and Human Services and \n     the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency have \n     certified that the implementation of this subsection will not \n     increase the incidence of cancer in the United States''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1740\n\n       On page 71, line 23, insert before the period the \n     following: ``: Provided, That this subsection shall not take \n     effect until the Secretary of Health and Human Services and \n     the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency have \n     certified that the implementation of this subsection will not \n     expose infants and children to cancer-causing chemicals \n     through the food such infants and children consume''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1741\n\n       On page 71, line 23, insert before the period the \n     following: ``: Provided, That this subsection shall not take \n     effect until the Secretary of Health and Human Services and \n     the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency have \n     certified that the implementation of this subsection will not \n     place at risk the long-term health of infants and children as \n     a result of exposure to cancer-causing chemicals added to the \n     food such infants and children consume''.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      LIEBERMAN AMENDMENT NO. 1742\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him \nto amendment No. 1487 proposed by Mr. Dole to the bill S. 343, supra;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Urban Regulatory Relief Zone \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the likelihood that a proposed business site will \n     comply with many government regulations is inversely related \n     to the length of time over which a site has been utilized for \n     commercial and/or industrial purposes in the past, thus \n     rendering older sites in urban areas the sites most unlikely \n     to be chosen for a new development and thereby forcing new \n     development away from the areas most in need of economic \n     growth and job creation; and\n       (2) broad Federal regulations often have unintended social \n     and economic consequences in urban areas where such \n     regulations, among other things--\n       (A) offend basic notions of common sense, particularly when \n     applied to individual sites;\n       (B) adversely impact economic stability;\n       (C) result in the unnecessary loss of existing jobs and \n     businesses;\n       (D) undermine new economic development, especially in \n     previously used sites;\n       (E) create undue economic hardships while failing \n     significantly to protect human health, particularly in areas \n     where economic development is urgently needed in order to \n     improve the health and welfare of residents over the long \n     term; and\n       (F) contribute to social deterioration to a such degree \n     that high unemployment, crime, and other economic and social \n     problems create the greatest risk to the health and well-\n     being of urban residents.\n\n     SEC. 203. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are to--\n       (1) empower qualifying cities to obtain selective relief \n     from Federal regulations that undermine economic stability \n     and development in distressed areas within the city; and\n       (2) authorize Federal agencies to waive the application of \n     specific Federal regulations in distressed urban areas--\n       (A) upon application through the Office of Management and \n     Budget by an Economic Development Commission established by a \n     qualifying city pursuant to section 205; and\n       (B) upon a determination by the appropriate Federal agency \n     that granting such a waiver will not substantially endanger \n     health or safety.\n\n     SEC. 204. ELIGIBILITY FOR WAIVERS.\n\n       (a) Eligible Cities.--The mayor or chief executive officer \n     of a city may establish an Economic Development Commission to \n     carry out the purposes of section 205 if the city has a \n     population greater than 200,000 according to:\n       (1) the U.S. Census Bureau's 1992 estimate for city \n     populations; or\n       (2) beginning six months after the enactment of this title, \n     the U.S. Census Bureau's latest estimate for city \n     populations.\n       (b) Distressed Area.--Any census tract within a city shall \n     qualify as a distressed area if--\n       (1) 33 percent or more of the resident population in the \n     census tract is below the poverty line; or\n       (2) 45 percent or more of out-of-school males aged 16 and \n     over in the census tract worked less than 26 weeks in the \n     preceding year; or\n       (3) 36 percent of more families with children under age 18 \n     in the census tract have an unmarried parent as head of the \n     household; or\n       (4) 17 percent or more of the resident families in the \n     census tract received public assistance income in the \n     preceding year.\n\n     SEC. 205. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMISSIONS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The major of chief executive officer of a \n     qualifying city under section 204 may appoint an Economic \n     Development Commission for the purpose of--\n       (1) designating distressed areas, or a combination of \n     distressed areas with one another or with adjacent industrial \n     or commercial areas, within the city as Urban Regulatory \n     Relief Zones; and\n       (2) making application through the Office of Management and \n     Budget to waive the application of specific Federal \n     regulations within such Urban Regulatory Relief Zones.\n       (b) Composition.--To the greatest extent practicable, an \n     Economic Development Commission shall include--\n       (1) residents representing a demographic cross section of \n     the city population; and\n       (2) members of the business community, private civic \n     organizations, employers, employees, elected officials, and \n     State and local regulatory authorities.\n       (c) Limitation.--No more than one Economic Development \n     Commission shall be established or designated within a \n     qualifying city.\n\n     SEC. 206. LOCAL PARTICIPATION.\n\n       (a) Public Hearings.--Before designating an area as an \n     Urban Regulatory Relief Zone, an Economic Development \n     Commission established pursuant to section 205 shall hold a \n     public hearing, after giving adequate public notice, for the \n     purpose of soliciting the opinions and suggestions of those \n     persons who will be affected by such designation.\n       (b) Individual Requests.--The Economic Development \n     Commission shall establish a process by which individuals may \n     submit requests to the Economic Development Commission to \n     include specific Federal regulations in the Commission's \n     application to the Office of Management and Budget seeking \n     waivers of Federal regulations.\n       (c) Availability of Commission Decisions.--After holding a \n     hearing under paragraph (a) and before submitting any waiver \n     applications to the Office of Management and Budget pursuant \n     to section 207, the Economic Development Commission shall \n     make publicly available--\n       (1) a list of all areas within the city to be designated as \n     Urban Regulatory Relief Zones, if any;\n       (2) a list of all regulations for which the Economic \n     Development Commission will request a waiver from a Federal \n     agency; and\n       (3) an explanation of the reasons that the waiver of a \n     regulation would economically benefit the city and the data \n     supporting such a determination.\n     \n[[Page S 10159]]\n\n\n     SEC. 207. WAIVER OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Selection of Regulations.--An Economic Development \n     Commission may select for waiver, within an Urban Regulatory \n     Relief Zone, Federal regulations that--\n       (1)(A) are unduly burdensome to business concerns located \n     within an area designated as an Urban Regulatory Relief Zone; \n     or\n       (B) discourages new economic development within the zone; \n     or\n       (C) creates undue economic hardships in the zone; or\n       (D) contributes to the social deterioration of the zone; \n     and\n       (2) if waived, will not substantially endanger health or \n     safety.\n       (b) Request for Waiver.--(1) An Economic Development \n     Commission shall submit a request for the waiver of Federal \n     regulations to the Office of Management and Budget.\n       (2) Such request shall--\n       (A) identify the area designated as an Urban Regulatory \n     Relief Zone by the Economic Development Commission;\n       (B) identify all regulations for which the Economic \n     Development Commission seeks a waiver; and\n       (C) explain the reasons that waiver of the regulations \n     would economically benefit the Urban Regulatory Relief Zone \n     and the data supporting such determination.\n       (c) Review of Waiver Request.--No later than 60 days after \n     receiving the request for waiver, the Office of Management \n     and Budget shall--\n       (1) review the request for waiver;\n       (2) determine whether the request for waiver is complete \n     and in compliance with this title, using the most recent \n     census data available at the time each application is \n     submitted; and\n       (3) after making a determination under paragraph (2)--\n       (A) submit the request for waiver to the Federal agency \n     that promulgated the regulation and notify the requesting \n     Economic Development Commission of the date on which the \n     request was submitted to such agency; or\n       (B) notify the requesting Economic Development Commission \n     that the request is not in compliance with this Act with an \n     explanation of the basis for such determination.\n       (d) Modification of Waiver Requests.--An Economic \n     Development Commission may submit modifications to a waiver \n     request. The provisions of subsection (c) shall apply to a \n     modified waiver as of the date such modification is received \n     by the Office of Management and Budget.\n       (e) Waiver Determination.--(1) No later than 120 days after \n     receiving a request for waiver under subsection (c) from the \n     Office of Management and Budget, a Federal agency shall--\n       (A) make a determination of whether to waive a regulation \n     in whole or in part; and\n       (B) provide written notice to the requesting Economic \n     Development Commission of such determination.\n       (2) Subject to subsection (g), a Federal agency shall deny \n     a request for a waiver only if the waiver substantially \n     endangers health or safety.\n       (3) If a Federal agency grants a waiver under this \n     subsection, the agency shall provide a written statement to \n     the requesting Economic Development Commission that--\n       (A) describes the extent of the waiver in whole or in part; \n     and\n       (B) explains the application of the waiver, including \n     guidance for the use of the waiver by business concerns, \n     within the Urban Regulatory Relief Zone.\n       (4) If a Federal agency denies a waiver under this \n     subsection, the agency shall provide a written statement to \n     the requesting Economic Development Commission that--\n       (A) explains the reasons that the waiver substantially \n     endangers health or safety; and\n       (B) provides a scientific basis in writing for such \n     determination.\n       (f) Automatic Waiver.--If a Federal agency does not provide \n     the written notice required under subsection (e) within the \n     120-day period as required under such subsection, the waiver \n     shall be deemed to be granted by the Federal agency.\n       (g) Limitation.--No provision of this Act shall be \n     construed to authorize any Federal agency to waive any \n     regulation or Executive order that prohibits, or the purpose \n     of which is to protect persons against, discrimination on the \n     basis of race, color, religion, gender, or national origin.\n       (h) Applicable Procedures.--A waiver of a regulation under \n     subsection (e) shall not be considered to be a rule, \n     rulemaking, or regulation under chapter 5 of title 5, United \n     States Code. The Federal agency shall publish a notice in the \n     Federal Register stating any waiver of a regulation under \n     this section.\n       (i) Effect of Subsequent Amendment of Regulations.--If a \n     Federal agency amends a regulation for which a waiver under \n     this section is in effect, the agency shall not change the \n     waiver to impose additional requirements.\n       (j) Expiration of Waivers.--No waiver of a regulation under \n     this section shall expire unless the Federal agency \n     determines that a continuation of the waiver substantially \n     endangers health or safety.\n\n     SEC. 208.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Urban Regulatory Relief Zone \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the likelihood that a proposed business site will \n     comply with many government regulations is inversely related \n     to the length of time over which a site has been utilized for \n     commercial and/or industrial purposes in the past, thus \n     rendering older sites in urban areas the sites most unlikely \n     to be chosen for new development and thereby forcing new \n     development away from the\n      areas most in need of economic growth and job creation; and\n       (2) broad Federal regulations often have unintended social \n     and economic consequences in urban areas where such \n     regulations, among other thing--\n       (A) offend basic notions of common sense, particularly when \n     applied to individual sites;\n       (B) adversely impact economic stability;\n       (C) result in the unnecessary loss of existing jobs and \n     businesses;\n       (D) undermine new economic development, especially in \n     previously used sites;\n       (E) create undue economic hardships while failing \n     significantly to protect human health, particularly in areas \n     where economic development is urgently needed in order to \n     improve the health and welfare of residents over the long \n     term; and\n       (F) contribute to social deterioration to such a degree \n     that high unemployment, crime, and other economic and social \n     problems create the greatest risk to the health and well-\n     being of urban residents.\n\n     SEC. 203. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are to--\n       (1) enable qualifying cities to provide for the general \n     well-being, health, safety and security for their residents \n     living in distressed areas by empowering such cities to \n     obtain selective relief from Federal regulations that \n     undermine economic stability and development in distressed \n     areas within the city; and\n       (2) authorize Federal agencies to waive the application of \n     specific Federal regulations in distressed urban areas \n     designated as Urban Regulatory Relief Zones by an Economic \n     Development Commission--\n       (A) upon application through the Office of Management and \n     Budget by an Economic Development Commission established by a \n     qualifying city pursuant to section 205; and\n       (B) Upon a determination by the appropriate Federal agency \n     that granting such a waiver will not substantially endanger \n     health or safety.\n\n     SEC. 204. ELIGIBILITY FOR WAIVERS.\n\n       (a) Eligible Cities.--The mayor or chief executive officer \n     of a city may establish an Economic Development Commission to \n     carry out the purposes of section 205 if the city has a \n     population greater than 200,000 according to:\n       (1) the U.S. Census Bureau's 1992 estimate for city \n     populations; or\n       (2) beginning six months after the enactment of this title, \n     the U.S. Census Bureau's latest estimate for city \n     populations.\n       (b) Distressed Area.--Any census tract within a city shall \n     qualify as a distressed area if--\n\n[[Page S 10165]]\n\n       (1) 33 percent or more of the resident population in the \n     census tract is below the poverty line; or\n       (2) 45 percent or more of out-of-school males aged 16 and \n     over in the census tract worked less than 26 weeks in the \n     preceding year; or\n       (3) 36 percent or more families with children under age 18 \n     in the census tract have an unmarried parent as head of the \n     household; or\n       (4) 17 percent or more of the resident families in the \n     census tract received public assistance income in the \n     preceding year.\n\n     SEC. 205.

Mr. \nCougil's strong sense of community service, especially his involvement \nwith local union activities was a great asset to labor relations in \nIllinois.\n  At age 13, Floyd Cougil started work at the Metropolis Box Factory in \nsouthern Illinois. In 1951, he became a charter member of local 1301 of \nthe Laborers Union of North America and he later founded the \nConstruction and General Laborers Local 1320 of the AFL.\n  Floyd served as trustee for the construction area conference in \nCairo, IL. He served with distinction on a panel created by the \nSouthern Illinois University to improve labor-management relations. \nFloyd was awarded his 50-year gold pin and membership card in 1989 for \nhis continued service with local 1320.\n  Floyd maintained a farm in Massac County, IL, and was a member of the \nMassac County Farm Bureau. His strong sense of community pride and \ninvolvement was demonstrated by the integral role he played in bringing \nboth the EEI and the Allied Chemical plants to Massac County. He is \nalso credited with helping solidify the Government contract with F.H. \nMcGraw and Co. for the construction of the Atomic Energy Commission \nproject in McCracken County, KY.\n  Floyd Cougil had unquestionable personal integrity with a genuine \nconcern for the well-being of his fellow man. His passing leaves a \ngreat void that will be felt not only by his family and his many \nfriends and colleagues, but by the whole State of Illinois as \nwell.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/17/senate-section/article/S10166-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10166-S10167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nDIRECTING THAT THE ``PORTRAIT MONUMENT'' BE RESTORED AND PLACED IN THE \n                            CAPITOL ROTUNDA\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Title IV--Effective Date: Strike this section entirely.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1788) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today, the Senate will be voting on the \npassage of the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 which \nwill eliminate and modify over 200 outdated or unnecessary \ncongressionally mandated reporting requirements and will also place a \nsunset on those reports with an annual, semiannual, or other regular \nperiodic reporting requirement 4 years after the bill's enactment. The \npassage of this piece of legislation will help to improve the \nefficiency of agency operations by reducing staff time in and resources \nspent on producing unnecessary reports to Congress.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that enactment of this \nlegislation could result in savings of up to $5 to $10 million even \nwithout factoring in the savings from the sunset provision.\n  The legislation that we will be voting on today is similar to the \nbill Senator Cohen and I introduced last year, S. 2156. That bill \ncontained nearly 300 recommendations for eliminations or modifications, \nand was the product of an extensive process that started with \nrecommendations from executive and independent agencies. Senator Cohen \nand I wrote to all 89 executive and independent agencies and asked that \nthey identify reports required by law that they believe are no longer \nnecessary or useful and, therefore, that could be eliminated or \nmodified. We stressed the importance of a clear and substantiated \njustification for each recommendation made.\n  S. 2156 was unanimously approved by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee on August 2, 1994. Senators Glenn, Roth, Stevens, and McCain \ncosponsored the bill. Unfortunately, the Senate was unable\n to act on the bill before \n\n[[Page S 10168]]\nthe close of the 103d Congress. But I am more hopeful that both Houses \nof Congress will pass this very timely piece of legislation this year.\n\n  In March 1995, the Senate agreed to include the language for S. 2156 \nin the form of two separate amendments to S. 244, the Paperwork \nReduction Act of 1995. The amendments, however, were struck in \nconference. But the chairman of the House Committee on Government \nReform and Oversight--Representative William Clinger--proposed to \ncombine and introduce the amendments as a free-standing piece of \nlegislation in the House of Representatives. The Senate also decided to \ncombine the amendments into our piece of legislation--S. 790--and \nplaced directly onto the Senate Calendar for immediate consideration \nsince the language had previously been approved as amendments.\n  S. 790 will eliminate 157 reports and modify 59 reports. The \nlegislation also includes a modified version of Senator McCain's sunset \nprovision which will eliminate those reports with an annual, semi-\nannual, or regular periodic reporting basis 4 years after the bill's \nenactment, while allowing Members of Congress to reauthorize those \nreports it deems necessary in carrying out effective Congressional \noversight. the sunset provision does not apply to any reports required \nunder the Inspector General Act of 1978 or the Chief Financial Officers \nAct of 1990.\n  The House of Representatives circulated its reports elimination and \nsunset companion bill to all of its appropriate committees in order to \nreceive their input on the items slated for elimination and \nmodification. Since that time, the House has requested several minor \nchanges--the overwhelming majority of which are technical, having no \neffect whatsoever on those items being eliminated and modified. For \nexample, a certain legal cite had to be corrected. In other cases, the \nHouse requested that certain reports selected for elimination be kept \nin order to conduct proper oversight functions. The House has also \nrequested the elimination of five additional Department of Energy \nreports beyond those listed in S. 790. The Senate Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources--both the majority and minority sides--concurred \nwith the House on this matter. On the Senate side, one report slated \nfor elimination was reinstated. As of this moment, the language for the \nSenate and House bills are identical.\n  Both the Senate and House of Representatives are ready to eliminate \nthose reports that are never or are simply dropped into file cabinets \nand wastebaskets, never to be seen again. In this era, we must ensure \nthat our scarce resources are utilized efficiently toward productive \nactivities. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan piece of \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the bill is deemed \nread the third time, and passed.\n  So the bill (S. 790), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n                                 S. 790\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
