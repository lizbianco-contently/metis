Mr. President, today, along with my distinguished ranking \nmember, Senator Kerrey, we are bringing to the Senate the Senate \nAppropriations Committee recommendation on fiscal year 1996 \nappropriations for the Department of the Treasury, U.S. Postal Service, \nthe Executive Office of the President, and certain independent \nagencies.\n  Mr. President, the bill we are presenting today contains total \nfunding of $23,134,570,000. This bill is $367,859,000 below the \nappropriations provided in fiscal year 1995. It is $42,716,000 below \nthe House-passed bill and $1.775 billion below the President's request.\n  Of the totals in this bill, we are recommending $11,262,500,000 for \nnew discretionary spending. The balance, $11,889,400,000 is for \nmandatory programs over which this committee has no control.\n  The $11,262,500,000 the committee proposes for domestic discretionary \nprograms is $1.8 billion below the President's request. Let me repeat \nthat, Mr. President. This bill is $1.8 billion below the President's \nfiscal year 1996 request.\n  Reaching this level has not been an easy task. We have had to make \nsome very difficult decisions, while trying to ensure that funds are \nmade available to carry out essential governmental functions. \n\n[[Page S11496]]\n\n  Mr. President, this bill includes $10,466,900,000 for the Department \nof the Treasury. The Treasury Department has varied responsibilities, \nthe bulk of which are directed to the revenues and expenditures of this \nGovernment and law enforcement functions.\n  This bill includes $121,908,000 for payment to the Postal Service \nfund for free mail for the blind, overseas voting, and payment to the \nDepartment of Labor for disability costs incurred by the old Post \nOffice Department.\n  The President receives $149,915,000 to exercise the duties and \nresponsibilities of the Executive Office of the President.\n  This bill also includes $573,872,000 for construction of new \ncourthouses and Federal facilities. This funding provides the General \nServices Administration the ability to let construction contracts for \nbuildings which construction can begin in fiscal year 1996. There is no \nfunding, Mr. President, for projects where no construction can be \naccomplished in 1996.\n  There is $11.8 billion in mandatory payments through the Office of \nPersonnel Management for annuitant and employee health disability and \nretirement, and life insurance benefits.\n  There is $390 million for other independent agencies.\n  Mr. President, this bill also proposes to terminate the Advisory \nCommission on Intergovernmental Relations, the Administrative \nConference of the United States, and the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy.\n  There have been many who have said that these organizations should be \nfunded and continued. Mr. President, as you well know, these are \ndifficult times--times in which we are being asked to make very tough, \nvery difficult decisions.\n  I am sure we will have the opportunity to discuss these proposals \nlater on during the deliberations on the bill.\n  Mr. President, this subcommittee continues to be a strong supporter \nof law enforcement. We have done what we can to ensure that the law \nenforcement agencies funded in this bill have the resources to do the \njob that we ask them to do.\n  There has been considerable discussion since this bill was reported \nfrom the subcommittee about the level of funding for the Internal \nRevenue Service. This level of discussion has been second only to that \nconcerning the decision of the committee to terminate the drug czar's \noffice. I would like to take a few moments to describe how we arrived \nat the funding level for the IRS.\n  This bill includes $7,307,208,000 for the Internal Revenue Service. \nThis total is $803 million below the President's request and $202 \nmillion below fiscal year 1995. There are those, including the \nPresident, who have said that you have to fund the IRS at the requested \nlevel to ensure that tax systems modernization continues and that funds \nowed to the Government are collected.\n  Mr. President, this morning, let me be perfectly clear on this. Based \non the subcommittee's budget allocation, we have no other options. Many \nmay disagree with the choices we have made, but we are working with \nlimited resources. Funding for the IRS makes up 65 percent, Mr. \nPresident, of the discretionary spending in this bill. It is obvious if \ncuts are made, the IRS will have to have a significant percentage of \nthe cuts.\n  The budget resolution narrative describes the commitment to tax \nsystems modernization and the collection initiative begun last year.\n But the crosswalk provided by the Budget Committee on which the \ncommittee's allocation was determined does not match this language.\n\n  Mr. President, as I have indicated, this bill makes a number of \npeople, including the President of the United States, possibly very \nuncomfortable. It is, however, the result of long, hard hours of work \non the part of members and staff of this committee. I want to thank all \nof them for that effort. I believe it is workable and should be \nenacted.\n  I yield to Senator Kerrey, the subcommittee's ranking member.\n  Mr. KERREY. First of all, I am very pleased to join the subcommittee \nchairman, Senator Shelby, in bringing this bill to the floor. As the \nchairman pointed out, this bill is substantially below the requested \nand enacted levels for many programs and activities under the \njurisdiction of the Treasury Department, the Executive Office of the \nPresident, and certain independent agencies.\n  The 602(b) allocation given the subcommittee constrained us from \nfunding many worthy programs to the levels needed to maintain \nappropriate levels of service and activity.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \nsincerely compliment the distinguished Senator from Alabama on the \ncooperative relationship he forged in the committee, working closely \nnot just with myself but with all subcommittee members, to put together \na fiscally responsible and very defensible bill, under the most \ndifficult circumstances.\n  Chairman Shelby has already touched on the major funding highlights \nof the bill, and I will not attempt to repeat at least most of the \npoints he has already made.\n  Mr. President, what I would like to do at the outset is to cite a \ncouple of stipulations that I have cited before, some of which may be \nslightly irrelevant to this particular piece of legislation, but it \ndoes have an impact upon what we are doing on the appropriations side.\n  Mr. President, one of the biggest reasons, if not the biggest reason, \nthat we continually see pressure upon appropriated accounts is that we \nhave yet to face the growing cost of all Federal entitlement programs. \nParticularly, Mr. President, the two biggest among them are health care \nentitlements--which the distinguished occupant of the chair has been \nworking on a long time--as well as retirement.\n  These entitlement programs, as a percent of this year's budget, plus \nnet interest, represent 66 percent of the entire Federal budget. That \nmeans the appropriated accounts are 34 percent.\n  Mr. President, the year that the distinguished chairman of our \ncommittee, Senator Hatfield, came to the U.S. Senate, there was 30 \npercent of our budget allocated for entitlements and net interest, and \n70 percent for all of our appropriated accounts. So the trend is \nshrinking domestic spending; that is to say, expenditures upon things \nwe have decided, either for defense or for nondefense purposes, are \nimportant either for our current needs or for our future needs.\n  The budget resolution under which we operate and has allocated money \nto the subcommittee has us going to 25 percent appropriated accounts in \nthe year 2002 and eventually, when the baby boom generation retires--75 \nmillion Americans who are in that baby boom generation start to retire \nin the year 2008--the appropriated accounts will go to zero.\n  Even at 25 percent, Mr. President, imagine what would happen this \nyear if we were allocating that percent. We would be spending under the \ncurrent level of revenue, by the way, a thing that has remained \nconstant in this town. Except for World War II and a short period of \ntime during the Vietnam war, the total level of taxation has remained \nat about 19 percent of the gross domestic product. You see a flat line \nover the last 50 years.\n  With 19 percent revenue, Mr. President, and 25 percent of our budget \nallocated for domestic spending, we would have $400 billion this year--\n$400 billion. Mr. President, I think even our most antidefense Member \nwould probably spend $250-or-so billion on defense. That means we would \nthis year try to figure out what to do with $150 billion for our crime \nefforts, for our education efforts, for our research efforts, for NASA, \nfor veterans. It would be impossible, Mr. President.\n  Now, I grew up in the 1950's and 1960's, and as a consequence of my \nparents being willing to pay cash for such things as the GI bill and \nthe Interstate Highway System, I enjoyed an awful lot more prosperity \nand a much higher standard of living as a consequence of the \ninvestments which they made.\n  There is far more agreement in this body than sometimes meets the eye \nthat there are certain things where we should pool our collective \nresources; we should take some of our taxpayers' money and make \ninvestments whether, again, it is education, transportation, or other \nsorts of things.\n  What entitlement growth does, Mr. President, is constantly press us \nto spend less and less and less. We are not saying that there are not \nthings that cannot be cut. Indeed, there are some \n\n[[Page S11497]]\nthings we have cut out this year that I think even in times where if we \nwere aiming to fix the cost of entitlement growth, we would probably \nzero in the amounts.\n  I will, during slack times in the debate, come back and try to \nhighlight this particular problem because it is an extremely difficult \nproblem, forcing us to deal both with health care and with retirement, \ntwo very controversial items, two very difficult items to deal with.\n  I believe, Mr. President, that time is not on our side, that \ncompounding interest rates are working against us rather than for us, \nboth at the national level and at the individual household level. I \nhope that Republicans and Democrats will, as we have attempted to do in \nthis subcommittee allocation, come together for the good of the country \nand do the right thing.\n  Mr. President, this bill is not business as usual. We have eliminated \nsome accounts, which may cause alarm to some Members. We have zeroed \nout the so-called drug czar's office; the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy, which, by the way, is $9.9 million; we have zeroed out \nthe Administrative Conference of the United States; and we have zeroed \nout the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations.\n  Again, these actions are a direct consequence of shrinking domestic \ndiscretionary spending in the budget that this body adopted.\n  We have funded programs where a compelling case has been made for \ntheir continued existence:\n  The Counter-Drug Technology Assessment Center, the central counter-\nnarcotics research and development office, has been continued in the \nDepartment of the Treasury and funded at a level of $20.5 million.\n  The High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program, which provides \nfunding to implement Federal, State, and local antidrug strategies, has \nbeen funded at a level of $110 million in the Department of the \nTreasury.\n  The Counsel of Economic Advisers, eliminated in the House bill, has \nbeen restored in this bill and funded at the requested level of $3.5 \nmillion.\n  While most programs have been reduced below enacted levels, we have \nincluded modest increases for Treasury law enforcement bureaus to \nsustain current levels of vigilance in border interdiction, \nPresidential protection and security, financial crimes, law enforcement \ntraining, and violent crime investigations.\n  We were not able to fully fund the President's 1996 request for \ncounterterrorism. Mr. President, this request was transmitted to the \nCongress on July 17, 1 day prior to the 602(b) allocation meeting. We \nhave, however, provided funding to continue those initiatives adopted \nin the fiscal year 1995 appropriations bill.\n  We have reduced funding for the new Federal building and courthouse \nconstruction by $415 million from the requested level. The chairman has \nearlier highlighted the criteria that he came up with. I fully support \nthese criteria. I think it is completely defensible. It lets taxpayers \nknow we are continuing to monitor these expenditures to make sure that \nwe are not wasting their money.\n  Mr. President, the Internal Revenue Service budget, which in many \nways, in most ways, took the biggest hit in our budget reduction, took \na large hit because it makes up 63 percent of our discretionary \nspending. Funding in this bill for the IRS is $201 million below the \nenacted level, and $803 million below the President's request.\n  The $405 million compliance initiative funded in fiscal year 1995 has \nbeen zeroed out. This unquestionably will have a major impact on \nrevenue over the next 5 years. The IRS will also have to reduce \npersonnel levels by some 5,000 to 6,000 employees.\n  Tax systems modernization, the single most important initiative under \nway for bringing the U.S. tax revenue system up to date, will also have \nto be scaled back substantially. The bill contains $674 million for tax \nsystem modernization, which is $270 million less than the $944 million \nrequested.\n  Since the IRS budget makes up such a large portion of our budget, and \nan even higher proportion of our outlays, the chairman and I had no \nother choice, given the allocation of money for this committee, but to \nmake large reductions in the Internal Revenue Service. I know many are \nconcerned about it, and both the chairman and I are concerned \nourselves. We find no other choice than to make these kinds of \nreductions.\n  The IRS brings in $1.2 trillion in revenue a year--at a budget \nsomewhere between $7 and $8 billion, which is less than 1 percent of \nthe revenue it brings in. Common sense in the private sector would tell \nyou if you had a business that brought in that kind of profit at that \nlittle cost, you would do everything you could to see the business had \nthe money it needed to keep generating revenue. Instead, the IRS must \ncompete side by side with every other Federal program without regard to \nthe amount of revenue it brings in.\n  I happen to believe the principal problem here is the governance of \nthe Internal Revenue Service. The incentives are all on the wrong side. \nSomehow we have to come to grips with an agency that does not have the \nincentives to do, I think, what most people, as you examine the \nInternal Revenue Service, say it ought to be doing, which is working to \nmake customers happy.\n  Taxpayers are never going to be happy to pay taxes. At least, I think \nthere are very few taxpayers who, on the 15th of April, are going to \nlet out a whoopee and celebrate that great moment when they have to \nfigure out what their taxes are for the year. Most taxpayers are not \ngoing to be terribly enthusiastic. But they ought to be able to get the \ninformation in order to pay the taxes. In spite of the money we have \nallocated, billions of dollars we have allocated in the past for tax \nsystem modernization, the General Accounting Office has evaluated their \nefforts as chaotic at best. They are making a good-faith effort, but \nthe incentives simply are not there.\n  Again, the distinguished occupant of the chair, as well as the \nchairman of this committee, and I, all three of us understand the \nprivate sector. We have been in business prior to arriving here. We \nknow if you have incentives to make a profit and incentives to take \ncare of your customers rather than incentives to satisfy some \ncongressional requirement, frankly, it is likely, if you have those \nkinds of incentives, that you are going to perform differently.\n  I feel strongly that the governance of the Internal Revenue Service \nis going to have to change and this agency is going to have to be given \npowerful private sector market incentives in order to be able to, not \njust deploy the technology, but do it in a way the taxpayers begin to \nsay to us in coffee shops and townhall meetings, ``I hate paying my \ntaxes, I think they are too high,'' or, ``I think they are not fair,'' \nor whatever, ``but finally I am getting the information in a timely \nfashion. Finally I am getting the facts. Finally, when I am called in, \nthe Internal Revenue Service is able to come up with my tax returns for \nthe last 10 years instead of telling me, no, it will take months and \nmonths to come up with it, long periods of time to correlate my tax \nreturn with my Social Security number.''\n  We had a tremendous problem this year with the earned-income tax \ncredit. They were stripping out the refunds as a consequence of our \nconcern about fraud--a legitimate concern. But any private sector \nbusiness that has to pull this information manually, given the \ntechnology today and the information systems today, it seems to me, \nwould not be in business very long. This agency needs a different kind \nof governance in order for us to be able to have taxpayers, the \ncustomers of this agency, begin to say that their needs are being taken \ncare of.\n  Again, I compliment the subcommittee chairman, Senator Shelby, on a \ngood bill and commend him on moving to strike controversial general \nprovisions that were in the House-passed bill. These are authorizing \nmatters which I do not believe belong in this appropriation bill.\n  I also want to acknowledge the fine work of the staff and thank them \nfor their help in permitting us to bring this bill to the floor. Chuck \nParkinson, Hallie Hastert, Stewart Hall, John Libonati, Abbie Raikes, \nand others have been enormously helpful.\n  I urge the Members of this body to support this bill and the \ncommittee amendments.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. \n\n[[Page S11498]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n          Committee Amendment on page 76, Beginning on line 10\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the committee amendment \non page 76.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Committee amendment on page 76: Strike lines 10 through 17.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 3 hours equally divided.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, if \nwe use all 3 hours, that means we would have a rollcall vote at 12 \no'clock, possibly 12:10, maybe possibly yield some time back. Hopefully \nthat will be the case. I know many of our colleagues have inquired when \nthe vote will be. So my guess will be around 12 o'clock.\n  Am I correct, Mr. President, that the time is equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will yield to the Senator from Wyoming \n5 minutes--10 minutes?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Five minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Five minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/05/senate-section/article/S11483-5", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ENDLESS DISCUSSION AND NO RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, ironically, I use this time to rise to \nsuggest that it has been a little disappointing as to how we use our \ntime, as a matter of fact, and I have been somewhat surprised at the \nlack of direction that we have had and that we continue to have in this \nbody in terms of moving forward.\n  It seems to me that clearly was the message we heard in 1994, the \nmessage that we always hear as trustees of the people for whom we are \nhere to do some things. And I am disappointed to see what I consider a \nchange of attitude and a change of direction, where rather than to move \naggressively forward to solve some issues and questions, we seem \ninstead to be sliding our feet.\n  The opposition party--it has become that, in fact, an opposition \nparty--should have some ideas and some suggestions and some directions \ninstead of simply saying, ``No, no, we are not going to do anything,'' \nand that is troublesome to me. I understand that. I understand that is \nthe technique. I understand that is the system. But I do not think it \nis the right thing to do.\n  It seems to me that we do clearly have issues we have to confront. \nThey are here. We have to find solutions to them. The idea that we \ncannot seem to resolve them is very disappointing to me. It seems that \neach time we start with some sort of a problem we must address, why, we \nrise and say, ``I am for a balanced budget but,'' and never come to a \nresolution.\n  Mr. KERREY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Certainly.\n  Mr. KERREY. I do not understand, Mr. President. This time was \nreserved to discuss an amendment of the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma to strike language in fact that is authorized in language on \nan appropriations bill. The Senator from Wyoming is coming to the floor \ntalking about us not having the right direction. I quite agree. I think \nthe amendment itself is an indication why this body takes far too long \nto reach decisions. And I do not understand, if we are to be discussing \nthe addition of authorizing language to an appropriations bill, why the \nSenator from Oklahoma has yielded time to the Senator from Wyoming to \ntalk on a matter that seems not to be related to the amendment that he \nis offering.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator from Wyoming yield?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Certainly.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield 5 minutes to my colleague from \nWyoming. And just to respond to my friend from Nebraska, we have a 3-\nhour time agreement. Originally, I requested an hour equally divided. \nSo if the Senator from Wyoming wishes to make a 5-minute speech on some \nof his thoughts about the inability of the Senate to move, I think that \nis entirely appropriate and we will have plenty of time to engage in \ndebate on both sides of this amendment.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Senator. I will not take time.\n  I guess this is sort of an illustration of the frustration that I \nhave, that I am willing to share. We went on and on and talked an hour \nabout something yesterday, and we all sat and listened, we all sat and \nwaited, we all sat for the whole evening, and we never came to any \nsolution.\n  I have to tell you that is pretty darned frustrating in terms of time \nmanagement and resource management and measuring results. I am not \ngoing to intrude in this. I think we should move forward, and I simply \ncome to the floor to share some frustration. As a matter of fact, \neveryone with ``Yes, I am for regulatory reform,'' comes from that \nside, but we never get it done. We always have ``but, but we don't want \nto do it.''\n  So the philosophy has become, ``Let's don't do it; let's stop it; \nlet's not have authorization for DOD, let's not have authorization for \nforeign affairs. Let's just say no. Let's threaten to veto everything \nthat comes up.''\n  I do not think that is a positive way to move, and I simply asked for \nsome time to say it, and now I will stop. But I feel strongly about it. \nI think that we as trustees of people have some responsibility to make \nsome effort to move. You may not like the result. That is what the \nsystem is about. That is why we vote to decide, not to stall, not to \nfilibuster, not to amend to death, not to talk an hour on every topic. \nI guess I used to be a little frustrated with the rules in the House. I \nhave come to think that was not a bad idea--some limit on the endless \ndiscussion and no resolution.\n  I appreciate the Senator's indulgence, and I simply share a little \nfrustration in terms of us being a little more product oriented in \nterms of getting some things done in this place.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/05/senate-section/article/S11498-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11498-S11517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TREASURY, POSTAL SERVICE, AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS, 1996\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n\n          Committee Amendment on Page 76, Beginning on Line 10\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, to get to the amendment that we have at \nhand, the House-passed Treasury, Postal appropriations bill had \nlanguage that said no funds would be used to pay for abortions as a \nbenefit for Federal employees. This was the policy of our country from \n1984 to 1993. It was reversed by the Clinton administration.\n  I might mention it was reversed after heated discussion and debate in \nthe Senate, in which it was decided by two votes. The side that \nprevailed in that vote, the Clinton administration, said that we should \nhave taxpayers' funds used to subsidize abortion for Federal employees. \nMany of us fought to maintain that prohibition. We felt that Federal \nemployees should have rights, should have benefits, but we did not \nthink a benefit should be included for abortion to be subsidized, the \nmajority of which is paid for by taxpayers. If they wanted to get an \nabortion, that is their right, they can purchase it. It costs about \n$250. But we did not think that taxpayers should have to subsidize it. \nAnd so that is the reason why we tried to maintain the prohibition \nwhich had been in effect from 1984 up until 1993.\n  The House reinstated that prohibition. The committee amendment struck \nthat prohibition. The amendment we have right now says we disagree with \nthe committee amendment. We would like to have that House language in \nthere. We may want to modify it. I may want to modify it. The Senator \nfrom Maryland may want to modify it. But I would like to at least have \nthat language in so we are going to say in effect that we will not use \ntaxpayers' funds to pay for abortion for Federal employees. \n\n[[Page S11499]]\n\n  My reason for yielding 5 minutes to my friend and colleague from \nWyoming is it does not take that long to say it. It is pretty simple. \nIt is something most everybody has voted on. I know it is a tough issue \nfor a lot of people. It is a very serious issue. It is an issue because \nwe are talking about life and death. It is an issue which says what \nshould be in a fringe benefit package. You have a lot of things--all \nemployees do. Most employees have health benefits, and they may have \nvacations and pensions and days off, and so on. Those are a package of \nbenefits. Should that package of benefits include the right to an \nabortion? I do not think so, especially not subsidized by the taxpayer,\n especially not when we ask taxpayers right now to pay 72 percent of \nthe cost, 60 percent of the premium. Should taxpayers have to pay for \nthat?\n\n  Remember what we are talking about. We are not talking about dental \nexams or medical checkups. We are not talking about annual physicals. \nWe are talking about an abortion. Should taxpayers have to pay for \nthat? I do not think so. And that was the policy of this country for 10 \nyears. It was reversed by the Clinton administration--I think a serious \nmistake, a serious mistake, again, one that deals with life.\n  Should people be able to go down and say, ``Well, I want to get an \nabortion. It is covered by my insurance policy. I know it is paid for \nby the taxpayers, the majority of it is. I can get one. Here is my \ncard.'' And so the person getting one maybe pays very little, if \nanything. That is a fringe benefit provided for by the Federal \nGovernment. I do not think abortion should be a fringe benefit provided \nfor by the Government. It is really just about that simple.\n  It is serious. I respect my colleagues on the other side who have a \ndifference of opinion. They feel very strongly. I happen to feel very \nstrongly. A lot of people--I think a majority of Americans, if you ask \nthem the question, do you support abortion? Maybe one way or another. \nBut, do you support taxpayers paying for it? I think a strong majority \nof Americans say, ``No. Don't use our dollars in that way. If somebody \nwants to get one, maybe that is their right. Let them spend their own \nmoney. But don't have it part of the Federal employee benefit package, \nwhich basically makes it a fringe benefit.'' That is what the issue is \nabout.\n  I hope that my colleagues will concur and join me in supporting the \nHouse language.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I believe the distinguished Senator from Nebraska has \ndesignated me as the controller of time on this amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. That is correct, Mr. President.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  I rise to support the committee amendment and oppose any motion to \ntable, and would like to thank the Senators--both the chairman of the \nsubcommittee and the ranking member--for their wise position on this, \nwhich is essentially for the committee amendment to be silent on the \nissue of the nature of health care services. To deny women who work for \nthe Government access to abortion or reproductive services through \ntheir health care plan is inconceivable to me and it is inconceivable \nto the Federal employees.\n  First, abortion is legal in this country. This motion to table, if \nadopted, denies women access to medical services that are not only \nlegal in the United States of America, but are protected under the \nConstitution. We are all familiar that the Supreme Court has held for \nthe past 20 years that it is a woman's fundamental right to decide \nwhether to terminate a pregnancy. And that is left to a physician and \nto the pregnant woman. Currently Federal employees, like workers in the \nprivate sector, are permitted to chose a health care plan that covers a \nfull range of reproductive health services, including abortion.\n  Now let me give you an analysis from the National Women's Law Center \non this issue.\n  First, the Federal employees health benefit plan does not generally \ndictate what benefits must be offered. So there is no health plan that \ndetermines the medical procedures. The Federal employees health benefit \ncoverage, which takes care of 9 million Federal employees, allows them \nto choose between 345 different health insurance packages branching \nfrom fee-for-service plans to HMO's. By and large, Federal law is \nnondirective about the scope of benefits which must be provided, \nleaving it to the individual plans to decide what benefits are offered \nto employees to determine what packages best suit their health needs. \nThat is the way it is, and that is the way it should be. And that is \nthe way it should continue to be.\n  In the fee-for-service plans, they have very general and nonspecific \nrequirements. They must provide benefits for cost, associated with the \ncare and general hospital and other health services of a catastrophic \nnature. They may provide hospitals, surgical, medical, ambulatory, \nprescription drugs, and so on. So there are a lot of ``mays'' in the \nfee for service.\n  In the HMO's, the requirements are more specific. Certain benefit \ncategories must be covered: physician and outpatient, inpatient, x ray \nand emergency, and some mental health and substance abuse services. \nPreventive health services are allowed, like family planning, child \ncare, and immunization.\n  Under the Federal employee benefit package, abortion is treated like \nany other health benefit. Plans are allowed but not required to provide \nabortion services. That means if you wish to have a plan that does not \ncover abortion, you may chose that plan. If you wish to have a plan \nthat does cover abortion, you can have that plan. That is the way the \nlaw is, and that is the way we would hope it would continue to be.\n  Under current law, the FEHBP permits health insurance plans to treat \nabortion services as they do any other health benefit. They may, but \nare not required, to provide health insurance coverage. Plans, not \nFederal policymakers, determine the specific benefit package. A ban on \nabortion coverage under FEHBP is inconsistent with the treatment of \nother health services which, under most health plans, are included or \nexcluded according to the decision made by the plan and what you want. \nSo that it is not the Congress that decides; it is the plan and the \nemployees who decide.\n  I think we ought to leave it like that. I do not think Congress \nshould treat abortion different than any other medical service that is \nmedically necessary or medically appropriate. In 1993, I worked hard to \nensure that the Federal employees health benefit package would permit, \nbut not require, coverage for abortion. Barring abortion coverage for \nwomen working for the Federal Government and their families denies \nthese individuals a health benefit that would be provided through the \nprivate sector. Over two-thirds of private health insurance plans and \n70 percent of the HMO's readily cover abortion services.\n  Restricting a Federal employee's health plan is an arbitrary taking \nof a Federal earned benefit package. Like wages, health benefits are \ncompensation for Federal workers. Abortion restriction effectively \nreduces the compensation package and treats it differently than any \nother health issue.\n  The legislative history shows that the supporters of abortion \nrestriction have as their goal the elimination of the right to \nreproductive choice for all women. This is a turning back of the clock \nof reproductive health and women's fundamental right to reproductive \nchoice. We have been here before. Previous debates on abortion and \nFEHBP reveal that the ultimate goal of the proponents of the abortion \nban is to extinguish the legal right to abortion altogether.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the motion to table, and I will work, \nas the day proceeds, to ensure that.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes of her 10 minutes \nleft.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I will yield that back, reserving the right the call it \nback again under the time I may control.\n  I now turn to the ranking member of the subcommittee and yield him 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, let me alert colleagues of what is going \non \n\n[[Page S11500]]\nhere. When the majority leader and the Democratic leader approached \nSenator Shelby and me about our bill, the first question was what sort \nof time agreements were we going to be able to work out? We hoped we \nwould work out an agreement on this particular matter. Unfortunately, \nthat is now no longer the case. So, instead of having a single vote at \nnoon with the possibility that all of the votes--I have been working \nwith other Members who have amendments--possibly the votes being \nstacked Monday morning, unless we can work out an agreement here this \nmorning, it is possible that we could be debating and having many other \namendments on abortion here all the rest of the day.\n  Mr. President, this really is an issue about beliefs, very strongly \nheld beliefs. If you believe that from the moment of conception you \nhave a human being, you reach the conclusion that abortion should be \nmade illegal.\n  I do not know what the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma--I \nactually have not been on the floor engaged in this particular debate \nbefore, but I have on many occasions in townhall meetings. It is a \ndifficult issue. I reached the conclusion that from the moment of \nconception, it is not human life and that, indeed, a woman should be \nallowed to make a choice, to make her own decision.\n  I support legal abortion. I support the Supreme Court's decision in \n1973. And thus, it seems to me, as long as it is the law of the land--\nit may be that those who have strongly held beliefs that abortion \nshould be made illegal, maybe some day they will ban abortion in the \nUnited States and make it illegal--but as long as it is legal, it seems \nto me our employees, if we are going to have insurance as a fringe \nbenefit, which we do--we have insurance we provide to employees of the \nUnited States of America, those men and women who wear our uniform in \nthe Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, those men and \nwomen searching for a cure for cancer out at the National Institutes of \nHealth. Turn on your television and see the space shuttle hooking up \nwith the Mir spacecraft, those are Federal employees. When you see \nFederal employees doing various things for the people of the United \nStates of America, they are working for us. And we provide health \ninsurance as a fringe benefit.\n  They have a choice with that purchase whether or not they want to \nhave a health insurance policy that provides abortion or, if it is an \nact of conscience, they can say, ``No, I don't want my health insurance \nto provide that.''\n  But it seems to me as long as a majority of the people of the United \nStates of America say that abortion should be legal, that when we hire \npeople we ought to provide them with fringe benefits and it allows them \nto purchase according to what they want to purchase, what their \nconscience says.\n  So it seems to me this is a very straightforward issue. It should not \ntake hours and hours and hours and hours of debate. I think both sides \nof this debate agree with that. If you believe abortion should be \nlegal, then our employees should be able to have health insurance as \nevery other employee of the United States of America does. That is why \nboth the chairman and I found the general provisions that were attached \nby the House of Representatives to be incorrect.\n  In addition, if you care about procedure, and the distinguished \nSenator from Wyoming earlier came to the floor talking about being \nfrustrated because we do not get things done, one of the reasons we do \nnot get things done is because we are always coming and attaching \nauthorizing legislation to appropriations bills or ignoring the law of \nthe land.\n  The President has already threatened to veto this bill for this \nreason, and many others, mostly having to do with the Internal Revenue \nService. This bill is likely to be vetoed anyway.\n  I hope Members come down here to keep the House language out, as long \nas abortion is legal. As long as we are having to hire people to work \nfor the United States of America, it seems to me that we should not be \neliminating a legal procedure.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments made by my \nfriend, the Senator from Nebraska. I might mention, I believe Senator \nShelby is supporting this amendment, to make that clarification. I also \nwould like to make a clarification that we are not passing authorizing \nlanguage on an appropriations bill. The appropriations bill tells how \nwe are going to spend money. This language basically says, ``no money \nappropriated by this act should be able to pay for an abortion or \nadministrative expenses in connection with any health plan under the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Program which provides any benefits \nor coverage for abortions.''\n  It deals with money. How are we going to spend money. Are we going to \nsubsidize abortion or are we not? These are taxpayers' dollars. So this \nis not an authorization. This is how we are going to spend money. Are \nwe going to fund abortions or are we not? We are going to have the same \nlanguage, the same amendment, I might----\n  Mr. KERREY. Will the Senator yield to answer a question so when we \ndebate this, I have an understanding? Like I said, this is the first \ntime the Senator from Oklahoma and I have stood nose to nose on this. \nDoes the Senator believe abortion should be illegal?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Let me respond, I do not think we should spend money for \nabortions. That is what this amendment is. We do not have to get into a \ngeneral philosophical debate on abortion. I will be happy to talk about \nthat at a different point.\n  My point is, I do not think funds should be used to subsidize \nabortion. I heard people say maybe it should be legal, maybe not legal; \nmaybe we should overturn Roe versus Wade. We are not doing that.\n  The issue is, should we be spending funds to subsidize abortion, \nshould it be included in fringe benefits in health care plans. We are \ngoing to have this on HHS, Medicaid, the so-called Hyde language: \nShould we use Federal funds to pay for abortions for low-income people?\n  Everyone who has been around here--most of us pretty much are \nveterans, there are a few people who maybe have not voted on this in \nthe House or Senate, not many--most of us have wrestled with this.\n  My colleague said something about time. I said I am happy to have an \nhour equally divided. This Senator is not trying to hold anything up.\n  But we do have a legitimate right on an appropriations bill to decide \nhow money is spent. Some of us feel strongly that abortion is wrong. \nSome of us feel very strongly that abortion destroys the life of an \ninnocent human being and we should not pay for it. We think it is \nwrong, and it is doubly wrong to subsidize it by U.S. taxpayers. In \nthis case, the taxpayers pay 72 percent of it.\n  So we have a couple of legitimate debates. One I want to mention \nagain. This is not authorizing language. This is not language coming in \ntrying to overturn Roe versus Wade. It is not coming in trying to make \nabortion illegal. This is language saying we should not pay for it, it \nshould not be a fringe benefit in health care plans, and that is \nlegitimate for an appropriations bill. We are going to have it also on \nLabor-HHS under Medicaid.\n  We were going to get into this last year if we had President \nClinton's health care bill, because he had a package of benefits. I \ntold my colleagues before, when that comes up and he wants to have a \ndefined package of benefits--and we know President and Mrs. Clinton \nwanted to have abortion as a defined benefit available to everybody in \nAmerica--that many of us were going to object because we think abortion \nis wrong. We do not think it is just another medical procedure. It is \nnot. It is not a cancer. It is not a sickness. It is destroying the \nlife of an innocent human being. It is fatal. It is deadly. Many of us \ndo not think we should be paying for it, certainly not subsidizing it \nand forcing taxpayers to subsidize it. So that is what this issue is \nabout.\n  Mr. KERREY. Can I ask the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. President, does \nthe Senator from Oklahoma feel the same way about tax deductibility of \ninsurance, that we should strike the right of business to deduct \ninsurance if their employees have an offset against FICA? We are \nbasically subsidizing \n\n[[Page S11501]]\nabortions there, if that is the conclusion that he has reached about \nFederal employees.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Oklahoma if the same argument \nthat he used against Federal employees being able to use insurance for, \nnot to subsidize abortion, but to purchase a service that continues to \nbe legal--it continues to be legal in the United States of America. I \ndo not know, again, whether the Senator from Oklahoma feels that \nabortion should be made illegal, but until a majority of Americans \nfeels abortion should be made illegal, it seems to me our employees \nshould have the option to purchase insurance that contains it.\n  I ask the Senator, does he think tax deductibility should be \neliminated against businesses offsetting FICA? That seems to me, as \nwell, that would be a subsidy.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, is the Senator's question on his time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is on his time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to respond. Mr. President, there are a \nlot of things that are legal that we do not have to subsidize. There \nare a lot of things that may be a legitimate legal business expense----\n  Mr. KERREY. I will be happy to allow the Senator to answer on his \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. I object. If the Senator is going to give an answer to my \nquestion, he can do it on my time. If it is going to be a speech on \nsomething else, it should be on his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators should suspend. The answer is on the \ntime of the Senator from Oklahoma. The question was on the time of the \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the Presiding Officer. Mr. President, I \nwill be happy to respond and comment. There are a lot of things that \nare legal. There are a lot of things that are legal today that may be \nexpensed by a business. That does not mean they should be expensed by \nthe Government or subsidized by the Federal Government.\n  As Congress, we are kind of the chairman of the board for the public \ndomain, for Federal employees, and it is our responsibility to decide \nwhat is a legitimate taxpayer expense. We have a responsibility of how \nto spend the money.\n  I will tell my colleague from Nebraska, I ran a corporation and I \npurchased health insurance for our employees. Abortion was not a \nbenefit. Abortion was not and has not been--it is debatable now how \nprevalent it is in the private sector. That information is not readily \navailable.\n  But we make the decision for public employees. We set public policy \nin Congress. We decide how the money is going to be spent.\n  There are a lot of things that are legal, but we do not subsidize all \nof them and certainly we should not. I think certainly we should not be \nsubsidizing something that may be legal, but when it is involving \ndestroying innocent human beings, I feel very strongly we should not \nsubsidize it.\n  That is what this amendment is about. This amendment is not what is \nlegal in other private health care plans, or about overturning Roe \nversus Wade. This is not anything about restructuring constitutional \namendments or anything like that. This is how are we going to spend \nFederal money and whether we are going to use taxpayer money to \nsubsidize the destruction of innocent human beings. I think that we \nshould not. That is the purpose of this amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Pennsylvania 10 \nminutes from our time. I believe he has 10 minutes from the Republican \nleader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague. She accurately states I have 10 \nminutes under her control, and the distinguished majority leader has \nallocated his leadership time of 10 minutes today. I will utilize the \ntime offered by the distinguished Senator from Maryland at the moment.\n  Mr. President, today's debate is about abortion. It is one aspect of \nwhat I would characterize as a systematic effort to eliminate the \nconstitutional right of a woman to choose.\n  The distinguished Senator from Oklahoma and I came to this body after \nthe 1980 elections, and our relationship has been an extraordinarily \ngood one. I have great respect for the sincerity of his beliefs on this \nsubject. My own views are that, as far as governmental action is \nconcerned, it is the decision on a broad picture which has been made by \nthe Supreme Court of the United States.\n  My own personal views are that I am very much opposed to abortion, \nand I have evidenced that with my support for funding for programs for \nabstinence, to try to perhaps eliminate or reduce, as much as possible, \npremarital sex, especially among young people, leading to so many \nteenage pregnancies, and my support for tax benefits for adoption \ncarrying to term. When it comes to the role of the Federal Government, \nit is my view that it is not a matter of the Federal Government to \ncontrol abortions.\n  Since it is a constitutional issue, I think the father of modern \nconservatives, Barry Goldwater, a former colleague in this body, \narticulated it best when he said, ``We ought to keep the Government off \nour backs, out of our pocketbooks, and out of our bedrooms.'' If the \nreal conservative view is that less government is the best government, \nthen where is government more intrusive than in the bedroom?\n  The Supreme Court of the United States has made fundamental \nconstitutional doctrine which governs the law of the land, and that is \nthat a woman has the constitutional right to choose an abortion. And it \nis not Roe versus Wade which was decided in 1973, but the more recent \ndecision of Casey versus Planned Parenthood, decided in 1992, an \nopinion written by three Justices appointed by conservative Republican \nPresidents, three Justices who were Republicans--Justice David Souter, \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor, and Justice Anthony Kennedy. I say they \nwere Republicans. Perhaps they still are Republicans, but in the \njudicial robes it is a nonpolitical function. But I think it is \nimportant to articulate that proposition that what we have here is a \n1992 decision, with Justices appointed by conservative Republicans.\n  Mr. President, there is more involved in the pending issue than to \neliminate health care plans sponsored by the Federal Government from \nhaving abortion rights. This is a systematic effort to have a meltdown \non women's rights, and it is a meltdown from A to Z, characterized by \nthe chart which I have had prepared.\n  This chart is captioned ``Dismantling a Woman's Right to Choice, from \nA to Z.'' It demonstrates a national campaign to dismantle a woman's \nright to choose when there has not been success in a constitutional \namendment to ban abortion. There are these systematic efforts, A to Z. \nThe one we are debating today comes under ``M.'' It is a mandate that \nFederal employee's insurance exclude abortion coverage.\n  Bear in mind, Mr. President, that a substantial part of the premium \npayments are paid by the individuals involved. Why not allocate that to \nthe abortion clinic? We have here starting with A, to amend the \nConstitution to abolish a woman's right to choose; B, ban Federal \nfunding for abortions for women in Federal prisons; C, to cut off \nfunding for family planning. And so it goes, all the way down to Z, \nwhich is to zero out the tax deduction for expenses incurred for \npregnancy termination.\n  When you take up ``B,'' Mr. President, it is banning the Federal \nfunding for abortions in women's Federal prisons. What is a woman to do \nin a Federal prison when she is raped and wants an abortion? Under the \nprovisions of the ban, there would be no abortion.\n  We debated very extensively on the floor of the U.S. Senate the \nconfirmation of Dr. Henry Foster. I say to you, Mr. President, that was \nnot one of the better days in the U.S. Senate. Here we had a man who \nwas practically run out of town on a rail, denied confirmation because \nhe had done one thing--performed medical procedures, abortions, which \nwere authorized under the U.S. Constitution. It is very difficult to \nget good people to come to Washington to serve. And it is \nunderstandable that people do not want to come to this city when they \nare not given their day in \n\n[[Page S11502]]\ncourt or on the floor of the U.S, Senate, because, simply stated, they \nperform medical procedures, abortions, permitted under the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  There are many matters which are now pending and which will be coming \nto the floor of this body when other bills are taken up. The issue on \nbanning funding for women in prison will come up on one appropriations \nbill--on judiciary. I serve as chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Service, and education, and \nthere are a number of issues which will come to the floor when that \nmatter comes here.\n  I suggest to you, Mr. President, that when we take up these issues \nand have such extended debate on them, as we did on Foster before, as \nwe are doing today on Federal health care programs, as we will be doing \non many, many issues, that we could better be spending our time on \nwrestling with the very difficult issues which are in line with the \nmandate of the 1994 election. We were sent here--the 104th Congress was \nelected, Mr. President, to deal with fundamental issues. There was a \nrevolution in November 1994, and the mandate at that time, as \ncharacterized by the Contract With America, was to return to core \nvalues--that is, to cut the Federal Government, to reduce spending, to \nreduce taxes, to have a strong national defense, and to have effective \ncrime control.\n  There is not a word in the Contract With America about abortion. \nThere is not a word in the Contract With America about any divisive \nsocial issue. We were in the process last night until midnight debating \nthe defense authorization bill, which I suggest is a matter of \noverwhelming importance where we decide what our priorities should be \non national defense. And that bill has been removed from consideration \nby the Senate, so that we can take up this issue today.\n  I suggest, Mr. President, that our time would be better spent if we \nhad continued the debate on national defense. We have very vital issues \nas to how we are going to be allocating the Federal dollars. I am very \nmuch concerned, Mr. President, that we move on the glidepath to have a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002. That is going to be a very difficult \nmatter to decide and debate and to make the tough decisions on.\n  There is grave concern about Medicare. I think it is very important \nthat we preserve the benefits for the senior citizens in the United \nStates under Medicare. There are major considerations with what the \nHouse has done on limiting funding for education, for Head Start, for \nscholarship programs. I suggest that that is a major issue we ought to \nbe taking up. We have important considerations on the National \nInstitutes of Health as to what we are going to do on health issues, \nmatters which I submit are really the core issues on the mandate for \nthis Republican Congress from the voters in 1994.\n  What we are saying here is a basic constitutional issue which has \nbeen decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, and however you \nmay slice it, however you may refine it, it is still a frontal attack, \na virtual meltdown, on women's rights, from A to Z.\n  This particular one comes in at ``M,'' the mandate that the Federal \nemployees insurance should exclude abortion coverage.\n  It would be my hope, Mr. President, that we would reject the \namendment which is offered by the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, \nrecognizing the sincerity of his views, but recognizing the law of the \nland in the United States is established by the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States. The Supreme Court of the United States has upheld the \nconstitutional right of a woman to choose.\n  If that is to be overturned, under the provisions of our \nConstitution, we know how to do it with a two-thirds vote here and in \nthe House and ratification by three-fourths of the States.\n  What we are seeing is a systematic meltdown, a systematic dismantling \nof a woman's right to choose. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield 7 minutes to a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Murray.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.\n   Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Senator from \nOklahoma, and in support of civil servants' full access to reproductive \nhealth care, including abortion services.\n\n  The other body has recently taken a major step backward for women \nthroughout this country. In its version of the fiscal year 1996 \nTreasury-Postal appropriations bill, the House denied all civil \nservants the right to chose health insurance programs that provide \nabortion services.\n  By reversing previous congressional action providing full access to \nreproductive health services for women in Government, the House has \nonce again cast a long shadow over a woman's right to sovereignty over \nher own body. I believe this action was wrong, and I believe the U.S. \nSenate has a responsibility to take a much more thoughtful approach to \nmaking major policy shifts in the appropriations process.\n  Civil servants, like most Americans, obtain their health care \nservices through their employment. Like me and many people I know, they \npersonally pay a part of their insurance premiums, and their employer--\nin this case the Government--pays the balance. I believe these people, \nlike most Americans, should be able to choose their own insurance, and \nuse any of the services offered by that insurance.\n  Civil servants are no different than any other American; why should \nthey be treated differently with their health insurance. They are \nregular people: The air traffic controller, the bridge\n engineer, the customs agent, secretaries, maintenance workers. These \nare regular Americans, and probably our neighbors.\n\n  Mr. President, most private sector working people have ready access \nto reproductive health services. Major insurers such as Aetna, Kaiser \nPermanente, and Blue Cross/Blue Shield provide this coverage. I believe \nwomen who work in the Government should have the same choices in health \ncoverage enjoyed by women in the private sector. Aside from being a \nmatter of consumer choice, access to reproductive services is the law \nof the land, and should apply even within Government and without.\n  This is not a shocking or unreasonable position. There is broad \nsupport within the Federal work force--and more importantly, within the \ncountry--for consumer choice in health insurance. Every union \nrepresenting Federal employees has endorsed access to abortion services \nin the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.\n  There are 9 million Americans covered by the program, including at \nleast 1.2 million women in the prime of their lives. These women rely \non the program; it is their only source of health insurance protection. \nThey, like every other woman in America, are entitled to make their own \nchoices about whether and when to bear a child. As I said, that choice \nis a fundamental constitutional right.\n  The other body is once again trying to turn the health care choices \nof women in Government into a political football. This is \nmicromanagement of the worse kind, and it is wrong. The U.S. Congress \nshould not be making reproductive health choices for Federal workers. \nNor should it discriminate against Federal workers who choose to have \nan abortion.\n  By denying women employees health coverage for abortion services, \nCongress would be doing just that. It would force female workers and \ntheir families to purchase separate insurance\n to cover reproductive health services. This would amount to a major \nwage reduction, and worse, it would be discriminatory.\n\n  Mr. President, the suggestion of the Senator from Oklahoma that we \nreject the committee amendments in this case is not a reasonable one \nfor women, whether they are in Government or not. The action of the \nHouse represents a major policy shift.\n  Two years ago, the Congress voted to give civil servants the choice. \nMillions of workers and thousands of families have since made health \ncare decisions based on that action. If we backtrack now, we will throw \nthese families into uncertainty once again about their options for \nhealth care, family planning, and household finances. Haven't we gotten \nbeyond this?\n  I have heard on this floor over and over again this year that people \nknow best; that families know best; that Government needs to get out of \npeople's lives. I could not agree more. Why is it then, that some in \nthis Chamber continue to insist on injecting the Federal Government \ninto people's personal \n\n[[Page S11503]]\nlives, into their bedrooms, and into their health care decisions?\n  Let me conclude with a personal story. My personal awakening to the \nabortion issue came when I was in college. Back then--and it was not \nthat long ago--abortion was not legal. A friend of mine was date-raped, \nand she became pregnant. Wracked with fear, she was forced to have a \nback-alley abortion. The damage done to her during that procedure has \nprevented her from ever having children. I want to ensure that no other \nwoman in this country, including my own daughter, has that experience.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the committee amendments, and reject \na motion to table.\n  I yield my time back to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 63 minutes, the \nSenator from Oklahoma has 73 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Maine, Senator \nSnowe, a colleague from the House. We welcome her on this.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator for yielding and appreciate her \nefforts here today because I think it is critically important to the \nissue that we are debating and will determine the Senate position.\n  I hope that we do not adopt the House position. I believe it is \nregrettable that we have even reached this point because, in effect, \nwhat we would be doing by accepting the House position is to further \nsubjugate women's lives and the health of Federal employees to a new \nstandard--a lower standard.\n  I agree with Senator Specter, who has said that it is about one ban \nafter another, after another ban, in attempts to do legislatively what \nthe courts have failed to do judiciously--to roll back, gut, water \ndown, strip away a woman's right to choose.\n  Now, we will talk about the issue at hand today. It is about changing \nthe status quo of health care for female Federal employees in America. \nIt would not take them a step forward. It would take a giant step \nbackward.\n  It would prohibit Federal employee health benefit plans from covering \ntermination of pregnancies in all instances, even in cases of rape and \nincest. So a Federal employee could not make that determination, even \nin the cases of rape and incest.\n  It does not allow a female Federal employee to make that decision on \nher own--a personal, moral decision, and, yes, a very difficult one at \nthat.\n  What we are saying here today is that the power of the purse of \nCongress ought to penalize a large number of women who work in the \nFederal Government from making their health care choices.\n  It is going to provide a serious financial handicap to a lot of \nfamilies if they have to make that decision, because there are a number \nof Federal employees who are at or below the poverty level. Mr. \nPresident, 25 percent of the Federal employees earn less than $25,000, \nand 18,000 Federal employees are at or below the Federal poverty level.\n  Now we are saying, ``We are sorry, you cannot make the choices about \nyour health insurance.''\n  We are telling 1.2 million women who work for the Federal Government \nthat you cannot have the same access to health care choices as your \ncounterparts in the private sector. There are 78 million women in the \nprivate sector who have those choices. The fact is, two-thirds of the \nprivate sector fee-for-service plans offer coverage for an array of \nreproductive choices; 70 percent of health maintenance organization \nplans provide reproductive choice coverage. Mr. President, 178 of the \n345 health care plans that are offered to the Federal employees offer \nthis choice. Four of the five major plans do so.\n  But now we are saying we are going to distinguish a woman's right to \nchoice by virtue of whether they work in the private sector or for the \nFederal Government, and that is what is wrong. We are denying the women \nwho work in the Federal Government their constitutionally protected \nright, that has been affirmed and reaffirmed by the highest court in \nthe land. It is discriminatory, it is unfair, it is inequitable.\n  Federal health insurance is one form of compensation to Federal \nworkers. They have earned that. They get their salary, they get their \nhealth care, and they get their pension coverage. It is not a Federal \nallowance. It is not a handout. It is something that they have earned \nand has been decided upon through an employment agreement. What is to \ndistinguish from the fact that we say, ``Well, Federal salaries are \nsupported by taxpayers, therefore we are going to say that you cannot \nuse your Federal salary to make your choices with respect to \nreproductive health care?'' What is the difference? There is none.\n  Should we not allow Federal workers to make the decision about what \nkind of health insurance they have? I think so. I think they ought to \nbe able to make that decision. Congress should not make that decision. \nThe Federal Government should not make that decision for them. It is a \npersonal decision. It is a constitutionally protected right decision.\n  So I hope we will not accept the House language, because it is \nregressive. It is penalizing to the 1.2 million women who work for the \nFederal Government. It is singling them out and denying them the same \nrights of freedom of choice as those women who work in the private \nsector.\n  I hope we reject the House position. We cannot underestimate the \nconsequences of this decision. There is a lot at stake here. It is \nabout the rights of Federal employees, not to mention the reproductive \nfreedom of women who work for the Federal Government.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments made by several \nof my colleagues and I appreciate their positions and the sincerity \nwith which they hold those positions. But let me just make a couple of \npoints.\n  I have heard a couple of our friends say, ``If we adopt the House \nlanguage we are denying a constitutional right.'' I disagree. There is \nnothing in the Constitution that says taxpayers have to pay for \nabortions. It is not in there. You can read the Constitution up and \ndown, it is not in there. Taxpayers do not have to pay for abortions. \nThere has not been a constitutional amendment that says, ``Taxpayers, \nyou have to pay for it.'' So we are not denying people their \nconstitutional rights.\n  I have heard colleagues say, ``It should be their personal \ndecision.'' It should be their personal decision with their personal \nmoney, not with taxpayers' money. Sure, if they want to use their own \nmoney, they can use their own money. There is nothing in our language \nthat says Federal employees cannot use their own money.\n  Abortions are not very expensive. They cost about $250. You can get \nthem pretty quickly. You can be in and out in an hour or two. They can \nuse their own money to do that. Most Federal employees are pretty well \npaid, they can probably afford that. We have to remember--how easy do \nwe want to make this? Do you want to have it paid for by the Federal \nGovernment, the Federal Government paying 72 percent of this, the cost \nof health insurance, turning it into a fringe benefit?\n  I want Federal employees to have decent benefits as well. But I do \nnot think that benefit should include the destruction of a human life \nand I do not think it should include taxpayers paying for it. If they \nwant to make that decision with their own money, that should be their \ndecision with their own money. It should not require Federal subsidies.\n  They should have that right--I guess under present law they have that \nright, or present interpretation of the Constitution they have that \nright. I am not arguing with that. Some people want to debate that. \nMaybe we will debate that another day.\n  What we are arguing about is Federal taxpayers' money. We are not \nundoing the Constitution. I heard people mention financial handicap. It \nshould not be easy to get an abortion. If you make this a standard \nfringe benefit item, readily available, Uncle Sam is picking up 72 \npercent of the cost, you get one in an hour or so--done. Maybe the out-\nof-pocket costs, I do not know, maybe it depends on the plan--maybe it \nis only $20 or $40. Just destroy a human life, be out tomorrow--be out \nin an hour. And we are destroying the life of \n\n[[Page S11504]]\na human being created in the image of God. I think that is a serious \nmistake and there is nothing in the Constitution that says taxpayers \nhave to pay for it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from California, \nSenator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend from Maryland for giving me this time \nand for her leadership on this issue. I hope the men and women of \nAmerica are listening to this debate, are watching this debate. I hope \nthey not only listen to the arguments but they pick up the tone of \nvoice that is used--the tone of voice that is used when talking about \nthe women of this country.\n  Women who are employed by the Federal Government work hard. They pay \n28 percent of their health premiums out of their own pockets. And when \nit comes to their health care coverage they deserve the same health \nbenefits as women who work in the private sector. They do not deserve \nto be lectured to by U.S. Senators who wish to make their own personal \nand private decisions for them.\n  Oh, $250 is not a lot for a certain Senator who says it is not a lot \nfor him. That is fine. Maybe it is a lot more to someone else who may \nearn $18,000 a year here. By the way, we have people who earn $18,000 a \nyear here. You just tell them $250 is not a lot of money. That is \ndisrespectful. That it elitist. And what if there are complications and \nit costs $1,000? And what if there are serious complications in the \nsituation and it costs $2,000? Senators who earn an awful lot of money \nhave no right to treat other people that way.\n  Mr. President, this is the beginning of a debate that is going to \nlast a long time, not only today but many days, because it is an attack \non the rights of women. There are enough people in the Senate who \nunderstand that, and who are not going to allow it to go by because \nwhat is at stake here is a much larger vote than the vote that we face.\n  Those who push this know they cannot win a vote to criminalize \nabortion. That is what their agenda is. We know it. We have heard it. \nConstitutional amendments outlawing abortion, that is what the agenda \nis around here. Let us face it. But they cannot win the vote. They \ncannot win a vote to arrest doctors and nurses and put them in prison \nand arrest women and put them in prison, so they go after the women \nthey have power over, the poor women, who are on Medicaid--those are \nthe most powerless--and the Federal employees, who they have control \nover.\n  Mr. President, 1.5 million women, in this case Federal employees, and \ntheir dependents--yes, this matter deals with life. It deals with the \nlives of Federal employees. And to call health insurance a fringe \nbenefit is another out-of-touch statement. I think the Senator from \nMaine addressed that very, very well.\n  Listen to the tone in the voice when talking about this issue as if \nit was an easy choice. Oh, women will go to doctors, just in and out, \nmake this decision, make this choice, go home as if it was some easy \nchoice. It always amazes me when men, in particular, who oppose the \nwomen's right to choose, talk about it like it was going to the store \nto pick out a dress. That is an insult to the women of this country. \nThis is a painful choice. This is a choice made with one's God. This is \na choice made with one's family. This is a choice made with one's \nphysician. And to talk about it as if it was not even a problem or a \ndifficult decision is an insult to the women of this country.\n  When we get to the welfare debate, I hope we hear the same compassion \nfor little kids who are undernourished and impoverished as we do for \nfetuses in the early days of a pregnancy. There is a politician in the \nHouse who said those who are against the women's right to choose are \nall for your right to be born, but after that you are on your own.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I have 2 additional minutes?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield 2 minutes with pleasure to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I hope we hear the same compassion we hear for a fetus in \nthe first few days as we hear for those babies who need the WIC \nProgram, who need the Head Start Program. But do you know what I am \ngoing to hear from the same people? ``Give it to the States. Let the \nStates decide.'' For those little kids--let the States decide. Let 50 \ndifferent Governors and 50 legislatures decide. We do not have to \ndecide here if a kid can go hungry. But we are going to decide, by God, \nwhat women, who happen to work for the Federal Government, do with \ntheir own bodies. Because $250 is not a problem. Well, it may not be a \nproblem for some Senators, but it may be a problem for some Federal \nemployees.\n  We cannot turn the clock back. We fixed this problem in 1993 and said \nat that time that women who are Federal employees will be treated like \nwomen all over the country. To go back on that would be wrong.\n  Is this a pattern that I see developing here, women who the Senate \ncan control will be treated differently than women anywhere else? If it \nis women involved in an ethics case, they cannot come forward in a \npublic forum. If it is women who are Federal employees, they cannot go \nforward and exercise their right to choose. What is next? What is next?\n  So I am proud to stand with my friend from Maryland, and I hope she \nprevails. And we will stay here as long as we have to until we win this \nbattle.\n  I yield my time back.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Before I yield to the Senator from New Jersey, I note \nthat the Senator from Oklahoma is both the manager of his time and now \nhe is the Presiding Officer. Is it, therefore, the Senator from \nOklahoma's--and I speak to him now as a Senator from Oklahoma----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Are you temporarily in the chair so that Senator-- I \ndid not know if you were going to be there for a whole hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from New Jersey \n10 minutes, and at the conclusion of his remarks, I will presume the \nSenator from Ohio will speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nickles). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am proud to stand with my colleagues \nin the U.S. Senate, not coincidentally relatively new Members, who \nfrankly, to use the expression, have changed the complexion of the \nplace. And by that I do not mean the exterior. I do not mean the facial \nmakeup. I am talking about integrity, I am talking about honesty, and I \nam talking about understanding that they represent the majority of \npeople in this country. And, yet, there is a move afoot to tell them \nhow to behave.\n  I rise in support of the committee amendment and to support a woman's \nright to choose.\n  Mr. President, the opponents of this committee amendment are trying \nto take away the right to choose from our Federal employees and their \nfamilies.\n  The current Federal employees health system allows women to choose \nthe type of health plan that suits them best. They can select a plan \nthat includes abortion coverage. Or they can select a plan that does \nnot. It is their choice.\n But the opponents of the committee amendment want to take away the \nright under a legitimate Federal health plan from getting abortion \ncoverage.\n\n  The opponents of those rights for Federal employees, citizens, like \nany other, want to effectively take away the right to choose for 1.2 \nmillion women of reproductive age who rely on a Federal health plan for \nhealth coverage.\n  In doing so, they are proposing to discriminate against a certain \nclass of women. They are saying that if you work for the private sector \nyou can get complete reproductive health care coverage.\n  But if you work for the Federal Government you cannot. We forget that \nthey have the same rights as any other citizen.\n  Mr. President, many people around here are deeply committed to \neliminating a woman's right to choose. And we \n\n[[Page S11505]]\nhave already seen how far they will go to pursue their agenda.\n  In June of this year, a minority of Republicans blocked a vote on the \nnomination of Dr. Henry Foster to be Surgeon General. They brought down \na man who had spent 38 years delivering health care to poor people,\n delivering babies by the thousands. But a minority defeated him just \nbecause he had performed other legal and obligatory procedures for his \npatients as long as it was not against his conscience, and obviously he \nwas a forthright physician who knew that he had a responsibility first \nto the health and well-being of his patients.\n\n  Dr. Foster's nomination became the first of the Republican primaries \nway in advance of New Hampshire or Iowa. The cloture votes were not \nabout Dr. Foster's qualifications; they were about who could pander \nmost to groups who want to outlaw a woman's right to choose in this \ncountry--nothing more, nothing less.\n  Mr. President, about 70 percent of the American people believe a \nwoman should have the right to choose what to do with her own body. Yet \nmany in Congress listen only to a narrow segment of the population \nwhose views are radically outside the mainstream. And they seem intent \non imposing their views on everybody else.\n  In that light, I would just like to remind my colleagues of what the \nRepublican Party platform says about a woman's right to choose.\n  It is pretty bold, and it was not a hidden statement: a \n``constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion.'' That is the mission.\n  The Republican Party platform calls for a constitutional amendment to \ntake away a woman's right to choose.\n  A constitutional ban on abortion. In fact, that has been part of the \nRepublican Party platform since 1980.\n  Not surprisingly, Mr. President, Republicans in Congress are trying \nto do just what their party platform states. They are trying to take \naway a woman's right to choose. And they are trying to do it by \nchipping away at that right, bit by bit.\n  Now, to be fair, Mr. President, I do want to say that not all members \nof the Republican Party share this view.\n  We heard from the distinguished Senators from Maine and Pennsylvania. \nBut that group is a small minority. They are prochoice. They speak out. \nBut they are not part of the party's leadership, and they are not \ndriving the Republican agenda. They are shut out.\n  I want to let my colleagues know that I will join the fight against \nthe Republican leadership and the antichoice legislative agenda at \nevery turn. And I am delighted to be serving in the ranks of those who \noppose taking away women's right to choose, led particularly by the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland and from California and others. \nLike the majority of Americans, I support the law and support Roe \nversus Wade and the constitutional right for American women to choose.\n  Mr. President, the women of this country should be concerned about \ntheir reproductive rights because the Republican Party can put its \nantichoice views into action in this Congress. They are not going to \nstop with Federal employees. They have bigger targets.\n  They plan to do everything in their power to restrict a woman's right \nto choose. We hear it all the time. They have a lot of antichoice \nlegislation on the drawing board.\n  For example, they plan to reinstate the gag rule and its overseas \nequivalent, the Mexico City policy. These proposals seek to intrude on \nthe doctor-patient relationship.\n  They also plan to restrict a woman's right to choose if that woman \nhappens to serve overseas in the military.\n  Mind you, someone who has agreed to join our military to protect this \ncountry has an immediate disadvantage, if she chooses to have an \nabortion, or if a member of her family has, or if she is a victim of \nrape and is on Medicaid, or if she is poor and she lives in the \nDistrict of Columbia, they plan to take away reproductive health care \ncoverage for these women. It is, indeed, an extremist agenda. Why are \nthey doing this? Because doing this is a means to an end. They want to \noutlaw abortion, and they are trying to do it step by step.\n  Mr. President, this is a buildup to ultimately passing a \nconstitutional amendment to outlaw the right to choose, plain and \nsimple.\n  The American women must also be afraid of what might happen in future \nPresidential elections. If another antichoice President is elected, \nwomen could face another barrage of Federal regulations designed to \nrestrict a woman's right to choose. They could face another round of \nantichoice nominees to the Supreme Court. And this would be a replay of \nwhat happened back in the Reagan-Bush administrations when we got \nClarence Thomas and the infamous gag rule.\n  I hope it will not happen, Mr. President, but those of us who care \nabout a woman's right to choose owe a need to keep the broader \nantichoice agenda in view. Whenever the right of some women to choose \nis threatened, whether they be Federal employees, rape victims, or \nresidents of DC, every woman's rights are threatened, and that is why \nwe need to fight back every step of the way.\n  I was astounded this week when I heard over the radio a distinguished \nCongressman, well-known senior Congressman from the State of Illinois, \nstate on the radio that abortion is a worse crime than rape. He alone \nis making decisions as to what the law ought to say, not respecting \nwhat is in the Constitution, not respecting what is in the statutes but \ndeciding--he deciding--that abortion is a crime worse than rape.\n  That is a foul thought. What is being said by so many of the \nproponents of individual rights, the ability to own guns, the ability \nto resist taxes, is that, yes, an individual's rights overcome all \nother things. Mr. President, we sometimes forget we are a nation of \nlaws, not of men. That is the cardinal principle--laws that apply to \neverybody. And the law is firm that the woman, in the right of privacy, \nhas a right to choose. But there are those same people who will insist \nthat they know best what is best for a woman. I find it shocking that a \nlegislator would suggest that abortion is a worse crime than rape.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will support the committee \nand protect a woman's right to choose, fight hard to preserve that \nright because therein I think is the precursor of what happens to the \nrights of all of us across this country.\n  The greatness of our society is the application of law and the \nobedience to law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma has yielded me \nas much time as I desire in debate.\n  Let me first thank the Presiding Officer for taking my place in the \nchair so I have the opportunity to discuss for a few minutes this very \ncontentious and very emotional issue.\n  Let me start, if I could, by trying to put this debate today, though, \nin perspective because the issue that we are debating today is very \nnarrow. It is very narrowly drawn. Each one of us has very strong \nfeelings about the abortion issue. As I look around this Chamber and \nsee my colleagues who are debating this issue today, I think each and \nevery one of us at one time or the other has done this before and our \npositions are very well known. Whether it is in this body or the other \nbody, we have all debated this.\n  The issue today is not the big picture issue about abortion. The \nissue today was defined very well by the Senator from Oklahoma. He has \ndone it several times in the Chamber, but I wish to bring it back to \nthat issue if I could. That issue is simply this: Should Federal tax \ndollars be used to subsidize abortion? That is it. That is what the \nissue is. Should Federal tax dollars be taken from citizens across this \ncountry, from every taxpayer, to subsidize abortions?\n  Let us try to put the debate in even more perspective. The abortion \ndebate and the abortion issue is one of the most--no, it is not one of \nthe most; it is the most--emotional, contentious, gut-wrenching debates \nin which this country engages. It is an issue that divides families. It \nis an issue that divides friends to the point where most of us, most of \nus will not on a casual basis even talk about it. I know of no issue in \nthis country that is so emotional and that at the same time finds the \nAmerican people so divided.\n  With that background, this not being just any ordinary issue where we \nare \n\n[[Page S11506]]\ntrying to decide whether we spend tax dollars or not, this is the moral \nissue, some people would argue, the moral issue of our day. On the one \nhand, the argument about freedom; on the other hand, the argument about \nlife.\n  That is the perspective that I think we have to take and the \nhistorical background as we come to this debate today. I find no \ncompelling reason for this Congress, for this Senate to say to every \nAmerican taxpayer, ``You have no choice; you have to subsidize \nabortion, and a portion of your income tax will be used, however small \nit might be, for something that you feel so emotional about and that \nyou feel is such a matter of principle.''\n  When I was growing up in Yellow Springs, OH, a few of the people I \nknew, or at least knew of, who felt so strongly about what we were \ndoing in the late 1950's and early 1960's, under President Eisenhower \nand President Kennedy, about national defense, they did not want their \ntaxes being used for national defense. I am sure people feel strongly \nabout a lot of different issues, and we make a decision as a country \nthat we do not let people pick and choose what taxes they pay. We \nshould not.\n  My only point is this issue that we are talking about today is \ndifferent. It is different because the country is so divided, and it is \ndifferent because it is such an emotional issue and because people feel \nso very strongly about it. I see no compelling reason to take \ntaxpayers' dollars to do this.\n  Mr. President, the argument has been made on this floor that if the \nSenator from Oklahoma prevails on this issue, we will be taking a right \naway from people. I think he has addressed that very well. That simply \nis not true. Health care plans do not pay for everything. No health \ncare plan pays for everything. There are choices that are made. No one \nargues that the Federal Government has the legal obligation or the \nmoral obligation or the constitutional obligation to provide for every \nmedical service that someone might want or might need.\n So it is a question of choice. It is a question of choosing what, with \nfinite tax dollars, we as a Congress believe, the trustees of the \nAmerican people, that we should spend the taxpayers' dollars on. And so \nI will be voting with my friend and colleague from Oklahoma.\n\n  I will just close on this final note. In every poll that I have \nseen--better yet, in discussions I have had with people across the \nState of Ohio for the last 4 or 5 years--I have traveled Ohio, it seems \nlike almost nonstop, for 5 years talking to thousands of people--it is \nclear to me that while people have various views about the big abortion \nissue, the overwhelming majority of the American people do not believe \ntax dollars should be used to fund abortion.\n  So when some of my colleagues make statements that would indicate \nthat this action today, if we take this action, will be against the \nmajority view of the American people, my answer to that is that it is \nsimply not true. Every survey would indicate otherwise. Our own surveys \nthat we all do as we campaign, as we travel and meet with people that \nwe try to represent, would indicate otherwise.\n  It is a narrow issue. Let us keep our eye on the ball. Let us not \nallow this debate to get off into, as my friend and colleague a moment \nago was talking about, a Republican agenda or Democrat agenda, \nplatform. This is a very, very narrow issue, to use tax dollars to fund \nabortion. Do you turn to people who feel very strongly about this issue \nand say, ``We don't care what you think, we are still involuntarily \ntaking money from your paycheck every week to do something that you \nfind to be very offensive\"? That is the issue. It is very narrow. It is \nvery simple.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your courtesy, and I yield back my \ntime.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from California, \nSenator Feinstein. She is very able on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair and the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the committee amendment and in \nopposition to the motion to table. The reason I do so is because it is \nmy belief, Mr. President, that the motion to table is a first step of a \nlong march to remove a woman's right to choose. The Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program is a network of plans that has been estimated \nto cover about 9 million people: Federal employees, retirees, and their \ndependents. About 44 percent of these people are women. According to \nestimates, about 1.2 million of these women are of reproductive age.\n  So, if we accept the motion to table, we are saying to 1.2 million \nwomen, no matter what your circumstances are, ``We, the U.S. Senate, \nknow more about your circumstances than you do, more about your \ncircumstances than your doctor knows.'' If successful, I believe there \nwill be another, and then another attack against a woman's right to \nchoose. If those backing this motion have their way, politicians will \nonce again govern a woman's reproductive system. And that will take us \nback to the days I remember well, the days of the back-alley abortion.\n  A woman, regardless of her religious beliefs, regardless of her \ndoctor's advice, will be governed by the advice, the will, the law of \nthe U.S. Senate. It does not seem to matter to people that women often \nfind themselves confronted by a myriad of circumstances. It does not \nhappen to matter that if a woman is raped leaving the Hart, the \nRussell, or the Dirksen Senate Office Building one night, we are \nprepared to say that she will be forced to carry a resulting pregnancy \nto term. No matter what the circumstance, no matter how terrible, no \nmatter how traumatic, if she is a Federal employee, she is on her own \nif she needs an abortion.\n  It is ironic to me that many of the same legislators who opposed \nnational health care reform because they claimed it interfered with a \nwoman's ability or a person's ability to choose their own insurance \ncoverage and health care are the same Members who will vote to deny \nFederal employees the ability to choose abortion coverage in their \ninsurance plans.\n  These same people who have long advocated that Government get off the \nbacks of the people are willing to put Government right back on when it \ncomes to a very personal decision about abortion.\n  Our Constitution, the highest law of the land, provides privacy \nrights for a woman to be able to make this basic decision in \nconsultation with a doctor, if she chooses, and basically to control \nher own reproductive system. And that is what this is really all about.\n  This motion would declare that Federal female employees are second-\nclass citizens. Although women pay for a percentage of their health \ncare plan, no health care plan would be able to contain reproductive \nplanning services if the Federal Government pays any portion of that \nplan. She is a second-class citizen because, in fact, two-thirds of all \nprivate health care plans do cover abortion and 70 percent of all \nhealth maintenance organizations, what we call HMO's, do offer a full \nrange of health care services, including abortion.\n  So if a woman works in the private sector, she has access to these \nplans. If the motion to table were successful, if a woman works for the \nFederal Government, she would not have access. As a result, she becomes \na second-class citizen.\n  So I believe the issue here is very simple. It is the first step in \nthe long march to say who controls a woman's reproductive system. Is it \nthe Congress of the United States or is it the woman, her beliefs, and \nher doctor? I am one, frankly, who believes we have many more serious \nproblems to tackle than this one. And I am one, frankly, who is really \nvery shocked to see in this day and age when the state of the art of \nhealth insurance plans is to offer reproductive family planning \nservices, including abortion, that the Congress of the United States is \nwilling to take this choice away from 1.2 million women who happen to \nbe Federal employees. And the fact of the matter is, the woman who is \ndenied the right to choose is the lowest paid woman.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the time----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The time has expired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Does the Senator from Oklahoma wish to speak?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I would be happy to make a few comments. \nI appreciate the statements that have been made by several of our \ncolleagues. I appreciate the statement made by the \n\n[[Page S11507]]\n\nPresiding Officer, which was right on target. The Presiding Officer, \nthe Senator from Ohio, mentioned this is not about a woman's right to \nchoose, not about a constitutional amendment. It is not about national \nplatforms. It is about whether or not we are going to subsidize \nabortions by taxpayers.\n  Somebody mentioned polling. I believe the Senator from New Jersey \nsaid 70 percent of the people support the right to choose. Certainly \nthat sounds good. If you ask people if they want their tax dollars \nbeing used to fund abortion, which is destroying an innocent human \nlife, you will find well over 70 percent say no. And that is all this \namendment does.\n  I have heard a couple of my colleagues now say, ``This is the first \nattack leading to a constitutional amendment that will ban abortion.'' \nI have been in this body for--this is my 15th or 16th year. We have \nnever voted on a constitutional amendment yet to outlaw abortion.\n  I think some people are trying to scare other people. We have had \nvotes every single year on whether or not we are going to fund abortion \nwith taxpayers' dollars--every single year. I am sure it will continue. \nSomeone said, ``Oh, I wish this issue would go away.'' Well, we have to \nmake decisions on how we are to spend money. Are we going to use our \ntaxpayer dollars in what way? Are we going to use it for fringe \nbenefits that include abortions? We have to make a decision. Are we \ngoing to do it or not do it? That is public policy.\n  The Senator from New Jersey said we are a nation of laws. I agree \nwith that. We have to make laws. It is interesting to note we have \nnever made a law legalizing abortion. Congress has never passed a law. \nBut we are not debating that today. That would be a good thing to \ndebate.\n  I know many people in this body support such a law, the codification \nof Roe versus Wade. Roe versus Wade is a 1973 decision to legalize \nabortion. That was a Supreme Court decision. That was not an act of \nCongress.\n  I read the Constitution to say that Congress should pass all laws, \narticle I. Congress should pass all laws. That was the law where \nbasically Roe versus Wade was legalized. That is not what we are \ndebating today. We are debating today the power of the purse, are we \ngoing to use taxpayers' dollars to subsidize abortion?\n  Taxpayers pay 72 percent of the cost of Federal employees health \ninsurance. So we have a right to say what is and what is not in it. \nThere are a lot of things not in Federal employees health insurance. We \ndo not have free dental coverage. A lot of people would like to have \nit, but we do not have it. It may be available somewhere, but you do \nnot have free dental coverage.\n  We have to make decisions. We have to make decisions of how we are \ngoing to spend the money. Taxpayers pay 72 percent of the cost of \nFederal employees health insurance. We have to decide, do we want to \ninclude abortion.\n  I heard two colleagues say this is just another medical procedure. I \ndisagree. They may want it to cover abortion just like it would cover--\nI do not know--a tooth extraction or maybe anything else that is \nroutine, but this is elective surgery. What does that elective surgery \ndo? It destroys the life of an innocent unborn human being.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will not at this point. I will in a moment. It \ndestroys the life of an innocent human being. Now that is serious and \nit is serious when you say to the taxpayers, ``We want you to pay for \nthree-fourths of it.''\n  So we are not debating constitutional amendments. We are not debating \na woman's right to choose. We are not changing the law. We are debating \nhow we are going to spend money. This amendment says no funds shall be \nused. We have that right.\n  As I say, we have debated this every single year on Health and Human \nServices because we deal with Medicaid. That is a national health \nprogram for low-income people, and we debate that every year.\n  I might mention, we have had restrictions every year saying we should \nnot use Federal money to subsidize abortion for low-income people. Now \nwe are talking about Federal employees. Federal employees, for the most \npart, are not low income. Most Federal employees do OK. Maybe they are \nnot all upper income, I did not say that, but the language we have \nright now, if we allowed it to go in, would basically say, ``Well, \nwe're going to have abortion as a fringe benefit for all Federal \nemployees paid for by the taxpayers,'' 72 percent paid by the \ntaxpayers, regardless of what their income level is.\n  Again, you have to go back to, what are we subsidizing? We are \nsubsidizing the destruction of a human life. A lot of Americans feel \nvery, very strongly that is not the way our tax dollars should be \nspent. They feel very strongly about it, and that is the reason why we \nhave had these debates every year.\n  Some may say, ``Well, this is delaying the process.'' This Senator \nhas no desire to delay the process. I was happy to have this amendment \nconsidered under a 1-hour time limit equally divided. I think everybody \nin this body knows how they are going to vote.\n  But I just wanted to respond to some of my colleagues. I heard some \nof my colleagues say, ``I support the right of the freedom of choice. I \nsupport the right to choose.'' I heard that. We are talking about a \nlife. We are talking about an unborn child.\n  I want people to have the maximum degree of freedom and liberty \nimaginable. I want people to have the right to choose almost anything \neverywhere. This is America. This is the land of opportunity, the land \nof the free, but that does not include destroying other human beings. \nThere are certain restrictions. That does not include hurting or \nharming someone else, and it certainly does not include having \ntaxpayers pay for it.\n  So that is what this amendment is all about. We do not think that \ntaxpayers should be forced to subsidize Federal employees in paying for \nabortions. That was the policy of our Nation, that was the law of the \nland from 1984 to 1993. President Clinton and his administration were \nsuccessful in changing that 2 years ago. We had a good, heated debate \nthen. We lost by two votes. Hopefully, we will not lose today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? \nIt is common courtesy around here. If he chooses not----\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield on the Senator's time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank you. I yield the floor. This is an indication \nof where we are going here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield 5 minutes to the patient Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nMaryland for her leadership on this very important issue.\n  Mr. President, I think there is a bitter irony to this debate. Last \nCongress, we were talking about the proposition that people in the \ncountry should have as good a health care coverage as Senators and \nRepresentatives have, and we talked about the Federal employees \nbenefits plan as the model.\n  As a matter of fact, sometime this Congress I intend to make sure \nthat we vote on that proposition, that we make a commitment to making \nsure that by the end of this Congress, we pass legislation that will \nprovide the people we represent with as good a coverage as we have.\n  Now we have an amendment which essentially says that the Federal \nemployees benefits package will not provide as good a coverage, as \nhumane a coverage as many men and women have through their private \nhealth insurance plans.\n  With the Federal employees benefits plan, nobody is required to \npurchase a plan that covers abortion, but if that is the choice of a \nwoman and her family, then she has the right to make that choice. That \nis the way it is with our private health insurance plans in this \ncountry.\n  So I rise to support the committee amendment and certainly will \noppose any effort to table the committee amendment, because I think \nthis is just an issue of discrimination. There is no reason why a \npublic employee, a woman who is a public employee, should have any less \nthe right to obtain coverage for abortion services \n\n[[Page S11508]]\nthan someone who is working in the private sector. That is what this \nissue is all about.\n  When I hear my colleague saying, ``Well, someone who works for the \nGovernment, someone who is a public-sector employee, can purchase her \nown private plan,'' we make $130,000 a year, so I guess we can. I guess \nour spouses can. But guess what, a lot of people who work for the \nGovernment make $18,000 and $20,000 a year. It is not so easy for them \nto do so.\n  So (A) this is an issue of fairness; (B) it is a bitter irony to see \nus now move away from Federal employees benefits plan as a model and, \ninstead, essentially try and say we are going to weaken this plan and \ndeny many Government employees the same right, the same opportunity to \npurchase coverage that they would have in the private sector.\n  And then finally, Mr. President, let me just say that when I hear my \ncolleague say we have not had a debate on a constitutional amendment to \nban abortion, that is right, because the votes are not there. But I \nwill tell you something, what this vote is all about, as my colleague \nfrom California said, it is a long march in that direction. This is a \ntest vote. It is a test vote on Roe versus Wade. It is a test vote on \nchoice. That is what this is all about. Nobody should have any \nillusions to the contrary.\n  I yield the rest of my time.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Did the Senator yield back his time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct, I yield back my time to the manager.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, before my colleague from Minnesota \nleaves, I will just mention, I mentioned we have never had a vote or a \ndebate on a constitutional amendment on banning abortion. I know that \nPresident Clinton, and many others, have sponsored legislation dealing \nwith codification of Roe versus Wade. We never had that debate either. \nMy point being, I do not want to get into a constitutional debate or \nanything else. I agree very strongly with my colleague and friend from \nNew Jersey when he says we are a nation of laws and the legalization of \nabortion, which some people would like to do, the codification of Roe \nversus Wade, I think it is called the Freedom of Choice Act which has \nbeen introduced with a lot of cosponsors, that has never been debated \neither. Maybe at some point we will have to do that, but that is not \nwhat the debate is about today.\n  The debate today is whether or not we are going to have taxpayers' \nfunds used to subsidize abortion.\n  That was just my point I wanted to make. My friend from Minnesota is \na friend and he is energetic in these debates. Maybe at some point we \nwill debate whether Congress should legalize abortion.\n I happen to think if it is going to be legal, it should be passed by \nCongress. That is the way I read the Constitution. It says Congress \nshall pass all laws.\n\n  But the issue today is not constitutional amendments, it is not \nplatforms; it is not agendas, it is how we are going to spend our \nmoney. I hear the references to the private sector. I do not know how \nmany colleagues came from the private sector, but I was in the private \nsector, and I helped put together health plans for our employees. \nAbortion was never a fringe benefit, and I did not think it should be. \nIt is available in some plans in the private sector. That may be their \noption. But in the Federal Government, for Federal employees, we are \nkind of the board of directors or the management team, and we have to \ndecide what the fringe benefits are. I personally do not think \nabortions should be paid for, three-fourths of which--or 72 percent of \nwhich--are paid for by the taxpayers. I think that would be incorrect.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 30 minutes, 21 \nseconds. The Senator from Oklahoma has 53 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nAppropriations Committee amendment. Before I get into my statement, I \nwould like to contest the position of the Senator from Oklahoma that \nsomehow we are dealing with taxpayer funds in the sense that we are in \na position where we ought to control how they are utilized. We are \ntalking here about compensation which is given to a woman for services \nrendered and to extend beyond what normally we would consider \nappropriate to call these funds that should be controlled by the \nGovernment. We are not talking here about Medicaid, which is an \nentirely different issue. We are talking here about compensation \nentitled to a woman for health benefits, and then saying we should, on \ntop of that, have a regulation or prohibition as to how that money can \nbe spent for health care.\n  The Federal policy here is to help provide health care for \nindividuals, not to dictate how they spend their money. I raise that \nbecause to me it raises a dangerous proposition that somehow we can \ncontrol the use of Federal employee compensation and whatever they do \nwith it, and if we are moving in that direction, to say, my God, if \nthey buy something, that is a violation of the law and their \ncompensation should be denied.\n  This is not about Medicaid. We decided in committee not to include \nthe House language in the benefit plan that would keep it from covering \nlegal medical procedures, because we did not want to replace a doctor's \nadvice and counsel with our own. We did not want to dictate how an \nemployee's compensation must be used in that difficult but \nconstitutionally protected area of abortion.\n  Currently, Federal employees can choose a health plan that covers a \nfull range of reproductive services, including abortion. About half of \nthe Federal employee health benefit plans offer the full range. These \nare mostly private plans they are purchasing, not Government plans.\n  Women employed by the Federal Government currently have a choice. \nThey can have a policy with abortion coverage, or they can opt out of \nit. I think that is appropriate. The issue, I think, is more the other \nway. We should not force a woman to buy a policy that covers abortion \nif that is against their beliefs. That is why I think this option \napproach, which is used in Missouri and in other States, is an entirely \nappropriate way to go. Women with full coverage can consult their \ndoctors and choose appropriate health care services without the \nintrusion of our own political beliefs.\n  In a national insurance market, abortion service is included in most \nplans. Nearly 70 percent of all health insurance plans offer such \ncoverage. Why should we want to penalize a Federal employee by denying \nthem and their families what is widely available to other employees \nwith health care coverage?\n  We must remember that abortion is a legal medical procedure. It is \nconstitutionally protected under the right to privacy. The choice of a \nwoman, with the help and the advice of a family doctor, to have an \nabortion is an intensely difficult and personal one. I would not \npresume to decide who should and should not have access to a legal \nmedical procedure.\n  Health care decisions are, by their nature, very sensitive and very \npersonal. Reproductive health matters are even more so. Since I am not \na doctor, I am not qualified to decide which health services are \nappropriate for someone else--even someone who is female and works for \nthe Federal Government.\n  We are not considering which health services generally should be \ncovered. This, rather, deals with a restriction on an employee's \ncompensation as to their ability to do what we want them to do, and \nthat is to provide themselves with health care. We will help provide \nthat.\n  Medicaid would bring out this discussion of the Senator from \nOklahoma. But there will be an appropriate forum for that issue. Why \nshould we here single out Federal employees' reproductive health as an \narea for excessive governmental intrusion merely because they get some \ncompensation to help them do what we want to do, to provide health care \nfor themselves.\n  I am disturbed by the trend I am seeing. The House almost zeroed out \nfunding for family planning services, an essential component of women's \nhealth. How can we say we care about out-of-wedlock births and teenage \npregnancy when we eliminate family planning? \n\n[[Page S11509]]\n\n  Now we are considering taking choice away from Federal employees as \nto how they may use their compensation, which we give them to purchase \nmedical care. This is not an appropriate role of the Federal \nGovernment. We must allow Federal professionals to seek appropriate \ncare without our interference.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in voting against any amendment to \nremove the committee amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the Senator from Montana such time as he may \nrequire.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend for yielding.\n  I very seldom come to the floor and talk about this subject. But I \nsee us going adrift here from the real purpose of this amendment. I \nwould like to associate my comments with those of the junior Senator \nfrom Ohio.\n  I want to ask two or three questions here of my colleagues. I want \nthem to answer them very simply and very honestly, yes or no. Does this \namendment prevent anybody, and in particular, a Government employee, or \nany woman, the right to an abortion? I say, what right do we have as \nlegislators to collect money from the citizens of this country who may \nhave different views on this particular subject than to spend it on \nthat? What right do we have? Show me. Show the American people where we \ndeny a woman a right of abortion. Show me in this amendment where it \nchanges the Constitution. I do not think there is a constitutional \namendment in this piece of legislation.\n  Do we get our way or no way based on emotion rather than fact when we \nstart looking at a piece of legislation? Let us stay with the issue as \nit is presented in this amendment. I see no constitutional change here. \nBut what I have heard is inflammatory language that spurs or incites \nemotions to a very, very high level, and we lose where we are going.\n  I heard a while ago this thing about ``second-class citizens.'' I do \nnot think there is a second-class citizen in America today. I take \noffense to that. I think there are citizens; I think there are very \nhard-working, frugal people who contribute to their communities, to \ntheir schools, pay their taxes, pull the wagon, who have a very, very \nstrong view on the subject of abortion. Have we denied their right? I \nhave heard in private plans that abortion is part of the plan. That is \ntrue, but they spend their money on their plan.\n  They do not use taxpayers' dollars. They do not even in most cases \nuse pretax dollars.\n  Let us not lose the real meat of this amendment. We do not need the \nlanguage it takes to look at it objectively and really take a look that \nwe as legislators and as a Government have or do not have a right to \ndo.\n  We are not going to starve the children. We are not going to freeze \nthe old people. What we are saying here is that we are using taxpayers' \ndollars, from people who have a very strong view on that, and they \ndeserve a voice in this debate, also.\n  Let us look at what we are supposed to be talking about. Let us not \nget off on another subject of where we should or should not be.\n  I rise in support of the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma, for \nthose folks who may not have a voice in this body today on how we spend \ntheir tax dollars, in fact, their hard-earned tax dollars.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Montana for his excellent statement. I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have been hearing this morning much \nabout the Constitution of the United States on the subject of abortion. \nEverything I have heard has been correct. The fact that the other side \nof this debate is right when they argue that the Supreme Court has \nupheld the right of a woman to have an abortion is only half of the \nconstitutional law on this subject.\n  We, on this side, accept the fact of the constitutional law of the \nright of a woman to an abortion. We hope that the other side will \naccept another fact of constitutional law. That is, the Supreme Court's \ndecision that taxpayers do not have to pay for abortions. This is also \nthe law of the land. I am here to defend it.\n  Now, there is no question but in this case that we are talking about \nduring this debate, the case of Federal employees' health insurance, \nthere is no question that the taxpayers are subsidizing it. It is a \nfact of our budget that approximately 72 percent of the Federal \nemployees' health care is paid for by their employer, the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I suppose the public is surprised that it is not 100 percent paid by \nthe taxpayers, because I often hear that Federal employees have free \nhealth insurance. No, it is like any other employee; a certain \npercentage is paid by the employer and a certain percentage is paid by \nthe employee. Here, it is 72 percent. A big portion of the premium is \npaid for by the taxpayers.\n  The taxpayers have an interest in this debate. The taxpayers have an \ninterest in this debate because the Supreme Court defines the \nConstitution that when it comes to abortion, the taxpayers do not have \nto pay for abortions. The taxpayers can pay for abortions if the law \nsays so, but there is not a constitutional right to have the taxpayers \npay for your abortion.\n  Now, there are other unsubstantiated arguments during this debate, as \nwell. Another is that most private plans provide for abortions. This \njust is not the case.\n  I checked with the Congressional Research Service on this because \nsome people just keep bringing up and repeating this unproved point, a \npoint I believe put out by the Guttmacher Institute. Of course, we all \nknow, Mr. President, the objective of the Guttmacher Institute. That \ninstitute used to be directly associated with abortion providers. Now, \nit is only indirectly associated with them. We are supposed to believe \nwhat they tell us?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for a question? Mr. President, will \nthe Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The data on this point are not available.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I do not yield.\n  According to the CRS on this point, the data is not available to \ndetermine if, in fact, most plans--private plans, that is--provide \nabortion services.\n  In fact, some of the largest insurers, like Mutual of Omaha, again, \naccording to the CRS, do not provide these services.\n  To make it clear, the private sector is just not an issue here. We \nalways hear the mantra that pro-lifers are somehow out of touch in \ntrying to turn the clock back on women.\n  The problem with the other side is that they totally disregard the \nchildren that are involved in these difficult cases. I would like to \nmove the clock forward for these children, not back, as the other side \nwould like to do.\n  As far as being out of touch, the other side is out of touch with \nprotecting these children, many of whom are going to be the future \nwomen of America.\n  Now, when you get past the gobbledygook of the proabortionists and \nyou really look at this amendment, you will see it has nothing to do \nwith the overall issue of abortion rights.\n  That is the part of the Constitution, I am saying, that is the law of \nthe land. That is not the issue. The issue is the other Supreme Court \ndecision that says the taxpayers do not have to pay for abortions. They \ndo not have a constitutional right for the taxpayers to pay for \nabortions.\n  Mr. President, the issue is whether it should be a taxpayers' subsidy \nwhich, under law, we can do.\n  Those who want you and the taxpayers to fund these abortions are the \nones who are really out of step. The vast majority of Americans, you \nsee, do not support their taxpayers' money being used to pay for \nabortions. It is those who flaunt this majority that are out of touch \nwith the American people.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of the Senator from \nOklahoma and stand up for the taxpayers and the children of America.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I inquire how much time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 40 minutes, and \nthe Senator from Maryland has 24 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I think if all time was used, the vote would occur at \nabout 12:10. \n\n[[Page S11510]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I mentioned at the beginning we may wish to yield back \nsome time. I hope we can do so. I notify my colleagues to plan on a \nvote, hopefully, shortly before 12 o'clock.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I believe I have how much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 24 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We intend to use all of our time, Mr. President. I now \nyield, as part of that time, 5 minutes to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments, if I \nmight, to speak in favor of the committee amendment which would \ncontinue to allow the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program [FEHBP] \nto offer coverage for abortion services. If this committee amendment is \nrejected, we will be responsible for creating a lower standard of \nhealth insurance coverage for our female employees than they could \notherwise obtain in the private sector. We are creating, if this \namendment is rejected, a lower standard for our female dependents than \nthey would receive if they worked in the private sector. This seems to \nme to be terribly unfair.\n  In the United States, women have a constitutional right to choose an \nabortion. But that right is meaningless if women do not have access to \nabortions or cannot pay for the service. Many who are opposed to \nabortion rights know that. So they come up with ways to make it more \nand more difficult for women to obtain a safe, affordable abortion. \nThose attacking the coverage of abortion services, in my judgment, are \nengaging in that attempt.\n  Some Federal employees might not want to participate in a plan that \nprovides for abortion coverage, and that is their right. The amendment \nbefore us does not require plans to offer abortions. It simply allows \nplans to include that service. In fact, of the 345 plans that are now \noffered under the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, out of 345, \n178--about half--offer some form of abortion coverage. So an employee \nwho is opposed to abortion, he or she can choose one of the other \nplans, choose out of the 167 that do not offer abortion services.\n  There are approximately 1.2 million women of reproductive age who \nrely on the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program for their medical \ncare; 1.2 million women. Who are these women? They are our colleagues \nhere in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. They are here \nwith us now on the Senate floor. They are our staff members, they are \nour daughters and our wives.\n  Right now, all of those women or their families pay for a portion of \ntheir health insurance. As happens in the private sector, the employer, \nin this case the Federal Government, shares part of that cost. The \nemployee pays part; the Federal Government pays part. This is not any \ngift from the Federal Government. What the employee is receiving is \npart of his or her compensation in the form of these health benefits.\n  I disagree that this is Federal money being used to pay for \nabortions. The Federal health benefits are part of a Federal employee's \nearnings. If we follow the opponents' argument, it follows the Federal \nemployee could not use his or her earnings from the Federal Government \nto pay to purchase an abortion, since that would be, if you follow the \nlogic they are applying here, a Federal subsidy.\n  Why could they not use their own money? Because the Federal \nGovernment pays their salary.\n  Opponents to the committee amendment contend that women can simply \nuse their own money to purchase abortion services. This is not an \ninexpensive procedure. The average cost of an early abortion is $250 if \nperformed in a clinic. In many places there are no such clinics. There \nis travel and there is the need to go into a hospital, and this can \ncost as much as $1,760.\n  I would also point out that one-quarter of all Federal employees earn \nless than $25,000, and nearly 18,000 Federal employees have incomes \nbelow or just slightly above the poverty level. So the cost for an \nabortion, for those women in particular, causes a definite hardship.\n  For 10 years, those working women could not buy health insurance that \nincluded abortion coverage. At the same time, in the private sector \ntwo-thirds of the fee-for-service plans and 70 percent of the health \nmaintenance organizations provided abortion coverage--and still do. Two \nyears ago we were able to get equal treatment for our colleagues, our \nstaff members and family members by overturning the ban on abortion \ncoverage. Today we are being asked to return to a two-tiered, unfair \nsystem which would deny abortion coverage to Federal employees and \ntheir families, even if they are raped or are victims of incest.\n  We are talking about a legal medical procedure, a right upheld by the \nSupreme Court on more than one occasion. It is time, in my judgment, we \nstop trying to find ways to get around this right by making the \nprocedure shameful or inaccessible or too dangerous for a doctor to \nperform. I urge my colleagues to support the committee amendment and \noppose the effort by Senator Nickles.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from New Hampshire as \nmuch time as he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, the issue of abortion is certainly one of \nthe more controversial issues that we face. Many people are very \nuncomfortable talking about it. There is never a huge crowd here on the \nfloor when this issue is brought up. Contrary to what some might \nassume, I respect those who feel differently than I do on this issue, \nhowever I think it is one of the great moral issues of the day, much as \nslavery was some 150 years ago in the United States of America. I rise \nin opposition to the pending committee amendment to H.R. 2020 and \nsupport the Senator from Oklahoma and commend him for what he is doing.\n  The pending committee amendment places before the Senate the issue of \nwhether abortion on demand will continue to be covered as a routine--I \nemphasize routine--health benefit, under the Federal Employee Health \nBenefits Program. That is really the issue here, as to whether or not \nabortion, which in my opinion takes a human life, is a health benefit. \nThe Federal Employee Health Benefits Program provides coverage for some \n9 million Federal employees and their dependents. People who feel as I \ndo, and others here, that it is the taking of a human life to commit an \nabortion, perform an abortion, do not want their tax dollars spent to \ntake human life. I think that is not an unreasonable position for them \nto take. I think it is backed up in the polls, that even people who are \nin favor of abortion--many people who are in favor of abortion--do not \nsupport Federal funding. That is really the issue, Federal funding. \nApproximately 72 percent of the premiums for those plans, under the \nFederal Employee Health Benefits Program, are paid by the Federal \nGovernment, in other words the taxpayers of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Between 1984 and 1994, for some 10 years, the Congress prohibited \nFederal Employee Health Benefits Programs from paying for abortions. \nBut, in 1993, Congress passed the fiscal year 1994 Treasury, Postal \nappropriations bill without, for the first time in 10 years, this \nlongstanding restriction on abortion funding. No such restrictions were \nincluded in the fiscal 1995 Treasury, Postal appropriations bill \neither. But at present, health plans in the Federal Employee Health \nBenefits Program are permitted to cover, and most of them in fact do \ncover, abortion--not simply abortion, but more appropriately, abortion \non demand, for whatever reason.\n  Thus, as we debate this issue on the Senate floor this morning, the \nAmerican taxpayer--whoever he or she may be or wherever they may be \nlocated or whatever their position may be on this issue--is forced to \npay for abortion on demand for Federal employees. That is the issue \nbefore us. That is why, for 10 years, it was not in there. And it is \nnot a matter of what your position is on abortion, it is a matter of \nwhether or not you believe the taxpayers, even those taxpayers who \ndisagree with abortion, should have to pay for it for Federal \nemployees. \n\n[[Page S11511]]\n\n  Also, is it really health care? When I think of health care I think \nof helping someone. I think of, perhaps, saving someone's life or \nperforming some medical service, which makes someone healthy again. The \ntaking of a human life, in my opinion, is not healthy--certainly not \nhealthy for the person whose life is taken. That, then, is the stark \ntruth about the status quo. As we debate this issue today on the Senate \nfloor, the American taxpayer, with all of the other things we have to \npay for as we begin to downsize and balance the budget, is being \nforced--not asked, forced--to pay for abortion on demand for Federal \nemployees.\n  How many abortions are we talking about? According to the Office of \nPersonnel Management [OPM] in the calendar year 1980, the last year for \nwhich any authoritative figures were available, 17,000 elective \nabortions were paid for through the Federal employees health benefits \nplan. The estimated cost is about $9 million. So the figures for fiscal \nyear 1994 are not, to the best of my knowledge--they may be; I do not \nhave them if they are--but assuming that the figures before the 1984 \nban have held steady after the ban was lifted in 1994, the American \ntaxpayer we assume can be expected to be forced to pay through the \nFederal employees health benefits plan some 17,000 elective abortions \nfor Federal employees in the current fiscal year at a cost of $9 \nmillion, plus some 15 years of inflation. So I think we can assume that \nthis is going to cost far in excess of $9 million. We all know \ninflation has risen considerably since 1980.\n  So let us be very clear, Mr. President. The question before the \nSenate today, in spite of all of the hard feelings and comments that \ndevelop from this issue, is whether the American taxpayer is going to \ncontinue to be forced to pay for abortion on demand for all Federal \nemployees for those who choose to have one.\n  As I indicated, about 72 percent of the premiums for the Federal \nemployees health benefit plan are paid for by the Federal Government. \nSo unless the committee amendment is defeated today, these taxpayer-\nfunded Federal premium payments will continue to be used to pay for \nabortion on demand for Federal employees.\n  It is particularly I believe inappropriate for the Congress to allow \nthese benefit programs in the Federal Government to cover abortion \nbecause, as I referred to this earlier, the overwhelming majority of \nabortions--there will be some dispute perhaps and some of my colleagues \non the other side may dispute the numbers--but the overwhelming \nmajority of abortions have nothing to do with saving a life or \nprotecting the physical health of the mother.\n  In hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1981, Dr. Irving \nKushner, who served in the Carter administration as Deputy Assistant \nSecretary for Population Affairs, testified before Congress about the \nreasons why women have abortions. Dr. Kushner estimated that only 2 \npercent of abortions are done for physical health reasons and that 98 \npercent are performed for life-style reasons.\n  Maybe those numbers are not exactly accurate. They could change. They \ncould vary somewhat. But even if there are 5 to 10 percent, those \nnumbers are still very striking.\n  Dr. Kushner testified that:\n\n       The data with which I am familiar would indicate that \n     something on the order of 2 percent of all of the abortions \n     in this country are done for some clinically identifiable \n     entity, physical health problem, amniocentesis, and \n     identified genetic disease.\n\n  The overwhelming majority of abortions in this country are performed \non women who, for various reasons, do not wish to be pregnant at this \ntime, Dr. Kushner testified.\n  There is a mixture of social, economic, educational, perhaps health, \nor whatever. But I am aware of no studies that indicate that anything \nhas changed in that regard since Dr. Kushner's statement. If someone \nhas some facts that would dispute that, I would certainly be happy to \nhear from my colleagues on that.\n  The overwhelming majority of the American people do not want their \ntax dollars spent to finance abortion on demand for Federal employees \nin this case. I base this contention on a series of national polls by \nwell-respected polling organizations.\n  In March 1995, the CBS-New York Times poll found that 72 percent of \nAmericans oppose the inclusion of abortion in a national health care \nplan. Only 23 percent were in favor. There is no reason why a greater \nnumber of Americans would favor such coverage from employees in the \nFederal Government with the taxpayers footing about 72 percent of the \nbill. Why would they?\n  Unless the committee amendment is defeated, H.R. 2020 will allow \nFederal tax dollars to be spent to pay for abortions for Federal \nemployees on demand as a routine method of birth control. Will some \nwomen do it for health reasons? Yes, of course. But the bottom line is \nthat, for the most part, a routine method of birth control--which many \nmillions of Americans oppose abortion on demand as birth control--they \nwill be forced to have their tax dollars pay for this.\n  According to a working poll in 1992, 84 percent of Americans are \nopposed to abortion as a method of birth control and only 13 percent \nfavor such a radical position on the abortion question. It follows then \nthat the American people do not want to pay for abortion on demand for \nFederal employees as a method of birth control.\n  Finally, Mr. President, in the area of polling, an ABC News-\nWashington Post poll taken in July 1992 said that 69 percent of \nAmericans oppose the Federal funding of abortions.\n  Mr. President, regardless of where one stands on the issue of \nabortion as a moral or a legal matter, it is beyond dispute on this \nsubject of debate today that millions of Americans believe that the \nunborn child is a human being from the moment of conception and that \nabortion is the wrongful taking of a human life.\n  A large number of Americans believe that forcing those millions of \npro-life Americans to pay for abortion on demand with their tax \ndollars, as I believe, is a gross violation of their freedom of \nconscience. That is why I am here supporting the Senator from Oklahoma \ntoday.\n  I do not see the manager of the bill, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, \nhere on the floor. I am sorry he is not because I was sitting on the \nfloor a short time ago, and I heard the Senator from Nebraska, Senator \nKerrey, say that he has studied this issue a long time and he has \nconcluded that human life does not begin at conception. I am \nparaphrasing, but essentially that is what he said.\n  I would just like to ask the Senator from Nebraska if he comes back \nto the floor, when did his life begin? When did the life of the Senator \nfrom Nebraska begin if it did not begin at the moment of conception?\n  I see the Senator here. And I am glad he came back on the floor. I \nwas referring to the comments earlier when you said you had concluded \nthat human life does not begin at conception, and I am very sincere and \nthis is not to be confrontational. My honest question to you is, when \ndid your life begin if it did not begin at conception, if you are not \nhuman the day after conception? Then how can you be here today as a \nreasonable, mature adult and a U.S. Senator contributing much to \nAmerica--I might add, because your mother chose life? And I think that \nthe argument that one makes is the intellectual argument that life does \nnot begin at conception is just mindboggling to me.\n  If you want to take the position, which many do and many of my \ncolleagues do on the other side of this issue, that because of a \nparticular reason, whatever that reason might be, a woman has a right \nto do that, to take that life, that is another argument. But to say \nthat life does not begin at conception, if it is not life by \ndefinition, there is no life to kill, there is nothing to take. So if \nthere is no life, then there is nothing to destroy. So if your life \ndoes not begin at conception, I do not know when it does begin. I would \nbe interested to know when the Senator from Nebraska thinks his life \ndid begin.\n  Mr. KERREY. Does the Senator ask me a question and expect a response \nat this moment, Mr. President?\n  Mr. SMITH. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Nebraska to \nrespond.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Not on my time.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask that I be allowed to talk 1 minute \nnot charged to either side.\n  Mr. SMITH. I will take it off my time.\n  \n[[Page S11512]]\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this is the realm of prayer you are \ntalking about--faith, a belief. That is what I was trying to say \nearlier. I was trying to give the Senator from New Hampshire and others \nwho hold the belief that if a human being from the moment of conception \nought to be protected and that it is murder, the Senator from New \nHampshire wants abortion to be made illegal because he believes it is \nmurder, I do not believe that it is a human being at the moment of \nconception, but only if you have that belief. That is your conclusion. \nHe believes it is murder and, as a consequence, wants to ban abortion. \nBut it is a realm of faith, a belief, if someone enters prayer when \nthey make this decision. You do not reach it on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. SMITH. If it is not a human being, what is it, I say to the \nSenator from Nebraska? Could the Senator from Nebraska answer that \nquestion on my time for me?\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, it may surprise the Senator from New \nHampshire to know that he is not my God. As I indicated earlier, I make \nthe decision.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I reclaim my time.\n  Mr. KERREY. I want to answer the question. I want to answer that \nquestion.\n  Mr. SMITH. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator from New Hampshire asked me to answer the \nquestion. I did not answer the question.\n  Mr. SMITH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. He yielded me time.\n  Mr. SMITH. I reclaim my time, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KERREY. He cannot withdraw that time.\n  Mr. SMITH. I reclaim my time.\n  Mr. KERREY. Now he does not like my answer in the midst of my answer.\n  Mr. SMITH. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. KERREY. He is trying to cut me off.\n  Mr. SMITH. I reclaim my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is able to \nclaim the floor and has reclaimed the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH. The Senator from Nebraska went well over the line with the \nstatement regarding God, and I refuse to yield any more time to him.\n  It would be glaringly inconsistent for those who support the Hyde \namendment, which prohibits payments for abortion for Medicaid-eligible \nwomen, to vote in favor of Federal funding of abortion for Federal \nemployees. In other words, Senators who support the Hyde amendment also \nshould oppose coverage for abortion under the Federal employees health \nbenefits plan. Supporters of the Hyde amendment, therefore, should vote \nto defeat the committee amendment.\n  The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the Hyde \namendment, and the Court found that the Government can distinguish \nbetween abortion and other medical procedures. In upholding the Hyde \namendment in 1980, the Court commented that abortion is inherently \ndifferent from other medical procedures because no other procedure \ninvolves the purposeful termination of, if it is not a human life, a \npotential human life.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I wish to commend my friend, Senator \nNickles. It takes a lot of courage, knowing the abuse we all take on \nthis issue, to be down here. We do not always have a crowd; not many \nMembers are willing to come down and speak on the issue. God knows, we \nget enough heat for doing it.\n  I think the exchange that just took place between the Senator from \nNebraska and myself is a very strong indication of the weakness of the \nargument that somehow after conception a precious life, a human being, \nis somehow not a human being.\n  There is no, absolutely no credibility for that argument. Anyone, any \nreasonable person, pro-life or pro-choice, proabortion or antiabortion, \nwho heard the exchange between the Senator from Nebraska and myself, \nwould understand that. If a person takes the position that a woman has \nthe right to terminate, that is another argument. I do not happen to \nagree with it, but that is another argument. And there is some good \nreason I think to at least argue that there is some rationale to that \ndecision. But to say that life does not begin at conception, there is \na--when an embryo is formed and the sperm and egg unite and life \nbegins, that is the beginning. You cannot be a 50-year-old man or a \nwoman unless that act took place. That is just a biological fact. It \nhas nothing to do with God.\n  I deeply resent the comment that the Senator from Nebraska made on \nthe floor of this U.S. Senate, somehow saying that because I questioned \nhis comments on this matter, somehow I would be believing myself to be \nGod. I deeply resent it. I think it was entirely inappropriate. I would \nhope that he will apologize for it but, frankly, I do not expect it.\n  Mr. President, I think I have made the point. The majority of the \nAmerican people do not support taxpayers paying for abortions, and I \nrest my case on that.\n  Mr. President, I yield back to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, on this issue, I have always opposed \nFederal funding of abortion. I have also supported restrictions on \nFederal health insurance with respect to Federal employees and the \nfunding of abortion but only with restrictions or exceptions for rape, \nincest, and life of the mother.\n  Mr. President, I will oppose Senator Nickles' proposal for that \nreason. The proposal before us has no exception for rape and incest. \nLet me just personalize why that makes a huge difference.\n  Several years ago, my wife was attacked eight blocks from where we \nare this morning by a vicious rapist. He put a gun to her head and \ntried to get her into our car. My wife was able to evade that vicious \nrapist, somebody with a record as long as your arm of rape, brutal \nrape. And yet what we have before us this morning is an amendment that \nsays if my wife had been raped, her health insurance could not pay for \nthe appropriate medical treatment. She would be expected to carry that \nbaby.\n  Mr. President, I am opposed to Federal funding for abortion, but I \nsay to you anybody that would say to my wife, if she had been raped by \nthat vicious criminal, that she ought to carry that baby, that is \nvicious and monstrous. How can anybody stand in this Chamber and say \nthat somebody who is victimized ought to be victimized a second time? \nSomething is radically wrong, I say to my friends, that anybody would \nsay to my wife ``You carry that baby to term.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, before my colleague from North Dakota \nleaves, let me just try to tell my friend from North Dakota--who just \nleft--that this Senator has tried, unsuccessfully now for 2 or 3 hours \nlast night and for a little while this morning, to put in a rape and \nincest exception.\n  I tell my colleagues that the language I offered 2 years ago had a \nrape and incest exception and life of the mother. The unanimous-consent \nagreement does not allow that at this time. That is the reason I said \nwe may well have to have another amendment, because that is my \nintention. That is my belief.\n  I happen to think that is where the votes are in this body. I do not \nknow where the votes are exactly on this language right now on adopting \nthe House language. The House language is exactly the policy we had \nfrom 1984 to 1993, exactly the same, and that is what they adopted in \nthe House. They adopted it with a 50-vote margin.\n  I stated to my friends on both sides of this issue that I thought \nwhere the votes were was to ensure that no funds could be used for \nabortion by Federal employees from their health insurance unless it is \nnecessary to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape and \nincest.\n  I have endeavored to try to introduce this amendment. I have been \ndenied \n\n[[Page S11513]]\nthat opportunity. The way the unanimous consent is drafted, I am not \nable to do it at this point. That is the reason I said, well, if this \namendment is not agreed to, we may have to do that later. This \namendment would keep the House language and it is amendable. And I \nmight mention it is amendable by this side; it is amendable by the \nother side.\n  I know my friend from Maryland--I have great respect for my friend \nfrom Maryland because we have worked on a lot of things over the years, \nand we have always done it very civilly--I know she has a different \nopinion, and I respect that. She has a right to offer an amendment. \nThere is no time agreement, there is no limitation on amendments, and \nso if people have different ideas, they are certainly welcome to offer \nthose.\n  I just wanted my friend from North Dakota to know, I wanted my friend \nfrom Maine, Senator Snowe, to know--and I mentioned that to them; they \nwere the only two people who mentioned rape and incest in the debate--I \njust wanted them to know it is my intention to try to accommodate that \nlanguage. That is the same language that we had 2 years ago.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCAIN. For a question.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am asking a question of the Senator from Oklahoma. It \nis my understanding that----\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I wanted to bring to the attention of the Senator from \nArizona, it will be the first time today the Senator from Oklahoma or \nanyone on that side of the debate has agreed to answer a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May we have regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor and \nhas a right to yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have a right to ask for regular order at any time under \nthe parliamentary rules of the Senate. I am asking for regular order.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is it true that the Senator from Oklahoma had requested \nto modify this amendment?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That he had sought to put in an exception for rape and \nincest?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And the other side had refused to do that, to allow that?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Well, there has been kind of a breakdown in comity around \nhere for the last few days. I regret it. I think all of us regret it. \nIt is not the standard behavior around here not to allow someone to \nmodify an amendment that was clearly the intention of the author of the \namendment.\n  Last night we saw this body break down in gridlock and not pass a \nbill that is important to national security. Now we find an amendment \nthat clearly was intended to be another way, that the Senator from \nOklahoma was not allowed to do so.\n  I would appeal to my colleagues to let us try to return to some kind \nof comity around here. We are entitled to opposing opinions, but why we \nwould not allow the Senator from Oklahoma to modify his amendment, when \nthat was clearly his intention, is beyond me. And I would urge the \nSenator from Maryland, if she is the one that is blocking this, to \nreconsider her position in not allowing the Senator from Oklahoma to \nmodify his amendment because what will happen is we will then bring up \nanother amendment, and which the Senator from Oklahoma is able to do.\n  So all we have done is waste the time of this body on a Saturday \nafternoon. So, I would ask the Senator from Oklahoma if perhaps he \ncould make another request and appeal to comity and courtesy which is \nsupposed to be the trademark of this body.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate that. I appreciate the suggestion of my \ncolleague and friend from Arizona.\n  I am prepared, if my colleagues--I happen to agree with his comments \n100 percent. I will just mention it is unfortunate the situation that \nwe are in right now. I would like to modify my amendment. The way that \nthe unanimous-consent request is drafted, I could not do it unless I \nhad unanimous consent. I have been contemplating trying to do it on the \nfloor. I tried to do it in negotiation and have not been successful. I \nmight try it now. I do not want to--I want to be very civil in this \ndebate.\n  I want to offer the rape and incest amendment because I know my \nfriend and colleague from North Dakota--it means a lot to him. And I \nknow my friend from Maine, it means a lot to her. I know it means a lot \nto the Senator from Texas. I know it means a lot to the Senator from \nGeorgia. So this is an important issue.\n  All Senators have rights. And I may be blocked from offering it at \nthis particular point under the UC, but not blocked from offering it \nlater. I understand that.\n  The Senator from Maryland has a couple of other ideas. She is not \nblocked from having those ideas expressed in the form of an amendment. \nI would like to do that now with my amendment. I know the Senator from \nNebraska wants to pass the bill. I have said, if we can offer this \namendment with the rape and incest, we are done, win or lose. We are \nfinished. And hopefully that would be the end of the case.\n  If we lose by one or two votes--this vote is very close, very close. \nAnd it is also, as the Senator from New Hampshire said, very important \nbecause we are talking about thousands of lives. Then it will be \nnecessary to come back and try again with a rape and incest amendment, \nwhich I have that right to do. And the Senator from Maryland has the \nright to offer her amendments as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I would like to clarify the situation, as well as the \ninnuendo that I am blocking this comity of adding rape and incest.\n  Mr. President, early yesterday I entered into a unanimous-consent \ntime agreement that is pending before the U.S. Senate today as the \nframework for debate.\n  I negotiated that agreement in good faith with the Republican leader \nand his staff. The UC that I agreed to, which is the framework under \nwhich we are operating, I was told is what the Senator from Oklahoma \nwanted. I had a lot of my own amendments, but I recognized the fact \nthat the Republican leader and the Democratic leader wanted to move \nthis bill. So I agreed to a 3-hour debate, up or down or on a motion to \ntable, on the House language which is limited to the life of the \nmother. That was my understanding.\n  At 10 after 10 last night the Senator from Oklahoma approached me and \nsaid, ``That is not what I thought the agreement was.'' That was, I was \ntold, the Senator from Oklahoma's desire to have that UC. So then to \nsay I am not the one having comity, that is what happened to me at 10 \nlast night.\n  So, Mr. President, I feel that my reputation and my sense of \nsenatorial courtesy is being impugned in a very unfair and unfactual \nkind of way.\n  Now, I am prepared to move ahead with the conclusion of this debate, \nto vote under the UC, as we have agreed upon. And then the Senator from \nOklahoma can offer his amendments. And quite frankly, I have two or \nthree of my own. But that is the situation. That is how the situation \nwas agreed upon.\n  I believe that my history in the Senate has been one of comity and \nsenatorial courtesy on these agreements. And having said that, now I \nyield whatever time to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. President, I have been listening to this debate about civility. \nOne of the most arrogant positions that can be assumed by the Senate is \nto try to relegate what rights and what health benefits will be \navailable to the Federal employees.\n  Here we find our colleagues on the other side entering the U.S. \nSenate, having the most comprehensive health care in the country, and \nthen making decisions about how they believe it ought to be limited for \nwomen in our society. There are 345 plans out there. \n\n[[Page S11514]]\nAny Federal employee can select whether she wants to have coverage or \nnoncoverage. But oh, no. We are going to decide that even for those \nthat want the coverage, they cannot have it. You have 78 million people \nwho have coverage today under other kinds of programs that are \nbasically being subsidized by the taxpayers under the deduction. Will \nthe colleagues over there try to take those programs on? Absolutely \nnot.\n  What they are saying, ``You are a Federal employee. You work for the \nGovernment. You make a choice and decision, the 1.2 million women, to \nhave this coverage. No. That is not good enough. We are going to tell \nyou exactly what kind of health procedures you will have.'' That is \narrogant. That is uncivil. That is wrong. And that is why the Senator \nfrom Maryland's position should be retained.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 12 minutes, 40 \nseconds. The Senator from Oklahoma, 14 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from California, \nSenator Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend.\n  My colleagues, it is important to know what we are doing here. This \nis an attempt, because colleagues do not want to raise the issue of \nwhether abortion should be legal, because I think they know they cannot \nwin that debate, to take the right to choose from women they have power \nover, in this case, women who happen to be Federal employees. And that \nis an abuse of their power, as the Senator from Massachusetts has so \neloquently stated.\n  Make no mistake about it, the Nickles proposal is radical. No \ninsurance can be used for abortion even in cases of rape or incest. And \nwe had a colleague walk out of here because he told his personal grief \nabout a situation that impacted his life.\n  Oh, they say, you can pay for it on your own. What if you cannot \nafford it? What if there are complications? Senator Chafee himself said \nin many cases it is $1,700. This is a radical, radical proposal. Please \ndefeat it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will tell my friend from Maryland, my friend from \nCalifornia, and my friend from North Dakota, I have an amendment I \nwould like to send to the desk. It would add rape and incest to the \nunderlying language. I think most people in this body would support \nthis language. I will tell my colleagues from Maryland and California, \nif this is included we will only have one vote.\n  And so, Mr. President, I send this amendment to the desk.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I object.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Consent would be required to offer an \namendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection has been heard.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will just make a couple comments. And I am not \nsurprised that an objection was heard because I have been trying to get \nthis done for the last many hours--2 or 3 hours last night, a couple \nhours today. My friend from Nebraska tells me as manager of the bill he \nthinks we can get it included. I want to tell my colleagues that want \nrape and incest in there, I think he is right. I think it will be \nincluded.\n  So I hope nobody votes ``no'' because rape and incest is not in \nthere. If they do, we are going to give them a chance to vote for it \nlater with it in there if this does not prevail.\n  I also want to comment on Senator McCain's comment. We do need to \nreturn to a little more civil approach to legislating. Last night on \nthe DOD bill, it was not pretty. This is not pretty the way we are \nlegislating now. Senators have the right to offer amendments. We need \nto protect that right. I will protect the right of anybody on this side \nof the aisle to offer an amendment and anybody on that side of the \naisle to offer an amendment and to modify their amendments. I think \nthat is an important principle.\n  Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Texas 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think maybe it is important to go back \nand talk about what the amendment is trying to do, since, obviously, we \nhave criticisms of it. The Senator from Oklahoma has tried to fix it, \nbut those who criticize it and object to it will not permit him to fix \nit. So I think people may have forgotten in all this what it is we are \ntalking about. Let me go back and try very simply to define the issue.\n  The Federal Government pays on average 72 percent of the health care \nbenefits of all the employees of the Federal Government. We have had a \nlongstanding consensus in America that no matter where people stood on \nthe issue of abortion--and obviously there are great differences in \nAmerica; there are great differences in the Senate--that since many \nAmericans felt very strongly in opposition to abortion on demand, and \nthat since people do not pay taxes voluntarily in America, that we \nought not to take their tax money to pay for abortion services in areas \nlike insurance premiums for Federal employees. This is not a radical \nidea. This was the law of the land for a decade prior to Bill Clinton \nbecoming President.\n  When Bill Clinton became President, that balance was overturned, and \nin 1993, for the first time in a decade, we took the taxpayers' money \nand used it to fund abortion on demand by paying for insurance premiums \nto fund abortion services.\n  What the House did in their bill is they went back and said that \npeople can do whatever they want to do. People can spend their own \nmoney on abortions if they choose to, but they cannot take the Federal \ntaxpayers' money--which after all, is collected by the Internal Revenue \nService through the force of law from taxpayers who strongly oppose \nabortion--and use it to pay for abortion on demand. That is what the \nHouse did.\n  What the Senator from Oklahoma is trying to do is simply to go back \nto the consensus that existed for the decade prior to Bill Clinton \nbecoming President, which simply says: Nothing in this amendment has \nanything to do with the right of a woman to have an abortion, but what \nit has everything to do with is the denial of taxpayer dollars to fund \nthat abortion, except under a very stringent circumstance: The life of \nthe mother being in danger.\n  The issue here is not the right of a person to have an abortion, it \nis whether or not the Government should use its power of coercion to \ncollect money from taxpayers to pay for it. I believe the American \npeople's answer to that question is ``no.'' That is why we need to \nmaintain the House-passed language, and I urge my colleagues to vote to \ndo so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nWisconsin, Senator Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  I also rise in strong opposition to restricting Federal employees \nfrom receiving abortion services as part of their health care plan.\n  The Federal employee health benefits plan is a network of insurance \nplans that cover approximately 9 million Federal employees and their \ndependents and including, I remind my colleagues, all of our staff \nmembers.\n  The Federal employees health benefits plan is made up of more than \n370 different health plans. When selecting coverage, women who work for \nthe Federal Government now have a choice about whether they want to \nselect a provider that does or does not perform abortions. In short, \nthey can now choose a plan with coverage, a coverage that best fits \ntheir needs.\n  I note that one-quarter of all Federal employees earn less than \n$25,000. This is a fairly respectable wage in many parts of Wisconsin \nwhere the cost of living is lower. But for a single parent with \ndependent children in a higher-cost area in the country, it can be \ndifficult to make ends meet on that amount of money. In fact, I am \nsorry to say that nearly 18,000 Federal employees have incomes hovering \nright \n\n[[Page S11515]]\naround the Federal poverty level. So let us not make any mistake about \nwho might be included in this category of people who are affected by \nthis amendment.\n  There are those who may say this is a good amendment because of the \nopportunity for deficit reduction. In fact, this is grossly untrue. If \nSenators are truly interested in addressing the root causes of the \nescalation of health care costs, then we should publicly commit to \naddress comprehensive health care reform.\n  Abortion is a deeply divisive issue and there are strongly held views \non all sides, but that does not justify a political football game with \nthe contents of a health care package.\n  So, Mr. President, I think this amendment should be soundly defeated. \nThe right to choose should be about allowing women options. Prohibiting \na woman from choosing health care coverage she feels is appropriate for \nher just because she works for you, Mr. President, or me or for the \nexecutive branch or for the Postal Service, in my view, is unjust.\n  So I hope my colleagues will join me and many other Senators who have \nspoken on this in rejecting this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator from Indiana is here. I do not know whether \nthe Senator from Oklahoma wants to yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 9 minutes, and \nthe Senator from Maryland has 8 minutes 48 seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Indiana 6 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I will just state that over the last 48 \nhours, the Senator from Oklahoma has come to me and we have discussed \nin great detail as to whether or not this amendment should include the \nrape-incest exception. He agreed, I agreed, all of us agreed that it \nshould. He was clearly under the impression that the unanimous-consent \nagreement allowed for the amendment to be offered to include the life \nof the mother, rape and incest. He was surprised, I was surprised, we \nwere all surprised when that was not the case. He made a valiant effort \nlast evening to include that.\n  So those who come to the floor and argue against this amendment \nbecause it does not include that simply have missed the point. We are \nattempting to try to do that and have been precluded from doing that.\n  Mr. President, on this issue of abortion, it is clear that we are a \nnation at conflict among ourselves and even within ourselves. The \ndebate over abortion has divided the country; it has divided the Senate \nand the Senators who represent the people of this Nation.\n  We have come over time to believe, I think all of us, strongly in \nindividual autonomy and personal privacy. At the same time, we have \nwitnessed dramatic advances in medical science which shows us the \ncomplexity and the humanity of life before birth. This is a jarring \ninconsistency of our deepest beliefs about liberty and our strongest \nconvictions about life, and it has led to an endless struggle, and even \nbroken the peace, between neighbors.\n  Law, on the one hand, is set against medical science on the other. \nPolitical rights, on the one hand, are set against moral commitments. \nThese are contradictions that we cannot escape but nor can we accept. \nThese contradictions are seemingly contradictions that we cannot \novercome.\n  But while our divisions are deep, there should not be division over \nforming a consensus on the issue that is before us. This ought to be a \nuniting issue rather than a dividing issue, that issue of whether or \nnot we will force people to violate their conscience by financing a \nprocedure that they find abhorrent. This should be the common ground in \nour abortion debate. Those who insist on using taxpayers' funds to \nsubsidize abortion are not asking for choice. They are asking for \ninvolvement in complicity on the part of every single American, despite \nthose Americans' deeply held religious beliefs and moral convictions.\n  The committee amendment before us today is a particularly clear \nexample of taxpayer financed abortion. Seventy-two percent of the cost \nof Federal employees health benefits are paid directly with tax \ndollars--Federal tax dollars.\n  Through this program in the early eighties, taxpayers subsidized over \n17,000 abortions at a cost of over $9 million. Now for a period of 10 \nyears--nearly 10 years--from 1984 to 1993, Congress protected those \ntaxpayers from contributing to elective abortions through the Federal \nemployees health benefits plan.\n I believe that was a policy and a position solidly supported by a \nmajority of the American people. During our debate over a national \nhealth benefits plan last year, only 23 percent said national health \ninsurance policies should include coverage for abortion; 72 percent \nsaid those costs should be paid directly by the women who have the \nabortion. An ABC News/Washington Post poll in June 1992 indicated that \n69 percent of the people surveyed felt the Government should not pay \nfor abortions even for women who could not otherwise afford them.\n\n  Therefore, by striking the committee amendment, we simply seek to \nrestore a principle on which I believe there is a strong majority \nconsensus; that is, that we should not appropriate tax dollars and use \nthem to violate the deepest moral convictions of millions of Americans.\n  Supporting the committee amendment means that abortion is not just a \nright but an entitlement. I understand why so many Americans are \noffended by being forced to support a procedure with their hard-earned \ntax dollars, because I also am offended. My concern is motivated by my \nown fundamental conviction that we are dealing with a fundamental \nmatter of human rights, relating to the most helpless members of the \nhuman family.\n  Abortion on demand is a violation, I say, of our compassion and of \nour humanity. It causes us to retreat from the history of a nation--\nthis Nation--whose story has been one of progress, however halting, \nsometimes won even through bloodshed, of extending inclusion in our \nideals of human dignity and human rights. One by one, the powerless, \nthe weakest, have been embraced and the American family has been \nextended. African-Americans, women, the handicapped, each discovered \nthat America's promise, though delayed, was not denied.\n  Over time, our Nation has developed a system of rights, deeper and \nwider through the persistence of those who have passionately argued for \ninclusion, not exclusion. Some of the opponents of this amendment have \nbeen the most outstanding spokespersons, with the deepest conviction \nfor the inclusion in the American family, for the extension of rights \nto those helpless individuals.\n  Abraham Lincoln wrote of our Founders:\n\n       This was their majestic interpretation of the economy of \n     the universe. This was their lofty, and wise, and noble \n     understanding of the justice of the Creator to his creatures. \n     . . . In their enlightened belief, nothing stamped with the \n     divine image and likeness was sent into the world to be \n     trodden on. They grasped not only the whole race of man then \n     living, but they reached forward and seized upon the farthest \n     posterity. They erected a beacon to guide their children, and \n     their children's children and the countless myriads who \n     should inhabit the Earth in other ages.\n\n  That beacon of light still shines in this world. It still lights the \npaths of nations whose freedom is new. It is my deepest concern that, \nat the very level where we reach the very weakest and helpless of \nAmericans, we will shut out that light, that we will halt the progress \nof America's promise--the promise of inclusion, the promise of \nextension of rights to the most helpless in our society--and cast one \nclass of the powerless into the darkness beyond our protection.\n  I believe that is the fundamental issue and why we should support the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 1 minute 46 \nseconds. The Senator from Maryland has 8 minutes 48 seconds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield to the Senator from Nebraska, the ranking \nminority floor manager, whatever time he needs.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this is a position--as I indicated earlier \nin my opening remarks--that is made upon beliefs, made in prayer; it is \na decision of faith, not a scientific, intellectual decision. Once it \nis made, it leads you to a conclusion about what our laws \n\n[[Page S11516]]\nshould be. If you conclude that this is a human being at the moment of \nconception, you want the law to say it is murder and it should be \noutlawed. If you believe, in a moment of faith--again, no science \nenables me to reach my conclusion--if you believe, in a moment of faith \nand prayer, that it is not, then you want to protect the right of a \nwoman and her doctor to make that decision.\n  The dilemma here, Mr. President, is that we have employees who work \nfor the Federal Government. Those who argue that health insurance is a \nsource of payment and that it is a source of subsidy have a difficult \ntime explaining what about the rest of their salary.\n  Even if this amendment passes--or this language of the House which \ndoes not allow health insurance to be used to pay for abortion under \nany circumstances, even if that language is held, you will still have \nFederal employees with their salaries making a purchase. Only if this \nbody is willing to pass a law sending police out to make sure Federal \nemployees do not use any of their money, could we not have the subsidy.\n  So, Mr. President, it is a very difficult dilemma. I hope my \ncolleagues understand that there was a good-faith effort to try to \nnegotiate. The Senator from Oklahoma agreed last night, and the Senator \nfrom Maryland did as well, to a time agreement in a UC. One of the \nthings the Senator from Oklahoma wants to add is rape and incest. The \nHouse does not have that language in there. The House language makes no \nexceptions. The Senator from Oklahoma wants to add rape and incest. I \nwould agree to that. However, the Senator from Maryland wants to add \nmedically necessary and appropriate. I do not believe the Senator from \nOklahoma wants to agree to that. So we have a difference of opinion as \nto how far we ought to go.\n  I believe strongly, Mr. President, that the best course is to \nrecognize that, whether it is a salary or whether it is a Federal \nemployee's health insurance, as a consequence of the Nation saying we \nare going to protect that right, has a right to use money that we have \ngiven them through tax dollars to make that decision.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that the language of the House is stricken, \nas the Senator from Alabama and the Senator from Nebraska and myself \nhave indicated that we believe ought to occur in this piece of \nlegislation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, obviously, I will be brief with only 1 \nminute. Two very basic points here: One, I think it is important to \nremember the words of former Senator Barry Goldwater who essentially \nsaid, ``We should get Government off our backs, out of our wallets, and \nout of our bedroom.''\n  He truly saw the importance of Government not getting involved in \nindividual, personal decisions such as this.\n  It is a very complex, emotional subject. Essentially, I believe, and \nI think most Americans believe, when it comes to abortion, it is a \nmatter of individual conscience, a matter that a woman must decide for \nherself, according to the dictates of her conscience, religion, her \nGod. It is a very personal choice that the Government should not be \nmaking for her.\n  Second, we should not allow women employees of the Federal Government \nto be treated as second-class citizens. That is what this amendment \ndoes. It says that if you are a woman and a Federal employee, you are \ntreated in a second-class nature. That is wrong.\n  On those two bases, I strongly urge the defeat of the Nickles \namendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I choose to use 3 minutes of the leader \ntime which Senator Dole yielded to me.\n  I have sought recognition again, after having spoken at some length \nearlier this morning, to respond to the very eloquent comments of the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana when he speaks about the moral \nconcerns which he has about abortion. I can well understand that, and I \nhave great respect for it.\n  As I had said earlier today, I am personally opposed to abortion but \ndo not think that it is a matter for the Government. Most of this \ndebate today has really centered--as Senator Coats has emphasized so \neloquently--on the moral considerations which many hold very, very \ndeeply, contrasted with what I think is the constitutional doctrine \nwhich has been established for the United States. That is not only Roe \nversus Wade in 1973; it is the more recent 1992 opinion in Casey versus \nPlanned Parenthood, written by three Supreme Court Justices appointed \nby conservative Republican Presidents. That is the law of the land.\n  This is a constitutional right for a woman to choose. I submit, Mr. \nPresident, that this amendment today, this issue today, is really a \npart of the systematic effort to dismantle the woman's constitutional \nright to choose.\n  I shall not take time again to display the chart on the A to Z \nconsiderations. The point is made that what we have here is a \ntaxpayers' issue and the focus is on what the subsidy is. There is \nFederal employment here, Mr. President, where the employees are giving \nvaluable consideration, and part of what they are receiving is this \nhealth care plan. Part of the plan is being paid for by the employee \nthemselves. The part which is being paid for by the Federal Government \nis really part of their consideration.\n  So we should put aside the business about taxpayers' dollars. It is \nreally the consideration of the earning of the employees who ought to \nhave the right to access abortion while that is the law of the land.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, in 1993, the U.S. Congress \nsuccessfully restored full reproductive health benefits to Federal \nemployees. We successfully overturned a gross overeach on the part of \nthe Congress into the benefits package of Federal employees.\n  By moving to strike the committee amendment, Congress is again \nattempting to micromanage employee benefits in a way that exceeds its \ntraditional role, and in a way that radically discriminates against \nwomen.\n  Congress has traditionally involved itself in issues of Federal pay. \nBut until the Reagan administration, it had consistently left details \nrelated to the administration of employee benefits to the Office of \nPersonnel Management.\n  This is as it should be. The majority of Americans believe that women \nshould be able to privately choose whether or not an abortion is \nappropriate for her personal situation or circumstance without \ninterference from Government. Two years ago, we removed the intrusion \nof politicians and politics from employee compensation issues.\n  I agree. I was sent to the U.S. Senate in part because the people of \nIllinois believe that women should be allowed to make their own private \ndecisions. This amendment amounts to Government interference in the \ndecisions of women who work for the Federal Government. In no way does \nCongress restrict health care benefits for men, Mr. President. Today we \nare not debating a proposal to limit a health care procedure that \naffects the reproductive health of men who work for the Federal \nGovernment. Congress does not mandate that men pay for a medically \nappropriate procedure from their own pocket. We are not talking about \nrestricting medical coverage for vasectomies. We are not talking about \nrestricting medical coverage for problems of the prostate. And we \nshould not. Yet this amendment asks Congress to discriminate against \nwomen Federal employees by legislatively restricting their health \nbenefits. This is simply wrong.\n  I am also very disturbed that women Federal employees are being \ndenied a benefit that is available to most women who work in the \nprivate sector. It is common practice in the health insurance industry \nfor private health care plans to cover complete reproductive services, \nincluding pregnancy, child birth, and abortion. Private health \ninsurance companies do not play politics with women's health care. They \nallow women to choose the most appropriate health care for their \nsituation and circumstance.\n  Approximately 9 million Federal employees, their dependents, and \nFederal retirees, depend on Federal benefits for their health \ninsurance. Some 1.2 million women of reproductive age rely on \n\n[[Page S11517]]\nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.\n  There are a number of insurance plans that Federal employees can \nchoose from, offered by a number of different insurance companies. \nCurrently, 178 of the Federal employees health benefit programs offer \nabortion coverage; 167 of them do not. Two-thirds of private sector \nhealth plans offer abortion services. Seventy percent of HMO's offer \nabortion coverage. If Congress strikes this committee amendment, \nFederal employees are being denied a benefit which is part of the \nmajority of benefits packages available to non-Government employees.\n  Federal employees pay a portion of the cost of their benefits. A \nFederal employee who chooses the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Federal \nbenefits package pays $44.04 per month directly out of pocket. The \nbalance of the premium is an earned benefit. It is compensation. Let me \nrepeat that for those who may not understand--it is not a gift from the \nFederal Government to its employees; it is earned by those employees, \nincluding the women employees. Given that fact, to single out one \nprocedure that her health care policy will not cover, even though she \ncan choose a health plan that does not provide this procedure, is \nridiculous.\n  The reality of this issue is that most women who choose to have an \nabortion do not use their insurance coverage to pay for it. Most women \nwant to keep the matter private. But even if most women do not use \nthese benefits, there is a matter of principle here. We should remove \nthe intrusion of politicians and politics from employee compensation \nissues. The Congress should not be discriminating against women. The \nCongress should not be playing politics with women's lives. The women \nof Illinois sent me to the Senate to make sure that Congress stopped \nplaying ``Father Knows Best.''\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/05/senate-section/article/S11498-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11517-S11521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   FEDERAL EMPLOYEES BENEFIT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Failing in their efforts to make abortion illegal, \nopponents of abortion are trying to make it more deadly. The AMA has \nshown that funding restrictions that deter or delay women from seeking \nearly abortions increase the likelihood that they will bear unwanted \nchildren, continue health-threatening pregnancies to term, or undergo \nabortion procedures that endanger their lives.\n  Abortion coverage is offered by over two-thirds of private health \ninsurance plans, and just over half of the Federal Employee Health \nBenefits Plans [FEHBPs]. Approximately 1.2 million women of \nreproductive age rely on the FEHBP for their medical care. Because \nCongress has some measure of authority over the health benefits of this \nlarge pool of women, it is no surprise that abortion opponents target \non it in their campaign to eliminate reproductive freedom.\n  A ban on abortion coverage under FEHBP is inconsistent with the \ntreatment of all other health services, which are included or excluded \nby health plans based on decisions made by the plans themselves, not by \nCongress. It is, in this respect, an intrusion in to the operations of \nthe free market about which some of the most ardent supporters of this \namendment sermonize so often. Barring abortion coverage for women and \nfamilies working for the Federal Government denies these individuals a \nbenefit they would most likely be able to obtain if they worked for a \nprivate employer.\n  Let us not be confused by this debate into thinking that this ban \nwould save money. In fact, it is an expensive ban, both financially--\nbecause the health risks associated with out-of-plan abortions and \nordinary, let alone complicated, births are not slight--and socially. \nThese dogged, exhaustive efforts to chip away at a woman's \nconstitutional right to choose lead to anxiety about the security of \nall our precious, constitutionally guaranteed freedoms. This is an \nunnecessary, unfair attempt to attack a fundamental, legal right that \napplies only to women. I urge my colleagues to join me in defeating \nthis ban, because it is ill-advised, expensive, inappropriate, and \nwrong.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I do not want to take much of the \nSenate's time this morning, but I would like to make a couple of points \nin support of the committee amendment to strike certain provisions of \nthe House-passed bill.\n  If we must have this debate, I believe it is appropriate that we have \nit today, Saturday. Having the debate on the weekend will give more of \nthe 1.2 million women who work for the Federal Government the \nopportunity to hear this discussion.\n  As women listen to this debate, I hope they are as disappointed and \ndisgusted with it as I am. This debate strikes me as the height of \narrogance.\n  We are here today, in our great benevolence, to decide which \nfundamental rights and what health benefits will be available to the \n1.2 million women who work for the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, there should not even be a debatable question here. \nWhether my colleagues on the other side like it or not, the Supreme \nCourt has spoken: Women in this country have the fundamental right to \nchoose.\n  The law, the right, and the privilege are clear. Whether or not to \nexercise that right is a personal decision. It is a decision to be made \nby a woman and her doctor, not by a group of 90 or so men in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, women who work for the Federal Government pay nearly \n30 percent of their health care premiums. This is more than most \nworkers in the private sector pay, when an employer agrees to provide \nhealth care coverage. In neither cases, the private or public sector, \nis health insurance coverage a fringe benefit. Health care coverage is \npart of an employee's compensation for service rendered to the \nemployer; and for the past 2 years, Federal employees, like most \nworkers in the private sector, have had the option of choosing a health \nplan that covers the full range of reproductive health services, \nincluding abortion.\n  Are we going to reverse this policy today? Are we going to issue a \nDraconian mandate, for purely political reasons, that applies only to \nwomen who work for the Postal Service, the Justice Department, the \nNational Park Service, the Department of Labor, and the other branches \nof the Federal Government? For these women, are we in the Congress \ngoing to decide that reproductive health services includes every other \nhealth service except abortion? Are we saying to these women ``Sure, \ncome work for the Federal Government. Devote yourself to public \nservice--but don't forget to check your constitutional rights at the \ndoor.''\n  That is what this debate is about. It is an attempt by anti-choice \nMembers of the Congress, who have failed to make abortion illegal, to \nmake the fundamental right to choose more difficult, more expensive, \nand more dangerous.\n  Mr. President, this is just the first step. Today it is the hard \nworking women in the Federal Government. Next, it will be Medicaid \nrecipients and American Indian women who depend on the Indian Health \nService for their health care. Then it will be family planning \nservices, which millions of women and girls depend upon. And on and on \nand on, until the goal of the radical right is realized and abortion is \nmade illegal.\n  This is the road we are on. Each Member of this body should \nunderstand this, and every woman in America should understand this.\n  Whose marching orders will we follow? Will we follow the extreme \npolitical agenda of the radical right, or will we follow the \nConstitution, as affirmed by the Supreme Court more than 20 years ago \nin Roe versus Wade? The Members of the House have already made their \ndecision. They opted for the radical right. I sincerely hope my \ncolleagues in the Senate have the wisdom to choose the other course.\n  We should uphold the Constitution. We should respect the fundamental \nright of every woman to reproductive choice, regardless of where she is \nemployed, or whether she is employed. We should get out of this \nridiculous business of micromanaging the lives and choices of hard-\nworking Americans. And we should reject this blatant attempt to \ndiscriminate against women who work for the Federal Government and rob \nthem of their fundamental right to choose.\n\n[[Page S11518]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we are now coming to the end of this \ndebate. I know we have only a few minutes. This is where good and \nhonorable people can differ.\n  I ask the Senator from Oklahoma, on his idea of modifying his rape \nand incest amendment, if he would also add the language medically \nnecessary?\n  Mr. NICKLES. No, I do not think that is defined well. I think we know \nwhat rape and incest mean. Medically necessary is ambiguous. I would \nnot agree.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Later this afternoon I will offer that amendment and we \nwill be able to expound on what medically necessary means.\n  In conclusion, I believe Federal employees should have the same right \nto determine what is necessary or appropriate for their health as \nprivate sector employees do.\n  Restrictions ignore the reality of women's lives. Half of all \npregnancies are unplanned, contraceptive failure, and also there are \nmedically appropriate and medically necessary circumstances beyond rape \nand incest that necessitate the performance of an abortion.\n  This is not about what is decided for coverage under the Federal \nemployees. It is not about what is decided but who decides. The \nprinciple of self-determination, freedom, reproductive, and otherwise, \npersonal responsibility, the prohibitions on Federal health insurance \nbenefits violates all these principles.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the amendment that is pending. I \nbelieve that the issue, the fundamental issue pending before us, is \ndiscrimination against women. Restrictions on primary health care \nservices, especially where those restrictions apply only to services \nrequired by a particular group--in this case, women--does constitute \ndiscrimination. Striking the committee amendment would perpetuate \ndiscrimination against women employees and their dependents.\n  Let us be clear about what funding restrictions for Federal health \ninsurance means. It means women who work for the Federal Government or \nreceive health insurance benefits from the Federal Government will be \ndenied the same coverage for abortion as they would receive if they \nworked in the private sector, that private sector that receives tax \nsubsidies, which is really a form of taxpayers' money, to provide that \nprivate sector insurance.\n  It means that women receiving the health insurance coverage through \nthe Federal Government will be denied their basic constitutional \nprotection for obtaining an abortion under the health insurance program \nin which they pay for their services. It would mean that women who \nreceive their health care coverage through the Federal Government will \ncontinue to get second-class health care.\n  Congress should not micromanage the Federal employees benefit \nprograms, and the Congress of the United States should not put itself \nbetween a woman and her physician on what is determined to be medically \nnecessary or medically appropriate.\n  I urge the defeat of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 1 minute \nremaining, and the Senator from Oklahoma has 1 minute.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I apologize. I had every intention of \ntrying to yield back time. The debate became a little hotter and that \nwas not to happen.\n  Let me clarify where we are. I heard my colleague from Maryland. She \nurged defeat of the amendment. We are voting on a committee amendment \nthat struck the House language. I hope people will vote ``no'' because \nI want to preserve the House language. I want to preserve the House \nlanguage that says no funds will be used for Federal employees to buy \nhealth insurance unless necessary to protect the life of the mother.\n  I also planned on amending that language and putting in a rape and \nincest exception. I would do it now but am prohibited from doing that. \nI understand that.\n  I want to protect the lives of unborn children. Senator Smith from \nNew Hampshire said before we had this prohibition, the Federal \nGovernment paid for 17,000 abortions. Then we placed a restriction in \n1983. The language we are trying to insert now, or keep alive the House \nlanguage, is the exact same language that this Government had for 10 \nyears between 1984 and 1993. It saved thousands of lives. Somebody \nsaid, well, it saved money. My interest is not the money so much as I \nwant to save lives. I do not want taxpayers to have to subsidize \nabortion as a fringe benefit.\n  Take a poll of people, ask any poll, Do you think taxpayers' funds \nshould be used to subsidize abortion, and the answer is no. \nOverwhelmingly no. Not close, Mr. President, 70 to 80 percent.\n  I heard my colleague say, get the Government out of this area. I want \nthe Government to quit financing abortions. That is the reason we have \nthis amendment.\n  I urge my colleague to vote no on the committee amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator from Oklahoma then does not intend to \ntable?\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is correct.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. This is a straight up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \ncommittee amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. For this portion of the debate on this amendment, we \nhave concluded it. I thank all of my colleagues who spoke, the \nDemocratic women of the Senate, I thank the good men of the Senate who \nsupport a woman's right to choose, and I thank our Republican \ncolleagues, because I think we have demonstrated that our position is a \nbipartisan position and a right position.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator yield and explain the vote that we are \nabout to have. There is some confusion.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. A vote ``aye'' would be to retain the position of the \nSenator from Maryland and to retain the committee amendment that was \noffered by Senator Shelby and is current law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the committee \namendment which appears on page 76, lines 10 through 17. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. EXON, when his name was called, Present.\n  Mr. LOTT.

I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], \nand the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor], are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  \n[[Page S11519]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n\n\n          Committee Amendment on Page 2, Beginning on Line 14\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is now the first \ncommittee amendment which appears on page 2, line 14 of the bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n     Amendment No. 2153, to committee Amendment on Page 2, Line 14\n   (Purpose: Prohibit taxpayer funding for abortions covered by the \n                Federal Employee Health Benefit Program)\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2153.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of the Committee amendment on Page 2, Line 14, \n     add the following:\n       Sec.  . No funds appropriated by this Act shall be \n     available to pay for an abortion, or the administrative \n     expenses in connection with any health plan under the Federal \n     employees health benefit program which provides any benefits \n     or coverage for abortions.\n       Sec.  . The provision of section    shall not apply where \n     the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were \n     carried to term, or that the pregnancy is the result of an \n     act of rape or incest.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, may we have order?\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, regular order.\n  What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Nickles amendment, which the clerk has \nreported.\n  Mr. KERREY. Is not the committee amendment the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The committee amendment is pending, and the \nSenator from Oklahoma has offered an amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has offered a \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  I would like to hear the Senator from Oklahoma. We talk a lot about \ncourtesy. If Senators will take their seats so we can hear what the \nSenator from Oklahoma says.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, during the debate, I mentioned my \ninterest and desire to include language that would be like the language \nthat we voted on 2 years ago that would really be like the so-called \nHyde language, which says no money shall be used for abortion except \nthat necessary to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape and \nincest.\n  That is the language I have now submitted. That is the language I \nwanted to get into the bill last night and earlier today and was \nunsuccessful.\n  I know my colleague from Maryland has a different idea. She would \nlike to have her amendment. I just mention that we have debated this \nfor a long time. I am happy to vote up or down on my amendment and \nhappy to vote up or down on the amendment of the Senator from Maryland. \nI do not know that we need any time. I think every person in this body \nknows exactly how they are going to vote on my amendment. They may or \nmay not know how they will vote on the amendment of the Senator from \nMaryland. But it is not my intention or desire, I tell my friend from \nNebraska, to delay this bill any longer. I was willing to agree to an \nhour time agreement on the first amendment. I am happy to enter into a \nvery short time agreement on this amendment, on the amendment of the \nSenator from Maryland. If the Senator from Maryland has two amendments, \nthat is the Senator's right and prerogative. And I am happy to enter \ninto time agreements and see where the votes are.\n  Mr. KERREY. As I understand, the action that we just took was that \nthe subcommittee in our legislation said we struck the general \nprovisions that were offered by the House.\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERREY. The House offered a restriction on the use of health \ninsurance saying health insurance could not be used to pay for \nabortions except if the life of the mother was in danger.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KERREY. The action we took struck those general provisions. You \nare now saying you want to amend and require that it only be in the \ncase of the life of the mother being in danger and rape and incest?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KERREY. You would not agree to allow ``medically necessary and \nappropriate'' be added?\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is not in my language. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KERREY. You support ``rape and incest,'' but not ``medically \nnecessary and appropriate.''\n  As I understand it, the Senator from Maryland wants to offer an \namendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I say to the Senator from Nebraska and to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, should the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma \nprevail, then I have two amendments that I will offer. One will deal \nwith allowing abortions that are medically necessary and medically \nappropriate; leave the decision to the clinician. If that should be \ndefeated, I will offer another amendment limiting it to medically \nappropriate.\n  I will say to the Senator from Oklahoma, there are many Senators who \nwish to speak. And there are many Senators who voluntarily reduced \ntheir time that they spoke on the last restriction to 5 minutes. There \nwere Senators who wanted to speak extensively. One was the Senator from \nPennsylvania on the other side of the aisle who actually went to the \nleader time because I could not accommodate him.\n  So at this point I cannot agree to a time agreement. If the two \nleaders have a different view and would like to discuss that with us, I \nwould be happy to enter into a quorum call. But right now, I have \ncolleagues that will want to talk about the yet one more restriction.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the statement of my \ncolleague from Maryland. I will just say we had 3 hours of debate on \nthis issue. People know how they are going to vote. This is Hyde \nlanguage. We have voted on this. Most of us voted on this several \ntimes. And I am happy to stay here as long as necessary. Just like I \nmentioned to my friend and colleague from Maryland that she has a right \nto offer her amendment, I have a right to offer my amendment. If it \ntakes 10 minutes, that is fine. If it takes longer, that is fine, too.\n  I just hope we can vote. We have almost all of our colleagues here. \nWe had a good vote, large attendance, on the last vote for a Saturday \nat 1. I do not know what the attendance is going to be on a Saturday at \n3.\n  I think this is an important amendment since we are dealing with an \nissue that does affect the lives of a lot of unborn children and it \ndoes affect health insurance policies. So I think it is an important \nvote. I hope that we will vote on it very quickly.\n  My amendment is self-explanatory. It says no funds should be used to \npay for abortions for Federal employees unless it is necessary to save \nthe life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest. The Senator from \nNorth Dakota made a very passionate speech and mentioned--I remember \nwhen his wife was abducted. That was horrifying. But he also indicated \nthat he would vote with us if we had the rape and incest amendment. \nSeveral of our colleagues have stated that.\n  I stated that I was going to give them that opportunity. I do not \nknow why it would take very long for us to debate that. But I am happy \nto debate it as long as necessary. I urge we vote on it as quickly as \npossible. I also urge that we also vote very quickly on the other \nadditional amendments of the Senator from Maryland.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I would like to remind the Senators to address \neach other in the third person and to make addresses through the Chair.\n\n[[Page S11520]]\n\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I spent so much time--I am trying to think what the third \nperson is. That is the ``he'' ``they'' stuff?\n  Mr. President, when the majority leader asked if we were ready--and \nwe had a meeting earlier this week with the Senator from Alabama, the \nchairman of the subcommittee, and the question was, are you all ready \nto go? I am not sure he said, ``you all.'' I guess I am in the Alabama \ntalk. He said, ``Are you guys ready to go with this bill?'' We said the \nonly controversial thing we have got is the abortion language having to \ndo with health insurance. If we can get a time agreement, we would be \nprepared to go to this bill.\n  Last night we had an agreement. And this thing was humming along \npretty comfortably. It looked like this would be the only vote, and we \nmight be able to stack the remaining votes on Monday morning. Now it \nappears that it is coming unraveled. I just say it does not appear to \nme to be holding together much any longer. We had an agreement last \nnight. It has broken apart.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma wants to offer another amendment. The \nSenator from Maryland will offer at least one additional amendment. We \nare stuck with the prospect now of being here all day long, voting on \namendment after amendment after amendment. And, you know, just for the \nlay of the land, again, we are going to go into conference with the \nHouse. I do not know what is going to come back out of conference. It \nis not going to be language entirely struck. We are going to have to \nnegotiate with the House to get some kind of language. It would not \nsurprise me if we did not come up with language that is what neither \nthe Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from Maryland want. I do not \nknow. Then, the President--they already promised to veto the darn \nthing, not on this but because we are cutting too much out of IRS. I do \nnot know.\n  I say to the majority leader, in the third person here, I do not know \nwhether or not it is advisable for us to continue on this bill. Maybe \nwe ought to come back to the Senator and say, ``Gee, we were wrong. We \nthought we had an agreement. We thought we had made a good-faith effort \nto work with Members on a variety of other controversial amendments and \nhave worked out an awful lot of differences.''\n  But it seems to me we are at a point where unless Members are \nenthusiastic about hanging around here all day long, voting on \nsomething that is apt to be vetoed by the President anyway, I do not \nknow how much prospect we have for getting an agreement on this \nTreasury, Postal appropriations bill.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Well, I just hope that the Senator from Nebraska will not \ngive up too easily. I know the process is very difficult. We found that \nout about midnight last night on the Defense Department authorization \nbill. We thought we were humming along pretty well. We got down to \nabout half a dozen amendments. Suddenly there were 61 amendments. I do \nnot know. We only had one amendment.\n  I know the Senator is prepared to accept a number of amendments. Is \nthat true?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Yes.\n  Mr. DOLE. A couple of outstanding amendments that are controversial?\n  Mr. SHELBY. That is right.\n  Mr. DOLE. It seems to me, you might be on to something here. We might \neven finish a bill over here. There is not much precedent for doing \nanything in the Senate, but there is always hope we might finish \nsomething. We have got a lot of stuff in the bone yard now that keeps \npiling up out there. Sooner or later we have to finish it. If we do not \ndo it today, then we will be doing it a week from today or sometime.\n  So if we can reach a time agreement, that would certainly help the \nmanagers. I do not want to discourage the managers.\n  We can go on to the Interior appropriations bill or we can start the \nwelfare bill today. But I would rather complete this bill before we go \nto the Interior bill.\n  And there is still some hope we can come back to the Defense \nauthorization bill that we almost completed yesterday and would like to \ncomplete today. But I hope that the managers might try to shop around \nfor time agreements, and if not, maybe set aside this particular \ncontroversy and go ahead and do the rest of the bill and see if we can \nnegotiate in the meantime. If we are going to have what amounts to a \nfilibuster all day long, then I think probably we would just go on to \nsomething else.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Would the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I wonder if the majority leader could get with the \nDemocratic leader and some of the main participants and see if we can \ncome up with a time agreement because we basically know how we are \ngoing to vote on this issue, as the Senator from Oklahoma said. But if \nwe can have a time agreement on several amendments, we could move this \nbill this afternoon.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I think the Senator from Alabama is right. I think \neverybody in this body knows how they are going to vote on the Hyde \nlanguage, the rape and incest. And I am willing to vote right now, or 5 \nminutes equally divided. I know the Senator from Maryland stated that \nif we prevail--and we might; it is very close; I will tell everyone \nright now it is within a vote or two--if we prevail, she wants to offer \na second-degree amendment. She has that right. I think she should have \nthat right. And we do not have to decide now. I will be happy to grant \nthe Senator from Maryland a time agreement if she wants it or not have \na time agreement if she wants. But the best thing is to see how this \nthing would move forward by having a vote on the pending amendment. And \nthen we go from there.\n  If the Senator wants to have additional amendments, she can do so. On \nthose amendments I will be happy to enter into a time agreement if she \nwould like--or not like, that is certainly acceptable with this Senator \nas well.\n  Mr. KERREY. What I would suggest is we go into a quorum call for 5 \nminutes, and we get the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from \nMaryland together to see if we cannot work out a time agreement where \nwe could have these two amendments.\n  I alert colleagues that the idea here is to try to limit the number \nof votes that we have.\n  We can have debates all the rest of the day and night. We would like \nto stack votes. We would like to get a UC and stack votes on Monday, if \nthe majority leader is agreeable to that.\n  Mr. DOLE. There are 94 Senators here. I do not know why we want to \nstack votes on Monday. We gave notice that there will be a Saturday \nsession. There are four absent on our side, two absent on the other \nside. We are disadvantaged. They knew we were going to have a session. \nWe do not have them very often. This is the first one we have had all \nyear. We are trying to get into a recess mode.\n  I hope we will not push anything off to Monday. Before long, it will \nbe a week from Monday and we will still be here, and a lot of people \nwill not be happy with the majority leader.\n  Mr. KERREY. I appreciate that very much, but what we are left with, I \ndo not know what the total number is--- seven or eight we could not \nagree to. We worked on a lot of them. We worked with the Senator from \nNew York, the Senator from Arkansas and several other Senators. We are \nworking with the Senator from Georgia right now. We are trying to \naccept amendments where we can.\n  But where we cannot do it, we are left with seven or eight votes. We \nare going to have a Saturday session, a full Saturday session, because \nall Members who have amendments are going to want to come, getting back \nto the third person here, Mr. President, are going to want to come to \nthe floor and present their amendments and debate their amendments. I \nwas trying not to avoid a Saturday session but trying to come up with a \nreasonable way to deal with the votes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum. \n\n[[Page S11521]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, this morning I was shocked and saddened \nto hear of the sudden and tragic death of a very good friend and long-\ntime colleague of mine, State Senator Cal Anderson.\n  Cal passed away last night of a disease that is touching far too many \nlives. Cal announced that he had been stricken with HIV/AIDS just a \nshort time ago. Cal faced AIDS as he faced every legislative battle we \nfought together: With courage, with integrity, and with honor. Even \nthough Cal was seriously ill these past months, he continued to do his \njob for his constituents the best he could, fighting hard for the \nthings he believed in. He worked hard to the end, representing his \nconstituents to the best of his ability.\n  I worked very closely with Cal during my time in the Washington State \nSenate. He has been known throughout our State as an outstanding \nlegislator. He worked hard, he stayed true to his beliefs, and he had a \nunique ability to find solutions. I worked with him on an open \ngovernment committee on which we took steps to make the legislative \nprocess more accessible. Cal made sure our bill was not only workable \nbut a big improvement in peoples' ability to participate in government.\n  Cal was a Vietnam combat veteran. He won two Bronze Stars and two \nArmy commendations for meritorious service. He was courageous and he \nwas honest. He served his country, as well as his constituents.\n  Perhaps most importantly, Cal was a passionate advocate for human \nrights and dignity. Just last month, a home in Seattle was dedicated in \nhis name. The Cal Anderson House is a 24-unit facility that will \nprovide housing, counseling, and other services to low-income families \nwith HIV/AIDS.\n  A month ago, I visited Cal in his hospital room. As usual, he spoke \nnot about himself but what I needed to do. Cal told me, if nothing \nelse, I needed to do as much as I could as a U.S. Senator to ensure \nthat people with serious diseases did not have to fight with their \ninsurance companies for health care at the same time they had to fight \nthe disease for their lives. Cal said he, himself, had excellent \ncoverage as an elected official, but those around him suffered through \ninsensitive insurance companies. He felt that dignity was and is being \ntaken away from seriously ill Americans, and that did not reflect the \nAmerica he knew and loved.\n  So, today, I rise to simply say good-bye to Cal, to thank him for his \nyears of service to his country and his State, and to say: Cal, your \nbattle is over, but our battle continues, to defeat AIDS so that it \nwill stop taking lives from far too many young Americans.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/05/senate-section/article/S11521-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11521-S11556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TREASURY, POSTAL SERVICE, AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n            Unanimous-Consent Agreement--Amendment No. 2153\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur \non or in relation to the Nickles amendment No. 2153 at 2:30 p.m. today, \nand that the time between now and the vote be equally divided in the \nusual form, and that no amendments be in order during the pendency of \nthe Nickles amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, \nwhat we have just agreed to is that we will have a vote on or in \nrelation to the Nickles amendment soon, which several of our colleagues \nhave requested, which deals with prohibiting funds for the use of \nabortion in Federal employees' health care plans unless it is necessary \nto save the life of a mother, and in the case of rape or incest.\n  I hope we can vote much sooner. We have an hour and 10 minutes, \nequally divided. This Senator will be happy to yield back a significant \namount of time. A lot of people would like to do something else on \nSaturday afternoon. It happens to be a very important vote. I think \neverybody knows how they are going to vote.\n  I ask my colleagues to speak briefly, and maybe we can yield back \ntime and actually vote prior to 2:30.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Does the Senator from Oklahoma wish to comment on his \namendment or on why he felt it met a compelling human need?\n  Mr. NICKLES. To respond, I have spoken more on the floor than I ever \ncared to on this particular Saturday. I think it is very well known \nwhat this amendment is. It is Hyde language. It says we are not going \nto use Federal funds to subsidize abortions for Federal employees \nunless it is necessary to save the life of the mother, or in the case \nof rape and incest. It is pretty self-explanatory.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Under the previous agreement, the \ntime is controlled by the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I ask unanimous consent that the time on our side be \ncontrolled by the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Now, where we are on the Nickles amendment is that, essentially, this \nis yet another version of a restriction. We just defeated an amendment \nthat was a restriction, and each side articulated that position, I \nthink, in a very clear way.\n  I do not want any restrictions on Federal employees health benefits. \nTherefore, I oppose the Nickles amendment.\n  Under the legislation pending, the committee amendment, if someone is \na victim of rape, they can have an abortion. If someone is a victim of \nthe most horrendous assault on a person, incest, they can have an \nabortion. This is not about allowing rape or incest; this amendment \nlimits it only to the life of the mother, rape, and incest.\n  So, we will be clear, this is not about being a knight in shining \narmor that says we will provide at least some flexibility in harsh, \npunitive, restrictive, and repressive legislation. No. The legislation \nthat is pending before the Senate through the committee amendment has \nno restrictions on Federal health employee benefits. That is the \ncurrent law.\n  Now, the issue is not what is decided. The issue is, who decides? I \nbelieve the U.S. Congress should not interject itself into the \nphysician's office. I believe the Congress should stay out of that and \nfocus on what it is supposed to be doing, which is broad policy \nobjectives for the Nation. It is not to intervene, interject, detour, \nderail, or micromanage what goes on in a physician's office when a \nFederal employee or a dependent in a Federal employee's family seeks \nmedical help. That is why we oppose it.\n  We did not want restrictions. We believe in doctors' autonomy, in \ndoctors' judgment. That is why we say the issue is not what is decided, \nbut who decides.\n  Now, we also believe that there is a war going on against American \nwomen; that there is a war going on in the home; that there is a war \ngoing on through the terrible violence of domestic violence. We believe \nthere is a war against women in terms of street crime, particularly \nrape. We believe there is a war against women going on in the workplace \nthrough sexual harassment. That there is even a war against women going \non in the U.S. Senate, and we cannot even get a public hearing on this.\n  We also believe that there should be no cutting of health care. What \nwe see is that there is a war against women. It is not only about \nabortion and Federal employees; we are also cutting medically necessary \nservices in other areas of health care. \n\n[[Page S11522]]\n\n  Look what we are doing to the elderly on Medicare. Look what we are \ndoing to children on Medicaid, under the guise of welfare reform, when \nchildren will lose their health benefits. Look what we are doing to the \nelderly, in terms of long-term care, by cutting Medicaid. That is why \nwe say there is a war against women going on in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  We want our colleagues to defeat the Nickles amendment, restricting \nwomen's options in health care, to only be able to have an abortion if \ntheir life was at stake or if it is rape or incest.\n  Now, every single Member of the U.S. Senate will view rape and incest \nas the most repugnant, the most horrible, the most atrocious thing that \ncan be done to a human being. Of course, if you are a victim of rape \nand incest, we would want you to be able to have that abortion. We want \nyou to have an abortion if it is medically necessary and medically \nappropriate.\n  We believe in freedom of choice, self-determination. We believe in \nthe United States of America, we believe it in foreign policy, and we \nbelieve it in the physician's offices where Federal employees or their \ndependents seek advice, counsel, and clinical judgment.\n  This is why we oppose this restriction. This is why we want to defeat \nthe Nickles amendment.\n  Later on, we want to defeat the cuts in Medicare. Later on, we want \nto defeat the cuts in Medicaid that take away medical services for the \nelderly and for children. We will also want to defeat the other \nhorrendous cuts that are going on where women are victims of violence \nand abuse, whether it is in the home, whether it is in the streets, or \nin the neighborhoods.\n  I hope that we would defeat the Nickles amendment, support the \ncommittee amendment, currently, which leaves the decisionmaking to the \npregnant woman and to the physician.\n  How much time did I consume?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland consumed 6 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, I say to my friend from Maryland.\n  I thought when we initiated this discussion we would have one vote, \nlet the chips fall where they may. But I respect the fact that the \nSenator from Oklahoma wishes to raise this issue again, and we will \nsee, now, where this leads.\n  What does this current amendment do? It reverses every single thing \nwe just did, except that it adds two exceptions to the House \nrestrictions.\n  I want to make that clear. It reverses everything that we did. It \nsays that no Federal employee female can use her private insurance to \nget an abortion unless her life is at stake or in cases of rape and \nincest.\n  In essence, it is treating Federal employee women unlike every other \nwoman in this country. They cannot use their private insurance to \nobtain an abortion unless their life is at stake or they are a victim \nof rape or incest.\n  I have a question to ask rhetorically to my friend from Oklahoma. \nWhat if her health is at risk if she carries the fetus to term? Can she \nget that abortion? No, not under the Nickles amendment. If her health \nis at stake, she cannot use her private insurance to get an abortion.\n  What if she runs the risk of severe paralysis if she carries the \nfetus to term? No, under the Nickles amendment she could not use her \nprivate insurance to obtain an abortion.\n  What if the doctor believes an abortion is necessary to preserve her \nfuture fertility? No, she cannot use her private insurance, unlike \nevery other woman in America, to exercise her right to choose.\n  What if the doctor believes there would be untold pain and suffering \nthroughout her entire life if the fetus is carried to term? No. No, \nunder the Nickles amendment, she would not be able to use her private \ninsurance to obtain an abortion, unlike every other woman in America \nwho has insurance.\n  The answer is, that woman would be in deep, deep, trouble\n   because she would be left alone, she would face a life, perhaps, of \nuntold pain and suffering, if she carried the fetus to term.\n\n  I hope the women and men in America are watching this debate, \nalthough it is not too likely. I applaud those who are here watching us \ntoday. Why do I want them to watch this? Because this is not some \nideological dispute. It affects their lives. I want them to think of a \ndaughter, of a niece, of an aunt or a cousin. I want them to think of \ntheir favorite female person that they know who might find herself in a \nvery troubled pregnancy, with terrible, terrible possibilities to that \nwoman's health, unable to use her insurance. Perhaps this favorite \nrelative is not wealthy. She is frightened. She is forced, because of \nthe Nickles amendment, to carry a fetus to term, even though it \nthreatens her long-term health.\n  I say the question comes down to this. Who do you trust? Who do you \ntrust to make this difficult, personal, agonizing, troubling decision? \nDo you trust the U.S. Senator who does not even know your family? I do \nnot. I do not put the health of my children in political hands. I keep \nit in my family, with my God, with my doctor, with my husband, with my \nloving family, with my loving rabbi, if you will. And I do not want to \nput it in the hands of the Senator from Oklahoma. I want to put it in \nthe hands of the people who love--who love, personally--the people who \nare impacted by this ill-advised amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes for the Senator from California \nhas elapsed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for 30 seconds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield the Senator 30 additional seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. In summing up my argument, let me say to the people of \nAmerica who are watching this debate, this is a difficult choice and we \nall make it inside our hearts, inside our minds, in our prayers. And we \ncome at it a little differently.\n  So should the politicians of America now decide, if you happen to be \na woman who works for the Federal Government, we are going to tell \nyou--even if you face long-term risk to your health, to your person, to \nyour body, to your future--what to do about a personal, religious \ndecision? I say no. Let us stand firm for the individual to make that \nchoice and let us support the Senator from Maryland and vote down the \namendment that is before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland controls 22 minutes \nand 30 seconds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am going to yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Illinois, and then, after that, I will yield 10 minutes to \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, there is a lot of emotional \ndiscussion in this debate regarding the issue of abortion and that, \nafter all, is what it is about. But let me suggest to the Members and \nthe people in the gallery and the people who are listening, there \nreally is another issue here and that is an issue of liberty and an \nissue of the appropriate role of the Federal Government in \nmicromanaging specific details having to do with women's health.\n  Whatever side of the abortion issue you come out on, it seems to me \none thing can certainly be said and that is that it is unusual--it has \nbeen unusual for the Federal Government, for the Congress of the United \nStates, for the Senate, to begin to detail, in specific detail, exactly \nwhat should and should not be covered by Federal employees' health \nplans.\n  Think about it. What would be the reaction on this floor if some \nSenator stood up and said: ``I think the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program should only prescribe this procedure for the prostate \nand not that procedure for the prostate.'' Everyone on this floor would \nsay, ``This is absurd. We have an entire group of people to make \ndecisions about health coverage so Federal employees can enjoy the same \nkind of health coverage as is enjoyed in the private sector.''\n  Yet, what is happening here is, because it is women's health, and \nbecause it is the volatile issue of abortion, there is an exception \nbeing made here, an exception that, frankly, goes back to overturning \nlongstanding precedents regarding the Congress not micromanaging \nemployee benefits in a way that exceeds our traditional role.\n  We have, traditionally, in the Congress, involved ourselves in issues \nof Federal pay. But, frankly, until the \n\n[[Page S11523]]\nReagan administration we, the Congress, have consistently left details \nrelating to the administration of employee benefits, employee benefits, \nto the Office of Personnel Management. This is as it should be.\n  It is the law that women are able to privately choose whether or not \nan abortion is appropriate for their personal circumstances and \nsituation without interference from the Government. So 2 years ago, in \n1993, we removed the intrusion of politicians from employee \ncompensation issues and we should, I think, continue to keep the \ninvolvement of politicians out of issues going to benefit coverage on \nFederal health insurance.\n  I would like to make another point. This represents yet another \nspecial carving out in the area of women's health that I believe is \ninappropriate. This Congress has already moved to restrict the rights \nof poor women to exercise their right under the law to choose whether \nor not to have an abortion. Now we are trying to take another step. We \nare going to restrict the right of women who work for the Federal \nGovernment to choose whether or not to exercise their rights to have an \nabortion.\n  In any event, this would isolate Federal employees, as a group, with \nhealth insurance plans that were like no one else's. That is to say, an \nemployee who worked for a major corporation in this country would have \nreproductive rights covered under her health insurance. An employee who \nworked for the Federal Government, if the Senator from Oklahoma is \nsuccessful, would not. And that is really the crux of this debate. Not \njust the issue of abortion because, frankly, between Supreme Court \ndecisions and decisions that have been in place for at least 20 years \nnow, the issue of abortion--in the law, at least--has been settled. It \nis legal. It is a matter of personal choice by an individual woman with \nregard to what it is she does with her own body.\n  I believe that personal choice ought to remain that way. It is no \none's business what somebody does in regard to a decision as private as \nthis. It should be between a woman and her God and her conscience and \nher family. It certainly should be removed from interference by \npoliticians who, frankly, I do not think should get that much into \nanybody's private business.\n  But that issue having been in the forefront of our public debate, we \nunderstand that right now there continue to be efforts here in the \nCongress to poke away at the issue, and to really repeal, by \nindirection, the decision of the courts and what has been the law in \nthis country for easily 20 years.\n  I believe this repeal by indirection is inappropriate. I believe it \nis a mistaken approach for us to suggest to the world that we believe \nin liberty when it comes to all these hosts of issues having to do with \npersonal freedom and individuals being treated fairly in terms of \nhealth coverage, and in terms of their decisions about their personal \ncircumstances, on the one hand, and yet carve out exceptions, exception \nafter exception after exception, when it comes to reproductive choice \nand reproductive rights.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will heed the warnings from the \nSenator from Maryland and will defeat the effort to make this incursion \ninto women's rights that I believe is certainly inappropriate and \nshould be defeated with this next vote.\n  With that, I say to the Senator from Maryland, I know I have no \nadditional time but I will yield back whatever time may be remaining to \nthe Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator from Illinois. She has been a \nmarvelously strong advocate. It is a blessing to have her here.\n  I yield a maximum of 10 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nMaryland for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. President, the major considerations on the pending amendment \ninvolve the underlying question of abortion and whether the U.S. Senate \nis going to continue at great length to debate this issue while \nrelegating other very important subjects to lesser status.\n  I agree with my colleagues who have emphasized the point that it is a \nvery important matter. And while I am personally opposed to abortion, I \ndo not think it is a matter for the Federal Government to regulate \nthem.\n  I think in the broadest context, the issue has been decided by the \nSupreme Court of the United States not just in Roe versus Wade in 1973 \nbut in the 1992 decision of Casey versus Planned Parenthood in a \ndecision written by three Justices who had been Republicans, all of \nwhom were appointed by conservative Republican Presidents.\n  So that is the law of the land, and that is the dominant question. \nWhen you take a look at what has occurred in the course of the recent \ndays and recent weeks you see a really concerted effort to dismantle \nthe constitutional right of a woman to choose.\n  On July 21, within the past 2 weeks, there was an amendment passed in \nthe House of Representatives overturning the option of the States, the \nrequirements of the States really, to provide abortion in the cases of \nrape or incest for poor women. On July 20, there was an amendment \nadopted in the House of Representatives which prohibited human embryo \nresearch. On August 3, there was an amendment adopted eliminating the \nfunding for the Office of Surgeon General which was a reaction of the \ndebate on Dr. Henry Foster whose only wrongdoing, only alleged \nwrongdoing, was that he performed medical procedures permitted under \nthe U.S. Constitution. This is a man who was practically ridden out of \ntown on a railroad without being allowed a vote in the U.S. Senate on \nthe confirmation process.\n  On July 21 of this year, the House adopted a provision which intruded \nupon the ability of medical schools to accredit hospitals and training \ninstitutions on the basis of requiring works in obstetrics and \ngynecology related to abortions. The House of Representatives, after \nvery extensive debate, very narrowly defeated a provision to eliminate \nfunding for Planned Parenthood.\n  We have seen legislation passed by the House of Representatives which \nwould prohibit Federal funding for a woman in a prison. If a woman is \nin a prison and she is raped, she has no access to funds of her own, \nand according to the standard of the House of Representatives, the \nFederal Government may not pay for her abortion. The House has also \npassed legislation which would prohibit the abortion on military \ninstallations around the world when there are servicewomen and \ndependents of servicemen who would be denied the opportunity to have an \nabortion performed on U.S. military installations.\n  So what has in effect happened is that there has been a concerted \nattack to dismantle the woman's constitutional right to choose because \nthose who have favored a constitutional amendment to ban abortions, to \ncriminalize abortions, have been unsuccessful in doing so.\n  That led one of my ingenious staff members to prepare this chart \nwhich I displayed briefly this morning, and on a separate amendment it \nis worth just another look. It is a chart entitled ``Dismantling a \nWoman's Right to Choose'' from A to Z. And the A is, Amend the \nConstitution to abolish a woman's right to choose; B, Ban Federal \nfunding for abortions of women in Federal prisons; C, Cut off family \nplanning funds. And when you come down to M--I am not going to read \nthem all--you have M, Mandate that Federal employees' insurance exclude \nabortion coverage. That is a matter on the floor today.\n  Mr. President, when the arguments have been made that there is a \nFederal subsidy, I submit, realistically viewed, it is not a Federal \nsubsidy, for two reasons. One is that the employees pay a substantial \npart of the funding--about 28 percent. So it would be fair and \nreasonable to allocate that 28 percent to this particular kind of \nhealth coverage.\n  Second, the Federal employees give services for their compensation, \nand part of their compensation is this health care plan, which does \nhave some Federal employer support as well as their own personal \ncontribution.\n  So what we really have here is marking for consideration the doctrine \nof the law which says the employee is bargaining for his salary, and \npart of the consideration is his health coverage, part of which the \nemployee pays \n\n[[Page S11524]]\nfor and part of which the employer pays for.\n  An argument was made earlier today that you have the deductibility \nfor the private health care plans where the employer can deduct it and \nthe employee does not count it as income, which is a procedure under \nthe Internal Revenue Code to encourage employers to have allocations \nfor health care.\n  So when you take a really close analytical look, there really is not \na Federal subsidy involved here, but it is a health care plan like \nmany, many other health care plans available in the United States which \ngives this coverage for this kind of a medical procedure.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on my 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 4 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as we move through the debate--it is now 1:47; the \ndebate started shortly after 9 o'clock this morning--on this one issue \non coverage in Federal employee health plans, it is obvious that unless \nwe make a change in the approach of the U.S. Senate, this issue is \ngoing to occupy a tremendous amount of our time, which I suggest could \nbe spent better on other matters of the public interest.\n  We are awaiting argument this afternoon on whether the office of drug \nczar ought to be defunded or not. The drug czar is an office which was \ncreated to coordinate and oversee all of our activities in the war on \ndrugs. This is a very important matter to analyze what the drug czar \nhas been doing--whether it has been an effective use of taxpayer \ndollars or whether it ought to be continued. That matter is being put \noff. And who knows whether we will reach it this afternoon or not?\n  Shortly before the debate started on this matter, the Senator from \nNew York, Senator D'Amato, was about to offer an amendment relating to \nthe Federal payments on the Mexican debt issue, a matter of enormous \nimportance. We have the issue of welfare reform, which is in the wings \nawaiting to come to the Senate floor. There is another appropriations \nbill on the Department of the Interior, which is awaiting consideration \nby the U.S. Senate.\n  This issue about the Federal employee insurance coverage is just one \nof many that we are going to be taking up. We are going to be taking up \nhuman embryo research. We will be taking up funding for women's \nabortions in prisons and abortion access in military hospitals for \nwomen in the armed services stationed overseas.\n  Mr. President, when we had the loud mandate in 1994 electing a \nRepublican Congress, I would suggest to you that the item of the \nContract With America was a dominant philosophical ground. It is \nimportant to note that there is nothing in the Contract With America \nabout abortion, not a single word. That mandate in 1994 was instructing \nthe Congress to work on reducing the size of Government, reducing \nFederal expenditures, having a tax cut, having strong national defense, \nand having effective crime control. And the issue of a balanced budget \nin the glidepath to the year 2002 was an item which involves a \ntremendous number of very, very important considerations.\n  If we are going to spend the better part of a day, if not the entire \nday, on this one item, a Saturday session at that, I would suggest to \nyou, Mr. President, that we are not going to be fulfilling the mandate \nfor which the voters elected a Republican Congress and sent a message \nto Washington to take care of a balanced budget to reduce spending, to \nfocus on problems like the drug problem, like the problem of the issue \nof the drug czar, like national defense--where we had that bill taken \nfrom the calendar so we can proceed to the debate on this issue \ninvolving abortion.\n  So, Mr. President, I think essentially stated as to the particulars \nof this bill, there is bargain for consideration by the employees. The \nemployees pay a portion of it themselves, 28 percent. But this, \nrealistically viewed, is not a Federal subsidy. And on the broader \npicture, the issue of the constitutional right of a woman to choose has \nbeen established by the Supreme Court of the United States. That is the \nlaw of the land, and we ought to accept it as such.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5 minutes and 20 seconds remaining \nunder the Senator's control.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. That is it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is it. Now it is 5 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from the State of \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Nickles \namendment. This amendment discriminates against women in Government by \nseverely limiting their access to abortion services through the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program.\n  The Senate just went on record saying that women who are Federal \nemployees have a right to use their medical services in their own way. \nWe should not change that decision now by going back on our word and \nsaying only in very limited cases. I think it is extremely important \nthat we understand this amendment significantly, and I go back to my \nfriend, who I talked about earlier today, who I knew in college some \nyears ago who was date raped and because abortion was illegal in this \ncountry was forced to go to a back-alley abortion and because of that \nprocedure, today cannot have children.\n  Under the Nickles language, I have to ask, what would happen to my \nfriend? Would she have to prove that she was raped? Would she have to \ngo through a court process? I think we walk a very slippery slope in \nthis determination, and I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I have listened carefully to their arguments today, and I have heard \nsome say that we are using taxpayer dollars, taxpayer dollars which are \nessentially paid to our Federal employees, and we are saying because it \nis our money, we are going to tell them how their pay is going to have \nto be used.\n  I suggest to my colleagues that is a very slippery slope to go down. \nIf we begin by saying, because it is our taxpayer dollars we pay you \nwith, you cannot have abortion services, can we then use our \nprerogative here to determine how else they can use their pay, our \ntaxpayer dollars? Can we tell them they cannot use their pay to buy \ntobacco products or they have to buy American cars?\n  Are we going to go through our Federal employees' budgets, home \nbudgets line by line to determine how their money is used simply \nbecause taxpayers' dollars pay Federal employees?\n  I say to my colleagues this is a very slippery slope, and I urge us \nto proceed cautiously. I urge us to vote no on the Nickles amendment \nand retain the language this Senate very thoughtfully voted on just a \nfew moments ago.\n  I yield back the time to my colleague from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I know Senator Feinstein wishes to \nspeak. I yield myself 1 minute.\n  I wish to make very clear that this legislation is, No. 1, a \nrestriction. No matter how it is improved, it is still a restriction.\n  Also, many people continue to bring out the issue of taxpayers' \nfunds. Federal employees contribute to the health insurance plan. This \nis their contribution. They have a right as Federal employees to be \nable to seek medically necessary services. This is not like Medicaid \nfunding on abortion which is 100 percent taxpayers' funds. I am sure we \nare going to be debating it extensively later on in the year.\n  I also want to bring to everyone's attention that right now no \nFederal plan restricts any type of medical procedure. The Federal \nEmployees Benefit Program generally does not dictate what benefits are \noffered. Therefore, it goes counter to everything to then single out \none medical procedure--abortion--for restriction.\n  We hope that the Nickles amendment is defeated.\n  Excuse me. Was the Presiding Officer tapping me down?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 1 minute has expired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I know we are waiting for Senator Feinstein. Did \nSenator Murray have any other remarks that she wished to amplify?\n  I say to the Senator from Oklahoma, I note that the other Senator \nfrom Oklahoma wished to speak. I will reserve what time I have \nremaining. \n\n[[Page S11525]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A reminder, the Senator from Maryland has 30 \nseconds remaining under her control.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, before I yield to my friend and colleague \nfrom Oklahoma, I will just tell my colleagues it is my intention to \nyield back the remainder of our time very shortly so there should be a \nrollcall vote probably in the next 10 minutes.\n  I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma such time as he desires.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the senior Senator from Oklahoma for yielding the \ntime. I thank him for all of his efforts in behalf of the unborn.\n  I think the senior Senator from Oklahoma is correct when he says that \nthere are not any votes that are going to be changed by this discussion \nwe are having today. We know when we walk in here how we were going to \nvote on this. We have debated this. There is not a person in this \nChamber who has not debated and has not voted on this issue more than \nonce. And so the benefit of this discussion we are having today is not \nfor each other, not to change votes. It is for whoever might be \nwatching, for maybe those rainy regions of America where people are \nstuck inside and a couple million people may be watching this. So I \nthink that it is worth at least responding to a couple of things that \nhave been said.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is a very eloquent attorney. He made \nsome comments about Henry Foster. He said that his only wrongdoing and \nthe thing that caused him not to be confirmed was his position on \nabortion.\n  That is not the case at all. It was his positions--plural--on \nabortion where he started out saying he had not performed abortions. \nThen it was 12, then 30, then 300. That has nothing to do with the \nsubject today, but I thought I would just mention it.\n  The Senator from Illinois talked several times about the fact that \nthis is a private matter; that Government should not be involved in the \nissue of abortion. I suggest to the Senator from Illinois that \nGovernment was not involved in this until abortion became a reality \nwith Roe versus Wade. We seem to forget in this body that there are \nthree branches of Government. It is not just the legislative branch. \nAnd the judicial branch of Government did all of a sudden make this an \nissue, so Government is the reason that we have an issue.\n  While I was serving in the other body, I kept track one time. Over an \n8-year period, five out of six votes having to do with abortion had to \ndo with the Federal funding of abortion. That is the Federal Government \nbeing involved in our lives.\n  Then the Senator from California, the junior Senator from California, \nmade the comment that any decision having to do with abortion should be \nin consultation and concern with--those were her words, I believe--her \nhusband, consultation and concern with her own body, consultation and \nconcern with the doctor, consultation and concern with the rabbi. I \nsuggest she is overlooking one very important part, and that is the \nmost helpless of all, that little human being. That little human being \ncannot take care of himself or herself. I suggest the husband can; I \nsuggest that the doctor can; certainly the junior Senator from \nCalifornia can; and certainly the rabbi can. But the one person not \nrepresented on that list is the little human being, the tiny baby. If \nsomebody wants to explore that a little bit further and determine in \nhis mind or her mind whether or not that is a little baby, I suggest \nyou walk up to the President there and he will hand you a Bible and you \nmight look for and read the 139th Psalm.\n  I yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield whatever time I have remaining to the Senator \nfrom California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have a hard time, Mr. President, saying my name now \nin 30 seconds, but I will try.\n  I basically believe that this is a bad amendment, and the reason I \nbelieve it is a bad amendment is because it makes women in the Federal \nwork force second-class citizens. The amount of taxpayer money in this \nis minimal,\n maybe $1 per $1,000. The fact is that most private health care plans \nafford a woman this opportunity.\n\n  The arguments on abortion on demand, I think, are ridiculous. That is \nnot real life, that is not the way women are. So I believe the \namendment that passed earlier this morning is the amendment that we \nshould abide by. And in that respect, I am very hopeful there will be a \nvery strong vote.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time under the control of the Senator from \nMaryland has now expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma controls the remaining time of the debate.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Indiana such \ntime as he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I think everybody in the Chamber knows just \nexactly what we are doing here. Earlier we debated at length and voted \non the issue of whether or not the taxpayer should fund abortions \nprovided to Federal employees. The debate switched to an issue that \nincluded a definition of what exceptions would be allowed to that \nprohibition.\n  I stated then, and a number of others have stated, what we believe to \nbe a clear consensus among the American people relative to the issue of \nfunding for abortion, use of taxpayers' dollars. We are not debating \nhere today--although it is part of the debate and I believe it should \nbe the central focus of debate in the Senate--the question of human \nlife, when it begins, what protections it deserves under our \nConstitution, what protections it deserves in terms of the statutes \nthat we may pass. That is probably the most fundamental issue this \nSenate could ever debate. And I hope we will have an opportunity to \ndebate those central issues.\n  That, however, is not the issue today. The issue today is whether or \nnot we will force taxpayers to send their money to the Government to be \nused to provide a medical procedure which violates--for many, not all--\nbut for many some of their most deeply held religious beliefs, some of \ntheir most deeply held moral convictions. This Senator, and others, \nhave stated they did not believe that is proper.\n  Polls that have been repeatedly taken throughout this country have \nindicated that a very substantial majority of Americans do not believe \nit is proper to utilize tax dollars for Government provision of \nabortions for women. That is the central issue here today.\n  Now, in the earlier debate, we debated whether or not there should be \nexceptions to that rule. And the exception provided for in the earlier \ndebate was simply the life of the mother. The Senator from Oklahoma had \nconcluded, in discussion with a number of us, had concluded some time \nbefore, up to 48 hours before, that the exceptions that he would \nprovide in his amendment or against the amendment in his language were \nnot only abortion provision in the exception of the life of the mother \nbut also in the cases of rape and incest. Because of a procedural \nproblem, he was not able to do that. That issue was presented to \nMembers of the Senate and raised because many came down and spoke on \nthis floor saying they could not support a provision which did not \nallow exceptions for rape and incest. The Senator from Oklahoma said, \n``I tried to do that. I was not able to do that for procedural \nreasons.''\n  So we moved to a vote. The vote failed--the Senator's position \nfailed, which I supported. I was disappointed that it failed. But, \nnevertheless, it failed. The Senator from Oklahoma now comes back with \nthe identical underlying premise, that is, taxpayers should not fund \nabortions, the Government ought to get out of the abortion business, \nbut provides exceptions in cases where the life of the mother or in \ncases of rape and incest occur. A number of Senators spoke publicly on \nthis floor saying that the reason they opposed the earlier amendment \nthat did not include rape and incest is because it did not include rape \nand incest. They could not vote for a provision that allowed only for \nthe exception of the life of the mother.\n  By statement or strong implication, they left the conclusion or the \nbelief, at least in my understanding, that if an amendment were \npresented that did allow exceptions for rape and incest, \n\n[[Page S11526]]\nthey would vote for it. They will have the opportunity to do that. A \nnumber of others with whom I talked privately expressed that same \nsentiment to me. ``I cannot vote for something that does not allow an \nadditional exception for the life of the mother and rape and incest.'' \nThat is what is before us. Let us keep the focus on what this issue is. \nLet us keep a focus on what this vote is. If, as many have said, you do \nsupport an amendment that allows life of the mother, rape and incest, \nthen support the amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  That is the issue that is before us. And I hope Members understand \nthat and the vote will clearly state where individuals stand on that \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. For the information of my colleagues, I misspoke \nearlier. It was my intention to yield back time. I understand the \nunanimous-consent agreement says that the vote will be at 2:30. I would \nbe happy to yield back the time. It would require unanimous consent to \ndo that. And I have been informed that the minority does not want us to \nyield back the time. So, I will not make that effort at this point.\n  But let me touch a little bit on this amendment.\n  First, I wish to compliment my colleagues, Senator Inhofe for his \nstatement and also Senator Coats for his statement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Inhofe and Kempthorne be added \nas cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, a couple of our colleagues----\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Thurmond and Senator Thomas be \nadded as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Also Senator Craig and Senator Coats be added as \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I heard a couple of things that kind of \nintrigued me during the course of this debate. Now, I think everybody \nknows how they are going to vote. I wish we could vote in just a couple \nminutes. Evidently that is not going to happen. The language that we \nnow have is Hyde language. We have had restrictions on public funding \nof abortion going back to the 1970's. Actually going back to Roe versus \nWade, there have been some restrictions on public funds used to pay for \nabortions because it bothers a lot of people. Abortion bothers them for \nwhat it is. It is destroying the life of an unborn child. And to think \nthat the Government would be paying for it bothers a lot of people. It \nis kind of a double hit. One is abortion is bad, it is wrong, it is \nterrible, it is destroying the life of an innocent child. And then, \ntwo, to have the Federal Government pay for it or subsidize paying for \nit really bothers a lot of people. It bothers this Senator. And \nevidently it has bothered the country, because Congress has had \nrestrictions on abortion funding in different elements, either for \nFederal employees or for Medicaid recipients, for a long time, and some \nrestrictions on how funds are spent overseas in military hospitals. We \nhave had all kinds of different restrictions because it bothers people \nto have taxpayers' funds used to destroy innocent human lives.\n  So that is what we are trying to do now, is to save human lives. We \nare trying to make sure that taxpayer funds are not used to subsidize \nabortion for Federal employees. The Federal Government subsidizes \nhealth care, rather generously, 72 percent. We do have a right to \ncontrol funds. We do have a right to say how the money is spent. We do \nit every year. We have done it every year. That is the reason why most \nof us, probably, voted on this in Congress. The majority of Congress \nhas supported the Hyde language for the last many, many years.\n  Some people said, well, that is unconstitutional. It is taking away a \nwoman's constitutional right to choose. I disagree. There is nothing in \nthe Constitution that says, ``Taxpayers, you must pay for abortions,'' \nnothing. As a matter of fact, there is a Supreme Court case that says \n``Abortion is inherently different from other medical procedures, \nbecause no other procedure involves the purposeful termination of a \npotential life.'' That is Harris versus McRae on June 30, 1980. The \nSupreme Court says, as we know, we have the power of the purse. We can \nwithhold funds. And abortion is a different type of medical procedure. \nA lot of our colleagues seem to think it is a fringe benefit and it \nshould be available just like any other medical procedure.\n  Most of us disagree, or a lot of us disagree. That is the reason why \nwe are here. I wish we were not debating this all morning. I would have \nbeen happy to have 30 minutes on the initial amendment. I really did \nnot want the initial amendment. I wanted to vote on this. I was denied \nthat opportunity. We had a vote on it 2 years ago. We lost by a couple \nvotes. This vote is going to be close.\n  I do not know if some additional colleagues have left or not. But I \nwill tell all my colleagues, this is very important.\n  One of our colleagues during the debate said in 1980, before we had \nthe Hyde restriction on Federal employees, that OMB calculated--or \nmaybe it was not OMB, but some Federal agency--had calculated that \nthere were 17,000 abortions paid for under the Federal employees plan.\n  It was illegal to do that from 1984 to 1993. We had similar \nrestrictions to the one we voted on before. The restriction we have now \nis more broad.\n  Let me rephrase that. The restriction that we had from 1984 to 1993 \nonly allowed abortion to save the life of the mother. The language we \nhave now allows abortion or moneys to be used for abortion to save the \nlife of the mother or in cases of rape and incest. The Senator from \nNorth Dakota made an excellent statement. He talked about his wife. He \nmade it very passionately. You can tell he believed in what he is \nsaying. I do not disagree. It is hard to argue with the statement that \nhe made.\n  Mr. KERREY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Withhold for a moment and I will be happy to yield.\n  If we do not have some restrictions, then you can have Federal \nGovernment taxpayers' funding of abortion for any reason--any reason. \nYou would have abortion on demand paid for by the Federal employees \nhealth care plan, and it can be for sex selection. If you find out the \nfetus is a different sex than you desire, you can have it aborted, and \nit will be paid for by your health care plan, or you can have a late-\nterm abortion and have that terminated. Or maybe you find out that your \nfetus has a health problem of some kind, you can have the baby \ndestroyed. Any reason, no restriction, no restriction whatsoever, and \nall you have to do is say, ``Here's my health card.''\n  Some people in the private sector have that option. Lots of people in \nthe private sector do not have that option. We should not use taxpayer \nfunds to make that so readily available.\n  I heard some people say they want abortion to be safe, they want it \nlegal and want it to be rare. If you make this a common fringe benefit \nin health care plans, three-fourths paid by the Federal Government, it \ndoes not cost very much, it is pretty easy and oh, yes, it is paid for \nby the Government, it must be OK, it has the sanction of the \nGovernment.\n  This is a fringe benefit provided for by the Federal Government, so \nyour out-of-pocket costs are going to be what? If an abortion costs \n$200 or $300 and you had to pay 20 percent or 10 percent, maybe it cost \n$20, $30, or $40. The majority of abortions that are done in the \nDistrict of Columbia are repeat abortions, and the majority of those \nare done because of convenience. As a matter of fact, one of the \nstatements made earlier in the debate by Senator Smith said 90-some odd \npercent. I believe the figure is 98 percent of the abortions performed \nare done because it is inconvenient, not because of rape, not because \nof incest, not because the mother's life is in danger, but because it \nis inconvenient. Maybe the pregnancy was not planned. I will admit, I \nwas not a planned pregnancy, but I am thankful my mother decided to go \nahead to term. She debates it right now.\n  Mr. President, we are here because our mothers made decisions to \nbring us to term. I hate to think that we are \n\n[[Page S11527]]\ngoing to make a fringe benefit so available, so commonplace, so \nordinary and minimize the cost for anyone to have abortions so \nroutine--``Oh, yes it is covered by health care insurance, let's just \ngo do it.'' Oh, incidentally, your health care insurance is paid 72 \npercent by Uncle Sam. That is Uncle Sam encouraging the policy.\n  For a couple of our colleagues who stated we want to get the \nGovernment out, we do not want the Government in our bedroom--and we do \nnot want the Government in our wallets, we are trying to say Government \ntaxpayers should not subsidize abortion. If they still want to have an \nabortion, they can get it and pay for it with their own money, but we \nshould not have Uncle Sam saying, ``We will pay it for you.''\n  That is the whole issue of what we are talking about, should we have \nFederal subsidies; do we want the Federal Government to subsidize. On \nMedicaid, we said no. On Medicaid, we have the Hyde language. We do not \nprovide abortions for Medicaid-eligible people unless it is necessary \nto save their life or in cases of rape or incest. That is what this \nlanguage is. We are saying the same thing should apply for Federal \nemployees. I will be happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. KERREY. Let me say, first of all, I know my friend from Oklahoma \nhas very strong feelings about this, and we have a different, I think, \ncore belief. I presume earlier discussions that I had with the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire is not going to be repeated in this case. We have a \ndifferent core belief, and it leads in a different direction.\n  But the question I have is, let us presume that we go into conference \nand we come back out and the House language holds and health insurance \nis not going to be used to pay for abortions, except to save the life \nof the mother. I have a woman who is making $45,000 a year working for \nthe Federal Government. She decides to take that $250 of her pay to get \nan abortion. What is the difference between her taking $250 of taxpayer \nmoney and using it to get an abortion and an insurance company? Are we \nnot still subsidizing? If a military employee who is not covered by \nthis legislation, this insurance, uses their salary, are they not \nsubsidized as well?\n  If you really want to eliminate all the subsidization, would we not \nhave to go out and make sure that no Federal employee used any of their \nFederal salary to pay for a legal abortion?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, responding to my friend and colleague \nfrom Nebraska, the answer is no. We do not have anything in this \nlanguage saying we are going to control how anybody spends their \ndisposable income. What we do say is on health care plans that we \nsubsidize--health care plans the Federal Government writes, health care \nplans the Federal Government pays 72 percent of the cost of--we do not \nthink abortion should be a fringe benefit. Abortion is entirely \ndifferent than other medical procedures. It destroys a human life. We \nare saying that should not be a fringe benefit. What somebody does with \ntheir own money is entirely their own business. We are not trying to \nchange that. What we are trying to say is, as far as Federal policy is \nconcerned, we should not be subsidizing abortion, we should not have \nthat included as a fringe benefit.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, within a moment, we will be voting on the \namendment I offered that basically is the Hyde language. It says that \nno funds will be used for abortion unless necessary to save the life of \na mother, or in the case of rape or incest.\n  If this amendment prevails, the Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, \nwill offer an amendment with time not to exceed 30 minutes. Hopefully, \nmaybe we can reduce that time, as well. I know some of our colleagues \nwanted to know the schedule. This vote will begin at 2:30, and if this \namendment wins--and I hope it will; I hope our colleagues will support \nit--we will be voting on the amendment of the Senator from Maryland \nwithin 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], \nthe Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], the Senator from Alaska [Mr. \nMurkowski] and the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], \nand the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I have an amendment that has been agreed to, \nand I ask unanimous consent that Senator Mikulski now be recognized to \noffer an amendment to the committee amendment, as amended, regarding \n``medically necessary'' and that there be 30 minutes of debate equally \ndivided in the usual form and that following the conclusion or yielding \nback of the time, the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to the \nMikulski amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n\n\n Amendment No. 2227 to the Committee Amendment on Page 2, Line 14, as \n                                Amended\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its consideration, and while the clerk is reporting the amendment, \nI would like the courtesy of the Senate to be in order.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is not in order, and I would really ask as \na courtesy to me that all Senators take their seats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senate will \nbe in order. Take all conversations to the Cloakrooms, please.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the Senate is still not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order so we can proceed, \nplease.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1227.\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n       Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding two \n     sections, no funds appropriated by this Act shall be \n     available to pay for an abortion, or the administrative \n     expenses in connection with any health plan under the Federal \n     employees health benefit program which provides any benefits \n     or coverage for abortions.\n\n[[Page S11528]]\n\n       The provision of section   shall not apply where the life \n     of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried \n     to term, or that the pregnancy is the result of an act of \n     rape or incest, or where the abortion is determined to be \n     medically necessary.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering will \nguarantee that there will be coverage for women. This is a serious \nissue, and I do not want to raise it and I do not want to shout. I \nunderstand the desire to come to a closure.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I am offering will guarantee that there \nwill be coverage for women under the Federal employees health benefit \nplan for abortion services that are medically necessary.\n  What is ``medically necessary''? When a doctor decides using his or \nher trained professional judgment, in consultation with the patient, \nwhat will best protect the woman's health, this judgment is made based \non the totality of the circumstances presented by the patient's \nsituation.\n  We, the Senate, are not doctors. It is not our role to substitute our \njudgment for the judgment of trained medical professionals. With one \nexception, we do not have medical degrees. We do not have medical \ntraining. The Senate cannot write prescriptions. The Senate cannot \nelaborate on lab results. The Senate cannot conduct physical exams. The \nSenate cannot perform surgery. This body should allow doctors to do \nwhat they are trained to do. We should not second guess these \njudgments.\n  There are medical conditions which, when presented, increase risk to \na woman's health during pregnancy. Cancer, diabetes, high blood \npressure, kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, AIDS--these and other \nconditions are known to increase a woman's health risk. If she carries \nher pregnancy to term and her doctor concludes that an abortion is \nmedically necessary to protect her health, should we, the Senate, make \nthese judgments? Should we then substitute our judgment for that of a \nphysician? Abortion is a complex, personal decision. It must be made by \na woman in consultation with her physician.\n  This amendment will ensure that Congress does not intrude into that \npersonal decision of what the woman and her physician believe to be \nmedically necessary for her.\n  Reproductive health care, including abortion, is essential for \nwomen's health and well-being. Providing access to safe, legal \nabortions protects women's health.\n  The American Medical Association concluded that as access to safe, \nearly, legal abortions becomes increasingly restricted, there is a \nlikelihood there will be a small but measurable increase in mortality \nand morbidity among women in the United States.\n  That is what the AMA said. They are the doctors. That is what the \ndoctors say. They say to deny access to abortion will harm the health \nof American women.\n  With the last vote the Senate already carved out exceptions to an \nabsolute prohibition on abortion. We should, therefore, allow one more \nexemption, and that is where it is medically necessary.\n  That is what I am proposing. Congress should not substitute its \npolitical judgment for the judgment of health professionals.\n  Just keep this in mind. Unless the Mikulski amendment passes, if a \nwoman is told by her doctor that she will be paralyzed for life if she \ncarries the fetus to term, she will be unable to obtain an abortion.\n  Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I submit that the pending amendment is \none which is very reasonable. Even those who stand very determined \nagainst a constitutional right of a woman to choose should have little \ntrouble in accepting medical necessity as determined by the attending \nphysician.\n  In earlier speeches today, I outlined my own view that what is \nhappening in Congress today is an assault on the constitutional right \nof a woman to choose, and that we have had a veritable meltdown of \nwomen's rights as there have been limitations on abortions in military \nhospitals overseas, limitations on research, limitations on \naccreditation of medical schools where doctors in training should be \ngiven instruction on ob-gyn, and abortion. But in the example given by \nthe distinguished Senator from Maryland, a woman who is about to be \nparalyzed certainly is in an extreme situation.\n  The Constitution of the United States has been interpreted by the \nSupreme Court, which is the final arbiter on the constitutional right \nof a woman to choose, and in a series of increments there has been a \nvirtual meltdown of that right.\n  If this amendment is rejected, it will be also attacking the basic \ndoctor-patient relationship and the determination of the doctor as to \nwhat ought to be done.\n  If there is not insurance coverage for a woman's health, what is the \npurpose of insurance coverage? And when Federal employees have this \ncoverage, it is something that is bargained for.\n  It escapes me as to why anyone would think that it is really a \nsubsidy when you have part of payment made by the individual employee \nand where you have the totality of the benefit as part of the \nbargained-for consideration for employment.\n  I think this is a minimal amendment and ought to be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I should really ask my colleagues, for \nany person who has a sense of honor and decency, please support this \namendment. Let us leave the decision to the doctors and not to the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I do not expect any more speakers. I look forward to \nhearing the comments of the Senator from Oklahoma, and perhaps after he \nhas concluded we might be able to yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of my friend \nand colleague from Maryland and I just inform my colleagues that it is \nmy intention to yield back some time very quickly. So hopefully we will \nbe voting in the next 5 minutes or so.\n  I might ask my friend and colleague from Maryland what ``medically \nnecessary'' means. I will just ask the question. If a woman wanted to \nhave an abortion and the doctor wanted to perform the abortion, is \nthere any circumstance in which the Senator from Maryland would see \nthat it is not medically necessary?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. For a social reason, possibly an economic reason.\n  What I use, and what I believe the physicians also use, is the \ndictionary definition of ``necessary'':\n\n       that which is essential, indispensable, or requisite in \n     order to save the health of the mother.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's explanation, \nbut let me just give you an example. The National Abortion Rights \nLeague defines ``medically necessary'' as ``a term which generally \nincludes the broadest range of situations for which a state will fund \nabortion.''\n  In testimony against implementation of the Hyde language, Dr. Jane \nHodgson said, ``In my medical judgment every one that is not wanted by \nthe patient, I feel there is a medical indication to abort a pregnancy \nwhere it is not wanted * * * I think they are all medically \nnecessary.''\n  I am afraid that if we adopted the Senator's language, we would have \nno restriction whatsoever, none whatsoever. Someone could say: You have \na headache. Therefore, yes, it is medically necessary.\n  There would be no restriction. It would greatly undermine the \nlanguage which we just agreed to, the so-called Hyde language, which \ndoes allow abortion in those cases necessary to save the life of the \nmother or in cases of rape and incest.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment of the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. President, I am ready to yield the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am ready to yield the time as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I would just comment that one example I can give that \nis not medically necessary is where someone would want an abortion for \nthe purpose of sex selection. \n\n[[Page S11529]]\n\n  So, Mr. President, having said that, I am prepared to again affirm \nmedically necessary and yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back the remainder of her \ntime.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and \nask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was rejected.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, if I could have my colleagues' attention. I \nam informed by the managers they have done an outstanding job. They did \nnot tell me they have done an outstanding job, but I am informed----\n  [Laughter.]\n  But they have. They have worked out a number of amendments, and they \nmay be in a position to take any additional amendments to this bill and \nhave a voice vote on final passage. We will have a rollcall vote then \non the conference report. There is a standing request that we have a \nvote on the bill and, if not on the bill, on the conference report.\n  Also, as we speak, there are negotiations going on with Senator Nunn, \nSenator Warner, Senator Levin, and Senator Cohen on an issue relating \nto the DOD authorization bill. We should have some information on that \nbetween now and a quarter of 4. If there is some resolution of that \nmatter, plus I guess another one the Democratic leader mentioned, it \nmight be possible to get an agreement on the remainder of the work on \nthe DOD authorization bill.\n  If we are able to do that--we will not do that today--we will get the \nagreement today and finish the work on Monday or sometime when we have \na little spare time next week during the welfare reform debate.\n  So if my colleagues can give us a little bit of time, we will be able \nto make an announcement about whether or not there will be additional \nvotes today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have an amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenator McCain, and others at the desk. I understand it will be \naccepted by the managers, and I ask that it be in order for me to call \nup the amendment.\n\n\nVote on Committee Amendment on Page 2, Beginning on Line 14, As Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator from Wisconsin will suspend. Is \nthere further debate on the first committee amendment, as amended?\n  If not, the question occurs on agreeing to the first committee \namendment, on page 2, beginning on line 14, as amended.\n  So the committee amendment, as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \ncommittee amendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2228\n\n     (Purpose: To reduce the number of executive branch political \n                              appointees)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     McCain, Mr. Santorum, and Mr. Grams, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2228.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 93, below line 13, insert the following:\n       (c)(1) None of the funds appropriated by this or any other \n     Act may be obligated or expended by any Federal department, \n     agency, or other instrumentality to employ, on or after \n     January 1, 1996, in excess of a total of 2000 employees in \n     the Executive Branch who are (i) employed in a position on \n     the executive schedule under sections 5312 through 5316 of \n     title 5, United States Code, (ii) a limited term appointee, \n     limited emergency appointee, or noncareer appointee in the \n     senior executive service as defined under section 3132(a)(5), \n     (6), and (7) of title 5, United States Code, respectively, or \n     (iii) employed in a position in the executive branch of the \n     Government of a confidential or policy-determining character \n     under Schedule C of subpart C of part 213 of title 5 of the \n     Code of Federal Regulations.\n       (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (c)(1) of \n     this section, any actions required by such section shall be \n     consistent with reduction in force procedures established \n     under section 3502 of title 5, United States Code.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my good \nfriend, the Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], along with the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum], and the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. \nGrams], in offering an amendment to reduce the number of political \nemployees who are appointed by the President.\n  I understand the amendment will be accepted by the manager.\n  Specifically, the amendment caps the number of political appointees \nat 2,000, down from an estimated average of 2,800.\n  CBO estimates that this measure will save $363 million over the next \n5 years.\n  Mr. President, as the cosponsorship of this amendment attests, this \nis a bipartisan proposal.\n  It has been endorsed by Citizens Against Government Waste, and it is \nsimilar to one of the assumptions the Budget Committee of the other \nbody made in developing their concurrent budget resolution. It is also \nconsistent with the recommendations of the Vice President's National \nPerformance Review, which called for reductions in the number of \nFederal managers and supervisors, arguing that ``over-control and \nmicromanagement'' not only ``stifle the creativity of line managers and \nworkers, they consume billions per year in salary, benefits, and \nadministrative costs.''\n   Mr. President, that assessment is especially appropriate with \nrespect to political appointees.\n  Between 1980 and 1992, the number of political appointees grew by \nmore than 17 percent, over three times as fast as the total number of \nexecutive branch \n\n[[Page S11530]]\nemployees. And since 1960, political appointees have grown by a \nstartling 430 percent.\n   Mr. President, the exploding number of political appointees was a \ntarget of the 1989 National Commission on the Public Service, chaired \nby former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker.\n  As the Commission noted, Presidents must have the flexibility to \nappoint staff that are ideologically compatible. Political appointees \ncan be important sources of fresh ideas, and can bring important \nexperience from the private sector into an administration.\n  Equally as important, political appointees help ensure that \nGovernment responds to the policy priorities mandated by the electorate \nat the ballot box.\n  But, as the Volcker Commission found, far from enhancing \nresponsiveness, the growing number of Presidential appointees \n``actually undermine effective presidential control of the executive \nbranch.''\n  The Commission noted that the large number of Presidential appointees \nsimply cannot be managed effectively by any President or White House.\n  Altogether, the Volcker Commission argued that this lack of control \nand political focus ``may actually dilute the President's ability to \ndevelop and enforce a coherent, coordinated program and to hold cabinet \nsecretaries accountable.''\n  The Commission found that the excessive number of appointees are a \nbarrier to critical expertise, distancing the President and his \nprincipal assistants both from the most experienced career officials \nand the front line workers, often the best positioned to make critical \nassessments of Government policies.\n  Mr. President, the problem of distancing that was raised by the \nVolcker Commission has been chronicled by Paul Light in his book, \n``Thickening Government.''\n  Light found that the increasing number of political appointees are \narrayed in layer upon layer of management, layers that did not exist 30 \nyears ago. He found that in 1960 there were 17 layers of management at \nthe very top of Government, but by 1992, there were 32 layers.\n  Compounding the problem, Mr. President, Light notes that these 32 \nlayers do not stack neatly one on top of the other in a unified chain \nof command. Some layers come into play on some issues but not on \nothers.\n  Light asserts that ``* * * As this sediment has thickened over the \ndecades, presidents have grown increasingly distant from the lines of \ngovernment, and the front lines from them.''\n  He adds that ``Presidential leadership, therefore, may reside in \nstripping government of the barriers to doing its job effectively * * \n*''\n  Mr. President, many will recall the difficulties the current \nadministration has had in filling even some of the more visible \npolitical appointments.\n  A story in the National Journal in November 1993, focusing upon the \ndelays in the Clinton administration in filling political positions, \nnoted that in Great Britain, the transition to a new government if \nfinished a week after it begins.\n  A speedy transition is possible because British Government runs on a \nhandful of political appointees.\n  According to Paul Light, they have about one-tenth as many career \nexecutives and only five layers of management between the Minister and \nthe British equivalent of the Deputy Assistant Secretary, compared to \nmore than 16 layers here.\n  By contrast, the transition of U.S. administrations over the past 35 \nyears has seen increasing delays and logjams, and perfectly illustrate \nanother reason why the number of positions should be cut back.\n  The average length of time from inauguration to confirmation of top \nlevel executive positions has steadily risen from 2.4 months under \nPresident Kennedy, to 5.3 months under President Reagan, to 8.1 months \nunder President Bush, to 8.5 months under President Clinton.\n  The consequences of having so many critical positions unfilled when \nan administration changes can be serious.\n  In the first 2 years of the Clinton administration, there were a \nnumber of stories of problems created by delays in making these \nappointments.\n  From strained relationships with foreign allies over failures to make \nambassadorship appointments to the 2-year vacancy at the top of the \nNational Archives, the record is replete with examples of agencies left \ndrifting while a political appointment was delayed.\n  Obviously, there are a number of situations were the delays were \ncaused by circumstances beyond control of the administration.\n  The case involving the position of Surgeon General of the United \nStates is a clear example.\n  Nonetheless, it is clear that with a reduced number of political \nappointments to fill, the process of selecting and appointing \nindividuals to key positions in a new administration is likely to be \nenhanced.\n  Mr. President, let me also stress that the problem is not simply the \ninitial filling of a political appointment, but keeping someone in that \nposition over time. Between 1970 and 1986, the tenure of a political \nappointee was 20 months, even shorter for schedule C employees.\n  And in a report released last year, the General Accounting Office \nreviewed a portion of these positions for the period of 1981 to 1991, \nand found high levels of turnover--seven appointees in 10 years for one \nposition--as well as delays, usually of months but sometimes years, in \nfilling vacancies.\n  Mr. President, as I have noted before on this floor, this legislative \nproposal may not be popular with many people, both within this \nAdministration and perhaps among member of the other party who hope to \nwin back the White House in the next election.\n  I want to stress that I do not view efforts to reduce the number of \npolitical appointees to be a partisan issue. In making its \nrecommendations, the nonpartisan Volcker Commission included the very \nproposal embodied in this amendment--capping political appointees at \n2,000.\n  And, as I noted earlier, I am pleased that this amendment has \nbipartisan sponsorship.\n  Indeed, I think it adds to the credibility and merits of this \nproposal that a Democratic Senator is proposing to cut back these \nappointments at a time when there is a Democratic administration in \nplace.\n  The amendment requires this President to reduce the number of \npolitical appointees, and would obviously apply to any further \nadministration as well.\n  Mr. President, the sacrifices that deficit reduction efforts require \nmust be spread among all of us. This measure requires us to bite the \nbullet and impose limitations upon political appointments that both \nparties may well wish to retain.\n  The test of commitment to deficit reduction, however, is not simply \nto propose measure that impact someone else.\n  Mr. President, as we move forward to implement the NPR \nrecommendations to reduce the number of Government employees, \nstreamline agencies, and make government more responsive, we should \nalso right size the number of political appointees, ensuring a \nsufficient number to implement the policies of any administration \nwithout burdening the Federal budget with unnecessary, possibly \ncounterproductive political jobs.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Feingold and \nGrams in supporting this amendment.\n  The amendment would reduce the number of Presidential appointees from \naround 2,800 to 2,000.\n  The number of political appointees has been constantly increasing. \nToday there are between 2,800 and 3,000. There are approximately 570 to \n580 Presidential appointees subject to Senate confirmation, 670 \nnoncareer members of the Senior Executive Service, 100 Presidential \nappointees not subject to Senate confirmation, and over 1,700 personal \nand confidential assistants--also known as ``schedule Cs.''\n  Fifty years ago, President Roosevelt, ran the country for four terms, \ndealt with the Great Depression, and orchestrated a war with some 200 \npolitical appointees.\n  According to the Volker Report:\n\n       From 1933 to 1965, during a period of profound expansion in \n     government responsibilities, the number of cabinet and sub-\n     cabinet officers appointed by the President and confirmed by \n     the Senate doubled from 73 to 152. From 965 to the present, \n     span when the total \n\n[[Page S11531]]\n     employment and programs were more stable, that number more than tripled \n     to 573.\n\n  The Commission continues:\n\n       Typically, the increase in presidential appointments has \n     been justified as a way to prod or control reluctant \n     bureaucrats, and to speed implementation of the President's \n     agenda. Thus the operative question is not whether the \n     current number of appointees is large or small, in absolute \n     terms or in compared to the number of civilian employees. The \n     real question is whether the proliferation has in fact made \n     government more effective and more responsible to \n     presidential leadership. The Commission concludes that the \n     answer is NO.\n\n  Mr. President, I think that point is worth repeating. When this issue \nwas studies by a distinguished, bipartisan group of experts, they \nconcluded that the increased number of political appointees had not \nresulted in more effective and more responsive leadership.\n  The public believes that our Government is too large and that it is \ntoo politicized. This amendment begins to address that situation. It is \nclearly not the solution. It is only a small step, but an important \nstep.\n  I also want to point out that this is not an amendment conceived by a \nRepublican Congress to punish or hurt a Democratic Presidency. This \namendment has bipartisan support. My friend from Wisconsin who \nintroduced the amendment is from the same party as the President. And I \nhope to be in the same party of the President in 2 years. This \namendment is about creating a better Government. It has nothing to do \nwith politics.\n  Additionally, Mr. President, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, adoption of this amendment would save approximately $363 \nmillion over the next 5 years. The savings for fiscal year 1996 alone \nwould be $45 million.\n  These savings could be used for a much greater good than giving third \nand fourth tier campaign workers superfluous Federal jobs.\n  Mr. President, this is a simple amendment. It will save money and \nresult in a more streamlined executive branch. It should be adopted.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the McCain \namendment to the Treasury Postal appropriations bill. This amendment \nwould cap the number of Presidential political appointees, or schedule \nC's, at 2,000, down from the current average of 2,800.\n  Overall, the Treasury Postal appropriations bill goes a long way \ntoward fulfilling our promise of deficit reduction to the American \npeople. Senator Shelby should be commended for weeding out excessive \nand duplicative layers of bureaucracy from the Treasury Department, \nPostal Service, Executive Office of the Presidency, and several \nindependent agencies. The result is an appropriations bill that is $42 \nmillion below the House appropriation for 1996, $367 million below the \nlevel enacted for 1995, and $1.8 billion below Clinton's budget \nrequest.\n  But the McCain amendment would make this bill even better for at \nleast two reasons.\n  In terms of deficit reduction, CBO estimates that limiting the number \nof political appointees to 2,000 would save $363 million over the next \n5 years. This degree of deficit reduction will contribute to greater \neconomic benefits for all Americans, with lower interest rates \nstimulating investment, economic growth, and jobs.\n  In addition to the monetary savings this amendment would generate, \ncapping the number of political appointees in the executive branch \nwould help make Government run more efficiently and productively. In \nfact, back in 1989, the Commission on Public Service, led by former \nFederal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker, recommended limiting the \nnumber of political appointees to 2,000.\n  Even more recently, Vice President Gore's National Performance Review \nrecommends a reduction in the number of political appointees, arguing \nthat ``overcontrol and micromanagement * * * stifle the creativity of \nline managers and workers * * * [and] consume billions [of dollars] per \nyear in salary, benefits, and administrative costs.'' As a bipartisan \nsolution, the McCain amendment fits in with reform strategies advocated \nat both ends of the political spectrum.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the McCain amendment. Your vote will \nbe a vote for greater Government efficiency, deficit reduction, and \ngood economic sense.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, we have conferred with the Senator from \nWisconsin and the ranking Democrat, Senator Kerrey. We accept the \namendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2228) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2229\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to take certain actions with \n              respect to the exchange stabilization fund)\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato], for himself, Mr. \n     Dole, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Grams, Mr. Helms, Mr. \n     Murkowski, and Mr. Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2229.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     Sec.   . LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR THE PROVISION OF \n                   CERTAIN FOREIGN ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, none of the funds made available by this Act for the \n     Department of the Treasury shall be available for any \n     activity or for paying the salary of any Government employee \n     where funding an activity or paying a salary to a Government \n     employee would result in a decision, determination, rule, \n     regulation, or policy that would permit the Secretary of the \n     Treasury to make any loan or extension of credit under \n     section 5302 of title 31, United States Code, with respect to \n     a single foreign entity or government of a foreign country \n     (including agencies or other entities of that government)--\n       (1) unless the President first certifies to the Committee \n     on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the House of \n     Representatives that--\n       (A) there is no projected cost (as that term is defined in \n     section 502 of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990) to the \n     United States from the proposed loan or extension of credit; \n     and\n       (B) any proposed obligation or expenditure of United States \n     funds to or on behalf of the foreign government is adequately \n     backed by an assured source of repayment to ensure that all \n     United States funds will be repaid; and\n       (2) other than as provided by an Act of Congress, if that \n     loan or extension of credit would result in expenditures and \n     obligations, including contingent\n      obligations, aggregating more than $1,000,000,000 with \n     respect to that foreign country for more than 180 days \n     during the 12 month period beginning on the date on which \n     the first action is taken.\n       (b) Waiver of Limitations.--The President may exceed the \n     dollar and time limitations in subsection (a)(2) if he \n     certifies in writing to the Congress that a financial crisis \n     in that foreign country poses a threat to vital United States \n     economic interests or to the stability of the international \n     financial system.\n       (c) Expedited Procedures for a Resolution of Disapproval.--\n     A presidential certification pursuant to subsection (b) with \n     respect to exceeding dollar or time limitations in subsection \n     (a)(2) shall be considered as follows:\n       (1) Reference to committees--All joint resolutions \n     introduced in the Senate to disapprove the certification \n     shall be referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing and \n     Urban Affairs, and in the House of Representatives, to the \n     appropriate committees.\n       (2) Discharge of committees.--(A) If the committee of \n     either House to which a resolution has been referred has not \n     reported it at the end of 30 days after its introduction, it \n     is in order to move either to discharge the committee from \n     further consideration of the joint resolution or to discharge \n     the committee from further consideration of any other \n     resolution introduced with respect to the same matter, except \n     no motion to discharge shall be in order after the committee \n     has reported a joint resolution with respect to the same \n     matter.\n       (B) A motion to discharge may be made only by an individual \n     favoring the resolution, and is privileged in the Senate; and \n     debate thereon shall be limited to not more than 1 hour, the \n     time to be divided in the Senate equally between, and \n     controlled by, the majority leader and the minority leader or \n     their designees.\n       (3) Floor consideration in the senate.--(A) A motion in the \n     Senate to proceed to the consideration of a resolution shall \n     be privileged.\n       (B) Debate in the Senate on a resolution, and all debatable \n     motions and appeals in \n\n[[Page S11532]]\n     connection therewith, shall be limited to not more than 4 hours, to be \n     equally divided between, and controlled by, the majority \n     leader and the minority leader or their designees.\n       (C) Debate in the Senate on any debatable motion or appeal \n     in connection with a resolution shall be limited to not more \n     than 20 minutes, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the mover and the manager of the resolution, \n     except that in the event the manager of the resolution is in \n     favor of any such motion or appeal, the time in opposition \n     thereto, shall be controlled by the minority leader or his \n     designee. Such leaders, or either of them, may, from time \n     under their control on the passage of a resolution, allot \n     additional time to any Senator during the consideration of \n     any debatable motion or appeal.\n       (D) A motion in the Senate to further limit debate on a \n     resolution, debatable motion, or appeal is not debatable. No \n     amendment to, or motion to recommit, a resolution is in order \n     in the Senate.\n       (4) In the case of a resolution, if prior to the passage by \n     one House of a resolution of that House, that House receives \n     a resolution with respect to the same matter from the other \n     House, then--\n       (A) the procedure in that House shall be the same as if no \n     resolution had been received from the other House; but\n       (B) the vote on final passage shall be on the resolution of \n     the other House.\n       (5) For purposes of this subsection, the term ``joint \n     resolution'' means only a joint resolution of the 2 Houses of \n     Congress, the matter after the resolving clause of which is \n     as follows: ``That the Congress disapproves the action of the \n     President under section  (b) of the Treasury and Post Office \n     Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1996, notice of which was \n     submitted to the Congress on   .'', with the first blank \n     space being filled with the appropriate section, and the \n     second blank space being filled with the appropriate date.\n       (d) Applicability.--This section--\n       (1) shall not apply to any action taken as part of the \n     program of assistance to Mexico announced by the President on \n     January 31, 1995; and\n       (2) shall remain in effect through fiscal year 1996.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, this amendment deals with the utilization \nof the Exchange Stabilization Fund. This amendment does not deal with \nMexico specifically. It is the result of what we have learned from the \nMexican crisis and the manner in which those funds have been used. This \namendment attempts to deal with what I believe is Congress' absolute \nresponsibility. That is to say, if we are going to make American \ntaxpayers' funds available, there should be a process which gives to \nthe Congress the ability to be involved in that decision.\n  Let me give you the four main provisions. First, before using ESF, \nthe President must certify that there was no cost to the U.S. taxpayers \nand that repayment of the ESF funds is guaranteed.\n  Second, congressional approval is required before using more than $1 \nbillion of ESF funds for more than 6 months in any 1 year to a single \nforeign country.\n  Third, in extreme circumstances, the President may exceed these \nlimits if he certifies that there is a threat to vital U.S. economic \ninterests or the stability of the international financial system.\n  Fourth, Congress may disapprove of the emergency certification on an \nexpedited basis.\n  Mr. President, I have conferred with Senator Dodd and others and we \nare all in agreement with this amendment.\n  Mr. President, since February, I have repeatedly expressed my concern \nabout the President's decision to circumvent Congress to bail out \nMexico. Billions of taxpayer dollars were wasted, put in jeopardy, and \nmay ultimately be lost, because the President used the Exchange \nStabilization Fund--the ESF--in an unprecedented action to bail out \nglobal speculators.\n  We must make sure that this never happens again. This amendment is \ndesigned to protect the American taxpayers and reassert congressional \ncontrol and responsibility over the ESF. I am very pleased that \nMajority Leader Dole, and Senators Helms, Hollings, Faircloth, \nMurkowski, Domenici, and Grams, are cosponsors of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, let me briefly explain my amendment. First, when using \nESF funds, the President would be required to certify that there is no \ncost to the U.S. taxpayers from the proposed transaction and that \nrepayment of the ESF funds is guaranteed. Earlier this year, Congress \napproved this same certification requirement for ESF funds sent to \nMexico.\n  Second, this amendment would impose a $1 billion 6-month cap on the \nSecretary's unrestricted ability to use ESF funds. When the Secretary \nwants to provide more than $1 billion to a single foreign country for \nlonger than 6 months, Congress will be forced to take action.\n  Mr. President, I want to make clear that this amendment does not \noverturn the President's bailout of Mexico. Instead, this amendment \nrestores the proper role of Congress in future economic crises in \nforeign countries.\n  We must learn from the Mexican crisis. Although reasonable people may \ndisagree about the wisdom of the President's Mexican bailout, there can \nbe no doubt that the ESF should not be used to provide foreign aid.\n  Mr. President, the time has come to make sure that Presidents cannot \ncircumvent Congress through the ESF to provide foreign aid. This \namendment is the first step. The Constitution expressly provides that \nCongress must approve appropriations, including foreign aid. It is \nspelled out in article 1, section 9: ``No money shall be drawn from the \nTreasury, but in consequence of Appropriations made by Law.''\n  The Treasury Department has acknowledged that the ESF can't be used \nfor foreign aid. I quote from a recent opinion to Treasury Secretary \nRobert Rubin, from the Treasury Department's general counsel: \n``Although loans and credits are clearly permitted under the ESF, their \npurpose must be to maintain orderly exchange arrangements and a stable \nsystem of exchange rates, and not to serve as foreign aid.'' This is \nclear. The ESF can't be used by the administration as a foreign aid \npiggy bank.\n  Mr. President, the administration's use of the ESF to bail out Mexico \nwas completely unprecedented and went well beyond any previous use of \nthe ESF. The ESF was established over 60 years ago, and until this \nbailout, it operated without controversy and in compliance with its \noriginal purpose--supporting the dollar and maintaining orderly \nexchange arrangements. But this small fund, which was rarely mentioned \nand relatively unknown, quietly grew into a $40 billion slush fund that \nis beyond congressional control.\n  Mr. President, in the Mexican bailout, the administration ignored all \nprecedent and recognized use of the ESF. Prior to the Mexican bailout, \nthe largest loan to a foreign country from the ESF was $1 billion to \nMexico in 1982--and that loan was for just 10 days. Another loan to \nMexico in 1982, for 6 months, was the longest loan in the history of \nthe ESF.\n  But this year, the administration committed $20 billion of American \ntaxpayer dollars to Mexico for loans and securities guarantees \nextending up to 10 years. And the administration took this \nunprecedented action without a single vote of Congress. I want to \nemphasize again: $20 billion to a foreign country for 10 years without \na single vote of Congress. That was not the purpose of the ESF--that \nwas foreign aid, pure and simple.\n  Mr. President, my amendment would reassert Congress' rights and \nresponsibilities over the ESF. And this amendment would restore the ESF \nto its original purpose--short-term stabilization of the dollar. \nAmerican taxpayers' money in the ESF should not, and must not, be used \nas foreign aid.\n  I would also like to address the apparent lack of cooperation by the \nadministration with the House leadership. I refer my colleagues to the \nabundant correspondence between Speaker Gingrich and the White House \nthat details the problems with, and the potential violations of, the \nMexican Debt Disclosure Act. This correspondence is available from my \noffice. The recent vote in the House on Congressman Sanders' ESF \namendment clearly illustrates the frustration and outrage felt by \nCongress and the American people toward the Mexican bailout and the \nPresident's use of the ESF.\n  Mr. President, I fully recognize that the ESF is an important tool in \nthese times of rapidly changing and turbulent financial markets. This \namendment would not limit, in any way, the Secretary's ability to use \nthe ESF to stabilize the dollar. The ESF was designed to protect the \ndollar, not the Mexican peso or any other foreign currency. This \namendment will simply reassert Congress' control over the ESF while \nrestraining the Secretary's \n\n[[Page S11533]]\nunchecked ability to spend taxpayer dollars.\n  We must not allow ESF to be used to circumvent Congress' \nconstitutional authority to appropriate funds and provide foreign aid. \nCongress is the peoples' voice and the administration must not turn its \nback on the people ever again.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, Senator Kerrey and I have reviewed the \namendment and statement by Senator D'Amato. We will agree to the \namendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nproposal that our colleague from New York has fashioned. I think this \nprovision strikes a good balance between the prerogative of the \nCongress and the responsibilities of the executive branch.\n  I believe a little background on the issue we are dealing with might \nbe useful for our colleagues. This amendment relates to the Exchange \nStabilization Fund which was created by the Congress more than 60 years \nago--in 1934. Throughout that 60-year period, it has been used \nprudently in dealing with currency-related matters.\n  I know that the recent use of this fund for Mexico has brought it to \nthe attention of our colleagues. Without question the $20 billion \nassistance effort extended to Mexico is without precedent in the \nhistory of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. Prior to that instance, the \nlargest single use of the fund occurred in 1982 when Mexico was \nconfronted with another currency crisis. On that occasion the fund \nextended a very brief extension of credit totaling $1 billion.\n  Much has changed in world financial markets since 1982. There has \nbeen an explosion of growth of these markets. In 1982, for example, the \nworld equity market totalled $ 2.73 trillion. By 1993 that market had \ngrown more than 500 percent to $14 trillion. This is just one indicator \nof the magnitude of capital flows that can occur in crisis situations--\nvirtually overwhelming most domestic exchange markets. I believe that \nthese factors should be taken into account in making a judgment about \nthe recent use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund.\n  The Senator from New York has felt very strongly that the Exchange \nStabilization Fund should not be a secret foreign aid spigot. Our \ncolleague from New York is correct about that. This was not its \nintended purpose. I am not suggesting, or is our colleague from New \nYork, that has been the case.\n  The President made no secret of his intention to assist Mexico in its \neffort to address its financial crisis. To the President's credit, he \ncame to the Congress first, and asked us to be involved. For reasons we \ndo not need to go into today, that did not work out. The President \nrecognized that Congress was not going to be able to respond in a \ntimely fashion. Senator Dole, the majority leader, and the Speaker of \nthe House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich, recognized that as well. \nThey joined with the President and endorsed his decision to utilize the \nauthorities of the Exchange Stabilization Fund to assist Mexico.\n  Senator D'Amato's amendment will enable the Congress to respond more \neffectively to any future crises of this nature, if it so decides to \ninvolve itself.\n  For these reasons, I support the amendment of the Senator from New \nYork. I think this is a good proposal.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator D'Amato on this \namendment. I really believe it came as a great surprise to many \nSenators--perhaps all but him--that this fund was around there and \ncould be used. I think the time has come for us to set some legislative \nlimitations on its use, because it is a very vital fund for its \noriginally intended purposes.\n  Therefore, as in years past, we will be grateful that it will start \nto accumulate again. And clearly we will not use it without Congress \nunderstanding its use, unless it be in a minor amount of dollars. I \nthink that is good for the future of the strength of our dollar, and \nthat we stabilize other currencies around the country, which has become \na vital part of our dollar valuation.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I want to join in congratulating the \nchairman of the Banking Committee for the way in which he handled this \nissue. He was courteous enough to talk with me about it some days--even \nweeks--ago. We have been negotiating back and forth on this as to what \nwe thought would be the best way to do this. The way he has ultimately \ndecided to do this, I think, demonstrates his willingness to be open to \nsuggestion--his willingness to accept changes that are suggested.\n  I not only congratulate him on this amendment, I look forward to \nhearings on this issue before the Banking Committee, because we \nrecognize that this particular amendment will run out after one fiscal \nyear. And we probably need to have hearings to discuss the underlying \nissue. Is $1 billion the right number for the long term? Should it be \n5, 10, 2, or 6? Is 6 months the right number of months? I think for the \ntime limit, set in this amendment, the Senator has made the right \nchoice. I encourage him to look for a long-term solution to this issue \nand to schedule hearings. I look forward to participating in those.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend our colleague from Utah, as well. \nHe has been very involved in this from the very beginning and has \noffered very good, sound advice on how to proceed. I know our colleague \nfrom New York agrees with that, as well. Also, I make the point that I \nhappen to believe--and I think most of our colleagues agree here--that \nthe Secretary of the Treasury has done a good job. He had a very \ndifficult problem to grapple with and he handled it very well.\n  As I pointed out earlier, we were faced with the difficult situation \nof the Congress being unable to act quickly and with very few other \nalternatives for responding to the Mexican problem.\n  I think we have gone through a good process over the spring. Treasury \nofficials, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, \nand other experts have come up to talk about this. I think all of these \ndiscussions have had a beneficial affect on the conduct of this entire \nprocess.\n  We do not want to discourage this administration or future ones from \nresponding decisively to crises like that which confronted us with \nrespect to Mexico. I don't believe this provision does that. Rather, it \nmakes the Congress more a part of that process. Heretofore, We did not \nhave the mechanism for being a part of the process. Now we will during \nfiscal year 1996.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding and congratulate him on his \nefforts.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank Senator Dodd. I thank my colleagues from Utah \nand New Mexico for their kind words, also. I do believe that Congress, \nby not becoming part of the process, shares the responsibility and onus \nin not doing so. Congressional involvement is part of our oversight, \nand it should be. Hopefully, this legislation will lead to a permanent \nmanner in which to bring us into the process, and if we choose not to, \nso be it. But I think we should be part of that process.\n  I thank all of my colleagues for the suggestion and their help in \nbringing us to this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2229) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2230\n\n      (Purpose: To provide funding for the Advisory Commission on \n          Intergovernmental Relations, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I want to thank the managers of this bill for the \nhard work they have undertaken. I want to acknowledge that this \nCongress, Members of this Senate, and Members of the House of \nRepresentatives this year established something that is quite \nremarkable. This Congress will be known for establishing the mechanism \nto stop unfunded Federal mandates, something talked about for years. It \nhas been accomplished. It was accomplished with the passage of Senate \nbill 1 which received 90 percent positive vote in the Senate and 90 \npercent positive vote in the House of Representatives.\n  Most of the legislation is prospective, dealing with future mandates. \nThat does not mean that our job is finished. What about the existing \nmandates that have been burdening local and State governments for \nyears?\n  A key provision in the Senate bill was title 3 which said we are \ngoing to \n\n[[Page S11534]]\ntake a look at all of the existing mandates and determine which of \nthose may be duplicating the cost, which of those are obsolete, which \nof those do not make sense and ought to be taken off the books \nentirely. That report is to be accomplished by April 1 of next year, \nnot a great deal of time to get that accomplished.\n  We designated in that legislation that the Advisory Commission on \nIntergovernmental Relations would be charged with that task. They have \nbeen working on it ever since Senate bill 1 became law.\n  What is the result of that? A letter from the Advisory Commission \nstated on August 3 they are making progress on the mandate study, they \nhave already met the first two deadlines and expect to meet the \nremainder as well. They have already approved criteria published in the \nFederal Register July 6 of this year and a report on court rulings \ninvolving State and local government which was officially transmitted \nto the President and the Congress, and a copy of which is attached.\n  I raise this, Mr. President, because the House of Representatives in \ntheir companion legislation to this took an unusual action, in my \nestimation. The House determined that while we have already launched \nthis effort, while we have already asked a Commission comprised of \nMembers of the U.S. Senate, Members of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, Governors, mayors, members of State legislatures, \ncounty officials, the executive branch and private citizens, they now \nsay, ``Stop, we do not think this group ought to do this task.''\n  They say, ``We would like to provide funds of $334,000 to the Office \nof Management and Budget to carry out this task.'' I do not understand \nthat, Mr. President. I do not understand the wisdom of saying that this \ngroup, which is the exact group that helped us pass the efforts to stop \nunfunded mandates, should not be the one tasked with coming up with the \nreview of existing mandates, but instead we would like to have the \nOffice of Management and Budget take on this task.\n  Now, we discussed this again in Senate bill 1. The House set up a \ndifferent commission now. Again, we have looked at the same type of \ncommission when we discussed in Senate bill 1. An amendment was offered \nby the Senator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, which said that this \nis the group that ought to do the job, and in a vote of 88-0 this \nSenate said that is correct, this is the group.\n  Yet now we have the committee that has come forward with their \nlegislation, and they say we concur with the House. We believe that the \nfunds that were dedicated to this group for that cause ought to be \ngiven to the Office of Management and Budget. Again, I totally disagree \nwith that.\n  This amendment, Mr. President, says that this group, the Advisory \nCommission on Intergovernmental Relations, will be allowed to finish \nthe job, and it provides the funds up through April 1 to complete that \ntask. At that point, no further funds would be made available to this \ngroup.\n  The idea of telling the very people that are impacted most by \nunfunded mandates that for some reason we do not want the report from \nthem, we would rather have it from the Federal Government that has been \nimposing unfunded mandates for years, does not make sense to me.\n  That is the essence of the amendment, Mr. President. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Kempthorne-\nDorgan amendment. If we do not pass this, I think we could be looked at \nas once again doing something half-baked and ill-considered in the \nCongress that just leaves people sick when they look at it.\n  What we are doing is giving a job and at the same time we are cutting \noff the money to do the job, if we do not pass this amendment. It just \nmakes us look silly. I compliment my friend from Idaho for picking this \nup and doing something about it.\n  As he said, earlier this year we enacted the Unfunded Mandates Reform \nAct. This is historic legislation. We desired to bring balance to our \nsystem of Federalism. It was a bipartisan effort. As we all know, we \nworked many long hours here on the floor of the Senate for almost 2 \nweeks full time, morning to night, and we ultimately passed the Senate \nby a vote of 91 to 9. Huge support, both sides of the aisle.\n  It deals primarily with future mandates on both the public and \nprivate sectors. It sets up a process of consideration and analysis \nwhereby we would have a better understanding of the cost and impact of \nFederal mandates in both the legislative and regulatory process.\n  S. 1 requires cost estimates to be made. Cost estimates of \nlegislation by the Congressional Budget Office, and cost benefit \nanalysis of regulations by the agencies.\n  Now, title 3 of S. 1 sets up a series of studies on the impact of \nexisting--big difference--existing regulatory and legislative mandates \non State and local governments, and to make recommendations on how to \nreduce the burdening and improve the flexibility of these mandates.\n  Title 3 tasks this responsibility, as the Senator from Idaho said, to \nthe Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations. We authorized \n$500,000 each year for fiscal year 1995 and 1996 for them to carry out \ntheir responsibilities under the act. We expect to get back far more \nthan that $500,000 for each year in the increased efficiencies that we \nwill have result from the studies they will do.\n  Unfortunately, the question is zeroed out of the ACIR, provided no \nappropriation to complete the studies required under S. 1. We gave them \na job and cut their budget to do it, which is just a bit idiotic. Once \nagain, the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. It \njust makes us look foolish because it is foolish. What the Senator from \nIdaho is doing is correcting that situation.\n  I understand about half of ACIR's budget comes from Federal \nappropriations. The rest comes from State and local governments and \nfrom the sale of publications and services.\n  I also realize by fiscal year 1997, ACIR is hoping to become fully \nself-sustained, no longer reliant on Federal funds. That is good. I am \nglad they are moving in that direction.\n  ACIR tells us they do need $334,000 in order to complete the studies \nthat we in Congress required of them to carry out S. 1. If we do not \nprovide these funds, what we are doing is saying we have set up here \nanother unfunded mandate with the group that was supposed to be looking \ninto unfunded mandates. We will not even have the people out there to \ndo that. Ultimately, they will not be able to do the studies and make \nthe needed recommendations.\n  I believe we should live up to the commitments we made when we \nenacted S. 1. I do not think there is objection to this. I hope we have \nfull support for it and can do it unanimously. I urge my colleagues \nstrongly to support the Kempthorne-Dorgan amendment. I thank my \ncolleague from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, may I acknowledge and thank the \nSenator from Ohio, Senator Glenn, who is a strong partner in bringing \nabout Senate bill 1. It was a bipartisan effort. The same \nbipartisanship is alive and well. We should keep it going.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, Senator Kerrey and I have conferred with \nSenator Kempthorne, Senator Glenn, and others, and we are willing to \naccept the amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, our side is willing to accept the \namendment as well. The ACIR will have the same happy ending and \ncontinue the same work started by Senator Glenn and Senator Kempthorne. \nI appreciate their hard work and effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne] for himself, Mr. \n     Glenn, and Mr. Dorgan, proposes an amendment numbered 2230.\n       On page 29, line 12, strike out ``$55,907,000,'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``$55,573,000,''.\n       On page 33, insert between lines 1 and 2 the following:\n\n           Advisory Comission on Intergovernmental Relations\n\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Advisory Commission on \n     Intergovernmental Relations to carry out the provisions of \n     title III of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public \n     Law 104-4), $334,000; provided, that upon the completion of \n     the Final Report required by such title, no further Federal \n     funds shall be available for the Advisory Commission on \n     Intergovernmental Relations.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment. \n\n[[Page S11535]]\n\n  The amendment (No. 2230) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2231\n\n (Purpose: To provide that no increase in the rates of pay for Members \n of Congress shall be made in fiscal year 1996, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Domenici, the Senator from New Mexico, and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the committee \namendments are set aside.\n  It is so ordered, and the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Thompson], for himself, Mr. \n     Domenici, Mr. Pressler, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. \n     Abraham, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Ashcroft, Ms. Snowe, Mr. McCain, and \n     Mr. Grassley proposes an amendment numbered 2231.\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n       Sec.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no \n     adjustment shall be made under section 601(a) of the \n     Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 (2 U.S.C. 31) \n     (relating to cost of living adjustments for Members of \n     Congress) during fiscal year 1996.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I also ask unanimous consent the following Senators be \nlisted as cosponsors to this amendment. In addition to Senator Domenici \nand myself, Senator Pressler, Senator Hutchison, Senator D'Amato, \nSenator Abraham, Senator DeWine, Senator Ashcroft, Senator Snowe, \nSenator McCain, and Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. For several months now this body has debated many \nfundamental issues facing this country. While we still disagree on many \nof these issues, there are certain truths that are becoming readily \napparent. One is that we must get our fiscal house in order in this \ncountry if we are to avoid national bankruptcy and preserve the country \nthat we have known.\n  It is true, it has been said often--and it cannot be said too often--\nthat our national debt and interest on that debt are strangling us. We \ncannot sustain deficits endlessly in the future at the rate we have. It \nwill have its effects on savings, a detrimental effect on interest \nrates, and ultimately the long-term growth of this country. We will be \nleaving a legacy of higher interest rates and a lower standard of \nliving to future generations.\n  We are coming to agree on this basic general principle during these \ndebates, and I think we are in the beginning stages, finally, of facing \nup to these problems. We have now passed a balanced budget resolution--\nwhich will lead us to a balanced budget in the year 2002--for the first \ntime in decades in this country. The President has now acknowledged the \nseriousness of this problem. We have a great opportunity, I think, to \nwork together to solve this problem. Although we may differ on the \nmeans by which we solve it, I think we can certainly agree on the end \nthat we must all work toward.\n  I think we are also becoming more honest with the American people. I \nthink it is clearer every day. People are beginning to realize if we \nare to solve this problem, we cannot have everything exactly as we have \nhad it in years past. Sooner or later, we are going to all have to make \nsome sacrifices for the sake of our country.\n  We have seen this in nondiscretionary spending items, where we have \ncome to realize we cannot continue to have growth in some of these \nprograms at multiples of 10 percent a year. We have begun to address \nthe question of cost-of-living increases. Some of our citizens have now \nhad delays in those. Others, such as Federal workers, will be having to \nface up to this.\n  Many of us who are concerned about our national defense and the fact \nthat seemingly every time we have a major engagement in this country we \nbecome complacent, we do not keep our appropriations up. And we are \nfaced with that situation, perhaps, again.\n  But the point is that all of us are suddenly realizing everybody is \ngoing to have to pitch in. Nobody is going to get all of what they \nwant. We are going to have to make sacrifices across the board. I feel \nthere are very few Americans who are not willing to help, as long as \nthey feel they are being treated fairly and there is an across-the-\nboard addressing of the problem.\n  The amendment Senator Domenici and I offer today is based upon the \nsimple proposition that while we are asking the American people and \nleading the American people toward addressing these problems and making \nthese adjustments, we do the same thing with regard to ourselves. We \ncertainly should not be having automatic cost-of-living increases for \nthis body during this particular period of time. Automatic pay \nincreases, where we do not even have to vote on them, stick in the craw \nof the American people, and it is destructive to what we are ultimately \ntrying to do here in this body.\n  Some people will say we are not going to save all that much money by \nfreezing the automatic cost-of-living increase for the year 1996, that \nit is largely symbolic. Our response to that is that symbolism is \nimportant. It is somewhat ironic that we are the body that has to lead \nthe American people, the Congress. We have to lead the American people \ntoward these difficult choices, but we are a body not held in high \nregard by the American people. So we must do what we need to do to put \nourselves in a position of leadership. In order for us to be able to \ndeliver a message to the American people and have it be credible, the \nmessenger is going to have to have more credibility.\n  Mr. President, I think we have begun to demonstrate to the American \npeople that this body is willing to do its part. We have seen we have \nfaced up to the problems of gifts and the problems of free trips we \nhave had in this body in the past. We have seen one of the first thing \nwe did in this session of Congress was to apply the laws to ourselves \nthat have, for so many years, been applied to the American people. We \nare going to be facing up to the pension issues which will bring us \nmore into line with other Federal employees and other people in the \nprivate sector.\n  So turning down an automatic cost-of-living increase this year, I \nthink, is a part of that overall, very important picture. We are going \ndown the right road now, and I am delighted to see this amendment is \ngoing to be, apparently, agreed to, and we are not turning back at this \nstage.\n  With that, I yield to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to assure the majority leader, \nfrom everything I understand, we are not going to speak very long--very \nlong in addition to what has already been said. He need not worry about \nfiling a cloture motion or anything like that. The only speakers I \nthink are Senator Hutchison and myself.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator Dole be added as a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be open \nuntil the Senate close today for additional cosponsors who might want \nto join it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I join with Senator Thompson in a very \nsimple amendment. I think it is very basic, it is very fair. It is the \nthing we ought to do.\n  We are in the midst of a great change. Part of that change is to get \nthe Federal deficit under control and make Government smaller. In doing \nthat, we are asking a lot of people to sacrifice and we are asking that \na lot of programs be restrained, some cut, some eliminated. I think we \nmust send the right signal to the American people. We must say to them \nwe are also willing to restrain ourselves in a way that reminds us that \nwe are in an era of restraining the budget.\n  I think the best way to do that is to say we are not going to have \nany pay raises for Members of Congress in 1996.\n  The budget resolution said we would not do that for 7 years. We \ncannot do that today for 7 years. I am not sure that we should. But we \ntake it 1 year at a time, and for now we are saying, \n\n[[Page S11536]]\nconsistent with the budget resolution and our affirmations as we all \nvoted with that--that we want to get the deficit under control and be \nfair--wherein we said let us not have any pay raises, we are saying \nthat is what we want to do. No pay raises for 1996 for Members of \nCongress.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for offering this amendment. It is \na privilege to be his cosponsor. I think the managers are doing the \nright thing in accepting it. It probably will become law, thanks to \nSenator Thompson's efforts, and I think the public deserves that this \nyear.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership of the \nSenator from Tennessee, Senator Thompson, and the Senator from New \nMexico, Senator Domenici.\n  Senator Domenici, in the budget resolution, provided that there would \nbe no increases in salaries of Members of Congress until this budget is \nbalanced. I think that is a fair contract with the American people.\n  Senator Thompson today is implementing that decision and we must do \nit in every appropriations bill that comes forward. That is necessary \nfor us to show that we are going to do what every American is doing \nwhen times are hard.\n  By freezing the salaries, we can contribute to this ending of the \nbudget deficit so that our children and grandchildren will have a \nchance to grow up with the kinds of childhoods we have been able to \ngrow up in and love in America.\n  So I thank the Senator from Tennessee. I thank the Senator from New \nMexico and our leader for making sure that we are going to do the right \nthing.\n  You have seen, the American people have seen, Mr. President, you have \nseen in the last few weeks and days and hours how hard it is for us to \nmake the necessary cuts to do what is right for America. But we are \ngoing to do it. We are showing that we are going to do it, that we have \nthe commitment, that we have the tenacity, that we have the will to do \nwhat is right, no matter how hard it is, so that our children will be \nable to inherit an America that is free from debt at some point in \ntheir future so that they will not have to pay taxes so onerous that \nthey will not have the quality of life that we enjoy today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nThurmond be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, Senator Kerrey, the ranking Democrat on \nthe subcommittee, and I have agreed to take this amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, while it is true that we have already \nspent the money, I accept the amendment.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my name be \nadded as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, an essential element of leadership is to \nlead by example. I think this does that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The amendment (No. 2231) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I wanted to indicate that there will be no \nmore rollcall votes today. We have already notified the cloakrooms in \ncase somebody was not notified. We will complete action on this bill.\n  I wanted to congratulate the managers. Getting it done in one day is, \nI think, an outstanding accomplishment.\n  Then we will go back to the DOD authorization bill with the managers \ndealing with about 20 to 30 amendments that have been cleared. So \nfollowing disposition of this bill, we will go back to the DOD \nauthorization bill. It will probably take about 30 or 40 minutes to do \nthat.\n\n\n                     Authority for Enrolling Clerk\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the enrolling \nclerk be authorized to insert the Nickles amendment No. 2153 at the \nappropriate place in the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Committee Amendments Agreed to En Bloc\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee amendments to H.R. 2020 be considered and agreed to en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the committee amendments were agreed to en bloc.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no points of \norder be waived thereon and that the measure, as amended, be considered \nas original text for the purpose of further amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Amendments Nos. 2232 through 2251\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I send a group of amendments which have \nbeen cleared to the desk.\n  Mr. President, these amendments are as follows:\n  An amendment on behalf of myself and Senator Kerrey to increase the \nlimitation of funds the Secret Service can spend to secure \nnongovernmental properties; an amendment on behalf of Senator Stevens \npertaining to mail delivery in Alaska; an amendment on behalf of \nSenators D'Amato and Moynihan transferring a forfeited aircraft to a \nwar museum; an amendment on behalf of Senators Ford and McConnell \nprohibiting implementation of an ATF ruling on citrus contents in \nalcohol; an amendment on behalf of Senator Pryor striking the committee \namendment on page 15, line 5 through line 9; an amendment on behalf of \nSenators Simpson and Craig restricting IRS funds to certain tax-exempt \norganizations; an amendment for myself and Senator Kerrey allowing for \nthe Department of Treasury to reimburse the District of Columbia for \ncosts incurred as a result of the closure of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  Further, an amendment on behalf of Senator Coverdell providing $5 \nmillion for payments to States to partially cover costs of the National \nVoter Registration Act of 1993; an amendment on behalf of Senator \nBingaman prohibiting the sale of tobacco products in vending machines \nin Federal buildings; a sense-of-the-Senate amendment on behalf of \nSenator Brown on GSA supply depots; two amendments on behalf of Senator \nKerrey and myself on an IRS commission and on a Secret Service \nprotection matter; an amendment on behalf of Senator Hutchison on \nborder stations; an amendment on behalf of Senator Bingaman requiring \nenergy costs in Federal facilities; a sense of the Senate on behalf of \nSenator Brown regarding an airport issue in Colorado; an amendment on \nbehalf of Senators Hatch and Biden restoring--I have a modification on \nthe Hatch-Biden amendment--funds to ONDCP; an amendment on behalf of \nSenator Brown regarding SES leave; an amendment on behalf of Senator \nLautenberg regarding transfer of a building in Hoboken, NJ; an \namendment on behalf of Senator Grassley restoring funding for ACUS; an \namendment on behalf of Senator Mikulski regarding pay for Uniformed \nService officers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama (Mr. Shelby) proposes amendment \n     Nos. 2232 through 2251, en bloc.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n                           amendment no. 2232\n\n  Mr. SHELBY offered an amendment (No. 2232) for himself and Mr. \nKerrey.\n\n\n[[Page S11537]]\n\n       At the end of Title V, add the following new section:\n       Sec.   .

Mr. President, it is my understanding that the \nmanagers of the bill, Senators Shelby and Kerry, have accepted my \namendment, and I want to thank them for their support. However, a \nsimilar provision was included in the House Treasury, Postal Service \nappropriations bill, and I want to make my comments on this matter part \nof the Record in anticipation of the conference between the House and \nSenate.\n   Mr. President, the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government \nappropriations bill provides $13 million to ``initiate a program to \nutilize private counsel law firms and debt collection agencies in the \ncollection activities of the Internal Revenue Service.''\n  In short, this provision requires the IRS to spend $13 million to \nhire private law firms and private bill collectors to collect the debts \nof the American taxpayer. My amendment is very simple--It strikes this \nprovision from the Treasury, Postal Service appropriations bill.\n   Mr. President, in over 200 years of our Federal Government, we have \nnever turned over the business of collecting taxes to the private \nsector--But I must point out that this dubious practice is as old as \nthe hills and dates back to at least ancient Greece.\n  The practice of private tax collection even has a name. It is called \n``tax farming'', and its modern history is chronicled in a book \nauthored by Charles Adams, a tax lawyer and history teacher. The book \nis named ``For Good and Evil: The Impact of Taxes on the Course of \nCivilization.''\n  In this book, Mr. Adams recounts many tales of how the world has \nsuffered under the oppression of the tax farmers. He specifically \ndescribes the tax farmers sent by the Greek kings to the island of Cos \nas ``thugs, and even the privacy of a person's home was not secure from \nthem.'' He further notes that a respected lady of Cos around 200 B.C. \nwrote ``Every door trembles at the tax-farmers.''\n   Mr. President, in the later Greek and Roman world, no social class \nwas hated more than the tax farmer. The leading historian of the \nperiod, Rostovtzeff, described tax farmers with these words: ``The \npublican (keepers of the public house) certainly were ruthless tax \ncollectors, and dangerous and unscrupulous rivals in business. They \nwere often dishonest and probably always cruel.''\n  Tax farming flourished, as a monster of oppression in many forms, in \nWestern civilization, for over 2,500 years until its demise after World \nWar I.\n  Tax farming brutalized prerevolutionary France. The French court paid \nthe price during the Reign of Terror when the people were so incensed \nthat they rounded up the tax farmers, tried them in the people's \ncourts, and condemned them to death. Accounts of the time tell of the \ntaxpayers cheering while the heads of the tax farmers tumbled from the \nguillotine.\n  In 17th-century England, Charles II imposed a ``Hearth Tax'', \nassessing 2 shillings per chimney in each house. To collect it, the \nking contracted out with private parties--named by the people, \n``Chimney Men''. These Chimney Men were ruthless and hated by the \npeople of England. Hatred of the privately collected tax helped depose \nCharles' brother, James II. As soon as the new monarchs, William and \nMary, were installed, the House of Commons abolished the tax, ending a \n``badge of slavery upon the whole people that allowed every man's house \nto be entered and searched at the pleasure of persons unknown to him.''\n  Now, I am not suggesting that providing $13,000,000 to the IRS in \norder to contract out with private law firms and collection agencies \nwill cause anyone to actually lose their head. But, for well-reasoned \ndecisionmakers, history should be utilized as a guide as to--what is, \nand what is not--a good idea. Clearly, Mr. President, history tells us \nthat contracting out the tax collection responsibilities of government \nis not a good idea.\n  Mr. President, some very notable economists and philosophers have \nalso warned against tax farming. In his book, ``The Wealth of \nNations,'' Adam Smith states, ``The best and most frugal way of levying \na tax can never be by farm.''\n  Smith goes on to observe that ``The farmers of the public revenue \nnever find the laws too severe, which punish any attempt to evade the \npayment of tax. They have no bowels for the contributors, who are not \ntheir subjects, and whose universal bankruptcy, if it should happen the \nday after their farm is expired, would not much affect their \ninterest.''\n  Mr. President, I know there are those in this Chamber who revere Adam \nSmith, so I hope they will heed his message in ``The Wealth of \nNations.''\n  Mr. President, just as relevant to the discussion is how this \npractice may be employed in our time and by our Federal Government?\n  First, Who will these people be?\n  Second, How will they be hired?\n  Third, Who will train them?\n  Fourth, Who will oversee them?\n  Fifth, Which taxpayer's cases will they work on?\n  Sixth, What type of taxpayer information will be made available to \nthem? And,\n  Seventh, How will these private bill collectors be paid?\n  Mr. President, this legislation provides no answer to these important \nquestions--it simply provides taxpayer dollars, $13 million of them, to \nnameless, faceless, untrained, and unaccountable bill collectors with \nno guidance as to how they will be paid.\n  Let us just briefly explore two of the questions that I just \nmentioned.\n  First, what type of taxpayer information will these private bill \ncollectors have access to? The American people demand that their tax \nreturn information will be kept confidential; that it will only be \nshared with the appropriate personnel within the Government. It is an \nessential element which lends confidence in our tax system and \n\n[[Page S11538]]\nleads to a high percentage of voluntary compliance.\n  If taxpayer information is shared outside of the Government \nconfidence, how many taxpayer will decide to no longer comply? I fear \nin an effort to collect more revenues, we will collect less.\n  Second, how will these bill collectors be paid? The bill does not \nspecify the manner in which these private law firms and private \ncollection agencies will be compensated. But Mr. President, most bill \ncollectors are paid on a contingency basis--that is, they are \ncompensated on some percentage of what they collect.\n  If this is to be the case--and it is certainly a possibility under \nthis bill--this is a blatant violation of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. \nIn the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, passed in 1988, there is included a \nstrict prohibition against the IRS from using enforcement goals or \nquotas.\n  Mr. President, a contingency fee to an outside contractor is a quota, \nand if applied to the compensation of an IRS agent would be strictly \nprohibited under the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. However, there is a fatal \nproblem the drafters of this legislation have not recognized. And that \nis--the Taxpayer Bill of Rights only applies to the IRS--not outside \ncontractors. Given this loophole, I must register my strongest \nobjection to any possibility that a modern day tax farmer might be paid \non a contingency basis.\n  But this certainly will not be the only protection afforded by the \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights which does not apply to these private bill \ncollectors. For example, a reckless IRS agent can be sued under the \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights. Mr. President, no such right exists for the \ntaxpayer against a private bill collector. We must take the time to \nanalyze what other rights the taxpayer may be losing under this \nprovision.\n  Mr. President, I might also point out that we have had no hearings in \nthe Senate on this proposed practice. And, as a member of the Finance \nCommittee, I must say I am shocked that an issue so fundamental to the \nrelationship between the Government and the taxpayer has not been the \ntopic of any discussion before the members of the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. President, the IRS Commissioner raises serious questions about \nthis provision. In a letter I received today, Commissioner Richardson \noutlines her concerns. Mr. President, I ask that a copy of the \nCommissioner's statement be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I believe the IRS Commissioner's concerns are \nwarranted and we should not act until we have the answer to these \nquestions.\n  The statement follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Treasury,\n\n\n                                     Internal Revenue Service,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 4, 1995.\n     Hon. David Pryor,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pryor: I am writing to express my concern \n     regarding statutory language in the FY 1996 Appropriations \n     Committee Bill (H.R. 2020) for Treasury, Postal Service and \n     General Government that would mandate the Internal Revenue \n     Service (IRS) spend $13 million ``to initiate a program to \n     utilize private counsel law firms and debt collection \n     activities . . .'' I have grave reservations about starting \n     down the path of using private contractors to contact \n     taxpayers regarding their delinquent tax debts without \n     Congress having a thorough understanding of the costs, \n     benefits and risks of embarking on such a course.\n       There are some administrative and support functions in the \n     collection activity that do lend themselves to performance by \n     private sector enterprises under contract to the IRS. For \n     example, in FY 1994, the IRS spent nearly $5 million for \n     contracts to acquire addresses and telephone numbers for \n     taxpayers with delinquent accounts. In addition, we are \n     taking many steps to emulate the best collection practices of \n     the private sector to the extent they are compatible with \n     safeguarding taxpayer rights. However, to this point, the IRS \n     has not engaged contractors to make direct contact with \n     taxpayers regarding delinquent taxes as is envisioned in H.R. \n     2020. Before taking this step, I strongly recommend that all \n     parties with an interest obtain solid information on the \n     following key issues:\n       (1) What impact would private debt collectors have on the \n     public's perception of the fairness of tax administration and \n     of the security of the financial information provided to the \n     IRS? A recent survey conducted by Anderson Consulting \n     revealed that 59% of Americans oppose state tax agencies \n     contracting with private companies to administer and collect \n     taxes while only 35% favor such a proposal. In all \n     likelihood, the proportion of those opposed would be even \n     higher for Federal taxes. Addressing potential public \n     misgivings should be a priority concern.\n       (2) How would taxpayers rights be protected and privacy be \n     guaranteed once tax information was released to private debt \n     collectors? Would the financial incentives common to private \n     debt collection (keeping a percentage of the amount \n     collected) result in reduced rights for certain taxpayers \n     whose accounts had been privatized? Using private collectors \n     to contact taxpayers on collection matters would pose unique \n     oversight problems for the IRS to assure that Taxpayers Bill \n     of Rights and privacy rights are protected for all taxpayers. \n     Commingling of tax and non-tax data by contractors is a risk \n     as is the use of tax information for purposes other than \n     intended.\n       (3) Is privatizing collection of tax debt a good business \n     decision for the Federal Government? Private contractors have \n     none of the collection powers the Congress has given to the \n     IRS. Therefore, their success in collection may not yield the \n     same return as a similar amount invested in IRS telephone or \n     field collection activities where the capability to contact \n     taxpayers is linked with the ability to institute liens and \n     levy on property if need be. Currently, the IRS telephone \n     collection efforts yield about $26 collected for every dollar \n     expended. More complex and difficult cases dealt with in the \n     field yield about $10 for every dollar spent.\n       I strongly believe a more extensive dialogue is needed on \n     the matter of contracting out collection activity before the \n     IRS proceeds to implement such a provision. Please let me \n     know if I can provide any additional information that would \n     be of value to you as Congress considers this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                               Margaret Milner-Richardson.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2237\n\n  Mr. SHELBY offered an amendment (No. 2237) for Mr. Simpson, for \nhimself and Mr. Craig.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nH.R. 2020. My amendment is a modest one, and it is identical to one \naccepted by the Senate 2 years ago as an amendment to the fiscal year \n1994 appropriations bill for the Treasury Department, Postal Service \nand General Government. This amendment would ban tobacco vending \nmachines in Federal buildings and on Federal property accessible to \nchildren. I am reoffering my amendment for three simple reasons:\n  First, in 1993, after the Senate passed my amendment to ban tobacco \nvending machines on Federal property, the conferees failed to retain \nthe legislative language, opting instead for the following statement in \nthe fiscal year 1994 Treasury-Postal Appropriations Conference Report:\n\n       ``* * * [elimination of the provision] does not signal a \n     lack of concern for the health and safety of minors. The \n     conferees agree that locating cigarette sales vending \n     machines in areas accessible to minors poses a serious \n     problem as their presence increases the availability of \n     products which otherwise may be prohibited from sale to \n     minors. Therefore, the conferees direct the Administrator to \n     eliminate vending machines in areas which are accessible to \n     minors.''\n\n  Despite this directive, tobacco vending machines remain on Federal \nproperty and many are fully accessible to children.\n  Second, more substantively, vending machines are extremely difficult \nto monitor. Not surprisingly, they are one of the chief sources of \ncigarette purchases among children and teenagers.\n  Third, finally, every State in the country has enacted a law to \nprohibit the sale or distribution of cigarettes to minors.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to talk about each \nof the points I have listed.\n  As I mentioned, the congressional directive contained in the fiscal \nyear 1994 Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill was issued almost \n2 years ago. In those 2 years, more than 2 million children and teens \nin this country took up smoking. One-third of them--more than 600,000 \nchildren--will later die of tobacco-related causes.\n  Let me repeat that: More than 600,000 children will die because \nsometime over the past 2 years, they started to smoke. And we cannot \neven get a few cigarette vending machines out of some Federal \nbuildings.\n  Mr. President, these statistics are not exaggerations. The facts are \nwell known and widely acknowledged:\n  First, more than 420,000 people died each year from tobacco-related \ncauses, making cigarette smoking the single most preventable cause of \ndeath and disability in the United States.\n  Second, every day, more than 3,000 children and teenagers start to \nsmoke. More than two-thirds of all adult smokers had their first \ncigarette before the age of 14, and 90 percent began smoking by age 18.\n  Third, every year, minors consume 516 million packs of cigarettes, at \nleast half of which are sold illegally to children and teens.\n  Five hundred-sixteen million packs of cigarettes consumed by minors \nannually. Three thousand children starting to smoke every day. And \nevery State in this country has a law prohibiting the sale of tobacco \nproducts to minors.\n  Clearly, something is not working. It is time for a new course of \naction. Some experts argue that the wisest, most effective course of \naction would be to take the tobacco industry up on its voluntary plan \nfor reducing underage smoking and try to hold the industry to its \ncommitment.\n  Others argue that we should use this opportunity to give the Food and \nDrug Administration broader regulatory authority of tobacco products. \nThe President is currently grappling with these tough issues, and we \nexpect an announcement of his decision at any time.\n\n[[Page S11541]]\n\n  For several years, I have sponsored legislation that would \nspecifically give the FDA the authority to regulate nicotine-containing \ntobacco products. For a number of years, the Department of Health and \nHuman Services has urged States and localities to take greater \nresponsibility by, among other things, banning cigarette vending \nmachines.\n  In recent years, other Federal officials, including President Clinton \nand former President Bush, have joined the Department's appeal to \nStates and localities. In its Healthy People 2000 Report, the Public \nHealth Service encourages Indian Tribal Councils to ``similarly enforce \nprohibitions of tobacco sales to Indian youth living on reservations'' \nbecause Indian nations are sovereign and exempted from State laws.\n  I agree with the Department's previous advice. I sincerely hope that \nover the next few days or weeks the President will take a tough stand \non the issue of Federal regulation of tobacco products. I hope he will \ngo much farther than this modest bill. At the same time, I would \ncaution the President and my colleagues in the Senate not to forget the \npowerful message that ``leading by example'' can convey.\n  Mr. President, over the past several years, while the Federal \nGovernment has been urging every political body in the country to ban \ncigarette vending machines, pack after pack are loaded into--and \npurchased out of--vending machines every day in Federal buildings. \nThose buildings include the Senate and House Office Buildings and the \nOld Executive Office Building, next door to the White House.\n  It is long past time for the vending machines to go. It is time for \nthe Federal Government to lead by example. I believe that if we expect \nStates, localities, Indian Tribal leaders, schools, parents, and even \nthe tobacco industry itself, to take steps to protect our children from \ntobacco, then we in the Federal Government should join the effort. We \nshould lead the effort. We can begin with passage of this amendment.\n  Thank you.\n                           amendment no. 2240\n\n  Mr. SHELBY offered an amendment (No. 2240) for Mr. Brown:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n       Sec.   . It is the sense of the Senate that the General \n     Services Administration should increase use of direct \n     delivery for high-dollar value supplies and only stock items \n     that are profitable, that after these changes are \n     implemented, the General Services Administration should phase \n     out the supply depots that are no longer economically \n     justifiable or needed.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, there is included in this bill a request to \nlook at the policies of the General Services Administration in \nsupplying some 18,000 commonly used products and supplies that are \nresold to the agencies and various depots of the Federal Government. \nHere are the numbers.\n  When the GSA delivers products directly, their markup is 10 percent. \nWhen they go through one of the depots though, that is, simply \nprocessing through a depot, their markup is 29 percent.\n  What we urge is that they reexamine their policy and deliver directly \nwhere possible. There is a 19 percent net savings to the taxpayer if \nthey follow that procedure.\n  I yield back, Mr. President.\n                           amendment no. 2241\n\n  Mr. SHELBY offered an amendment (No. 2241) for himself and Mr. \nKerrey:\n\n  (Purpose: To establish the National Commission on Restructuring the \n                       Internal Revenue Service)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . NATIONAL COMMISSION ON RESTRUCTURING THE INTERNAL \n                   REVENUE SERVICE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) While the budget for the Internal Revenue Service \n     (hereafter referred to as the ``IRS'') has risen from $2.5 \n     billion in fiscal year 1979 to $7.5 billion in fiscal year \n     1996, tax returns processing has not become significantly \n     faster, tax collection rates have not significantly \n     increased, and the accuracy and timeliness of taxpayer \n     assistance has not significantly improved.\n       (2) To date, the Tax Systems Modernization (TSM) program \n     has cost the taxpayers $2.5 billion, with an estimated cost \n     of $8 billion. Despite this investment, modernization efforts \n     were recently described by the GAO as ``chaotic'' and ``ad \n     hoc''.\n       (3) While the IRS maintains the TSM will increase \n     efficiency and thus revenues, Congress has had to appropriate \n     additional funds in recent years for compliance initiative in \n     order to increase tax revenues.\n       (4) Because TSM has not been implemented, the IRS continues \n     to rely on paper returns, processing a total of 14 billion \n     pieces of paper every tax season. This results in an \n     extremely inefficient system.\n       (5) This lack of efficiency reduces the level of customer \n     service and impedes the ability of the IRS to collect \n     revenue.\n       (6) The present status of the IRS shows the need for the \n     establishment of a Commission which will examine the \n     organization of IRS and recommend actions to expedite the \n     implementation of TSM and improve service to taxpayers.\n       (b) Composition of the Commission.--\n       (1) Establishment.--To carry out the purposes of this \n     section, there is established a National Commission on \n     Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service (in this section \n     referred to as the ``Commission'').\n       (2) Composition.--The Commission shall be composed of \n     twelve members, as follows:\n       (A) Four members appointed by the President, two from the \n     executive branch of the Government and two from private life.\n       (B) Two members appointed by the Majority Leader of the \n     Senate, one from Members of the Senate and one from private \n     life.\n       (C) Two members appointed by the Minority Leader of the \n     Senate, one from Members of the Senate and one from private \n     life.\n       (D) Two members appointed by the Speaker of the House of \n     Represtatives, one from Members of the House of \n     Representatives and one from private life.\n       (E) Two members appointed by the Minority Leader of the \n     House of Representatives, one from Members of the House of \n     Representatives and one from private life.\n     The Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service shall be an \n     ex officio member of the Commission.\n       (3) Chairman.--The Commission shall elect a Chairman from \n     among its members.\n       (4) Meeting; quorum, vacancies.--After its initial meeting, \n     the Commission shall meet upon the call of the Chairman or a \n     majority of its members. Seven members of the Commission \n     shall constitute a quorum. Any vacancy in the Commission \n     shall not affect its powers, but shall be filled in the same \n     manner in which the original appointment was made.\n       (5) Appointment; initial meeting.--\n       (A) Appointment.--It is the sense of the Congress that \n     members of the Committee should be appointed not more than 60 \n     days after the date of the enactment of this section.\n       (B) Initial meeting.--If, after 60 days from the date of \n     the enactment of this section, seven or more members of the \n     Commission have been appointed, members who have been \n     appointed may meet and select a Chairman who thereafter shall \n     have the authority to begin the operations of the Commission, \n     including the hiring of staff.\n       (c) Functions of Commission.--\n       (1) In general.--The functions of the Commission shall be--\n       (A) to conduct, for a period of one year from the date of \n     its first meeting, the review described in paragraph (2), and\n       (B) to submit to the Congress a final report of the results \n     of the review, including recommendations for restructuring \n     the IRS.\n       (2) Review.--The Commission shall review--\n       (A) the present practices of the IRS, especially with \n     respect to--\n       (i) its organizational structure;\n       (ii) its paper processing and return processing activities;\n       (iii) its infrastructure; and\n       (iv) the collection process;\n       (B) requirements for improvement in the following areas:\n       (i) making returns processing ``paperless'';\n       (ii) modernizing IRS operations;\n       (iii) improving the collections process without major \n     personnel increases or increased funding;\n       (iv) improving taxpayer accounts management;\n       (v) improving the accuracy of information requested by \n     taxpayers in order to file their returns; and\n       (vi) changing the culture of the IRS to make the \n     organization more efficient, productive, and customer-\n     oriented;\n       (C) whether the IRS could be replaced with a quasi-\n     governmental agency with tangible incentives for internally \n     managing its programs and activities and for modernizing its \n     activities, and\n       (D) whether the IRS could perform other collection, \n     information, and financial service functions of the Federal \n     Government.\n       (d) Powers of the Commissioner.--\n       (1) In general.--(A) The Commission or, on the \n     authorization of the Commission, any subcommittee or member \n     thereof, may, for the purpose of carrying out the provisions \n     of this section--\n       (i) hold such hearings and sit and act at such times and \n     places, take such testimony, receive such evidence, \n     administer such oaths, and\n       (ii) require, by subpoena or otherwise, the attendance and \n     testimony of such witnesses and the production of such books, \n     records, correspondence, memoranda, papers, and documents.\n\n     as the Commission or such designated subcommittee or \n     designated member may deem advisable.\n       (b) Subpoenas issued under subparagraph (A)(ii) may be \n     issued under the signature of the Chairman of the Commission, \n     the chairman of any designated subcommittee, or any \n     designated member, and may be served by \n\n[[Page S11542]]\n     any person designated by such Chairman, subcommittee chairman, or \n     member. The provisions of sections 102 through 104 of the \n     Revised Statutes of the United States (2 U.S.C. 192-194) \n     shall apply in the case of any failure of any witness to \n     comply with any subpoena or to testify when summoned under \n     authority of this section.\n       (2) Contracting.--The Commission may, to such extent and in \n     such amounts as are provided in appropriation Acts, enter \n     into contracts to enable the Commission to discharge its \n     duties under this section.\n       (3) Information from federal agencies.--The Commission is \n     authorized to secure directly from any executive department, \n     bureau, agency, board, commission, office, independent \n     establishment, or instrumentality of the Government \n     information, suggestions, estimates, and statistics for the \n     purposes of this section. Each such department, bureau, \n     agency, board, commission, office, establishment, or \n     instrumentality shall, to the extent authorized by law, \n     furnish such information, suggestions, estimates, and \n     statistics directly to the Commission, upon request made by \n     the Chairman.\n       (4) Assistance from federal agencies.--(A) The Secretary of \n     State is authorized on a reimbursable or nonreimbursable \n     basis to provided the Commission with administrative \n     services, funds, facilities, staff, and other support \n     services for the performance of the Commission's functions.\n       (B) The Administrator of General Services shall provide to \n     the Commission on a reimbursable basis such administrative \n     support services as the Commission may request.\n       (C) In addition to the assistance set forth in subparagraph \n     (A) and (B), departments and agencies of the United States \n     are authorized to provide to the Commission such services, \n     funds, facilities, staff, and other support services as they \n     may deem advisable and as may be authorized by law.\n       (5) Postal services.--The Commission may use the United \n     States mails in the same manner and under the same conditions \n     as departments and agencies of the United States.\n       (e) Staff of the Commission.--\n       (1) In general.--The Chairman, in accordance with rules \n     agreed upon by the Commission, may appoint and fix the \n     compensation of a staff director and such other personnel as \n     may be necessary to enable the Commission to carry out its \n     functions, without regard to the provisions of title 5, \n     United States Code, governing appointments in the competitive \n     service, and without regard to the provisions of chapter 51 \n     and subchapter III of chapter 53 of such title relating to \n     classification and General Schedule pay rates, except that no \n     rate of pay fixed under this subsection may exceed the \n     equivalent of that payable\n      to person occupying a position at level V of the Executive \n     Schedule under section 5316 of title 5, United States \n     Code.

Mr. President, I am offering an amendment today to \nrestructure the IRS. Senator Shelby and I closely examined the IRS \nduring creation of the Treasury-Postal Service fiscal year 1996 budget, \nand during this examination, I made the following observations.\n  IRS funding has increased from $2 billion in 1979 to $7.5 billion in \nfiscal year 1995, and fiscal year 1996 funding for the IRS is projected \nto increase by $800 million.\n  Because of growing entitlement spending, discretionary spending will \nbecome increasingly limited. The IRS budget comprises 70 percent of the \nTreasury-Postal Service Appropriations Subcommittee allocation, and the \ncommittee has expressed its concern that both the IRS and other \nimportant accounts will be substantially cut because of future \nbudgetary constraints. Due to increasing entitlement spending, Congress \nsimply will not have the funds in fiscal year 1997 and beyond to \nincrease the budget of the IRS.\n  Despite an increase of $5 billion in the IRS' budget since 1979, tax \nreturns processing has not become significantly faster, tax collection \nrates have not significantly increased, and taxpayer assistance \nactivities have not significantly improved.\n  The IRS, aware of inefficient computer systems that impede their \nability to collect revenue, has asked for almost $2.5 billion since \n1979 for tax systems modernization [TSM]. This funding was intended to \nupdate the IRS computer systems so that the IRS could achieve its \nvision of a highly efficient, virtually paper-free work environment.\n  The desired outcomes of TSM have not been achieved, and IRS' ability \nto properly plan and manage this $7.5 billion tax systems modernization \nprogram has been repeatedly questioned by the General Accounting Office \nand the Congress. GAO recently described TSM as ``ad hoc'' and \n``chaotic.''\n  The failure to successfully implement TSM has occurred for a number \nof reasons. The GAO attributes this failure to ``pervasive management \nand technical weaknesses'' in the IRS. Two specific possibilities that \nexplain the failure of TSM:\n  First, the IRS employs some 115,000 personnel and the current \norganizational structure seems to breed a culture which is averse to \nchange, and the IRS has not made efforts to provide incentives to \nchange this culture;\n  Second, the IRS does not have a comprehensive business strategy to \nplan, build, and operate its information systems. Notably absent is a \ncost-benefit\n analysis and performance measure of systems.\n\n  A key element of a successful TSM is taxpayer conversion to \nelectronic filing. Because the IRS has not sufficiently encouraged the \nuse of electronic returns, the IRS remains overwhelmed with paper \nreturns. It processes 200 million paper returns per year, or 14 billion \npieces of paper, and this number continues to grow. The dependence on \npaper returns contributes substantially to the IRS' inefficiency in \nprocessing returns, and the IRS often cannot retrieve documents from \nthe over 1.2 billion tax returns in storage.\n  According to GAO, because the IRS lacks a comprehensive business \nstrategy to encourage electronic submissions, only 17 million \nelectronic returns are expected in fiscal year 1995, a far cry from the \ngoal of 80 million electronic returns by fiscal year 2001. Electronic \nreturns are a crucial part of the conversion to a modern systems.\n  Originally, the IRS claimed that investing in TSM would increase \nrevenues because the increased efficiency would allow resources to be \ndiverted to compliance initiatives. But in order to continue increasing \nrevenue, Congress has provided additional increases for the IRS \ntotaling $1.3 billion since 1990 for enhanced revenue compliance \ninitiatives. Increases in revenue collection have resulted from hiring \nof additional call collectors, revenue officers, agents, and \nexamination audit personnel rather that redistributed resources due to \nmodernization. Additionally, despite these revenue compliance \ninitiatives, audit coverage rates have declined.\n  The failure of the IRS to implement TSM and their increased attention \nto compliance initiatives results in an agency that pays very little \nattention to taxpayer service. If people have the facts, they will pay \nthe tax. Consequently, taxpayer confidence in the IRS's ability to \nprovide accurate and timely information in response to their requests \nhas continued to decline over the past 10 years. \n\n[[Page S11543]]\n\n  Fully modernized systems would substantially increase revenues \nthrough compliance initiatives because IRS workers could instantly \naccess taxpayer information and identify accounts receivable, and in \naddition, information for audits and fraud identification would be \nreadily accessible, Further, the Congress believes that voluntary \ncompliance would increase if IRS employees could assist taxpayers with \naccurate and timely information on their accounts. A 7-percent increase \nin voluntary compliance is estimated to increase revenues by as much as \n$40 billion a year.\n  With the successful completion of modernization, the IRS could expand \nits functions and perform other services that would benefit the public, \nin areas such as the collection of delinquent child support payments \nand student loans. The IRS should soon have the capability to fulfill \nother financial services functions besides revenue collection for the \nFederal Government.\n  IRS brings in $1.2 trillion per year in tax revenue. It is an \nimportant Federal agency with the potential to be a quasi-Government \nagency with profit incentives while still protecting taxpayer privacy.\n  Many changes come with modernization efforts and increased \ntechnological capability. While the Congress acknowledges the efforts \nthe IRS has made to correct the problems identified, both the IRS and \nthe taxpayers would benefit if restructuring of the IRS took place for \nthe sake of expediently implementing TSM and better serving the \ntaxpayer.\n                           amendment no. 2242\n\n  Mr. SHELBY offered an amendment (No. 2242) for himself and Mr. \nKerrey.\n\n       At the end of Title V, add the following new section:\n       Sec. 2. Section 5542 of title 5, United States Code is \n     amended by adding the following new subsection at the end:\n       ``(e) Notwithstanding subsection (d)(1) of this section, \n     all hours of overtime work scheduled in advance of the \n     administrative workweek shall be compensated under subsection \n     (a) if that work involves duties as authorized by section \n     3056(a) of title 18 United States Code and if the \n     investigator performs, on that same day, at least 2 hours of \n     overtime work not scheduled in advance of the administrative \n     workweek.''\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, this amendment makes a technical \ncorrection to the 1995 Law Enforcement Availability Pay Act. The Pay \nAct, which was included as a separate section in the Fiscal Year 1995 \nTreasury Appropriations Act, commonly referred to as LEAP, contained a \nprovision which amended section 5542 of title 5. This provision \nrequires that the first 2 hours of scheduled overtime work by criminal \ninvestigators be calculated against availability pay hours, authorized \nunder the act.\n  The issue relating to the calculation of work hours for scheduled \novertime compensation has been an issue of contention for certain \nagencies and criminal investigators alike. The current section, as \nwritten, is overly restrictive and inflexible and, thus, increases the \npotential for litigation.\n  The provision, as stated in a letter received from the Federal Law \nEnforcement Officers Association, is unfair and does not adequately \nreflect the intent of Congress. The author of this legislation, Senator \nDennis DeConcini, attempted to clarify congressional intent in a \nDecember 1994 floor statement.\n  Despite this clarification by the amendment's sponsor, personnel \nregulations have gone unchanged.\n  Flexibility is needed for the unusual circumstances surrounding \nSecret Service specific physical security assignments which will become \nextraordinarily demanding during the upcoming Presidential campagin and \nthe United Nations General Assembly's 50th anniversary. In light of \nthese upcoming demands it is imperative that flexibility to agency \nmanagement and fairness to the agents be provided, as was originally \nintended by Congress. This amendment only applies to the unique \ncircumstances surrounding Secret Service physical protection \nactivities.\n  The Pay Act, resulted in over $40 million in savings in fiscal year \n1995 to Federal law enforcement agencies. It also prevented hundreds of \nmillions of dollars from being spent on litigation by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  It was endorsed by Federal law enforcement agencies, the Office of \nManagement and Budget, and respected law enforcement associations.\n  In order to ensure that this legislation does what it was intended to \ndo, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n                           amendment no. 2243\n\n  Mr. SHELBY offered an amendment (No. 2243) for Mrs. Hutchison.\n\n    (Purpose: To require the Administrator of the General Services \n    Administration to report to Congress on border station leasing \n                             arrangements)\n     ``SEC. --.

Mr. President, with the passage of NAFTA, cities and \ntowns along the border are increasingly interested in expanding the \nopportunities for trade and economic growth. An essential factor in \nthis growth is the presence of new or expanded border stations at new \nriver or land border crossings. These stations house agents of the U.S. \nCustoms Service, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the \nDepartment of Agriculture. New or expanded facilities are essential in \nencouraging trade and in meeting the objectives and dreams of NAFTA.\n  The normal procedure for the construction of border stations is for \nthe General Services Administration to build and own them. The \nrationale is that these buildings are long-term investments of the \nFederal Government and Federal ownership is the most cost-effective \nform of ownership. Up to now the funding for these projects has come \nthrough two channels. One is the congressionally authorized Southwest \nBorder Station Capital Improvement Program started in 1988. It has \nfunded improvements along the southern border. The other is for the \nU.S. Customs Service, the INS, the Department of Agriculture to provide \nGSA with a list annually of desired border station projects. They are \nthen included in GSA's capital budget. Both methods were successful \nprior to the passage of NAFTA in meeting the need for border station \nfacilities in a manner that, if not always as timely as desired by \nState and local governments and private sponsors, did provide funding.\n  Three events have changed the situation: First, increased demand for \nnew border crossings. The passage of NAFTA has increased the importance \nof trade with Mexico and Canada as a source of jobs and income. This \nhas caused towns and cities on both sides for the border to seek \nadditional border crossings in order to accommodate expected future \ntraffic.\n  Second, reduced Federal funding for construction. Budget cuts are \nreducing the funds available for new construction, including border \nstations. GSA is under pressure to reduce construction projects by \nhundreds of millions of dollars.\n  Third, reduced Federal flexibility to meet the demand for new \nstations. Because of budget scoring rules introduced under the Omnibus \nBudget Reconciliation Act of 1990, GSA cannot economically lease a \nborder station. If a local government or sponsor is willing to build \nand lease the facility to GSA for 20 years, GSA under the new scoring \nrules must provide all the money up front for the stream of payments \nover the 20-year period. This makes the leasing alternative as \nexpensive as new construction in a time of reduced budgets. GSA cannot \nspread the cost over 20 years, even though they can lease the border \nstation. No homeowner would be able to afford a mortgage if these rules \napplied. This is particularly frustrating to local sponsors since many \nare willing to lease the stations and then give them to GSA after the \nlease term.\n\n[[Page S11544]]\n\n\n\n                         realities and remedies\n\n  NAFTA is a reality--the demand for new crossing will not diminish, \nbut increase.\n  Federal budget reduction is a reality--the availability of Federal \nfunds for border stations is not increasing, but diminishing.\n  The budget scoring of leasing transactions for border stations is the \nconsequence of much broader issues that Congress and the administration \nwere dealing with that had nothing to do with border stations.\n  Changing the scoring rules for border stations resolves the problem.\n  Under this language, the Administrator of General Services will \nreport on leasing arrangements whereby the GSA can enter into lease \nwith State and local governments, as well as private sponsors, for the \nconstruction of border stations for a period of up to 30 years. The \nlanguage provides that such a report will acknowledge that at the end \nof the lease term the Federal Government owns the border stations.\n                           amendment no. 2244\n\n  Mr. SHELBY offered an amendment (No. 2244) for Mr. Bingaman.\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, I rise today to propose an amendment, on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Biden, which will restore funding for the \nOffice of National Drug Control Policy, better known as the ``drug \nczar's office.''\n  The amendment funds the drug czar's modest budget--$9.3 million--\nwithout cutting a single dollar from law enforcement.\n  The issue this amendment presents to the Senate is whether, in the \nabsence of any Presidential leadership in the drug war, can our Nation \nafford to eliminate the drug czar's office? Certainly not.\n  The success of the war against drugs rests with the Command in Chief. \nSadly, we have not had strong Presidential leadership in this anti-drug \nfight from President Clinton.\n  Through the 1980's and into the 1990's we saw dramatic reductions in \ncasual drug use brought about through increased penalties, strong \nPresidential leadership, and a clear national anti-drug message. Casual \ndrug use dropped by more than half between 1977 and 1992.\n  Under President Clinton's leadership, however, we are losing ground. \nOver the past 2 years, almost every available indicator shows that \nthese gains have either stopped or been reversed.\n  The most recent edition of the National High School Survey reported a \nsecond year of sizable increases in drug use among our Nation's 8th, \n10th, and 12th graders. Use of marijuana, LSD, and other drugs is on \nthe rise, and young people are less worried about the dangers of drug \nuse.\n  Last year's National Household Survey on Drug Abuse showed an \nincrease in drug use after consistent declines--in many cases dating as \nfar back as 1979.\n  More than 2 years ago, one well-known columnist described President \nClinton's leadership role in developing and promoting a strong anti-\ndrug policy as: ``No leadership. No role. No \n\n[[Page S11545]]\nalerting. No policy.'' [A.M. Rosenthal, N.Y. Times, March 26, 1993]. \nSadly, what was true in 1993 is still true today.\n  President Clinton has abandoned many of the drug control efforts \nundertaken by his immediate predecessors. He has abandoned the bully \npulpit to divisive voices.\n  President Clinton himself rarely speaks out against drug abuse--he \nhas not given a major speech on the subject in more than a year and a \nhalf--and he offers little, if any, moral support or leadership to \nthose fighting the drug war in America or abroad. His former Surgeon \nGeneral, for example, repeatedly called for consideration of drug \nlegalization.\n  President Clinton has also cut Federal efforts to keep drugs from \nflowing into our cities and States.\n  Last year, President Clinton ordered a massive reduction in Defense \nDepartment support for interdiction efforts that have been preventing \nbulk shipments of drugs from reaching American streets.\n  The administration proposed deep cuts to the drug control budgets of \nthe Defense Department, Customs, and the Coast Guard. Cocaine seizures \nplummeted. U.S. Customs cocaine seizures in the transit zone dropped 70 \npercent; and Coast Guard cocaine seizures are off by more than 70 \npercent.\n  The administration also accepted a one-third cut in resources to \nattack the cocaine trade in the source and transit countries of South \nAmerica.\n  Domestic marijuana eradication efforts led by the Federal Government \nhave been substantially reduced. And finally, the Clinton \nadministration has injured cooperative efforts with source country \ngovernments, such as when it ordered the United States military to stop \nproviding radar tracking of drug-trafficking aircraft to Columbia and \nPeru.\n  Having gutted our Federal efforts to stop drugs from arriving here, \nPresident Clinton has hamstrung efforts to deal effectively with them \nonce they hit our streets. Upon taking office, President Clinton \npromoted the drug czar to Cabinet level, but then slashed the drug \nczar's staff by 80 percent.\n  The President allowed the DEA to lose 198 drug agents over 2 years. \nThe President also proposed a fiscal year 1994 budget that would have \ncut 621 further drug enforcement positions from the FBI, the DEA, the \nINS, Customs, and the Coast Guard.\n  The Clinton administration claimed it was implementing a so-called \ncontrolled shift in Federal drug policy. Instead, President Clinton \nappears to have adopted a reckless abdication drug policy.\n  This lack of leadership surrendered for a time much of our previous \ninternational intelligence capability to the drug cartels; it\n retreats on tough law enforcement efforts; subjects Federal law \nenforcement to unprecedented personnel reductions; and weakens Federal \nprosecution of drug offenders.\n\n  Mr. President, this failed Presidential record is why we need to \npreserve the drug czar's office. Congress needs to be able to hold this \nPresident accountable for being invisible on the drug issue.\n  Some may wonder why a fiscal conservative like myself would be \nadvocating more money for any Federal office. I am not known as one who \nbelieves in preserving bureaucracy.\n  So, then, why am I sponsoring this amendment?\n  Because, Mr. President, we must not give the American people the \nimpression that this Congress condones President Clinton's abdication \nof responsibility.\n  Perhaps A.M. Rosenthal put it best when he wrote in yesterday's New \nYork Times that:\n\n       Mr. Clinton's leadership has sometimes seemed to us anti-\n     drug types as ranging from absent to lackadaisical. But for \n     Congress to hobble the war by wiping out its coordinator \n     seems a strange way of inspiring the President or the \n     country, [New York Times, August 4, 1995].\n\n  Mr. President, drugs are killing our country. They are contributing \nto a wide range of devastating effects on all Americans, particularly \nour children and youth. Drugs contribute to crime, the break-up of \nmarriages and families, lower productivity in the workplace, and many \nother societal problems.\n  If President Clinton does not take the drug issue seriously, someone \nhas to. Today, Mr. President, that someone is, I hope, each one of us.\n  If the drug office is dismantled, and responsibility is diluted among \nthe 50-plus departments and agencies involved in drug control, then the \nPresident will be able to evade accountability.\n  No one will be in charge, no one will be responsible, and instead of \nthe current lack of aggressiveness--which by the way can be fixed if \nthe White House wants to fix it--we will have institutionalized drift.\n  Even William Bennett, hardly a friend of government spending or close \nally of the Clinton administration, has conveyed to me that he supports \nkeeping the office open.\n  Obviously, Lee Brown and I have a major differences about what is and \nwhat isn't an effective drug strategy. At the same time, I want to \nemphasize that those differences are differences of policy and \napproach. Notwithstanding our differences, at least Director Brown is \nthe one person in this White House who seems to care about the drug \nissue. I don't believe we should punish the administration's poor \npolicies by eliminating the office of its only Presidential \ncoordinator.\n  Let me draw an analogy. Last week, an overwhelming majority of the \nSenate went on record as being opposed to the Clinton administration's \nfailed policy of lack of leadership in Bosnia.\n  Yet, although the Senate differed with the President's policy, no one \nseriously suggested eliminating the National Security Council, which \nhas been formulating administration policy. A move to cut the NSC would \nhave been called shortsighted.\n  Why then is such a proposal to eliminate the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy and less shortsighted when it comes to our Nation's drug \npolicy?\n  To those who think the drug czar's office needs to be reorganized, \nand who are concerned at reports of excessive travel spending, I share \nyour concerns.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee will be looking at changes to the drug \nczar's staffing and mission, and the pending Hatch-Biden amendment will \nrequire an independent audit of the drug czar's travel spending and \nsecurity budget.\n  If we are to succeed in the drug war, we need Presidential \nleadership. In the absence of such leadership, we need a drug czar all \nthe more.\n  President Clinton has failed to stand behind his drug czar. Congress \nshould not reward him for doing so by eliminating this office.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr President, the drug office provides the accountability \nand single point of contact necessary for Congress to exercise \noversight of Federal drug strategy.\n  The drug strategy and the drug budget provides the only single \ndocument that details our national drug strategy.\n  When he was Director, William Bennett testified before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee in February 1990:\n\n       [A] year ago [before drug office was law], if you had asked \n     for a comprehensive picture of national drug policy, you had \n     to go to over 30 different agencies. Not anymore. William \n     Bennett, testimony, February 2, 1990.\n\n  Also, this is not a debate about the drug strategy. This is a debate \nabout whether we have a drug strategy.\n  I disagreed with elements of the strategy proposed by Director \nBennett, Director Martinez, and Acting Director Walters. But, if we did \nnot have a drug strategy, we could never have had a drug policy debate.\n  To illustrate this point, I would point out that there are 85 \ndepartments, agencies, offices, and bureaus that make up the Federal \nantidrug effort. The drug director is the only person who is dedicated \nfull time to bringing any order to this effort.\n  This year the Federal Government will spend $13.3 billion fighting \nagainst drugs. The President proposes that we spend $14.6 billion next \nyear. I do not want to debate the specifics of the drug strategy.\n  My point is that with so much money being spent, we ought to be able \nto debate how we are going to spend these dollars. And, we can only \ndebate if there is a policy for us to discuss. And there is only a drug \npolicy if we have a drug strategy.\n  This amendment serves one central purpose: To make sure that we have \na full-time general in command of our war on drugs.\n\n[[Page S11546]]\n\n  Although drugs have dropped off of the media's radar screen for the \nmoment, we cannot be lulled into a sense of complacency on this issue. \nDrug-related violence still shatters the night in cities, towns, and \nrural hamlets all across the country; hard-core addicts roam the \nstreets in as great numbers as ever; and the recent surveys by the \nNational Institute on Drug Abuse tell us that teenagers may be \nforgetting the lessons we have taught them over the past few years: Use \nof marijuana, LSD, and inhalants is on the rise among our young people.\n  This is no time to eliminate the drug office--we must redouble our \nefforts. We must bolster, not obstruct our Nation's ability to develop \nand mount an all-out attack on the drug scourge.\n  I am gratified that the Senate has worked in a bipartisan fashion to \ncontinue--and bolster--the Office of National Drug Control Policy.\n         to preserve the office of national drug control policy\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I strongly oppose the provision in this bill that would \neliminate the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and in support of \nthe Hatch-Biden amendment to restore most of the funding for this \noffice.\n  I am pleased that the managers have agreed to accept this important \nimprovement in the bill.\n  Despite considerable progress over the past decade, drug abuse is \nstill rampant in the United States, and continues to have catastrophic \nsocial consequences. Drug abuse hurts worker productivity, increases \nhealth care costs, and has burdened the Nation's criminal justice \nsystem to the breaking point. It remains a major concern of parents and \ncommunity leaders throughout the country.\n  Let's remember why we authorized appointment of a drug czar in the \nfist place. In 1988, we passed comprehensive antidrug legislation. We \nenacted tougher sentences for drug crimes, broadened drug interdiction \nefforts, and increased funding for treatment and prevention.\n  We also recognized that throwing money at the drug problem was not \nthe answer. Instead, we needed a coordinated national strategy to wage \nthe drug war. We wanted to be tough on drugs, but we also wanted to be \nsmart on drugs. That's why the 1988 bill created the Office of National \nDrug Control Policy, known as the drug czar's Office.\n  The drug czar has not been able to close every open-air drug market. \nHe has not eliminated every waiting list for drug treatment. He has not \ncut off the flow of drugs from South America. But he has helped to \nfocus the attention of the country, and his fellow Cabinet members, on \nthe impact of drug abuse.\n And he has helped to marshal and prioritize Federal resources to wage \na more effective battle against drugs.\n\n  The pending bill would turn back the clock and eliminate the drug \nczar's office. I disagree with that decision, and I am especially \ndisturbed at the lack of consideration accompanying it.\n  There have been no hearings in the Judiciary Committee. Indeed the \ncommittee is united in support of the Hatch-Biden amendment to preserve \nthe Office.\n  The report accompanying this bill contains a bare two paragraphs of \nexplanation: the appropriations subcommittee says that ``[d]rugs and \ndrug-related violence remain the scourge of our Nation. The committee \nis very concerned that the administration has moved the war on drugs \nfrom a top priority, and that is reflected by this Office's \ninvisibility. The committee believes that the funding provided to \noperate this Office can be far better utilized on the front lines and \nhas taken action accordingly.''\n  The logic of that argument escapes me. If the subcommittee believes \nthat the drug czar has been insufficiently visible, why eliminate his \noffice? If drugs are the scourge of the Nation, why eliminate the \nOffice that coordinates the Federal antidrug effort? The $9 million \nused to fund the Office is less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the \nantidrug budget, and adding that sum to the front-line effort won't \nmake a bit of difference.\n  But eliminating the Office would gravely undermine the goal of \ncoordination and send precisely the wrong message to parents and \nteenagers. Our allies around the world who argue that the United States \nneeds to do more, not less, to reduce its demand for drugs would be \nshocked if we took such action.\n  In contrast to the sketchy treatment of this subject in the Senate \nreport, the report of the House subcommittee contains substantial \ncriticism of the current drug czar, Lee Brown, for focusing too much \nattention on prevention and treatment efforts. That, of course, has \nbeen the real strength of the current drug czar. Dr. Brown has emerged \nas a skilled advocate for demand-reduction efforts both within and \noutside the administration.\n  This drug czar doesn't travel around the country holding press \nconferences every day, like some earlier occupants of his office. But \nDr. Brown has spent every single day in office fighting for the \nproposition that we need more drug treatment and antidrug education in \nthis country, not less. He has justifiably taken Congress to task when \nwe have failed to meet the targets in the administration's antidrug \nbudget. I, for one, respect him for that.\n  Under the stewardship of Dr. Brown, the Federal antidrug effort has \nenjoyed notable successes in recent years. In New York, Los Angeles, \nHouston, Baltimore, and other cities, several drug trafficking and \nmoney laundering organizations have been exposed and dismantled. The \nSouthwest border has been strengthened.\n  The drug czar's office has been instrumental in persuading Colombia--\nthe source of 80 percent of the cocaine that reaches our shores--to \ntake a more aggressive stand against the cocaine cartels. The Office \ndeserves neither the credit for every success, nor the blame for every \nfailure. But it has worked well, and it is accomplishing the central \ntask of reducing duplication and overlapping Federal antidrug programs.\n  This is no time to abandon our effort. The Federal Government must \nsend a clear message to families and communities that it is strongly \ncommitted to a national drug control policy.\n  As the most recent high school senior survey demonstrates, the war on \ndrugs is far from won: In 1994, 45 percent of all high school seniors \nreported having used an illegal drug at least once; the percentage of \nhigh school seniors who reported using an illegal drug within the past \nyear rose to 35 percent, up nearly 5 percent from 1993; 3.6 percent of \neighth graders had used cocaine at least once; 20 percent of eighth \ngraders had used inhalants at least once.\n  In my view, these statistics make the case for a more balanced drug \nstrategy that emphasizes drug abuse prevention. They argue for \nexpanding the mandate and authority of the drug czar, in order to help \nwage a more effective battle against illegal drugs. But surely these \nstatistics provide no support at all for those who seek to eliminate \nthe drug czar's office. That route is nothing short of a surrender in \nthe war on drugs, an admission of failure that all of us should reject.\n  I welcome adoption of the Hatch-Biden amendment.\n        the elimination of the office of national control policy\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, why are we here today considering the \nelimination of the Office of National Drug Control Policy [ONDCP]? It \nis not that they have worked themselves out of a job. Indeed, all \nindications suggest that drug usage and availability have reversed \ntheir course and are now on the rise.\n  Frankly, the performance of this office--or rather lack thereof--has \nled us to this point. Their silence on the scourge of drugs, coupled \nwith their diminished support of interdiction activities, has sent a \nclear message to the drug cartels and to the American people. That \nmessage is that this administration is apathetic with respect to the \nissue of drug trafficking and drug use.\n  Under this administration, every passing year has witnessed \nadditional cuts in overall interdiction funding. According to numbers \nprovided by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, interdiction \nfunding has been cut by approximately $700 million since 1991. This \namounts to more than a 25-percent reduction.\n  Moreover, the administration's source country strategy has diverted \nscarce assets and diminished our capabilities in transit and border \ninterdiction activities. While the strategy of source country \ninterdiction is conceptually sound, the reality is that it \n\n[[Page S11547]]\nleaves us susceptible to the decisions of sovereign nations on whether \nor not to cooperate with the United States.\n  In a letter sent to President Clinton in January of this year I, \nalong with Senators Dole and Hatch, expressed our concern over this \nsource country emphasis at the expense of our transit and border \ninterdiction capabilities. Shortly thereafter the President delivered \nto the Congress his budget which once again contained less funding for \ndrug interdiction activities. It appears the President missed the \nmessage.\n  I am unconvinced that the Office of National Drug Control Strategy is \ndoing all it can to support the agencies involved in interdiction \nactivities. Based on the statistics I've seen and on the information \nI've acquired from various law enforcement officials, I would suggest \nONDCP has not done enough. Not enough in budgetary support and not \nenough in verbal advocacy.\n  Reliable groups who gather drug-related data have independently \nverified that drug usage is rising. Indeed, a variety of variables that \nthese groups analyze indicate the United States is failing in its \ninterdiction efforts. For instance, cocaine and heroin emergency room \nadmissions have been rising since 1992--Drug Abuse Warning Network \n[DAWN]. Drug usage among high school students, 8th to 12th grade, has \nalso been rising over this same period--monitoring the future study. \nFinally, the data also shows that as interdiction funding has dropped, \nso to has the price of cocaine. Cocaine is now more affordable that it \nhas been at any time over the last 6 years--DAWN.\n  Last year, the Commandant of the Coast Guard was tasked with \ncoordinating and representing all law enforcement agencies involved in \ndrug interdiction to the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The \nCommandant informed Lee Brown, Director of ONDCP, of the various \nagencies' dissatisfaction over their interdiction budgets. It would \nappear that the concerns of the people in the field and the mission \nthey are asked to perform are just not a priority for this \nadministration.\n  While created with the laudable goal of coordinating the many \nagencies involved throughout the Government in fighting the scourge of \ndrugs through interdiction, education, and treatment, ONDCP has fallen \nshort of its responsibilities--especially in the interdiction effort.\n  The elimination of this office should not be viewed as a signal that \nthe Congress has given up on drug interdiction, indeed just the \nopposite is the case. The elimination of this office should, in no \nuncertain terms, signal the administration that not enough is being \ndone and that their support of interdiction activities has been \ninadequate.\n  I believe President Clinton would send a strong signal to the \nAmerican people by increasing his support of interdiction activities.\n                    amendment no. 2245, as modified\n\n  Mr. SHELBY offered an amendment (No. 2245) as modified, for Mr. \nHatch, for himself and Mr. Biden.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2246\n\n  Mr. SHELBY offered an amendment (No. 2246) for Mr. Coverdell.\n\n       On page 2, line 21, strike ``$105,929,000'' and insert \n     ``$110,929,000, of which $5,000,000 shall be transferred to \n     States covered by the National Voter Registration Act of \n     1993, to be expended by such States for costs associated with \n     the implementation of the National Voter Registration Act of \n     1993, with such funds disbursed to such States on the basis \n     of the number of registered voters in each State on July 1, \n     1995, in relation to the number of registered voters in all \n     States on such date'': Provided that no further funds in \n     addition to the $5,000,000 so transferred, may be transferred \n     by the Secretary to the States for costs associated with the \n     implementation of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 \n     during Fiscal Year 1996.\n       On page 46, line 12, strike ``$2,329,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$2,324,000,000''.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2247\n\n  Mr. SHELBY (for Mr. Brown, for himself and Mr. Kerrey) offered an \namendment (No. 2247) as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To limit the amount of leave that Senior Executive Service \n                  employees may accumulate to 60 days)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) Section 6304(f) of title 5, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (2) by striking ``described in paragraph \n     (1)'' and inserting ``for an individual described \n     subparagraphs (B) through (E) of paragraph (1)''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) For purposes of applying any limitation on \n     accumulation under this section with respect to any annual \n     leave for an individual described in paragraph (1)(A)--\n       ``(A) `30 days' in subsection (a) shall be deemed to read \n     `60 days'; and\n       ``(B) `45 days' in subsection (b) shall be deemed to read \n     `60 days'.''.\n       (b)(1) The amendments made by subsection (a) shall take \n     effect January 1, 1996.\n       (2) Any individual serving in a position in the Senior \n     Executive Service on December 31, 1995 may retain any annual \n     leave accrued as of that date until the leave is used by that \n     individual.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the amendment that Senator Kerrey and I \nhave sponsored on the executive service leave changes the amount of \nleave one can accrue and in effect be paid for at a later date.\n  Most Federal employees right now fall under a circumstance where they \ncan accrue 30 days. That is, you can accrue up to 30 days, but after 30 \ndays, if you accrue more than that, you do not get it. You do not get \npaid for it. But currently Senior Executive Service people get special \ntreatment. Instead of being limited to the 30 days that everybody else \ngets, they get 90 days. Thus, the reason for the amendment that we have \nsponsored and will adopt. It moves it down to 60 days.\n  Mr. President, my own feeling is that they ought to be treated like \neveryone else. They ought to be limited to 30-days. But movement from \n90 days to 60 days is movement in the right direction. I do intend, \nthough, in future pieces of legislation to address this issue again, \nand my hope is we will eventually move this down to the same treatment \neveryone else gets--30 days.\n  I should be quite clear; the overtime already accumulated by \npersonnel would remain with the employee until used. In other words, it \nis not retroactive and the amendment would not affect overtime accrued \nby Senior Foreign Service personnel, Defense Intelligence Senior \nManagement Executive Service, the Senior Cryptological Executive \nService, and the FBI and the DEA Senior Executive Service.\n  Mr. President, we ought to be thinking about consistent rules for \neveryone in this area, and it is an area I think is worth pursuing.\n                           amendment no. 2248\n\n  Mr. SHELBY offered an amendment (No. 2248) for Mr. Lautenberg.\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . TRANSFER OF CERTAIN FEDERAL PROPERTY IN NEW JERSEY.\n\n       The first section of the Act entitled ``An Act transferring \n     certain Federal property to the city of Hoboken, New \n     Jersey'', approved September 27, 1982 (Public Law 97-268; 96 \n     Stat. 1140), is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by adding ``and'' at the end; and\n       (2) by striking ``Stat. 220), and'' in subsection (b) and \n     all that follows through ``New Jersey; concurrent with'' and \n     inserting the following: ``Stat. 220);\n\n     concurrent with''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2249\n\n  Mr. SHELBY offered an amendment (No. 2249) for Mr. Grassley, for \nhimself, and Mr. Heflin, Mr. Roth, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Thurmond, \nand Mr. Glenn.\n\n       On page 33, insert between lines 1 and 2 the following:\n\n             Administrative Conference of the United States\n\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Administrative Conference of \n     the United States, established under subchapter V of chapter \n     5 of title 5, United States Code, including not to exceed \n     $1,000 for official reception and representation expenses, \n     $1,800,000.\n       On page 35, line 22, strike out ``$5,087,819,000,'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``$5,086,019,000,''.\n       On page 46, line 12, strike out ``$2,329,000,000,'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``$2,327,200,000,''.\n       On page 48, line 12, strike out ``$5,087,819,000,'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``$5,086,019,000,''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Unfortunately, Mr. President, the Administrative \nConference of the United States has been zeroed out by the House and \nSenate Appropriations Committee. In the absence of this amendment, \nthere would be no funding at all for the Conference. The Administrative \nConference is the only permanent, independent watchdog over the \nexcesses and waste in regard to agency rules and rulemaking. It is a \nvery small agency with a very important role in the Government. It is \ncharged with the responsibility of identifying and recommending \nimprovements to the administrative procedures \n\n[[Page S11548]]\nof Federal agencies, a function that has only become more important.\n  Administrative process and procedure is the central function of the \nFederal Government. The Conference's sole purpose is to objectively and \nfairly develop improvements to this administrative process.\n  There are some that argue that the valuable work that ACUS does can \nbe done equally as well by other agencies. This is not true, however, \nas ACUS is unique in its ability to provide objective, fair, \nnonpartisan,, nonideological improvements to the efficiency of \ngovernment.\n  The Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, which I \nchair, recently held a hearing on the reauthorization of ACUS. In a \nletter to the subcommittee, Supreme Court Justice Scalia, a former \nConference Chairman and present member, noted the benefits of ACUS: \n``The Conference seeks to combine the efforts of scholars, \npractitioners, and agency officials to improve the efficiency and \nfairness of the thousands of varieties of Federal agency procedures. In \nmy judgment, it is an effective mechanism for achieving that goal, \nwhich demands change and improvement in obscure areas where \nbureaucratic inertia and closed-mindedness often prevail.'' By the way, \nSupreme Court Justice Breyer is also a member.\n  To delegate ACUS' important responsibilities to the Department of \nJustice, as some have suggested, would be to have the fox guarding the \nhen house. We have seen in the recent regulatory reform debate how \npartisan and nonobjective the Justice Department can be. ACUS is an \nagency that is not likely to make a lot of friends because many of its \nrecommendations force agencies to be more efficient and more \naccountable. This is all the more reason for it to continue.\n  ACUS is not an ideological or a partisan agency. In testimony before \nthe Administrative Oversight and the Courts Subcommittee, Judge Loren \nSmith, Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims said: ``With a \ngovernment as large and complex as ours has become; there must be a \nplace where the administrative process can be analyzed from a \nrelatively policy neutral perspective.'' To entrust the responsibility \nof oversight to a partisan agency would be foolish.\n  Mr. President, it is wise to invest a small amount of money to \nmaintain a permanent, independent watchdog over the fairness, \nefficiency, and effectiveness of the detailed workings of the \nadministrative process. The return on the money invested here justifies \nits small budget. In a hearing before the Subcommittee on \nAdministrative Oversight and the Courts, Jim Miller, the former head of \nthe Office of Management and Budget under President Reagan, said: ``As \nyou know I am a fierce advocate of downsizing the Federal Government \nand reducing the number of agencies and programs. The way to do this is \nto pare back those operations that generate the least bang for the \ntaxpayers' buck. I submit that ACUS is not one of these.'' Mr. \nPresident, the\n Conference's value lies in its ability to streamline and save money. \nIts value far, far exceeds its costs.\n\n  And, Mr. President, our amendment is budget neutral since the small \namount of funding for ACUS will be taken from the General Services \nAdministration account. Therefore, this amendment will not add to the \nFederal deficit.\n  Some have mistakenly argued that ACUS doesn't do anything \nmeaningfull. Well, these arguments come from those who do not have to \ndeal with the complexity and burdens of the regulatory process.\n  Just a few of the major accomplishments of ACUS include the \nfollowing:\n  First, regulatory reform: In the comprehensive regulatory reform \nlegislation S. 343, that the Senate has been considering, the \nConference was relied upon for their expertise in this area, and a \nnumber of ACUS' recommendations were made part of the bill. And when \nthe legislation was before the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight \nand the Courts, which I chair, ACUS recommendations were relied upon.\n  Second, alternative dispute resolution: ACUS has explored \nalternatives to costly litigation such as mediation and alternative \ndispute resolution. By adopting the Conference's recommendations, \nagencies have saved millions of dollars of taxpayer's money. I will \nsoon be introducing a permanent extension of the Agency Dispute \nResolution Act which is based on ACUS' recommendations.\n  Third, simplying Government contracting: Through a number of \nrecommendations, ACUS has succeeded in streamlining the Federal \ncontracting process, a procurement system which accounts for $200 \nbillion in expenditures each year. This was accomplished through \namending the jurisdictional requirement in certification of Federal \ncontracts. The potential for further savings here are enormous.\n  Fourth, negotiated rulemaking: OMB has utilized ACUS as a reg neg \nresource center for agencies undertaking negotiated rulemaking, a \ncutting edge reform which allows for enormous improvement in \nGovernment. This is accomplished by revolutionizing the way which \nagencies come up with rules. Under this reform, parties who would be \naffected sit down with the agency and discuss the ramifications of \nproposed regulations, and hopefully, come up with a negotiated \nagreement.\n  Fifth, equal access to justice: The Conference played a key role in \nenacting the Equal Access to Justice Act. ACUS was assigned by Congress \nthe responsibility to ensure executive branch compliance. While there \nwas some institutional hostility to the changes, the model rules that \nACUS had drawn up, were eventually adopted by all agencies. The \nConference continues its\n work on this issue, most notably in its recent recommendation for \nstreamlining attorney's fee litigation.\n\n  Sixth, Contract Disputes Act: The Conference recommended changes to \nthe Contract Dispute Act. This legislation has worked well over these \nlast 3 years, eliminating an enormous amount of needless litigation.\n  The Administrative Conference is not your typical agency. It is \nsmall, it has no natural constituency, and it is vital to the success \nof any governmental reform efforts. Its budget is small, and it saves \nmuch more than it costs. I must repeat the words of Chief Judge Smith \nfrom his testimony:\n\n       I argue for the reauthorization of the Administrative \n     Conference not because it is good for the Conference, or its \n     able chair, but rather because it is good for America. It \n     will help make this huge Federal Government a little more \n     fair for our citizens, be they small business people, \n     farmers, workers, children, property owners, \n     conservationists, or taxpayers.\n\n  Mr. President, we in the Congress need all the help we can get in \nkeeping an eye on what many view as an out-of-control Federal \nbureaucracy. Overall, the manager of the bill, Senator Shelby has done \nan excellent job in crafting a responsible bill that helps put us on \nthe road to a balanced budget. I support his efforts on many tough \ndecisions he had to make regarding this bill.\n  But, on this one very small item, I just think that we are literally \nbeing penny wise and pound foolish. So, I urge my colleagues to join in \nsupport of this effort for a more efficient and more accountable \nGovernment.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of an \namendment offered by my friend and colleague Senator Grassley to \nrestore funding for the Administrative Conference of the United States.\n  The Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and Courts, \nwhich is chaired by Senator Grassley, and upon which I serve as ranking \nmember has just concluded a hearing on Wednesday, August 2, 1995, \nrelative to the Conference's reauthorization. At that hearing a panel \nof distinguished witnesses testified on behalf of the continued \nauthorization for this small, but vital independent agency whose \npurpose is to promote the efficiency, adequacy, and fairness by which \nFederal agencies conduct regulatory programs, administer grants and \nbenefits, and perform related government functions.\n  The witnesses who testified before our subcommittee were the Hon. \nThomasina Rogers, chairwoman of the Conference, the Hon. Loren Smith, \nchief judge of the Court of Federal Claims and a former chairman of the \nConference, Thomas Susman, a prominent Washington lawyer and former \nstaff member of the Judiciary Committee, and James Miller III, former \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald \nReagan. That is quite a cross-section of \n\n[[Page S11549]]\nindividuals and reflect the broadbased, non-ideological support that \nthe Conference enjoys by the legal and academic community across the \nnation.\n  We are living in a time of retrenchment, when the Federal Government \nis cutting back and trying to do more with less. The question we must \nask ourselves as policy makers is ``does eliminating the Conference \nmake good common sense''? I believe the answer is ``no'' and will \nelaborate today on why it is good policy to continue the valuable work \nthis agency performs on behalf of the American taxpayer.\n  Former OMB Director Jim Miller put it succinctly at the hearing when \nhe asked: ``Does the Conference produce value for money''? That is \n``putting the hay down where the goats can eat it,'' as we say back in \nAlabama.\n  First let me share some background with my colleagues who may not be \nfamiliar with the work that the Conference does. As I have mentioned, \nthe Conference seeks to improve the fairness, adequacy, and efficiency \nof the regulatory process with a unique combination of public and \nprivate cooperation between government officials and private citizens \nwho volunteer their time and expertise. The Conference has leveraged \nits rather modest $1.8 million appropriation with hundreds of thousands \nof dollars of estimated donated time from private citizens to conduct \nthe necessary work to advise the executive, legislative, and judicial \nbranches of the Federal Government.\n  The Conference was established by law in 1964 to make recommendations \non needed improvements to the regulatory process and to serve as sort \nof a clearinghouse for all of the Federal agencies in this regard. We \nin Congress have given the agency additional statutory duties over the \nyears under the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act, the Negotiated \nRulemaking Act, and the recently enacted Congressional Accountability \nAct, and the proposed Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act.\n  Let me give you a concrete example. Under the Administrative Dispute \nResolution Act, the Conference has assisted in carrying out the act's \ngoals of cutting down on unnecessary Government litigation when cheaper \nand quicker alternatives could be used to the benefit of the Government \nand the taxpayer. The Conference instituted a computerized roster that \nnow contains the names of hundreds of neutral mediators who are \navailable to assist agencies in resolving their problems.\n  The Conference has also sponsored an initiative which allows agencies \nto use each other's employees as an alternate source of low cost, high \nquality mediators. And importantly, the Conference organized a series \nof interagency working groups bringing together people from dozens of \nagencies to work cooperatively on projects no one agency would likely \nundertake on its own.\n This is the point I am trying to make--the Conference is a \nclearinghouse for all of our Federal agencies with regard to improving \nthe administrative process of the Federal Government.\n\n  Let us look at another concrete example of how the Conference works \non behalf of the taxpayer to say him time and money. The Conference \nrecently cosponsored with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy a \nprogram in which agencies agreed to work toward a partnership with \nprivate sector companies to reduce the number of contract claims filed \nunder the Contract Disputes Act. This was achieved by using alternative \ndispute resolution techniques, and 24 agencies signed a pledge \ncommitting them to enhanced use of ADR techniques.\n  Other savings to the taxpayer were presented at the subcommittee \nhearing. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, relying on a \nConference recommendation, began a pilot mediation program that saved \nmore than $9 million in legal fees in the first 18 months. The U.S. \nInformation Agency used ADR techniques to settle its largest contract \nclaim--$1 million in interest charges alone were saved. A pilot project \nby the Department of Labor, which worked closely with the Conference, \nreduced the cost of litigation in enforcement cases resolved by \nmediation by up to 17 percent and expedited the resolution of those \ndisputes by 6 months. Finally, the Army Corps of Engineers reports that \nits use of ADR techniques has reduced its contract claims from more \nthan 1,000 in 1988 to slightly more than 300 in 1992.\n  I have perhaps gone on too long for my colleagues in outlining some \nof the concrete results, but just these alone answer former OMB \ndirector Jim Miller's question: ``Does the Conference give value for \nmoney''? The short answer is ``yes'' it does.\n  In closing I would like to enter into the Congressional Record a copy \nof a letter written to the Hon. Richard Shelby, chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and General \nGovernment and to the Hon. Robert Kerrey, ranking member of that \nsubcommittee, which supports continued funding for the Conference. The \nletter is signed by numerous private sector members of the Conference \nincluding private practitioners, public interest groups, law \nprofessors, and a State Supreme court justice.\n  Let me read from it a brief excerpt.\n\n       The Administrative Conference may be one of the most \n     economically efficient uses of taxpayer dollars in the \n     government. Its present budget is $1.8 million. Its work in \n     ADR alone has been the catalyst for tens of millions of \n     dollars of savings by government agencies and the private \n     sector. It should be allowed to continue this important cost-\n     saving work.\n\n  Mr. President, that succinctly states why I am cosponsoring this \namendment to restore the modest funding to this small, but vital \nnonpartisan independent agency. It does deliver value for money. It \nshould continue its service to the American people.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    July 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and \n         General Government, Senate Committee on Appropriations, \n         Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. J. Robert Kerrey,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and \n         General Government, Senate Committee on Appropriations, \n         Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Senator Kerrey: We, the undersigned \n     private-sector members of the Administrative Conference, are \n     writing to urge you to continue to support funding for the \n     Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS).\n       Created in 1964, ACUS is uniquely bipartisan and a special \n     blend of public and private input. By teaming government \n     officials with private citizens who volunteer their time and \n     expertise, ACUS leverages its small appropriation into \n     hundreds of thousands of dollars of donated time to conduct \n     basic research and give advice and assistance to the \n     Congress, the President, federal agencies, and the federal \n     judiciary on difficult issues of administrative law, \n     regulation and rulemaking, and fairness and efficiency in \n     government procedures. In recent years ACUS has been a major \n     architect and proponent of government use of alternative \n     dispute resolution (ADR), which replaces costly and time-\n     consuming litigation with various consensual techniques that \n     save money for both the government and private sector and \n     enhance the public's participation in the governmental \n     process. Indeed, ACUS is now the most important repository of \n     expertise and information about ADR. Because ACUS' sole goal \n     is the improvement of the regulatory process, and its \n     approach is nonpartisan and nonideological, its \n     recommendations have an exceptionally high rate of \n     acceptance.'\n       Congress uses ACUS as a recognized source of impartial \n     expertise. In enacting its very first piece of legislation \n     this session, the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, \n     Public Law 1054-1. Congress gave the Administrative \n     Conference the statutory responsibility for examining and \n     making recommendations regarding the implementation of the \n     numerous health, safety and labor statutes that will now \n     apply to three congressional agencies--the Library of \n     Congress, the General Accounting Office, and the Government \n     Printing Office.\n       The Dole regulatory reform bill currently under Senate \n     consideration, S.343, as well as the bill unanimously \n     reported out of the Government Affairs Committee, S. 291, and \n     the recently introduced Glenn bill, S. 1001, include \n     important new oversight responsibilities for ACUS. In \n     selecting ACUS to undertake these new responsibilities, the \n     Governmental Affairs Committee observed:\n       Because ACUS is comprised of respected experts and \n     practitioners representing a wide range of perspectives and \n     interests, and has a record of developing unbiased, practical \n     solutions to regulatory problems, the Committee believes that \n     this agency is well suited to producing the studies and \n     recommendations needed to fulfill the intent of section 5 [of \n     the bill.]. Report of the Senate Committee on Governmental \n     Affairs, S. Rep. No. 104-88, p. 57 (May 25, 1995).\n       The Administrative Conference may be one of the most \n     economically efficient users of taxpayers dollars in the \n     government. Its present budget is $1.8 million. Its work in \n     ADR alone has been the catalyst for tens of millions of \n     dollars of savings by government agencies and the private \n     sector. It should be \n\n[[Page S11550]]\n     allowed to continue this important cost-saving work. It has developed a \n     program to complement current Administration and \n     Congressional initiatives and address the details that must \n     be resolved if regulatory reform and reinvention efforts are \n     to be implemented successfully. Even if its job were solely \n     to monitor and improve regulatory changes that may emerge \n     from this Congress, that would be reason enough to retain it.\n       In short, we urge you to support continuous funding for \n     ACUS.\n           Sincerely,\n       Joseph A.

Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nrestore funding to the Administrative Conference of the United States.\n  The Administrative Conference, or ACUS, is a small agency in the \nexecutive branch with an important mission and a very broad scope. It \nis charged with the responsibility of identifying and recommending \nimprovements to the administrative procedures of our Federal agencies, \nand for more than 25 years ACUS has commendably carried out that \nresponsibility.\n  The backbone of our Federal agencies is the administrative process. \nThe administrative process includes the issuance of regulations, the \nadjudication of individual claims for benefits, the award of licenses, \nand the debarment of fraudulent and nonperforming contractors. There's \nnot much that a Federal agency does that doesn't involve administrative \nprocess.\n  It is understandable, then, that when Vice President Gore went \nlooking for key elements to reform the way our Federal agencies carry \nout their responsibilities, he focused in on the administrative \nprocess. When he did so, he saw the work of ACUS as an important asset \nto achieving real progress. Streamlining the administrative process is \nthe main goal of the National Performance Review, and ACUS is the key \nvehicle the administration intends to use to reach that goal. The bill \nwe are now considering would undermine the cause of regulatory reform, \nbecause it fails to provide any funding for ACUS.\n  Let us look quickly at some of the specific tasks that we in Congress \nhave directed ACUS to take on. The Regulatory Negotiation Act, which I \nauthored, gives ACUS a key role in encouraging and facilitating agency \nuse of regulatory negotiation. Regulatory negotiation is a fairly new \napproach to developing regulations that brings the affected parties \ninto the process earlier and attempts to achieve by consensus what we \nmay never be able to achieve through the normal, often adversarial, \nrulemaking process. It may not be the right approach in every case, but \nwhere it fits it has proven to be very beneficial: cutting costs, \nimproving enforcement, and producing more cost-effective regulations. \nWere ACUS to be eliminated, we would risk losing the progress we have \nmade over the last few years to get agencies to rely more on regulatory \nnegotiation.\n  Similarly, ACUS has been assigned a key role in the implementation of \nthe Alternative Dispute Resolution Act. When used appropriately, ADR is \na proven time and money saver. The ADR Act encourages agencies to avoid \ncostly and protracted litigation by using arbitration, mediation, and \nother alternative dispute resolution techniques. ACUS is responsible \nunder the ADR Act for facilitating the use of ADR in the Federal \nagencies, and they have been quite successful. Were we to allow ACUS to \ngo unfunded, the center would fall out of the ADR effort, and much of \nthe progress we have tried to achieve would be lost.\n  ACUS is presently evaluating conflict management in the Fish and \nwildlife Service's implementation of the Endangered Species Act; agency \npractices regarding sale and distribution of Government assets such as \nbroadcast frequency licenses, oil and gas leases; Department of Justice \ncontrol over agency litigation; the use of audited industry self-\nregulation; techniques for expedited rulemaking; and many more. Each of \nthese has the potential to greatly improve the operations of Federal \nagencies.\n  Here in the Senate, we are still finding important roles for ACUS \neven while we are talking about eliminating it. Section 8 of the Dole-\nJohnston substitute to S. 343, the regulatory reform bill would direct \nACUS to evaluate the agencies' compliance with that bill's risk-\nassessment requirements. Congress relies on ACUS for crosscutting \nprojects such as these because of its unparalleled expertise regarding \nthe administrative process.\n  While these tasks could be performed by someone other than ACUS, this \npoints out the most valuable aspect of ACUS. ACUS is a small, free-\nstanding agency that is free of partisan wrangling. Its research and \nrecommendations are supposed to be without political favoritism, an so \nthey have been. But because of ACUS's expertise and prestige, it is \nable to bring together many of the best minds in the fields of \nadministrative law and Government operations from the private sector, \nacademia, and Government to work together in the public interest. Law \nprofessors, the private bar, judges, and agency officials serve \ntogether on ACUS panels, providing their services free of charge. \nACUS's ability to leverage its small amount of money into such a \nsizable substantive gain makes it unique. The Nation could not expect \nto find a more economical source of the \n\n[[Page S11551]]\nservices ACUS provides, and allowing ACUS to go unfunded for even 1 \nyear would erode its stature and severely damage this unique \narrangement.\n  Administrative process is not glamorous stuff, but if you think back \non the major issues debated here this session, its importance is clear. \nMany of us have drawn on ACUS's expertise when considering the issues \nof unfunded mandates, the regulatory moratorium, regulatory reform, \nlobbying disclosure, telecommunications. The ability of ACUS's staff to \nquickly and accurately answer an extraordinary range of questions about \nhow the Federal administrative agencies operate is extraordinary. This, \ncombined with the many important roles ACUS plays in improving the \noperation of those Federal administrative agencies, offers compelling \njustification for restoring adequate funding to ACUS.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Iowa for offering this \namendment and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment to \nrestore funding for the Administrative Conference of the United States.\n  The Administrative Conference is a small agency that provides \nindependent, nonpartisan advice and assistance to Congress and Federal \nagencies on how to make Government procedures more efficient, flexible, \nand open.\n  ACUS, as the Conference is sometimes called, is a unique public-\nprivate partnership. It consists of members from Government, the \nacademic community, and the private sector, who develop consensus-based \nrecommendations for improved agency procedures. It also has a small \ncareer staff that works with agencies on implementing recommended \nreforms, and that assists congressional offices and agencies on issues \nof administrative law and practice.\n  In this era of budget reduction and smaller government, the \nAdministrative Conference is especially valuable. There are several \ncompelling reasons for this.\n  First, ACUS studies problems and makes recommendations that save the \nGovernment lots of money. For example, the Conference has testified \nthat the Social Security Administration adopted an ACUS recommendation \nto simplify the Social Security appeals process. From following just \nthis one ACUS recommendation, the Social Security Administration \nreports that it will save $85 million annually.\n  A second example is the use of alternative dispute resolution \ntechniques, or ADR, which means mediation and other methods of settling \ncases and avoiding costly litigation. The Administrative Conference is \nthe Government's central resource on the use of alternative dispute \nresolution. Data from five agencies show that their use of these ADR \nmethods, which ACUS has been promoting for a decade, saved $13.8 \nmillion in 1994.\n  James C. Miller, who was budget director under President Reagan and \nis a staunch budget-cutter, has testified that it would be a mistake \nfor Congress to zero out the Administrative Conference, because ``ACUS \ngenerates far more value to the American people'' than its yearly \nbudget. On this point, Jim Miller and I agree completely. The \nConference's budget is only $1.8 million dollars--an amount that is \nrepaid many times over in reduced litigation costs and improved \nGovernment efficiency.\n  A second reason why the Conference is especially valuable now, is \nthat we are in the midst of revamping the Government's administrative \nand regulatory procedures for the first time in 50 years. Such a time \nis when we most need the expert, impartial advice and assistance of the \nConference. For example, there are now two leading regulatory reform \nbills in the Senate--S. 343, which is sponsored by the distinguished \nmajority leader, and S. 1001, which I introduced. Both of these bills \nincorporate key recommendations of the Administrative Conference. I \nknow that, on both sides of the aisle, Senate staff working on these \nbills have turned for advice repeatedly to the Conference staff. Both \nof these bills also include explicit requirements for the \nAdministrative Conference to review how the legislative reforms work \nout in practice, and to recommend any needed corrections.\n  Third, over the past year the Conference has focused and marshaled \nits energies to support the current transition to a smaller, more \nefficient, more responsible Government. ACUS continues its very \nvaluable support for Government use of negotiation, mediation, and \nother alternatives to costly litigation. These ADR techniques foster \nflexible and open decisionmaking, encourage results that are acceptable \nto the parties, reduce the amount of litigation clogging our courts--as \nwell as saving the Government and the private sector money.\n  The Conference is also concentrating its research-and-development \nefforts on such regulatory techniques as audited self-regulation and \nenhanced waiver authority. These innovative techniques are designed to \nbe more flexible and responsive than the traditional regulatory \napproach of one-size-fits-all.\n  Finally, I want to dispel any misperception that the Administrative \nConference is redundant--that other organizations in the Government or \nin the private sector could do the same job. No other entity is \ndesigned to do what the Administrative Conference does.\n  Certainly, we in Congress get plenty of advice on how to reform \nagency processes and procedures--maybe too much advice. But most of \nthis advice comes from industries, or regulatory agencies, or advocacy \ngroups, or ``thinks tanks,'' or party caucuses--which have vested \ninterests or political agendas.\n  Unlike all of these groups, the Administrative Conference's only \nagenda is to foster greater efficiency and fairness in Government. Its \nrecommendations must be practical and unbiased, in order to pass muster \nwith a membership drawn from both practitioners and academics from both \npolitical parties and from all points on the political spectrum. \nFurthermore, only ACUS has a mandate to follow through and help \nagencies to implement recommendations that are adopted.\n  This is one agency that actually saves the Government more money than \nit costs. Based on the Administrative Conference's track record of \nsuccess, this unique institution should be preserved.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and \nto reinstate funding for the Administrative Conference.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment of Senator \nGrassley to restore funding for the Administrative Conference of the \nUnited States. Because I am, and have been, a strong proponent of \nreducing the size of government, let me take a moment to explain why I \nthink we should restore life to this tiny agency.\n  We have reached the point where, now more than ever, there is \nwidespread consensus that the administrative process must be reformed \nand streamlined. The Administrative Conference is the only Government \nagency whose sole mission and expertise is directed to improving \nadministrative procedure. And the Administrator Conference is a unique \nsource of nonpartisan advice and assistance to Congress and the \nagencies on how to make the regulatory process more efficient, more \nflexible, and more rational. The supporters of ACUS comprise a virtual \n``Who's Who'' of administrative law from across the political spectrum. \nIndeed, ACUS is especially effective in carrying out its mission \nbecause it achieves a unique synergy of expertise from government, the \nprivate sector, academia, and the public interest community.\n  As we all know, results matter, and ACUS has had notable success in \nreducing the inefficiency, ineffectiveness, and delay in the regulatory \nprocess. These successes repay ACUS' small budget--$1.8 million--many \ntimes over. To paraphrase S. 343, the benefits clearly justify the \ncosts. For example, ACUS has produced massive savings in money, time, \nand agency resources by implementing alternative dispute resolution.\n  Data from five agencies show that the use of alternative dispute \nresolution has saved $13.8 million for just these few agencies in 1994. \nWith ACUS' help, the use of alternative dispute resolution is expanding \nrapidly. It has been estimated that a recently adopted ACUS proposal to \nchange the appeals \n\n[[Page S11552]]\nprocess saves the Social Security administrative process $85 each year. \nIt would be penny-wise and pound-foolish to let the Administrative \nConference expire.\n  Furthermore, it is now--when we are proposing the most comprehensive \nchanges to the Administrative Procedure Act since it was written 50 \nyears ago--that we need the advice and assistance of the Administrative \nConference more than ever.\n  As small as ACUS is, it has provided important support for the \nmovement toward regulatory reform and for alternatives to the \nlitigation morass that burdens our Nation. Many ACUS recommendations \nhave been incorporated into the regulatory reform proposals we are \nconsidering, including S. 343. Indeed, section 8 of S. 343 provides for \nACUS to study and advise Congress on the operation of the risk \nassessment requirements and the operation of the Administrative \nProcedure Act. My regulatory reform bill, S. 291, contained a similar \nprovision. So did the Glenn bill. As complex and far reaching as the \ncurrent regulatory reform proposals are, we will need the kind of \nindependent expertise that ACUS provides if we want to carry out \nregulatory reform.\n  Because I want to reform the regulatory process and to make \ngovernment more efficient, I support Senator Grassley's amendment to \nfund the Administrative Conference. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis worthy effort.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2250\n\n  Mr. SHELBY offered an amendment (No. 2250) for Ms. Mikulski:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n       Sec.   . Service performed during the period January 1, \n     1984, through December 31, 1986, which would, if performed \n     after that period, be considered service as a law enforcement \n     officer, as defined in section 8401(17)(A)(i)(II) and (B) of \n     title 5, United States Code, shall be deemed service as a law \n     enforcement officer for the purposes of chapter 84 of such \n     title.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I rise today in support of my amendment to chapter 84 \nof title 5, United States Code, which corrects a technical error in \nexisting law. The error which I refer to results in some Federal law \nenforcement personnel who began duty during an interim period when the \nFederal employee retirement system was being changed being denied the \nbenefits they deserve.\n  From January 1, 1984, to December 31, 1986, certain Federal law \nenforcement personnel were hired and placed under an interim retirement \nsystem. The Civil Service Retirement System [CSRS] was not open to \nnewly hired employees and the new retirement system, the Federal \nEmployees Retirement System [FERS], was not yet in effect. When the \nFederal Employee Retirement System went into effect, this group of law \nenforcement personnel became covered under the FERS law enforcement \nprovisions.\n  However, during this transitional period, these law enforcement \nofficers were denied law enforcement credit because they were never \nclassified as law enforcement personnel. This amendment corrects the \nexisting language so this group of law enforcement personnel will not \nbe required to unfairly work up to an additional 3 years to meet \neligibility requirements under the FERS law enforcement provision. Our \nFederal law enforcement personnel work long, hard, and dangerous duty \nin service of this country. It is only fair that we ensure that each \nand every Federal law enforcement employee receives the retirement \nbenefits they deserve.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2251\n\n  Mr. SHELBY offered an amendment (No. 2251) for Mr. Brown:\n\n       The General Services Administration and the Federal \n     Aviation Administration should review and reform current \n     personnel rules and labor agreements regarding federal \n     assistance when relocating because of a change of duty \n     station.\n       The Senate is concerned about reports that, under FAA and \n     GSA rules, employees at the Denver, Colorado, ATCT and TRACON \n     were permitted to claim personal housing relocation \n     allowances in connection with their transfer from FAA \n     facilities at Stapleton Field to the new Denver International \n     Airport, even in some cases where an employee's new home was \n     farther from the new job site than the employee's former \n     home.\n       The FAA should immediately investigate this misuse of \n     public funds at Denver International Airport and reform their \n     personnel rules to end this kind of abuse.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, with reference to this amendment on the \nDenver International Airport, under a previous policy memorandum--to be \nspecific, between the FAA and the NATCA--there was an agreement to \nwaive regulations that apply to the payment for the movement of \nworkers. The old rules indicated there would be payment for employees' \nmovement if, indeed, an airport was moved over 10 miles. The new Denver \nairport is 17 miles from the old site. So it came under the old \nregulations. However, the new regulations make it clear that \ncompensation is not to be given unless the airport is relocated 35 \nmiles or more and if a controller moves 30 minutes closer to the new \nduty station.\n  Thus, the Denver International Airport employees would have received \ncompensation--or at least some of them could have--under the old \nregulations. But they did not qualify for the compensation under the \nnew regulations. Nevertheless, on April 8, 1993, there was a memo of \nunderstanding reached where they waived the application of these new \nregulations. In other words, they waived the current regulations and \nmade employees eligible for moving expenses even though the airport was \nonly moved 17 miles.\n  The impact has been enormous. Four workers received a total of \ndollars $85,000 for this small move, even though they moved further \naway from their workplace. In other words, they moved, but their new \nhome was further away from the new airport than their old home had been \nfrom the old airport. In other words, we paid them when they actually \nchose to move further away.\n  A total of 38 FAA workers have been paid now $528,000 in moving \ncosts, an average of $14,000, even though under the new regulations \nthey would not qualify for anything. The FAA has set aside another \n$2.07 million to reimburse over 100 workers still eligible to submit \nexpenses before February 1997. The largest single reimbursement was for \n$61,281 to an air traffic controller who moved from one address in \nEnglewood, CO, to another address in Englewood, CO.\n  It is quite clear that the taxpayers have been ripped off and with \nthe complicity of the people who signed the new memo waiving the \nregulation, thus the amendment calling for the study and review.\n  Mr. President, I hope the people responsible for this kind of \ntreatment of the taxpayers will receive appropriate discipline from \ntheir superiors.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendments be considered and agreed to en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2232 through 2251) were agreed to, en bloc.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nconference agreement on H.R. 2020, the Treasury, Postal Service, and \nGeneral Government appropriations bill for 1996.\n  This bill provides new budget authority of $23.0 billion and new \noutlays of $20.6 billion to finance operations of the Department of the \nTreasury; including the Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Customs Service, \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and the Financial Management \nService; as well as the Executive Office of the President, the Office \nof Personnel management, and other agencies that perform central \nGovernment functions.\n  I congratulate the chairman and ranking member for producing a bill \nthat is within the subcommittee's 602(b) allocation. When outlays from \nprior-year budget authority and other adjustments are taken into \naccount, the bill totals $22.8 billion in budget authority and $23.1 \nbillion in outlays. The total bill is at the Senate subcommittee's \n602(b) nondefense allocation for budget authority and under its \nallocation for outlays by $32 million. The subcommittee is also under \nits Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund allocation by $2 million in \nbudget authority and $1 million in outlays.\n  I would also like to thank that subcommittee for including funding to \ncomplete construction of the Federal courthouse in Albuquerque, NM.\n  I ask Members of the Senate to refrain from offering amendments which \nwould cause the subcommittee to exceed its budget allocation and urge \nthe speedy adoption of this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the spending totals for the Senate \nreported bill be printed in the Record.\n \n[[Page S11553]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      TREASURY-POSTAL SUBCOMMITTEE                      \n[Spending totals--Senate-reported bill; fiscal year 1996, in millions of\n                                dollars]                                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                        Budget          \n                                                      authority  Outlays\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed......................................  .........    2,778\n    H.R. 2020, as reported to the Senate............    11,187     8,747\n    Scorekeeping adjustment.........................  .........  .......\n                                                     -------------------\n      Subtotal nondefense discretionary.............    11,187    11,525\n                                                     ===================\nViolent crime reduction trust fund:                                     \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed......................................  .........        8\n    H.R. 2020, as reported to the Senate............        76        61\n    Scorekeeping adjustment.........................  .........  .......\n                                                     -------------------\n      Subtotal violent crime reduction trust fund...        76        69\n                                                     ===================\nMandatory:                                                              \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed......................................       127       130\n    H.R. 2020, as reported to the Senate............    11,763    11,756\n    Adjustment to conform mandatory programs with                       \n     Budget Resolution assumptions..................      -334      -333\n                                                     -------------------\n      Subtotal mandatory............................    11,555    11,553\n                                                     ===================\n      Adjusted bill total...........................    22,818    23,147\n                                                     ===================\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n    Defense discretionary...........................  .........  .......\n    Nondefense discretionary........................    11,187    11,557\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund..............        78        70\n    Mandatory.......................................    11,555    11,553\n                                                     -------------------\n      Total allocation..............................    22,820    23,180\n                                                     ===================\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate Subcommittee                     \n 602(b) allocation:                                                     \n    Defense discretionary...........................  .........  .......\n    Nondefense discretionary........................  .........      -32\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund..............        -3        -1\n    Mandatory.......................................  .........  .......\n                                                     -------------------\n      Total allocation..............................        -3       -33\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding. Total adjusted for \n  consistency with current scorekeeping conventions.                    \n\n  Mr. SIMON. In December 1994, as part of the National Performance \nReview, the administration announced that the Office of Personnel \nManagement [OPM] would privatize its investigative branch, the Office \nof Federal Investigations [OFI]. OPM intends to complete the transition \nby January 1996.\n  For over 40 years, the OFI has been responsible for conducting \nbackground investigations for potential employees of various agencies \nwithin the Federal Government, including the Department of Energy, the \nDepartment of Justice, and the Treasury Department. Overall, OFI \nconducts about 40 percent of all Federal background investigations for \npositions ranging from bureaucratic jobs to high ranking positions \nrequiring substantial security clearances. In my view, shifting this \nresponsibility to the private sector raises a host of extremely \nimportant questions which need to be addressed before we proceed.\n  First, we must ensure that our national security is not in any way \njeopardized by a move to privatization. Currently, OFI does background \nchecks on individuals that will ultimately have access to top secret \ninformation, such as nuclear weapons systems. We need to ask ourselves \nif this is the type of matter that we want a private sector employee to \nhave access to. If the answer is yes, certainly we need to carefully \nreview the safeguards needed to ensure that our national interests \nremain secure.\n  The ability of private firms to maintain the privacy of sensitive \nrecords is another area that needs to be closely addressed. A private \ncontractor would potentially have the ability to amass large quantities \nof personal information on Government employees. Although OPM has \nsuggested that they would have the ability to keep records private, I \nhave not heard specific measures that could be taken to guarantee this. \nSerious study must be given to what measures can and should be taken to \nprotect privacy.\n  We must also ensure that quality investigations will continue to be \nconducted. The Federal Government currently uses private\n investigators for a very small fraction of background checks. The only \nexperience with private investigators on a large scale produced \nnumerous investigations that were not up to standard, or, even in a \nfraction of cases, were falsified. This must not happen again. What \nsafeguards can and should OPM put in place to ensure that quality is \nmaintained?\n\n  It is also important to ask ourselves if private investigators will \nbe able to provide the best available information to Government \nagencies. Will they have difficulty obtaining vital information from \nlaw enforcement agencies? In a preliminary study, the General \nAccounting Office [GAO] has determined that law enforcement officials \nmay be reluctant to give out sensitive information to private \ninvestigators. This issue deserves further study.\n  My comments are not meant to imply that private contractors cannot \nperform top quality investigations while also ensuring privacy and \nprotecting out national security. It is certainly conceivable that they \ncould. However, before a decision of this magnitude is made, it is \ncrucial that we all have the best possible information. If further \nstudy shows that private investigators can successfully take over this \nimportant function, then I might support the transition. However, until \nthese questions are answered, I believe the best course of action is a \ncautious one.\n  I understand that the Senate Treasury and Postal Appropriations \nreport requires that a cost-benefit analysis be conducted to determine \nthe feasibility of moving to privatization, and that the House report \nmandates a similar study. In addition, Congressman Mica has requested \nthat the GAO conduct an ongoing study into potential problems with the \nprivatization effort. I would ask that my questions and concerns be \nraised as part of these studies.\n  Mr. SHELBY. While I appreciate the concerns of the Senator from \nIllinois, I think the move to privatization is a good one. The \nadministration and the subcommittee have carefully reviewed the \nprivatization issue. In February, OPM conducted a feasibility study and \nrecently contracted out with another firm to present a business plan. \nThat plan should address the steps OMP will take to ensure continued \noversight of this important function.\n  However, my colleague from Illinois has raised several important \npoints that I believe should be addressed. I will work to include \nlanguage in the conference report that would require the GAO to study \nthe questions raised by Senator Simon, including the potential impact \non the quality of investigations, privacy issues, and national security \nconcerns. I believe that before OPM moves to privatization, Congress \nshould have the opportunity to review both the OPM and GAO reports on \nthese issues.\n  Mr. KERREY. I share the views of the chairman, and will work to \nensure that the concerns of the Senator from Illinois are addressed in \nthe conference report as well. They are indeed important issues that \ndeserve further study.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank both of my colleagues for their leadership on this \nissue. I appreciate their willingness to ensure that my concerns are \naddressed, and look forward the results of further study.\n                        breckenridge post office\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Would the Senator from Alabama yield a few moments at \nthis time to enter into a brief colloquy?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I would be happy to yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Senator.\n  As the Senator may recall, the House report on the Treasury/Postal \nappropriations bill notes that committee's concerns about the failure \nof the Postal Service to complete the planning and the construction on \nthe new post office in Breckenridge, CO.\n  The planning stage was originally to be finished in fiscal year 1995 \nso that the new post office could be completed in fiscal year 1996. \nThis issue was not addressed in the Senate report.\n  Breckenridge, CO, is not being adequately served by the Postal \nService at this time because of the need for better facilities. I would \nask the Senator from Alabama, then, if he would work with me to \nencourage the conferees to adopt the House's comments on the building \nof the Breckenridge Post Office in the conference committee report.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I look forward to working with the Senator on this \nmatter. I know how important efficient postal service is to rural \ncommunities.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the distinguished Senator from Alabama for his \nconsideration and I yield the floor.\n                          ``guns for felons''\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am very pleased that this \nlegislation includes a provision that Senator Simon and I requested \nthat would block funding for a program that allows convicted felons to \nregain their ability to possess firearms. \n\n[[Page S11554]]\n\n  As a general matter, Mr. President, Federal law prohibits any person \nconvicted of a felony from possessing firearms. However, under what I \ncall a guns for felons loophole, convicted felons can apply to the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to get a waiver.\n  After receiving an application, ATF performs a broad-based field \ninvestigation and background check. If the Bureau believes that the \napplicant does not pose a threat to public safety, it can grant an \nexemption from the Federal ban.\n  Mr. President, Senator Simon and I have been able to block funding \nfor this program for the past few years. However, between 1981 and \n1991, ATF granted 5,600 waivers. Many of these required a substantial \namount of scarce time and resources. ATF investigations often lasted \nweeks, and included interviews with family, friends, and the police.\n  In the late 1980's, the cost of processing and investigating these \npetitions worked out to about $10,000 for each waiver granted.\n  What happened when convicted felons got their firearms rights back? \nWell, some apparently went back to their violent ways. Those granted \nrelief subsequently were rearrested for crimes ranging from attempted \nmurder to rape, kidnaping, and child molestation.\n  Mr. President, the ATF guns for felons loophole is an outrageous \nwaste of taxpayer dollars. It also is a poor use of scarce ATF \nresources. ATF agents have better things to do than conduct background \ninvestigations so that felons can get a gun.\n  Mr. President, we ought to eliminate this ridiculous program \npermanently. Senator Simon and I have introduced legislation to do so. \nMeanwhile, though, we at least should block funding for the program in \nappropriations bills. I am very pleased that the Appropriations \nCommittee agreed with us this year.\n  Mr. President, there is broad support for closing the guns for felons \nloophole. The Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of \nPolice Organizations, and the International Brotherhood of Police \nOfficers all have testified in favor of terminating the ATF program.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, firearm violence has reached epidemic \nproportions. We have a responsibility to the victims and prospective \nvictims to take all reasonable steps to keep this violence to a \nminimum. Keeping firearms away from convicted felons is the least these \ninnocent Americans should be able to expect.\n                      federal property management\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, my efforts to correct longstanding problems \nrelated to Federal property management, particularly in the courthouse \nconstruction program, are already well documented in the public record. \nDuring the last few years, I have supported a number of amendments to \neliminate wasteful spending for construction projects that were not \nneeded or not cost-effective and I've introduced legislation to reform \nthe way the Federal Government manages its office space.\n  Over the years, the General Accounting Office [GAO] and General \nServices Administration [GSA] Inspector General reports have \nhighlighted recurring problems at GSA in managing the Federal \nGovernment's real estate portfolio and have shown a pattern of wasteful \nspending. Long standing problems have significantly impaired GSA's \nability to meet the Federal Government's property needs in a cost-\neffective and businesslike manner.\n  Despite GSA Administrator Roger Johnson's efforts to reform GSA and \nreorganize the Public Buildings Service [PBS], I remain convinced that \nPBS fails to adequately meet Federal space needs in a cost-effective \nmanner and continues to construct buildings that are not needed and \nthat we can ill afford. Earlier this month, GAO testified before the \nEnvironment and Public Works Subcommittee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure that the Federal Government continues to spend billions \nof dollars more than is necessary to acquire and manage Federal office \nspace. Congress has also contributed to the problem as it has too often \nfunded construction projects which have not gone through the normal \nauthorization process.\n  In today's climate of downsizing Government and budgetary cuts, \nfunding for any Federal building project must be carefully assessed to \nensure the best and maximum use of scarce Federal resources. Last \nmonth, I wrote to my colleagues on the Treasury, Postal Appropriations \nand General Government Subcommittee urging them not to obligate funds \nfor any unauthorized Federal buildings or unauthorized courthouse \nconstruction projects; to reassess the need to spend $1 billion, as the \nPresident requested, on new construction; to closely scrutinize whether \nplanned funding levels for projects already in the pipeline are \neconomical and realistic in view of current budget constraints; and to \nassess repair and alteration funding levels.\n  I am pleased with the language in the fiscal year 1996 Treasury \nPostal appropriations bill which is currently before the Senate. The \nbill reduces Federal construction funding and notes that no funds \navailable in the bill will be used for unauthorized\n projects. I commend Senators Shelby and Kerrey for their leadership in \nthis important area.\n\n  I am also pleased with the language in the bill that prohibits the \nsubmission of a fiscal year 1997 budget for the construction of U.S. \ncourthouse, unless the facilities meet the construction standards \ndeveloped by the GSA, the Office of Management and Budget, and the \nJudicial Conference and reflect the priorities established in the \nJudicial Conference's 5-year construction plan.\n  Mr. President, the current courthouse construction program lacks a \nstrategic plan and fails to prioritize projects to ensure that scarce \nFederal resources are spent where they are most needed. As a result, \nCongress must make the tough funding decisions to protect the \ntaxpayer's interests and prevent wasteful spending. The Appropriations \nCommittee report notes that the committee has been frustrated by the \ncourts unwillingness to establish a priority list for construction and \ncontinued insistence that all projects are of an equal priority.\n  I share the committee's frustration over the courthouse construction \nprogram. GAO has testified that the Federal judiciary overestimated \ncourthouse construction space needs for the next decade by more than 3 \nmillion square feet which, if authorized, could waste up to $1.1 \nbillion. Last year, a Governmental Affairs Committee hearing showed \nthat, in addition to continuing to build unneeded Federal courthouses, \nwe are wasting additional millions on extravagant courthouse features \nsuch as top of the line marble, custom lighting, and private \nkitchenettes. As a result of the hearing, I, along with a number of my \ncolleagues, wrote GAO requesting an audit of the courthouse \nconstruction program. The audit is still ongoing and is expected to be \ncompleted later this year.\n  As Congress looks for ways to address the Federal budget deficit, we \nmust ensure that Government programs and agencies are operating in the \nmost cost-effective manner possible. Again, I commend Senators Shelby \nand Kerrey for their leadership in putting an end to funding \nunauthorized construction projects.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I want to record my considerable \nconcerns about this appropriations bill. The amount appropriated for \nTreasury is inadequate, specifically as it regards IRS enforcement \nefforts. The amount appropriated by the Senate for enforcement \nrepresents a decrease of $705 million from the amount appropriated last \nyear. This is even lower than the amount appropriated for enforcement \nby our colleagues in the House.\n  Over half of the decrease in enforcement funds is attributable to the \nIRS Taxpayer Compliance Initiative that was first established last \nyear. The Compliance Initiative funds should be made available now, to \nenable the IRS to realize the full benefits of its recent technological \nimprovements. Specific enforcement efforts that will be jeopardized if \nthese funds are not forthcoming include the collection of $30 billion \nin delinquent accounts; increased audit coverage; improved information \nreporting by Federal employees; and improved enforcement of \ninternational tax provisions including the transfer pricing laws.\n  Thanks to prior appropriations for the Tax Systems Modernization \nProgram, the IRS has improved its technology to the point that it is \nwithin reach of benefiting from that significant investment of taxpayer \ndollars. \n\n[[Page S11555]]\nDenying funds for the Compliance Initiative means turning our backs on \nwhat the IRS estimates is $9.2 billion, over 5 years, that would come, \nnot from any tax increase, but from collecting taxes that are owed but \nare presently going unpaid.\n  Very simply, providing the IRS with adequate funding for their \nCompliance Initiative would reduce the deficit, without a tax increase. \nWe know that these expenditures would yield increased revenues in \nexcess of the amount spent. The IRS estimates that the return on these \nexpenditures would approach $5 for every $1 spent. Viewing the \nappropriation of funds for this purpose as the same as all other \nspending is shortsighted.\n   Commending the providence atf and urging adequate staffing levels\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the Treasury, \nPostal, and General Government appropriations bill today, I wish to \nbring to the Senate's attention the often-overlooked good work that the \nlocal offices of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms [BATF] \nprovide to our country. I do so partly because of the recent scrutiny \ndirected at the BATF here in the Congress and partly in response to a \nletter I recently received from the U.S. attorney for Rhode Island, \nSheldon Whitehouse, who wrote to me to indicate his concern over the \nneed for adequately staffing the Providence, RI office of the BATF.\n  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms is charged with \nenforcing and administering Federal firearms and explosives laws, as \nwell as those laws covering the production, use, and distribution of \nalcohol and tobacco products. Over the years, the Bureau has been an \nessential partner in our crime fighting efforts in these areas and, in \nparticular, the BATF office in Providence, RI has distinguished itself \nin its work even given its small size.\n  Indeed, to quote from the letter I received from U.S. Attorney \nWhitehouse, the Providence office--\n\n       Has been extremely effective for its size, particularly at \n     fighting the kind of crime that presents the most violent \n     threat to Rhode Islanders; guns, drugs, and gangs. Recent ATF \n     investigations have led to the Federal arrests and \n     convictions of some of the largest dealers of assault weapons \n     and crack cocaine in Newport, and numerous Providence area \n     armed career criminals.\n\n  The problem, Mr. President, is that adequate staffing of the \nProvidence office of the BATF is being seriously threatened. Only a \nyear ago, the Providence operated with a small, tight crew of just six \nagents. Today, there are currently four agents and by the end of the \nyear there will be just three agents. The danger is that without \nadequate appropriations, the office will not be able to replace the \nfull complement of six agents. This would be a tragic loss to Federal \nlaw enforcement in Rhode Island and one that in our zeal to squeeze \nsavings out of the Federal budget would be unwise and potentially \ndangerous. I highlight three recent cases handled by the Providence \nBATF to illustrate my point.\n  Just recently, Tonomy Hill was a troubled housing project in Newport, \nRI. Following an undercover investigation by the BATF, an illicit drug \ntrafficking and illegal firearms operation based at Tonomy Hill and \ninvolving two drug kingpins and 33 associates from as far away as \nPhiladelphia and New York was exposed. In the end, the ring leaders and \n33 associates were prosecuted and convicted on both State and Federal \ncharges.\n  In another case, in July 1993, Michael Sadd of Wakefield,\n   RI was robbed at gunpoint and then murdered. Through joint \ncooperation with local law enforcement, ATF agents successfully \ncompleted an undercover operation whereby the suspected murderer was \nfound, taken into custody, and currently is awaiting trial.\n\n  Finally, in 1991, it was becoming increasingly apparent that Rhode \nIsland's gun laws were being thwarted by the proliferation of illegal \nfirearms on the streets. The ATF conducted an investigation and it was \ndiscovered that a local Rhode Islander was working with a purchaser in \nArizona to provide a supply of illegal firearms to the local black \nmarket, smuggled into the State and registered under bogus serial \nnumbers. The case ended with the Arizona purchaser in prison and \npending charges against his accomplice in Rhode Island.\n  These examples show that the ATF presence is much-needed in Rhode \nIsland, especially as our State and local law enforcement agencies face \ncutbacks and budget shortfalls. In the troubled times facing our \nstreets and neighborhoods, we must commit adequate resources at all \nlevels to address the ever increasing menace of violent crime. I \nrealize the difficult times our country faces in finding a way to solve \nour budget deficit. Nevertheless, in the establishment of priorities, I \nhope that adequate attention will be given to maintaining law \nenforcement.\n  With regard to the legislation at hand, I hope that given the Bureau \nof Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms good work in Rhode Island that a \nrequisite level of funding will be appropriated and insisted upon \nduring a conference with the House of Representatives to assure that \nadequate field office staffing is maintained not only in Rhode Island \nbut throughout the country. I welcome the opportunity to work with my \ncolleagues to help achieve this result.\n                         Customs Port of Entry\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I intended to offer an amendment that \nreflects my growing frustration with the Treasury Department's \nunwarranted unwillingness to grant the State of South Dakota's \napplication to obtain official designation as a U.S. Customs port of \nentry. Specifically, the amendment would have required the U.S. Customs \nService to state for the record to the Congress that the State of South \nDakota in fact qualifies for the designation as a port of entry under \nexisting laws and regulations.\n  Mr. President, South Dakota is the only State without a Customs port \nof entry. The State has been working with Customs and Treasury \nofficials for more than a year on this matter. There is no disputing \nthe fact that South Dakota has met all the necessary criteria set forth \nby the U.S. Customs Service for port of entry designation:\n  The Greater Sioux Falls area has a population in excess of 300,000 \nwithin the immediate service area.\n  The Greater Sioux Falls area is serviced by three major modes of \ntransportation--air, rail, and highway.\n  The potential Customs workload will exceed the requirement of 2,500 \nconsumption entries per year with no more than half of this number \nderived from any one business.\n  The State of South Dakota and the city of Sioux Falls have committed \nto optimal use of electronic data input.\n  Facilities for Customs--provided without cost to the Federal \nGovernment--will be provided and meet the specifications of the U.S. \nCustoms Service.\n  Unfortunately, even though South Dakota has met all the baseline \nrequirements needed to be designated full port status, Customs \ninitially proposed that the State accept a lesser user fee status. This \nrecommendation is unacceptable. First, as I have just stated, South \nDakota more than meets all necessary requirements for port of entry \ndesignation. In fact, our population base and number of potential \ncustoms entries actually exceeds the standards set by the U.S. Customs \nBureau. Therefore, I am convinced anything short of full port \ndesignation would unnecessarily and unfairly hinder international trade \nopportunities for South Dakota businesses.\n  Second, the Customs Service has been inconsistent in applying its own \ncriteria when making port designation determinations. The U.S. Customs \nCommissioner admitted that 35 to 40 percent of the existing 301 ports \nof entry do not meet the workload measurement criteria that Customs \nrequires for a new port of entry applicant. The amendment I intended to \noffer would have required the Customs Service to report the exact \nnumber of existing ports which do not meet minimal designation \nrequirements. I also have learned that because of budgetary \nconstraints, Customs will not approve any new port applications this \nyear, regardless of the merits of the applicant, and the fact that the \nadded costs for the new port are minimal.\n  Mr. President, we have more than 100 ports that have a status that \nthey could not qualify for if they applied today. Allowing these ports \nto retain their status while denying South Dakota its rightful \ndesignation defies common sense. It is a wasteful use of taxpayer \ndollars. It is wrong, plain and simple. \n\n[[Page S11556]]\n\n  Not only is it highly inefficient for the Federal Government to \ncontinue funding over 100 inefficient ports, but it is also highly \nunfair and counterproductive to a State's plans for economic \ndevelopment if the Federal Government denies a port of entry \ndesignation even if the State qualifies for it.\n  Clearly this issue is one of fairness--fairness to the taxpayers and \nbusiness men and women of South Dakota. The administration advocated \nthe passage of GATT and NAFTA as a way to increase international trade \nopportunities. South Dakota, the only State in the country without a \nCustoms presence, is precluded from capitalizing on new trade \nopportunities because a port designation is required before the State \ncan become a Foreign Trade Zone [FTZ]. South Dakota businesses are \nmoving out of the State because of a lack of an FTZ.\n  The refusal to grant South Dakota's port of entry application denies \na major agricultural exporter and burgeoning economy the opportunity to \ncompete on a level playing field with the rest of the Nation.\n  Mr. President, the State of South Dakota is right now working with me \nand my colleagues of the South Dakota delegation to try to convince the \nCustoms Service and the Treasury Department to grant the status our \nState rightly deserves. It is my understanding a positive resolution is \nimminent. I certainly hope so because my patience is being put to the \ntest. In the hope of reaching a renegotiated solution soon, I will not \noffer this amendment--an amendment that is more a reflection of my \nclear and growing frustration with this blatant unfairness being dealt \nto the people of South Dakota. I certainly hope I will not have to \npursue this option in the near future. South Dakota deserves its \nrightful place on the world economic stage. South Dakota deserves a \nport of entry. We qualify for it. We have earned it. It is long \noverdue.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I know of no other amendments. Does the \nSenator from Nebraska?\n  Mr. KERREY. No other amendments.\n  Mr. President, just one final statement. Earlier, I had praised all \nmy staff except for the staff person who wrote up my document asking me \nto thank the staff, and I would like to now thank Patty Lynch, chief \nstaff person for myself and the Appropriations Committee, for her fine \nwork on this bill.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would also like to take this opportunity \nto thank Senator Kerrey for working with me on this bill. We have a \ngood relationship. We have worked hard on the bill, and I think we have \naccomplished much.\n  I also wish to thank Patty Lynch, who has worked with our staff day \nin, day out. I thank Chuck Parkinson who has put in hours and hours of \nwork, and also my legislative director, Stewart Hall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is open to further amendment. If \nthere be no further amendment to be proposed, the question is on the \nengrossment of the amendments and the third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass?\n  So the bill (H.R. 2020), as amended, was passed.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERREY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \ninsist on its amendments to H.R. 2020, request a conference with the \nHouse on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and that the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint the conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  There being no objection, the Presiding Officer (Mr. Inhofe) \nappointed Mr. Shelby, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Kerrey, Ms. \nMikulski, Mr. Hatfield, and Mr. Byrd conferees on the part of the \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/05/senate-section/article/S11521-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I rise to congratulate our leader, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Packwood and others, who \njust went above and beyond the call of duty to bring together, I \nbelieve, a consensus welfare reform package here on the Republican \nside.\n  The leader, in a few minutes, is going to lay down that package for \nus to begin debate next week. Second to our efforts to balance the \nbudget, I think this is the next most important issue that we can deal \nwith in the Senate and one that I think is at the top of the minds of \nnot only the people of the United States who pay for the welfare system \nbut the people in it.\n  I think this is a bill that addresses the concerns of both those who \nare in the system and those who are paying for the system. The people \nwho are paying for the system are going to get more results, more \nvalue, for their tax dollars that they are contributing, and more \npeople are going to be helped into productive mainstream life in \nAmerica. That is a value to the people who are paying and, obviously, a \ntremendous value to the people who find themselves dependent on \nwelfare.\n  What the leader has done, I think, is truly extraordinary. In a very \ndifficult arena where we are trying to give authority back to the \nStates, you run into problems such as, What is fair? How much do you \ngive? And to what State based on what formula? We were able to, through \nthe tremendous work of the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, \novercome that and come up with a formula that I think works for \neveryone. It does not disadvantage any State and provides growth \nopportunities for those States who are really up against it with \nburgeoning populations of not only the overall population but of the \npoor in our country.\n  We have been able to handle the tough problems of how we are going to \nget work requirements and how many requirements. How many do we turn \nover to the States and how much do we retain here? In that partnership \nwe seek to establish how much do we allow the States to innovate and \nhow much do we want to oversee and require?\n  And I think the leader's proposals, again, struck the proper balance \nof a true partnership, not one that the current administration would \nhave you believe is a partnership where we will make all the decisions. \nYou come to us when you want to change anything, and we will tell you \nif we think it is OK to do that, in everything you do. That is not a \npartnership, no more than a student asking the teacher for permission \nto go to the bathroom. If the teacher says, ``No you've got to go back \nto your seat.'' It is the same thing. If the State wants to improvise, \nand the President says, ``No, you have to go back to your seat,'' that \nis not a partnership. To call that a partnership is absurd.\n  What we do is truly give authority, truly give discretion and give \ndollars, in some cases with strings, other cases \n\n[[Page S11557]]\nwithout. But it is a partnership. And it was carefully crafted, and I \nthink wonderfully done. And I am hopeful when we have this debate--\nthere will be debate--there will be amendments on the Republican side \nand amendments on the Democratic side to craft this bill over the next \nweek.\n  I think there will be a great debate here about the direction this \ncountry is going to take and the future of the role of Government in \nsolving people's problems.\n  Actually, one of the more innovative proposals that is in the \nleader's bill--also in other bills here--is to allow community groups \nto be the welfare agency, allow churches and community organizations \nand nonprofits who work in those neighborhoods to actually be the \nconduit agency to help and provide support for the poor in those \nneighborhoods--a radical concept of getting the government completely \nout and going to the people who care most, the neighbors, the pastors, \nthe community activists. It is a wonderful concept. It is a breath of \nfresh air in what seems to be a hopeless cycle of dependency that we \ncreated in this Federal Government welfare policy. It is dramatic \nreform.\n  You will hear, I am sure, some say, well, it does not go far enough, \nnot radical enough, does not change enough. And I am sure you will hear \nmany come to the floor and tell us how we are going to destroy \nneighborhoods and create mass homelessness and starve millions of \nchildren and, you know, the sky will fall. You will hear it from both \nsides. Usually, when that is the case, you get a pretty good feel you \nhave a good bill because you have not satisfied the far extremes of \neither side.\n  What we have done is taken a responsible approach, one I am very \nproud to be associated with. And before we got this debate underway, I \nwanted to congratulate the leader in his ability to forge this \ncompromise, which I truly believe will get overwhelming support on the \nRepublican side and get substantial support on the Democratic side of \nthe aisle. Because I know there are many on that side of the aisle who \nsee the problems in the current system and see this as a responsible \nremedy to that problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I know we are going to start this, but I want to thank the \njunior Senator from Pennsylvania, who comes from the House, who did a \nlot of work on the House side putting together welfare reform. And we \nhave been fortunate on this side of the aisle to have Senator \nSantorum's daily, hourly assistance on a very important piece of \nlegislation, bringing people together with diverse views. It is not \neasy. It is all about leadership. And I congratulate and commend the \nSenator from Pennsylvania for his extraordinary effort. And because of \nthat, largely because of that, I might add, I will be introducing the \nbill here following disposition of a number of amendments by our \ncolleagues in reference to the DOD bill.\n  I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/05/senate-section/article/S11556-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11557-S11574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Smith, I offer an \namendment which perfects section 120(h)(3) by clarifying that section \n120(h)(3) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and \nLiability Act of 1980 does not apply to long-term leases at military \nbases undergoing hazardous waste remedial action.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment has been cleared by the other \nside.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the minority side has no objections to this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond], for Mr. \n     Smith, proposes an amendment numbered 2252.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 468, strike lines 16 through 24 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     ``The requirements of subparagraph (B) shall not apply in any \n     case in which the transfer of the property occurs or has \n     occurred by means of a lease, without regard to whether the \n     lessee has agreed to purchase the property or whether the \n     duration of the lease is longer than 55 years. In the case of \n     a lease entered into after September 30, 1995, with respect \n     to real property located at an installation approved for \n     closure or realignment under a base closure law, the agency \n     leasing the property, in consultation with the Administrator, \n     shall determine before leasing the property that the property \n     is suitable for lease, that the uses contemplated for the \n     lease are consistent with protection of human health and the \n     environment, and that there are adequate assurances that the \n     United States will take all remedial action referred to in \n     subparagraph (B) that has not been taken on the date of the \n     lease.''.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, during the Armed Services Committee \nconsideration of S. 1026, Senator McCain and I introduced language to \namend section 120(h)(3) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response \nCompensation and Liability Act of 1980 [CERCLA], otherwise known as \nSuperfund, to allow for the use of long-term leases at former military \nbases undergoing hazardous waste remedial action.\n  The need for this language grew out of a lawsuit filed by the \nConservation Law Foundation [CLF] and the town of Newington, NH, which \ncharged that the Air Force had violated Superfund section 120(h) by \ntransferring contaminated parcels at Pease Air Force Base via long-term \nlease without an approved remedial design. In a decision dated August \n29, 1994, Judge Martin Loughlin of the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of New Hampshire, held that the Air Force's actions to provide \nlong-term leases to the State of New Hampshire were a violation of \nCERCLA. Not only has this decision placed a cloud over redevelopment \nefforts at Pease, but more important, it has helped to hinder the \nexpedited redevelopment of facilities across the Nation that are being \nclosed under the Base Closure and Realignment Act.\n  The language that was included in section 2824 of S. 1026 was \nintended to modify section 120(h)(3) of Superfund to provide that the \nDepartment of Defense may enter into long-term or other leases while \nany phase of the cleanup is ongoing. The amendment that I am offering \ntoday clarifies the language included in section 2824 to provide that \nnot only are existing leases appropriate, but future leases may be \nentered into after consultation between the EPA and DOD. I have worked \nclosely with Senators Chafee, Baucus, and Lautenberg, as well as the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of the Air force, in \ndeveloping this language, and I believe that it has been cleared by \nboth sides.\n  This amendment will not only eliminate a significant obstacle to the \nexpedited redevelopment of these bases, but it will give the Department \nof Defense more flexibility and creativity in placing these facilities \nback into productive use.\n  Again, I thank my colleague for working with me to adopt this \nimportant measure.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I urge the Senate adopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2252) was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to lay that motion on the table. \n\n[[Page S11558]]\n\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2253\n\n  (Purpose: To require a cost-benefit analysis of various options for \n  reorganization of the Army ROTC program and to delay reorganization \n   pending submission of a report on the results of the analysis to \n                               Congress)\n\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, this amendment requires the Secretary of \nDefense to complete a report on the effect of the closure of Fitzsimons \nArmy Medical Center on gulf war veterans and their families who suffer \nfrom health problems associated with Persian Gulf syndrome. That report \nmust also tell Congress how the Defense Department and the Army plan to \nprovide effective testing and treatment of those people.\n  Mr. President, last summer I held a field hearing out in Colorado on \nthe subject of gulf war illnesses. That experience proved to me that \nthe Persian Gulf syndrome is real and serious. Veterans complained of \nrespiratory illnesses, muscle and joint aches, and fatigue, as well as \na series of psychological symptoms. One family I know in Colorado \nwatched their son go from a robust, strong, and vigorous young man to a \nthin, weak, and depressed gulf war vet as a result of unexplained \nhealth problems stemming from his Persian Gulf service.\n  Many of these vets, and their families, relied on Fitzsimons for \ntesting and treatment. Fitzsimons is 1 of 15 regional medical centers \nfor conducting evaluations of Persian Gulf war illnesses. Last October, \nFitzsimons opened the Persian Gulf War Service Center to diagnose and \ntreat gulf war vets. In addition, Fitzsimons set up a Persian Gulf war \nhotline to get information and make appointments.\n  It is hard to underestimate the importance of Fitzsimons to the \nregional effort in support of gulf war vets. Fitzsimons provides \ninitial evaluations for vets in its immediate area, as well as assisted \nother medical facilities that could not handle the extra workload. \nFitzsimons is responsible for all gulf war cases that require more \nextensive evaluations and treatment. Fitzsimons organizes quarterly \nregional conferences on Persian Gulf war illness issues. The Fitzsimons \nhotline continues to generate three or four new referrals every day.\n  We are going to lose all those services when Fitzsimons closes. I say \nwhen it closes, because I am sure that Congress will vote to accept the \nBRAC recommendations, with or without my support. I want to make sure \nthat the Defense Department and the Army do not ignore these gulf war \nvets, and do not try to sweep their health problems under the rug.\n  Congress needs to know the DOD's plans to care for these people, and \nthat is why I proposed this amendment. I appreciate the help from my \ncolleagues on the Armed Services Committee on both sides of the aisle, \nand I thank them for agreeing to accept this amendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Campbell on his \namendment to require the Department of Defense to provide a report on \nthe impact the closure of the Fitzsimons Army Medical Center will have \non the treatment of Persian Gulf veterans suffering from illness \nassociated with service in that conflict. The amendment will ensure \nthat the Department \n\n[[Page S11559]]\nof Defense makes appropriate arrangements for care for these veterans \nand their families.\n  I support the amendment and urge its adoption.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I urge that the Senate adopt the \namendment.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2254) was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD.

SENSE OF SENATE ON THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONAL TEST \n                   AND EVALUATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Office of the Director of Operational Test and \n     Evaluation of the Department of Defense was created by \n     Congress to provide an independent validation and \n     verification on the suitability and effectiveness of new \n     weapons, and to ensure that the United States military \n     departments acquire weapons that are proven in an operational \n     environment before they are produced and used in combat.\n       (2) The office is currently making significant \n     contributions to the process by which the Department of \n     Defense acquires new weapons by providing vital insights on \n     operational weapons tests to be used in this acquisition \n     process.\n       (3) The office provides vital services to Congress in \n     providing an independent certification on the performance of \n     new weapons that have been operationally tested.\n       (4) A provision of H.R. 1530, an Act entitled ``An Act to \n     authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1996 for military \n     activities of the Department of Defense, for military \n     construction, and for defense activities of the Department of \n     Energy, to prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year \n     for the Armed Forces, and for other purposes'', agreed to by \n     the House of Representatives on June 15, 1995, contains a \n     provision that could substantially diminish the authority and \n     responsibilities of the office and perhaps cause the \n     elimination of the office and its functions.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the authority and responsibilities of the Office of the \n     Director of Operational Test and Evaluation of the Department \n     of Defense should not be diminished or eliminated; and\n       (2) the conferees on H.R. 1530, an Act entitled ``An Act to \n     authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1996 for military \n     activities of the Department of Defense, for military \n     construction, and for defense activities of the Department of \n     Energy, to prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year \n     for the Armed Forces, and for other purposes'' should not \n     propose to Congress a conference report on that Act that \n     would either diminish or eliminate the Office of the Director \n     of Operational Test and Evaluation or its functions.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, this is a sense of the Senate that the \nSenate should not recede to the House provision that would abolish DOD \nDirector of Operational Test and Evaluations.\n  I believe it has been cleared on the other side.\nMr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment \nwith my friend the Senator from Delaware, Senator Roth, that would \nexpress the sense of the Senate regarding the function of operational \nweapons testing in the U.S. Department of Defense.\n  In 1983, Senator Roth and I passed legislation in Congress creating \nthe Office of the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation in the \nPentagon. This office was designed to be an independent and objective \nvoice in the acquisition process, making sure that new weapons were \ntested in strong, realistic operational conditions before they were \nbuilt and sent into combat.\n  Before the creation of this office, the tests on new weapons overseen \nstrictly by those who were responsible for the development and \nproduction of these systems. Their strong financial and emotional \nattachment to the weapons being tested often compromised the integrity \nof the entire military acquisition process, and led to the fielding of \nweapons that simply did not work.\n  So the independent operational testing office was created to \neliminate the practice where ``the students were grading their own \nexams.'' Since its creation, this office has worked hard to restore \nintegrity and objectivity to DOD procurement. Our operational testers \ncurrently provide valuable information on the reliability and \neffectiveness of new weapons being developed and produced.\n  Mr. President, I was shocked to learn that the House version of the \nDOD authorization bill for fiscal year 1996 contained a provision to \neliminate the Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation \nand its important testing oversight function. The House legislation is \ndangerously misguided. In their apparent effort to streamline the \nOffice of the Secretary of Defense, the House National Defense \nCommittee has attempted to eliminate this important office and the \nresponsibility of operationally testing new weapons.\n  I am pleased that the Senate Armed Services Committee's bill does not \ncontain a similar provision. However, I am fully aware that this issue \nmust still be resolved in the House/Senate conference on this \nparticular legislation. As a result, Senator Roth and I, as co-authors \nof the legislation creating the testing office, feel strongly that the \nU.S. Senate must respond strongly to the provisions passed by our \nfriends in the House of Representatives.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Thurmond, and the ranking member, Senator Nunn, for accepting \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2255) was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I have to go to the telephone. I am \ngoing to ask the able Senator from Idaho to take over in my place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2256\n\n(Purpose: To revise the authority relating to awards for service during \n       the Vietnam era in order to authorize upgrades of awards)\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Lott, I offer an \namendment which would allow the Secretary of Defense or service \nsecretary to award appropriate decorations to Vietnam veterans. I \nbelieve this amendment has been cleared by the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne], for Mr. Lott, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2256.\n\n       On page 202, line 16, insert ``or upgrade'' after \n     ``award''.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, this side has no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2256) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2257\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford], for Mr. Nunn, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2257.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. \n\n[[Page S11560]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 137, after line 24, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . AUTHORIZING THE AMOUNTS REQUESTED IN THE BUDGET FOR \n                   JUNIOR ROTC.\n\n       (a) There is hereby authorized to be appropriated \n     $12,295,000 to fully fund the budget request for the Junior \n     Reserve Officer Training Corps programs of the Army, Navy, \n     Air Force, and Marine Corps. Such amount is in addition to \n     the amount otherwise available for such programs under \n     section 301.\n       (b) The amount authorized to be appropriated by section \n     101(4) is hereby reduced by $12,295,000.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I support the amendment to provide an \nadditional $12.2 million to the Junior ROTC Program. This will provide \na level of funding equal to that requested by the administration. While \nI believe that the JROTC Program is of value to local communities, I \ncontinue to be concerned that its growth in funding will displace \nhigher priority military programs during this era of declining defense \nbudgets. I believe that the Department of Defense and Congress need to \ncarefully scrutinize the growth of this program. Although current \nauthority allows the JROTC Program to expand to as many as 3,500 \nschools, I believe that this would place an undue burden on the defense \nbudget and therefore will seek to reduce this level of authority in \nfuture years. I urge the Department to exercise restraint when drafting \nits fiscal year 1997 budget request and not seek a growth in this \nprogram.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment that would \nfully fund the Department of Defense budget request for Junior ROTC. \nThe bill as reported, would freeze the program at the fiscal year 1995 \nlevel of funding, which would have the effect of precluding the \nDepartment's planned expansion to an additional 435 schools, covering \napproximately 30,000 students.\n  Junior ROTC is a nationwide partnership program between the military \nservices and high schools which emphasizes self-discipline, \ncitizenship, personal responsibility, and sound work habits. It \nfeatures classroom instruction, extracurricular activities, and summer \ncamp. The program has received strong support from high school \nfaculties, community leaders, and parents.\n  Junior ROTC makes an enormous contribution to our nation, both in \nterms of the impact on military recruiting and the impact on the \nindividuals and communities who benefit from this outstanding program.\n  In the early nineties, the program was substantially expanded as a \nresult of an initiative by Gen. Colin Powell and President Bush to \naddress the issues of citizenship and self-esteem among at-risk teens \nin the wake of the LA riots.\n  President Bush said that JROTC is ``a great program that boosts high \nschool completion rates, reduces drug use, raises self-esteem, and gets \nthese kids firmly on the right track.''\n  General Powell said:\n\n       With its emphasis on self-discipline, personal \n     responsibility, values, citizenship, and saying NO to drugs, \n     JROTC provides America's youth with positive incentives to \n     stay in high school and graduate. * * * I believe immediate \n     expansion of the JROTC program is the best opportunity for \n     the Department of Defense to make a positive impact on the \n     Nation's youth.\n\n  The present members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff strongly support the \nprogram, and I ask unanimous request that a letter dated August 3, \n1995, signed by all of the Chiefs be printed in the Record, and I urge \nthe adoption of the amendment.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                     The Chairman,\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are concerned about the recent \n     Committee markup that would freeze funding for the Junior \n     Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) Program at the FY \n     1995 levels--an action that would deny 435 high schools the \n     opportunity many have sought for years, the chance to host a \n     JROTC unit. This program has an 80-year track record of \n     success and historically has enjoyed strong bipartisan \n     support by the Congress. We hope that the Senate could adopt \n     appropriate modifications to the Committee's Bill (S. 1026).\n       The current expansion of the program was initiated by then-\n     Chairman Colin Powell, who recognized that JROTC offers young \n     people an opportunity to improve their sense of \n     responsibility, self-esteem, and citizenship, while offering \n     an alternative to drugs and violence. The program also \n     influences youth to stay in high school and graduate--\n     something we in uniform have long endorsed. Moreover, with a \n     per-student cost of about $500 annually, JROTC is a modest \n     investment in today's youth.\n       Recognizing such benefits, President Bush proposed, and the \n     Congress supported expansion of the program from 1,600 units \n     to 3,500. Under that authority, the Department currently is \n     executing the fourth installment of a 5-year expansion that \n     is slated to add 284 units during the next school year, plus \n     151 the following year. The Committee's Bill would truncate \n     that planned growth.\n       Frankly, there would be enormous challenges associated with \n     changing direction. Contracts for the soon-to-start 284 \n     schools largely have been accomplished, and faculty hiring \n     substantially is completed. Funding is committed, and JROTC \n     contracts with school districts generally require a 1-year \n     notice before a Military Department unilaterally may \n     terminate a unit. Nearly 70 percent of instructors for the \n     new units are hired and are in the process of relocating. \n     Millions of dollars for instructional materials, uniforms, \n     equipment and supplies are in-place or on-order--the start \n     date for classes is only a few weeks away! A display of \n     affected schools, by state, is attached.\n       We remain sensitive to the competing demands and choices \n     that must be made under tight budgets. Nonetheless, the \n     Services always have prioritized JROTC into their funding \n     plans, because we are so frequently reminded of the \n     contributions JROTC makes to America and to its youth. We \n     hope that the Senate can accord similar priority, and amend \n     the Committee's Bill to permit currently planned unit \n     activations to continue.\n           Sincerely,\n         John M. Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n           Staff; Dennis J. Reimer, General, U.S. Army Chief of \n           Staff; C.C. Krulak, General, U.S. Marine Corps \n           Commandant; W.A. Owens, Vice Chairman of the Joint \n           Chiefs of Staff; J.M. Boorda, Admiral, U.S. Navy Chief \n           of Naval Operations; Ronald H. Fogleman, General, U.S. \n           Air Force Chief of Staff.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the bill as reported would freeze the \nprogram at the fiscal year 1995 level of funding for the Junior ROTC. I \nbelieve it has been cleared on the other side.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. We have cleared this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2257) was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2258\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Nunn and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford], for Mr. Nunn, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2258.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 109, strike out lines 1 and 2 and insert the \n     following in lieu thereof: by inserting ``of the reserve \n     components and of the combat support and combat service \n     support elements of the regular components'' after \n     ``resources''.\n       On page 109, strike out line 11 and all that follows \n     through line 2 on page 110.\n       On page 110, in line 3, redesignate subsection (d) as \n     subsection (c).\n       On page 403, insert the following between line 16 and line \n     17:\n\n     SEC. 1095. EXTENSION OF PILOT OUTREACH PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 1045(d) of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1993 is amended by striking out ``three'' and \n     inserting ``five'' in lieu thereof.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, this amendment clarifies the authorities \nconcerning the Civil-Military Cooperative Action Program and that would \nextend the pilot program for reducing the demand for illegal drugs.\n  On a bipartisan basis, Congress established the Civil-Military \nCooperative Action Program (10 U.S.C. 410) in the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 1993. The purpose was to build upon \nthe longstanding tradition of the Armed Forces--acting as good \nneighbors on a local level--in applying military resources to assist in \nworthy \n\n[[Page S11561]]\ncivic projects when they would not be competing with the private \nsector.\n  The statute required DOD to develop a coordinated program so that DOD \ncould insure that such programs were consistent with national policy of \nprotecting military readiness and avoiding competition with the private \nsector; DOD could share information among commands about useful ways to \nprovide such assistance; and DOD could coordinate requests for \nassistance to avoid duplication among DOD activities and between DOD \nand other Federal agencies.\n  The statute requires DOD to establish a ``Civil-Military Cooperative \nAction Program'' to ``use the skills, capabilities, and resources to \nthe Armed Forces to assist civilian efforts to meet the domestic needs \nof the United States.'' It further requires DOD to establish advisory \ncouncils on the regional, State, or local level, as appropriate, \ncomprised of representatives from business, civic, and social service \norganizations, and Federal, State, and local agencies. The advisory \ncouncils provide recommendations on projects and program guidance. In \naddition, DOD is required to issue regulations governing the types of \nassistance, and guidance to assure nonduplication of public service and \nnoncompetition with the private sector.\n  The Civil-Military Cooperative Action Program builds upon a \nlongstanding tradition of military commanders serving as good \nneighbors--coordinating training activities and providing assistance to \nlocal communities to help with worthy civic projects. The statutory \nprogram is designed to ensure that these efforts are conducted in \naccordance with national goals--that is, they must be consistent with \nreadiness and there must be no competition with the private sector or \nother public activities.\n  At a time when we are providing over $250 billion in funding for \ndefense--and when defense is the only segment of the Government \nreceiving a substantial budget increase--it is no\n time to tell our communities that the military cannot or will not \nprovide assistance consistent with military readiness and training.\n\n  The civil-military cooperation cannot and should not be a military \nmission. But there is no reason why the Armed Forces cannot conduct \ntraining--particularly in terms of the activities of support troops--in \na manner that can have incidental benefits to civilian society.\n  A good example is medical screening. When troops go on cold weather \ntraining in Alaska, why shouldn't the medics assist medically \nunderserved communities with screening and basic medical supplies--\nparticularly when the shelf-life of those supplies will expire if not \nused?\n  The bill as reported by the committee makes a number of useful \nchanges in the current statutory authority to emphasize military \nreadiness, but several improvements are needed in the language \nrecommended by the committee.\n  The bill as reported would restrict the program to the reserve \ncomponents. My amendment would make it clear that the program also \napplies to the combat support and combat service support elements of \nactive duty regular components.\n  The bill as reported would eliminate Federal agencies labor unions \nfrom participation in the advisory councils. The advisory councils were \ndesigned to bring together business, civic, and government leaders to \nensure that there is no private sector competition and no duplication \nof services offered by other public agencies. We should not exclude \nFederal agencies and labor unions from the process since that could \nlead to unnecessary duplication of Federal and private sector services.\n  My amendment does not affect the provision of the bill providing that \nthe management of the program should not be located under the Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs. Since the program clearly \napplies to the active and the reserve components, oversight should be \nprovided by the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. \nIt is my expectation that the expertise and experience of those who \nhave been responsible for the program to date would be relied upon by \nthe Under Secretary in his oversight of this program.\n  My amendment also extends for 2 years the pilot outreach program to \nreduce demand for illegal drugs, authorized by section 1045 of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995. The pilot \nprogram has been reviewed by the Rand Corp. and has generally received \ngood reviews. There has been insufficient opportunity at this point, \nhowever, to determine the long-term effectiveness of the program, so a \n2-year extension of the pilot is warranted.\n  Mr. President, I note that the Department of Defense appropriations \nbill for fiscal year 1995, as reported by the Appropriations Committee, \nfully funds the administration's request for the Civil-Military \nCooperative Action Program and the related Challenge and Starbase \nPrograms. That funding is fully consistent with the continuing \nauthority provided by the Armed Services Committee for these important \nprograms.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I support the amendment to allow the \nDepartment of Defense to continue the Pilot Outreach Program another 2 \nyears. I further support the perfecting language regarding the Civil \nMilitary Cooperation Program. I believe that these programs can be of \ngreat value, however, I am concerned when scarce defense dollars are \nearmarked for these programs that do not significantly enhance national \nsecurity. I note with approval that this will not be the case in this \nsituation. I urge the Department of Defense to refrain from requesting \nfunds for these programs in the future since there are so many more \npressing military requirements that continue to go unfunded. It is my \nhope that these programs will continue to provide valuable services to \nlocal communities using funds that are more appropriate to their \nmission.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, this clarifies the authority concerning the \nCivil Military Cooperative Action Program.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2258) was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2259\n\n  (Purpose: To amend section 381 to make the National Defense Sealift \n  Fund available for expenses of the entire National Defense Reserve \n                                 Fleet)\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE.

By authorizing the \nconveyance of the property to the city of Forsyth, we will meet a \nhousing need for the elderly and provide a recreation area for the \ncommunity.\n  Although we considered the amendment during the markup of this bill, \nthe subcommittee had not received the appropriate General Services \nAdministration [GSA] screen certifying that no other Federal agency had \na need for the property. The subcommittee therefore agreed to defer \naction on the conveyance until the GSA cleared the property for \ndisposal. We now have that clearance and are prepared to recommend to \nthe Senate to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. President, Senator Glenn and I believe the GSA screen is an \nessential step toward maximizing the use of our Federal resources. We \nhave already submitted all the land conveyances contained in the House \nbill to the GSA for review and will apply the same criteria to those \nconveyances as we have to this amendment.\n  I thank Senator Glenn for his cooperation and urge the adoption of \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the amendment offered by Senator McCain and \nmyself concerns a land issue which the Readiness Subcommittee \nconsidered during its markup proceedings.\n  The amendment authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to convey 58 \nacres of property located at the Radar Bomb Scoring Site, Forsyth, MT, \nto the city of Forsyth, MT. The Air Force plans to vacate the few \nhousing facilities and to declare the property excess to its needs. In \nreceiving the property, the city of Forsyth must continue to use the \nfacilities for housing purposes. The city of Forsyth has a justified \nneed for these facilities to house the elderly in the community.\n  The subcommittee recognized the local community's needs and the Air \nForce's desire to vacate and dispose of the property. However, the \nmembers of the Readiness Subcommittee chairman agreed to defer action \non the proposal until the General Services Administration [GSA] \ncompleted an expedited screening of the property to determine if any \nFederal agencies had an interest in the property.\n  Requiring GSA to screen the property is in keeping with my concern \nthat we should not give away property without protecting the interests \nof the Federal Government.\n  On July 11, GSA reported back to the subcommittee that no Federal \ninterests in the property were expressed. In addition at Senator \nMcCain's and my request GSA made a preliminary valuation of the \nproperty. GSA estimates that the property is worth $700,000.\n  In keeping with the subcommittee's agreement, Senator McCain and I \nurge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment to \nthe defense authorization bill which would transfer land at the Air \nForce Complex at Forsyth, MT, to the community.\n  This amendment makes sense. The Air Force will be releasing this \nfacility in the near future and the community will benefit greatly by \nacquiring this property. It is a win-win situation for the Air Force \nand the community.\n  The city of Forsyth has met all necessary requirements and the \nconveyance is noncontroversial. They will use the property for \naffordable housing for retirees, assist the hospital and nursing home \nin their expansion plans, and assure that the facility is cared for and \nimproved rather than allowed to deteriorate.\n  This is clearly a positive solution and provides the highest and best \nuse for the property. The community of Forsyth should be commended for \ntheir tireless work on this project.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, this has been cleared by the other \nside.\n  Mr. FORD. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2260) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2261\n\n  (Purpose: To authorize a land conveyance, Radar Bomb Scoring Site, \n                            Powell, Wyoming)\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators McCain and \nGlenn, the chairman and ranking members of the Readiness Subcommittee, \nI offer an amendment which conveys approximately 24 acres comprising \nthe radar bomb scoring site, Powell, WY, to the northwest board of \ntrustees, Powell, WY.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne], for Mr. McCain, \n     for himself and Mr. Glenn, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2261.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 487, below line 24, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2838. LAND CONVEYANCE, RADAR BOMB SCORING SITE, POWELL, \n                   WYOMING.\n\n       (a) Authority to Convey.--The Secretary of the Air Force \n     may convey, without consideration to the Northwest College \n     Board of Trustees (in this section referred to as the \n     ``Board''), all right, title, and interest of the United \n     States in and to a parcel of real property (including any \n     improvements thereon) consisting of approximately 24 acres \n     located \n\n[[Page S11563]]\n     in Powell, Wyoming, which has served as the location of a support \n     complex, recreational facilities, and housing facilities for \n     the Radar Bomb Scoring Site, Powell, Wyoming.\n       (b) Condition of Conveyance.--The conveyance authorized \n     under subsection (a) shall be subject to the condition that \n     the Board use the property conveyed under that subsection for \n     housing and recreation purposes and for such other purposes \n     as the Secretary and the Board jointly determine appropriate.\n       (c) Reversionary Interest.--During the 5-year period \n     beginning on the date that the Secretary makes the conveyance \n     authorized under subsection (a), if the Secretary determines \n     that the conveyed property is not being used in accordance \n     with subsection (b), all right, title, and interest in and to \n     the conveyed property, including any improvements thereon, \n     shall revert to the United States and the United States shall \n     have the right of immediate entry onto the property.\n       (d) Description of Property.--The exact acreage and legal \n     description of the property conveyed under this section shall \n     be determined by a survey satisfactory to the Secretary. The \n     cost of the survey shall be borne by the Board.\n       (e) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary may \n     require such additional terms and conditions in connection \n     with the conveyance under this section as the Secretary \n     considers appropriate to protect the interests of the United \n     States.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, Senator Glenn and I are offering an \namendment to convey approximately 24 acres comprising the radar bomb \nscoring site, Powell, WY, to the Northwest College Board of Trustees. \nThis conveyance like the one in the previous amendment has been \nscreened by the GSA for other Federal use and declared to be excess to \nthe Government.\n  I recommend the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the amendment offered by Senator McCain and \nmyself concerns a land issue which the Readiness Subcommittee \nconsidered during its markup proceedings.\n  The amendment authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to convey 24 \nacres of property located at the radar bomb scoring site, Powell, WY, \nto the Northwest College in Powell, WY. The Air Force plans to vacate \nthe facilities as early as August 1995. In receiving the property, the \ncollege must continue to use the facilities for housing purposes and \nrecreational purposes. The college has a justified need for these \nfacilities to house and support students at the college. The Northwest \nCollege Task Force, which includes several members of the Wyoming \nLegislature and the Powell Chamber of Commerce, and the Air Force \nsupport this proposal.\n  The subcommittee recognized the college's needs and the Air Force's \ndesire to vacate and dispose of the property. However, the members of \nthe Readiness Subcommittee Chairman agreed to defer action on the \nproposal until the General Services Administration [GSA] completed an \nexpedited screening of the property to determine if any Federal \nagencies had an interest in the property.\n  Requiring GSA to screen the property is in keeping with my concern \nthat we should not give away property without protecting the interests \nof the Federal Government.\n  On July 11, GSA reported back to the subcommittee that no Federal \ninterests in the property were expressed. In keeping with the \nsubcommittee's agreement, Senator McCain and I urge the adoption of the \namendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I want to compliment Senator McCain and Senator Glenn, \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Readiness Subcommittee, for \ntheir work on this amendment and their continuing efforts to ensure \nthat Federal property is properly screened for use by other Federal \nagencies before it is conveyed to the private sector.\n  Mr. President, I understand that both these bomb scoring sites at \nPowell, WY, and Forsyth, MT, have been screened by the General Services \nAdministration for potential use by other Federal agencies and that \nthere is no interest. Therefore, I support the amendment and the \ntransfer to the local government entities for use to improve housing, \neducation, and recreation.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I would simply like to add my strong \nsupport for this bill and in particular, for the provision relating to \nthe land conveyance of the former Air Force radar bomb scoring site \nnear Powell, WY.\n  This provision properly authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to \nconvey, without consideration, to the Northwest College Board of \nTrustees, all right, title, and interest of the United States--in and \nto--the parcel of real property consisting of approximately 24 acres \nlocated in Powell, WY.\n  This parcel also includes facilities such as a commissary and post \nexchange, as well as housing facilities that the Northwest College will \nmost surely put to good use almost immediately.\n  The Northwest College Task Force, several members of the Wyoming \nLegislature and the Powell Chamber of Commerce have all endorsed the \nre-use proposal submitted by the Northwest College. Northwest College \nwill use the facilities to help to alleviate their acute student \nhousing shortage and for other educational and classroom purposes.\n  Mr. President, I sat on the Northwest College Board for 8 years and I \ncan certainly attest to the fact that this is a great community \ncollege. One of the best.\n  This transfer of Air Force property will be well noted and greatly \nappreciated by the community of Powell, WY and the college, as they \nface continued growth into the 21st century.\n  I would like to offer my deepest thanks to Senator Thurmond, Senator \nBurns, and Senator Nunn for their efforts--as well as their fine staff \nrepresentatives--in this endeavor. They have all been so supportive of \nthe Wyoming delegation's efforts regarding this provision, and I do \ngreatly appreciate that. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, this has been cleared by the other \nside.\n  Mr. FORD. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2261) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2262\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding establishment of \n  Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps units in schools on Indian \n                             reservations)\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Pressler, I offer \nan amendment which expresses the sense of the Senate that Indian \nreservations receive full consideration in selection of future JROTC \nsites.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne], for Mr. Pressler, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2262.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 343, after line 24, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1036. ESTABLISHMENT OF JUNIOR R.O.T.C. UNITS IN INDIAN \n                   RESERVATION SCHOOLS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Defense \n     should ensure that secondary educational institutions on \n     Indian reservations are afforded a full opportunity along \n     with other secondary educational institutions to be selected \n     as locations for establishment of new Junior Reserve \n     Officers' Training Corps units.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise to offer a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment which states that as the Junior Reserve Officers Training \nCorps [JROTC] programs expands in the future, the Department of Defense \nwill seek to expand JROTC opportunities in schools on Indian \nreservations that seek to participate in the JROTC program. \nUnfortunately, only six of the Nation's 3,500 schools currently \nparticipating in the JROTC program are located on Indian reservations.\n  The JROTC program helps our young people acquire the skills that will \nserve them the remainder of their lives. To achieve this goal, the \nJROTC curriculum includes such topics as American citizenship, history, \nself-discipline, goal-setting, ethics, responsibility, and integrity. \nIn short, the JROTC program helps motivate young men and women to \nbecome better American citizens. I believe the JROTC program is a \nvaluable addition to any high school's educational curriculum.\n\n[[Page S11564]]\n\n  Many challenges face native American youth today. Too many Indian \nchildren grow up without having the opportunities or options available \nto help them achieve their full potential. Native American youth too \noften enter adulthood without the necessary skills to contribute to \ntheir local communities. As a result, they are unable to reap the \nbenefits or meet all the responsibilities of parenthood, citizenship, \nand employment.\n  Today's native American youth hold within them the key to the future \nof native American communities. In their heads, hands, and hearts are \nthe tools to a better life for them, their family, and their community. \nAs their elected representatives, we can help prepare these young \npeople for more productive lives by expanding the learning \nopportunities available to them. The JROTC program is one option that \nif made more available on native American reservations, could make a \nbig contribution to young people seeking to make a difference for \nthemselves. I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee for their cooperation with this amendment. I intend \nto work with Secretary Perry and the other leaders of our Armed Forces \nin determining how we can achieve the goal of a greater JROTC presence \non native American reservations. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I support this amendment expressing the \nsense of the Senate that secondary educational institutions on Indian \nreservations be afforded full and equal opportunity to be selected as \nlocations for establishment of new Junior Reserve Officers' Training \nCorps units.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I believe this amendment has been \ncleared with the other side.\n  Mr. FORD. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Cohen, I offer an \namendment that would amend section 1012 of the bill. Section 1012 \nauthorized the transfer of several ships to certain foreign countries \nunder the authority of 10 USC 7307(b)(1). It contained a waiver of the \nrequirements contained in the Arms Export Control Act and the Foreign \nAssistance Act to formally notify certain congressional committees of \nthe terms of transfer. While inclusion of this waiver reflected an \nestablished practice of several years duration, these committees have \nnow reaffirmed their preference for formal notification.

Mr. President, this is an amendment containing a series \nof clarifying changes to the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of \n1994. These are part of a number of changes that the administration has \nasked us to make to the legislation in light of experience with \nimplementation of the new law. The Members of the Senate will note that \ntitle 8 of the defense authorization bill contains a number of these \nrelatively minor changes to title 10 of the United States Code to \nadvance the streamlining of the acquisition process. The changes in my \namendment would affect other parts of the United States Code that are \nnot solely within our committee's jurisdiction. This amendment has been \ncoordinated with the Committees on Governmental Affairs and Small \nBusiness. It has been cleared on both sides. I ask that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I believe this has been cleared by the other side.\n  Mr. FORD. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2266) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2267\n\n (Purpose: To strike out provisions that amend title 38, United States \n                 Code, relating to veterans' benefits)\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne], for Mr. Thurmond, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2267.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 381, beginning on line 5, strike out ``(a)'' and \n     all that follows through ``Activities.--'' on line 6.\n       On page 381, strike out lines 13 through 16.\n       On page 403, strike out lines 5 through 16.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, this amendment clarifies how we will \ndeal with three issues with which the Armed Services Committee shares \nan interest with the Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  Our bill includes three provisions which are of interest to the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I am \npleased that Senator Simpson, chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, and I have been able to agree on how our two Committees will \nwork together to ensure the needs of both Departments are accommodated.\n  This amendment strikes section 1094, ``Extension of the Vietnam \nEra,'' and section 1075(b) which would eliminate a joint DOD-DVA report \nwhich the Veterans' Affairs Committee would like to retain. I have been \nassured that the Veterans Affairs' will work in their legislation to \nextend the Vietnam era as requested by the Army.\n  As for the joint DOD-DVA report, the Armed Services Committee \neliminated a large number of unneeded or outdated reporting \nrequirements. It was not our intention to eliminate any report for \nwhich there is a valid requirement. I agree to retain this DOD-DVA \nhealth care sharing report.\n  The Veterans Affairs' Committee also has an interest in section 644 \nwhich makes the maximum coverage under the servicemen's group life \ninsurance plan automatic. The change in the amount of coverage \nautomatically available to those who elect to participate in the \nservicemen's group life insurance plan is important to the Department \nof Defense and contributes to improved quality of life for service \nmembers and their families. I have worked closely with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee to develop \nthis legislation. I am pleased that we have been able to make this \nchange in a cooperative manner.\n  I thank Senator Simpson, the chairman, and Senator Rockefeller, the \nranking member, of the Veterans' Affairs Committee for their assistance \nas \n\n[[Page S11566]]\nwe addressed these issues of mutual interest. Together we have been \nable to move forward with legislation which is beneficial to active and \nreserve military personnel and veterans.\n  I understand this amendment has been agreed to on both sides and I \nurge its adoption.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I believe this has been cleared.\n  Mr. FORD. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2267) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2268\n\n (Purpose: To establish and maintain a Battlefield Integration Center \n      for the integration of missile defense warfighting pillars)\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senators Shelby and Heflin and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne], for Mr. Shelby and \n     Mr. Heflin, proposes an amendment numbered 2268.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (a) On page 32, before line 20, section 201(4) is amended \n     by adding the following new subsection:\n       (c) 475,470,000 is authorized for Other Theater Missile \n     Defense, of which up to $25,000,000 may be made available for \n     the operation of the Battlefield Integration Center.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the Army's Space and Strategic Defense \nCommand has created a promising concept for the integration of the \npillars of missile defense. Currently, there are no integrated \nwarfighting scenario simulations available for a comprehensive \nintegration of active defense, passive defense, attack operations and \nbattlefield management. SSDC proposes to make fully operational a \nbattlefield integration center to provide this virtually needed \nservice. Certainly, the gulf war demonstrated that missile defense is \nnot simply missile intercept.\n  Instead, comprehensive missile defense involves a myriad of \nactivities ranging from the preparation of civilian populations for \nattack to the active suppression of an enemy's missile capabilities. \nWithout coordination between these elements, we cannot maximize our \nmissile defense capabilities. Increased coordination and integrated \nbattlefield simulations will allow us to fully utilize these \ncapabilities and create far more effective and comprehensive missile \ndefense plans.\n  In addition, the integration and coordination offered by the BIC is \nnot a distant technology. The computing and communications hardware is \nalready in place that will allow the BIC to create missile defense \nplans for actual theater and regional conflicts involving U.S. forces. \nThe BIC will instantaneously allow U.S. commanders to download and \nreceive comprehensive missile defense battle plans based upon the \nexisting ground conditions.\n  The BIC is a cost-effective, immediately available resource that will \nfill a large void in our missile defense system and I thank the Senate \nfor its support.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, this would authorize funds for the \nBattlefield Integration Center, which is very important for our theater \ndefense program.\n  This has been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. FORD. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2268) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2269\n\n    (Purpose: To clarify the use of existing technologies under the \n requirements relating to national missile defense system architecture)\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford], for Mr. Heflin and \n     Mr. Shelby, proposes an amendment numbered 2269.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 58, line 13, insert ``, except that Minuteman \n     boosters may not be used as part of a National Missile \n     Defense architecture'' before the period at the end.\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, this is an amendment which would prevent \nthe use of Minuteman missile boosters as part of an NMD architecture. \nThe reason for this amendment is the clear fact that using these \nboosters in this fashion would be a clear violation of the START I \nTreaty.\n  The START I Treaty is the true centerpiece of modern arms control. I \nam confident that no member of this body supports abandoning this \ntreaty, so I hope this amendment will enjoy the full support of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, this amendment would prevent the use of \nMinuteman missile boosters as part of the NMD architecture.\n  I understand it has been cleared.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. This amendment has been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2269) was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2270\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Director of the Ballistic Missile Defense \nOrganization to establish a Ballistic Missile Defense Technology Center \n      within the Space and Strategic Defense Command of the Army)\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford], for Mr. Shelby and \n     Mr. Heflin, proposes an amendment numbered 2270.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 69, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 242. BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY CENTER.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--The Director of the Ballistic Missile \n     Defense Organization shall establish a Ballistic Missile \n     Defense Technology Center within the Space and Strategic \n     Defense Command of the Army.\n       (b) Mission.--The missions of the Center are as follows:\n       (1) To maximize common application of ballistic missile \n     defense component technology programs, target test programs, \n     functional analysis and phenomenology investigations.\n       (2) To store data from the missile defense technology \n     programs of the Armed Forces using computer facilities of the \n     Missile Defense Data Center.\n       (c) Technology Program Coordination With Center.--The \n     Secretary of Defense, acting through the Director of the \n     Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, shall require the \n     head of each element or activity of the Department of Defense \n     beginning a new missile defense program referred to in \n     subsection (b)(1) to first coordinate the program with the \n     Ballistic Missile Defense Technology Center in order to \n     prevent duplication of effort.\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment, creating a \nBallistic Missile Defense Technology Center, is to improve the \nefficiency of the BMD technology program, in the face of a shrinking \ntechnology budget. With the increased emphasis on acquisition of \ntheater missile defense systems, clearly justified by the imminent and \nexpanding theater missile threat, the BMD technology budget has been \nsqueezed to the point that built-in technical obsolescence of emerging \nBMD systems is a serious possibility. In effect, we are eating our seed \ncorn.\n  This amendment recognizes that because the BMD technology budget is \ndangerously close to an inadequate level, it is critically important \nthat the dollars that are available are spent wisely. We must be \nvigilant to avoid \n\n[[Page S11567]]\nduplication of effort and waste of funds on technologies of \nquestionable priority. With all three services, and other agencies, \nspending BMD technology dollars on related areas of technology, the \nopportunities for duplication are clearly evident. Further screening \nand coordination of candidate technology tasks is urgently needed to \nassure that scarce technology funds are properly allocated.\n  The U.S. Army Space and Strategic Command, an organization that has \nbeen at the forefront of BMD research and development for 40 years, is \nthe ideal center for carrying out the necessary screening and \ncoordination of BMD technology. Acting as executive agent to the BMD \noffice, this organization can bring an unparalleled record of technical \nexperience and performance excellence to this challenging coordination \nfunction. In the current BMD technology program, this organization is \nimmersed in all of the critical BMD technologies and it has a core of \nengineers and scientists that can immediately assume a coordination \nrole. It constitutes a ``smart buyer'' of BMD technology, proven over \ntime, and it can contribute immensely to a more efficient utilization \nof the technology budget.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, this amendment establishes a ballistic \nmissile defense technology center within the strategic defense command \nof the army.\n  This has been cleared.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. It has been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2270) was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I move to lay that on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2271\n\n(Purpose: To revise Section 1055 concerning military cooperation from a \n            United States Policy to a sense of the Congress)\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the base realignment and closure process \nhas been a necessary evil we have all had to endure in order to reduce \nmilitary infrastructure to a size appropriate for our smaller, post-\ncold war military. While most of us have supported the spirit of this \nmeasure, few would insist that improvements to the process are \nunnecessary.\n  Earlier this year I offered S. 803 in hopes of dramatically \nstreamlining the process and accelerating the economic recovery time of \naffected communities. I withdrew this amendment at the urging of the \nDepartment of Defense, in order to allow the Department time to \ncomplete and promulgate regulations they were in the process of \ndesigning to accomplish similar goals. I am pleased to say that their \nwork had been fruitful.\n  The amendment we now offer seeks to address those issues that remain \nproblematic; some for the Department of Defense and others for \ncommunities directly affected by base closures.\n  The most common complaints arising from communities participating in, \nand affected by, surplus military base disposal include: lack of equity \nfor all parties participating in the process, and, extensive lapses of \ntime between closure decision and ultimate reuse.\n  The latter of these two issues seems to be adequately addressed by \nthe Department of Defense's new regulations, as we had hoped for. It \nappears that DOD's plan offers a realistic approach to the process that \nallows for flexibility where the process requires it and strict time-\nlines where they are appropriate. The former issue, equity among \nparties interested in reusing former military property, is dealt with \nin the amendment we now offer.\n  Through the first three rounds of base closure, be have witnessed how \ndifficult it is to dispose of excess military real estate. While the \nBRAC process was not created to provide disproportionate benefits to \nspecific groups of individuals, it became apparent quite early that \nthis was in fact an unintended consequence.\n  Our amendment would put an end to these practices. This legislation \nlevels the playing field by limiting opportunities to acquire property \nto those that exist by working with the recognized Local Redevelopment \nAuthority.\n  We have the opportunity to alleviate many significant concerns held \nby communities that will undergo change as a result of the 1995 BRAC \nround. This amendment is simple. This amendment improves a process that \nis greatly in need of improvement. This amendment provides a \ndesperately needed solution; we cannot fail to act.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] which would improve \nthe base closure process by giving more control to the local community \nin reuse and redevelopment decisions. I am happy to be an original \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  Last year I helped draft legislation that exempts military bases from \nthe McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. This legislation, the Base \nClosure Community Redevelopment and Homeless \n\n[[Page S11569]]\nAssistance Act of 1994, passed Congress and was signed into law by the \nPresident last October.\n  Under the new legislation, instead of being given the right of first \nrefusal to base property, homeless assistance providers were given a \nseat at the reuse table with the local redevelopment authority. After a \nreuse plan is developed on the local level, the Secretary of Housing \nand Urban Development would review the plan to ensure that the needs of \nthe homeless were met. After the HUD Secretary's approval, the \nSecretary of Defense would dispose of the buildings and property at the \nclosing base.\n  While the new law is a substantial improvement over the old base \nclosure and reuse law as well as the McKinney Act provisions, I think \nmore should be done to empower communities, put base reuse decisions in \nthe hands of local officials, and remove a Federal mandate.\n  The McCain/Feinstein amendment amends the new law by requiring the \nSecretary of Defense to simply consult with the Secretary of HUD over \nthe reuse plan that is development by the redeveloped authority; it \nremoves HUD's veto power over the reuse plan.\n  Homeless assistance providers would still be guaranteed a seat at the \nreuse table, and redevelopment authorities would still be required to \naccept expressions of interest for base property by homeless assistance \ngroups and other interested parties. In addition, the Secretary of HUD \nwould still review the final reuse plan to ascertain if the needs of \nthe homeless have been met, and have the ability to consult with the \nredevelopment authority.\n  However, instead of the Secretary of HUD approving or disapproving \nthe reuse plan, the Secretary of Defense would make the final decision. \nThe Secretary of Defense would simply consult with the Secretary of HUD \nbefore making any property disposal decisions. Furthermore, the local \nredevelopment plan--developed by the local community and local elected \nofficials--would be given deference by the Secretary of Defense.\n  I believe this amendment would substantially improve last year's Base \nClosure Community Redevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act. Yet, this \namendment does not go as far as the House of Representative's version \nof the Defense Authorization Act, which contains an amendment offered \nby Representatives Bilbray and Molinari.\n  The Bilbray-Molinari amendment would completely repeal the Base \nClosure Community Redevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act and exempt \nall military bases from the McKinney Act.\n  In addition to disrupting the base reuse process, the Bilbray-\nMolinari amendment would prevent homeless assistance providers from \nacquiring base property at no cost--even when communities want to \ntransfer property for homeless use--and would not guarantee that they \nhave a seat at the reuse table.\n  The McCain-Feinstein amendment still guarantees that homeless \nassistance providers will have an opportunity to acquire base property, \nbut it puts base reuse decisions in the hands of local officials who \nknow what is best for their communities.\n  This amendment also contains some other provisions that will assist \nin the base closure and reuse process. These include:\n  Base realignments: This provision would make a technical amendment to \nthe Base Closure Community Redevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act of \n1994 by including base realignments, in addition to base closures. \nCurrent law requires the Secretary of Defense to dispose of base \nproperty in accordance with the sometimes outdated Federal Property and \nAdministrative Services Act regulations. This provision allows the \nSecretary, in consultation with GSA, to prescribe general policies and \nmethods for utilizing excess property and disposing of surplus property \nwhich are unique to base closure situations.\n  Lease back of base closure property: This provision would allow base \nclosure property, that is still needed by the Department of Defense or \nanother Federal agency, to be transferred to a local redevelopment \nauthority provided that the LRA leases back the property to DOD or the \nFederal agency on favorable terms, that is: long term lease, nominal \nrent. This provision is needed to improve the planning and \nredevelopment of base closure property by providing local communities \nwith certainty over the future use and availability of the property \nshould the DOD or Federal occupant vacate.\n  Leasing proceeds: This provision would require that leasing proceeds \nfor property at closing or realigning bases be deposited into the BRAC \naccount, rather than a special Treasury account. This would treat \nleasing proceeds in the same fashion as sale proceeds from BRAC \nproperty. It would make additional funds available to base closure and \nenvironmental clean-up activities, thus speeding transfer of property \nto the local community and, thus, economic redevelopment of a closing \nbase.\n  The McCain-Feinstein amendment makes various changes to existing law \nto improve the base closure and reuse process, and speed economic \nredevelopment of closing military bases. I urge my colleagues support \nof this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the U.S. Conference of \nMayors in support of this amendment be placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 The United States\n\n\n                                         Conference of Mayors,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: At our June 1995 meeting, The U.S. \n     Conference of Mayors adopted the attached resolution on ``A \n     National Action Plan on Military Base Closings.'' I would \n     draw your attention to item 6. This was adopted in response \n     to the House passed Molinari amendment to the 1996 Defense \n     Authorization Bill which would repeal the 1994 BRAC and \n     Homeless Assistance Act.\n       The U.S. Conference of Mayors believes that local \n     governments which do not desire transfer for homeless \n     services should not be subject to HUD approval of their reuse \n     plans. However, we support the ability of the federal \n     government to transfer property under existing law \n     provisions, at no cost to the local community or the homeless \n     provider, if so desired by the local government.\n       As the mayor of a city with a naval facility on the 1991 \n     BRAC closure list, I am concerned about the House amendment \n     which would deny us the ability to implement the homeless \n     provisions of our local reuse plan.\n       In Seattle, our adopted reuse plan has a substantial \n     homeless component of which we are proud and anxious to \n     implement, as it will greatly add to our services to assist \n     homeless people in becoming self-sufficient. Without the \n     property transfer positions nullified in the Molinari \n     amendment, our critical homeless component is seriously \n     jeopardized.\n       Therefore, I urge you to provide for local flexibility and \n     control while not eliminating the homeless property transfer \n     provisions for local governments desiring such transfer.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Norman B. Rice,\n                                    Mayor of Seattle, President.  \n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, we have agreed to accept the amendment by \nSenators McCain and Feinstein which aims to revise and improve the base \nclosure and realignment process. This is certainly not the first time \nthat we have tried to improve this process. In 1993, under President \nClinton's leadership, we passed significant revisions to the BRAC \nprocess which were aimed to give local, impacted communities a greater \nsay in their own future. Those provisions were aimed to help speed up \nthe process by which communities can initiate economic development \nefforts to move forward. Again last year another effort was made to \nrevise the BRAC property disposal process. This effort resulted in \nlegislation which quickened the property disposal process, with \nparticular regard to addressing the needs of the homeless.\n  While I believe that the amendment before us addresses some \nlegitimate problems in the current BRAC process, for example it gives \nDOD the authority to utilize recent regulations promulgated by GSA, I \nam concerned about some particular areas. Overall, my greatest concern \nis that we have not given the existing process a chance to work. Only \nlast month did DOD issue its regulations, developed after extensive \ninteragency and public comment, which implement the 1993 and 1994 BRAC \nlegislation I just mentioned. Communities are having a difficult enough \ntime coping with the closure of \n\n[[Page S11570]]\ntheir particular base without trying to determine which set of \nregulations, or which property disposal process, they need to operate \nunder. Should this legislation result in another rewrite of the \nimplementing regulation, it will translate directly into further delays \nfor the communities.\n  I am also concerned about the lease-back provisions of this \nlegislation. I am concerned that the Federal Government's interest be \nfully protected in the cases where it retains a presence at a closing \nbase. I recognize the need for communities to have assurances that \nfuture Federal use of these facilities is compatible with their own \nreuse plan. However, we must protect all taxpayers' interest as well. \nWith regard to this provision as we proceed to conference with the \nHouse, I intend to seek the comments of the General Services \nAdministration to ensure that appropriate controls are in place for \nfuture leasing.\n  Another concern is whether the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment has the necessary authority to provide their comments to \nthe local redevelopment plan--and ensure that these comments are \naddressed. This provision is particularly important with regards to the \nconcerns of the homeless.\n  Mr. President, as we proceed to conference, I look forward to \nobtaining additional comments of the relevant officials in the \nDepartment of Defense, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, \nas well as the General Services Administration regarding these \nprovisions.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as a Member representing a State that is \nexperiencing the realities of base closure, I welcome any effort to \nexpedite the closure process and protect the redevelopment plan \ndeveloped by the communities. This is a good step in that direction. It \nstrengthens the Secretary of Defense's authority to review the base \nreuse plan and whether or not it has given appropriate consideration to \nthe needs of the homeless or other interested party.\n  Mr. President, I especially support the provision of this amendment \nwhich allows the military departments to convey base closure property \nto local redevelopment authorities, if the property is still required \nby the department or another Federal agency, as long as the needed \nproperty will be leased back for a 50-year renewable lease at no cost. \nThe change satisfies both the Department of Defense or other Federal \nneed for available property, while at the same time providing the local \ncommunity with certainty over future use of the property should the \nFederal agency leave. It also provides the local community with the \nownership it often needs to redevelop the base to make needed \ninfrastructure improvements. The permissive authority of this \nlegislation is designed to be used infrequently and primarily for small \nparcels or individual buildings which are surrounded by property which \nwill be conveyed to the local community.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will be of great benefit to \nCharleston, SC, and other communities throughout the Nation. I support \nthe amendment and urge its adoption.\n  Mr. FORD. This has been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Yes, this has been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2272) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2273\n\n  (Purpose: To improve the provision relating to restoration advisory \n                                boards)\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford], for Mr. Kohl, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2273.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 89, strike out lines 13 through 22 and insert in \n     lieu thereof the following:\n       ``(2) The commander of an installation may obtain technical \n     assistance under paragraph (1) for a technical review \n     committee or restoration advisory board only if--\n       ``(A) the technical review committee or restoration \n     advisory board demonstrates that the Federal, State, and \n     local agencies responsible for overseeing environmental \n     restoration at the installation, and available Department of \n     Defense personnel, do not have the technical expertise \n     necessary for achieving the objective for which the technical \n     assistance is to be obtained;\n       ``(B) the technical assistance is likely to contribute to \n     the efficiency, effectiveness, or timeliness of environmental \n     restoration activities at the installation; and\n       ``(C) the technical assistance is likely to contribute to \n     community acceptance of environmental restoration activities \n     at the installation.''.\n       On page 90, line 20, strike out ``until'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``after March 1, 1996, unless''.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, my amendment seeks to improve the provisions \nrelating to restoration advisory boards by helping them to acquire \nindependent technical assistance. These boards are a crucial way of \ngetting the community around a Defense Department cleanup site involved \nin the process. For these local groups to feel confident that the \nDepartment of Defense is adequately cleaning up these sites, they may \nneed to rely on outside sources of information and analysis. Many times \ncommunities are unwilling to accept the Government's claim that they \nhave done the job adequately, and want an external source to help them \nconsider the data. The provisions in this amendment will make sure that \nthey have access to the administrative and independent technical \nsupport they seek.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter I received from Gary Vest, \nActing Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environmental Security be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                     Office of the\n\n\n                                   Under Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Herbert Kohl,\n     United States Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kohl: The purpose of this letter is to respond \n     to your July 27, 1995, letter to the Deputy Under Secretary \n     of Defense (Environmental Security) concerning Section 323 of \n     S. 1026, the FY 1996 Department of Defense Authorization \n     Bill. Responses to the five questions in your letter are \n     provided in the Enclosure.\n       Your continued support and commitment to community \n     participation and the Defense Department's restoration \n     advisory board effort is deeply appreciated. If you need \n     additional information, my staff point of contact for this \n     matter is Ms. Marcia Read at (703) 697-9793.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Gary D. Vest,\n\n                                     Acting Deputy Under Secretary\n                              of Defense (Environmental Security).\n       Enclosure.\n\n  Questions of Senator Herbert Kohl Concerning Section 323 of S. 1026\n\n       Question 1. Will the language in Section 323 in any way \n     obstruct the creation or continued operation of any \n     restoration advisory boards? Do you have any legal opinions \n     on this question?\n       Answer 1. Our legal opinion is that Section 323 would cause \n     the Department of Defense (DoD) to suspend operation of \n     existing restoration advisory boards (RABs) until regulations \n     are promulgated, as there would be no available funding \n     source to meet RAB administrative expenses.\n       Question 2. Is the language consistent with the regulatory \n     promulgation the Defense Department has initiated to provide \n     technical assistance to RABs?\n       Answer 2. The Department has not yet promulgated any \n     regulations to provide technical assistance to RABs. The \n     Department did publish a notice in the Federal Register \n     requesting public comments on various options for providing \n     technical assistance funding to RABs. The closing date to \n     submit written comments was July 24, 1995, and we are \n     currently evaluating the comments we received. We will \n     propose a draft regulation later this year.\n       Question 3. Would this language preclude any RAB from \n     receiving technical assistance if the RAB wants to receive \n     technical assistance independent of the installation \n     commander or the environmental contractor providing services \n     to the installation?\n       Answer 3. We believe that the precondition outlined in \n     subsection (e)(2) would effectively eliminate independent \n     technical assistance for RABs. It appears that installation \n     commanders would be unable to make the requisite finding \n     regarding the absence of technical expertise without \n     undermining the credibility of the installation's own \n     technical expertise. We understand the existing authority to \n     provide technical assistance was intended to provide RAB \n     members the \n\n[[Page S11571]]\n     means to procure independent, technical advice from a source outside of \n     the Department, and that this authority was not predicated on \n     a finding that the Department's technical experts were in any \n     way deficient.\n       Question 4. Does the Defense Department support Section 323 \n     as currently drafted?\n       Answer 4. The Department is reviewing Section 323 and is \n     considering appealing the language.\n       Question 5. After taking into account administrative costs, \n     would there be funds available for technical assistance for \n     RABs under this provision?\n       Answer 5. It is difficult to estimate precisely how much of \n     the $4 million would be strictly designated for technical \n     assistance. However, with 200 RABs already in existence, $4 \n     million may not be enough to meet even the administrative \n     expenses that may be needed to effectively operate these \n     RABs.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, this clarifies language in the bill \nconcerning environmental restoration advisory boards.\n  This has been cleared.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. It has been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2273) was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE.

Mr. President, I support this amendment to provide an \nadditional $40 million for overseas humanitarian, disaster, and civic \naid programs. Although I am concerned with any defense funds being \nearmarked for this non-defense mission, I note with approval that this \nis a significant reduction from the administration's requested level.\n  I further support the provision requiring the Comptroller General of \nthe United States to report to the congressional defense committees any \nactions necessary to ensure that future funding for these activities is \nprovided through the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development or any successor agency. I think that it is \nimportant that the Federal Government provide funds for activities \nthrough appropriate sources. In this case, future international \nhumanitarian and disaster assistance activities should be funded \nthrough those agencies which have primary responsibility for these \noperations. This amendment moves us toward this goal which will allow \nthe American people better insight into how their tax dollars are \nspent.\n  I will continue to strive to eliminate nondefense spending from the \nDOD budget. I urge the administration to assist in these efforts by \nrefraining from including such programs in the DOD budget request. The \nDepartment of Defense is a military organization and should dedicate \nits resources to those programs which make the greatest contribution to \nnational security.\n  Mr. NUNN.

SENSE OF SENATE ON MIDWAY ISLANDS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) September 2, 1995, marks the 50th anniversary of the \n     United States victory over Japan in World War II.\n       (2) The Battle of Midway proved to be the turning point in \n     the war in the Pacific, as United States Navy forces \n     inflicted such severe losses on the Imperial Japanese Navy \n     during the battle that the Imperial Japanese Navy never again \n     took the offensive against United States or allied forces.\n       (3) During the Battle of Midway, an outnumbered force of \n     the United States Navy, consisting of 29 ships and other \n     units of the Armed Forces under the command of Admiral Nimitz \n     and Admiral Spruance, out-maneuvered and out-fought 250 ships \n     of the Imperial Japanese Navy.\n       (4) It is in the public interest to erect a memorial to the \n     Battle of Midway that is suitable to express the enduring \n     gratitude of the American people for victory in the battle \n     and to inspire future generations of Americans with the \n     heroism and sacrifice of the members of the Armed Forces who \n     achieved that victory.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Midway Islands and the surrounding seas deserve to \n     be memorialized;\n       (2) the historic structures related to the Battle of Midway \n     should be maintained, in accordance with the National \n     Historic Preservation Act, and subject to the availability of \n     appropriations for that purpose.\n       (3) appropriate access to the Midway Islands by survivors \n     of the Battle of Midway, their families, and other visitors \n     should be provided in a manner that ensures the public health \n     and safety on the Midway Islands and the conservation and \n     natural resources of those islands in accordance with \n     existing Federal law.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, historic victories such as Midway and \nGettysburg and Yorktown and Normandy are remembered by memorializing \nthe hallowed ground upon which American blood was shed. Historians rank \nthe Battle of Midway as one of the most decisive naval battles of all \ntime. The Midway Islands, and the surrounding seas where so many \nAmerican lives were sacrificed, deserve to be memorialized as well, and \nthat is what this amendment suggests.\n  Mr. President, victory at Midway was the turning point in the Pacific \nTheater. During the month of June 1942, a badly outnumbered American \nnaval force, consisting of 29 ships and other units of the armed \nforces, under the overall command of Adm. Chester W. Nimitz, out-\nmaneuvered and out-fought 350 ships of the combined Japanese Imperial \nFleet. The objectives of the Japanese high command were to occupy the \nMidway Islands and destroy the United States Pacific Fleet, but the \nforces under the command of Admiral Nimitz completely thwarted Japanese \nstrategy.\n  The outcome of the conflict, Mr. President, was remarkable given the \nfact that U.S. forces were so badly outnumbered. The United \nStates lost 163 \n\n[[Page S11572]]\naircraft compared to 286 Japanese aircraft. One American aircraft \ncarrier, the U.S.S. Yorktown, and one Destroyer, the U.S.S. Hamman, \nwere destroyed. On the other hand, the Japanese Imperial Navy lost five \nships, four of the ships being the Imperial Navy's main aircraft \ncarriers. Almost as devastating was the loss of most of the experienced \nJapanese pilots. At the end of the day, 307 Americans had lost their \nlives. The Japanese navy lost 2,500 men.\n  The heroism of many of the American servicemen at Midway often \nrequired the ultimate sacrifice. Many of the Marine pilots, flying worn \nout and inferior planes, did not live to celebrate the victory at \nMidway. All but five torpedo-plane pilots who attacked the Japanese \naircraft carrier task force--without protective air cover--were shot \ndown. These pilots undoubtedly knew they were flying to an all but \ncertain death.\n  So severe was the damage inflicted on the Imperial Japanese Navy by \nAmerican airmen and sailors, that Japan never again was able to take \nthe offensive against the United States or Allied forces, and the rest, \nas they say, is history.\n  Mr. President, victory over the Japanese achieved, of course, by men \nand women from all the U.S. Armed Forces. Certainly at Midway, elements \nof each of the services--Navy, Marines, and U.S. Army Air Corps--were \nheavily engaged, closely coordinated, and paid a high price for their \nbravery. The Midway Islands should be memorialized to honor the \ncourageous efforts of all the services when they were called upon to \ndefend our Nation and its interests.\n  The sacrifice and heroism of these men should never be forgotten--it \nis vital that our sons and daughters never forget what their fathers \nand grandfathers sacrificed for freedom. The Battle of Midway should be \nmemorialized for all time, on the Midway Islands, on behalf of a \ngrateful Nation.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. This has been cleared.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 2275) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2276\n\n (Purpose: To authorize the Secretary of the Navy to establish a crash \n                 attenuating seats acquisition program)\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE.

I believe this has been cleared.\n  Mr. NUNN. I urge adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2276) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE.

On behalf of Senator Smith, I offer an amendment that \nwould express the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of Navy should \nname the LHD-7 the U.S.S.

Iwo Jima (LPB-2), the first ship in a \n     class of amphibious assault ships.\n       (3) This Act authorizes the LHD-7, the final ship of the \n     Wasp class of amphibious assault ships that will replace the \n     Iwo Jima class of ships.\n       (4) The Navy is planning to start building a new class of \n     amphibious transport docks, now called the LPD-17 class. This \n     Act also authorizes funds that will lead to procurement of \n     these vessels.\n       (5) There has been some confusion in the rationale behind \n     naming new naval vessels with traditional naming conventions \n     frequently violated.\n       (6) Although there have been good and sufficient reasons to \n     depart from naming conventions in the past, the rationale for \n     such departures has not always been clear.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--In light of these findings, \n     expressed in subsection (a), it is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Secretary of the Navy should:\n       (1) Name the LHD-7 the U.S.S.

Mr. President, in the bill there is a provision, which I \nauthored and the committee accepted, which would establish a defense \nmodernization account for, really, the first time in my knowledge. That \nsays to the various departments of the military--Army, Navy, Air Force, \nMarine Corps--that they can have a defense modernization account for \nany savings, including money they might otherwise feel compelled to \nspend at the end of the year to make sure they had fulfilled their \nbudget expectations. That is where a lot of waste goes on in budgeting, \nand in the Government, is the urge and incentive we inadvertently \ncreate in Government to have all Government agencies, not just the \nArmy, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, to spend money at the end of \nthe year so they look like they needed all the money they originally \nbudgeted.\n  Much waste comes from that. So the provision in the bill I offered \nwill establish a defense modernization account and say to each one of \nthe services that they will be able to take any savings that they are \nable to accumulate during the year and put it in this modernization \naccount. They will be able to use it, subject to the approval of the \nCongress. It has to come back through the Congress, either through \ndirect appropriation or through an approval process that we go through \nhere. It has to come back. But subject to that, this money will be able \nto be used where we need it most and that is in long-term \nmodernization.\n  Senator Glenn has been for this proposal, but he had some concerns \nabout it. This amendment would modify the defense modernization account \nto limit the total balance of the account, to limit the number of years \nthe funds may remain in the account, to provide for additional \noversight, and to sunset the account.\n  I agree to all of these proposed changes and I urge the adoption of \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared with \nour side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2279) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. On this amendment I thank Senator Glenn, Senator Grassley, \nand Senator Roth. They were very helpful in developing these amendments \nand they will be having statements on this amendment on Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I understand that concludes the action, is \nthat correct, tonight? It concludes action on the amendments that have \nbeen cleared. We cleared about 25 amendments. We appreciate that very \nmuch. We hope to return to the DOD authorization bill on Monday. I know \nthere are some negotiations going on with reference to a couple of \nareas.\n  If that is negotiated successfully, we hope to be back on the DOD \nbill late Monday afternoon, and wrap it up. I think in a couple of \nhours we can complete action on this bill. I know there are a few \namendments out there that might require rollcall votes. If we reach the \nnegotiation agreement, there could be at least one amendment that will \nrequire a vote, plus the others we did not complete last night. But I \nunderstand there will be very few amendments that we would have to deal \nwith.\n  So, hopefully we can complete action on the DOD authorization bill on \nMonday. It is a very important bill. It takes a long time. Last year I \nthink it was 6 days. It always takes a great deal of time because it is \nso involved and so complex. It involves the defense of our Nation, so \nit deserves a great deal of consideration and debate.\n  I thank the managers.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, yesterday during consideration of S. 1026, \na statement by Senator Roth was inadvertently left out of the \nstatements that were made at the time Senator Cohen introduced his \namendment entitled the Information Technology Management Reform Act of \n1995. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Roth's \nstatement be printed in today's Record and that it be printed in the \npermanent Record for Friday, August 4, 1995, immediately following \nSenator Cohen's statement on the information technology amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/05/senate-section/article/S11557-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11574-S11575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT REFORM ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the amendment just introduced by \nSenator Cohen, myself and others will make a big step toward reforming \nthe way the Government buys and uses information technology. The \nFederal Government will spend $27 billion this year on information \ntechnology, and the GAO has reported to me that much of it will be \nwasted unless significant reforms are made. I want to congratulate \nSenator Cohen for his leadership in investigating the problems in the \nGovernment's acquisition of information technology. I also want to \nrecognize Senator Cohen for the clarity of his vision and for his \ncooperation in working with me to develop this important amendment.\n  Mr. President, there is no disagreement about the compelling need for \nreform in this area. The heart of this issue is that the Federal \nGovernment is not using computers to fix its outdated management \npractices. In January, the GAO reported to me that Federal managers do \nnot have the essential information needed to do their jobs, despite \nspending more than $200 billion over the last 12 years on computers. \nThe problem is that far too often, agencies buy computers just to have \none on each person's desk. The agencies buy computers like a junk food \njunkie buys bacon double cheese burgers and candy bars. There's lots of \nfat and sugar, but little healthy substance.\n  There is a more subtle issue here that needs to be highlighted. \nModern organizations and management processes are required before \ncomputers can yield meaningful cost savings and capability \nimprovements. If Government does not make the necessary structural and \nprocess changes, then the $27 billion in spending on computers will be \nfor naught. All we will have achieved is inserting 1990's technology \ninto a 1950's organization. We will have several hundred billion \ndollars of new computers but no corresponding increase in capability.\n  Mr. President, instead of helping to solve problems, the Government \nprocess for buying and managing computer technology has become the \nproblem. Its reliance on a tangle of redtape and bureaucracy strangles \nevery effort to streamline and modernize Government operations. We must \nshift the bureaucracy from reliance on overburdened procedures and \nreports that no one reads; we must focus on results.\n  Numerous reports have documented this fact. GAO, the General Services \nAdministration, the Office of Management and Budget and others have all \nfound that these computer buys are poorly planned, take far too long, \ncost too much money and all too often produce systems that simply don't \nwork. Once delivered, these systems are managed using practices equally \nineffective.\n  Mr. President, GAO reported to me last January that developments in \nre-engineering and modern technology offer huge opportunities to reduce \ncosts and improve services. Yet, the Federal sector has largely failed \nto seize upon the moment. For example, GAO has found that a veteran has \nto wait an average of 151 days, nearly 4 months, to get paid by the \nVeteran's Administration for an original compensation claim. After \ncommitting nearly\n $700 million for computers and equipment to fix this problem, the \nwaiting time actually increased! It seems the agency failed to set \nperformance goals for its new equipment and did not consider whether or \nnot its claims process could be improved before being automated. By \nOctober 1994, claims processing time had gone up to 228 days. This is \nunbelievable and unconscionable!\n\n  In a separate report provided to me just this past Monday, GAO \nadvises that eleven federal agencies have problems with information \nmanagement or systems development that are serious enough to be listed \nas high risk programs. GAO explained that ``[t]he major reason for \nthese problems has \n\n[[Page S11575]]\nbeen the lack of a sound process for selecting which IT initiatives to \nfund and for overseeing their development.'' It is precisely because of \nthe great significance of this issue that I joined in developing this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, this amendment strikes at the heart of these problems \nby repealing the so-called Brooks Act which has controlled the way \ngovernment buys and manages information technology for the last 30 \nyears. The Brooks Act never worked as it was intended. Its reliance \nupon the submission of reams of paperwork through layers of bureaucracy \nhas not worked in the past. And, its tight bureaucratic controls are \nclearly not relevant to today, with information technology advancing \nexponentially in a highly competitive market.\n  Our amendment re-engineers this process, replacing red tape with a \nreliance on thorough, up-front investment planning and hands-on \nmanagement practices which focus on bottom line results. The new \nprocess is modeled on the best practices used by America's most \nsuccessful businesses. That model requires Government managers to focus \nlike a laser on anticipating difficulties and then fixing them before \nthey become problems. The amendment enables government agencies to \naccomplish these goals without additional paperwork or bureaucracy. \nYet, this new process preserves the advantages and safeguards embodied \nin the Competition in Contracting Act.\n  Nevertheless, Mr. President, I have four major concerns that must be \nmore fully addressed than the current amendment will permit. First, the \namendment may be interpreted as consolidating bid protests affecting \ninformation technology along with those from all other procurement. I \nam not satisfied that the case for such dramatic change has been made. \nThere is much debate about this kind of consolidation and several \nalternative approaches have been proposed. I intend to fully consider \neach of these and will keep an open mind during the next 2 months, as I \nwork on a comprehensive procurement reform bill.\n  Second, the current amendment does not address the excessive layers \nof bureaucracy in the Federal buying system which hang like a dead \nweight around the necks of Government program managers. This is a \ngovernment-wide problem not unique to information technology and not \naddressed by this amendment.\n  Third, I believe that we must do a better job of educating and \ntraining the entire acquisition workforce--not just those involved in \ninformation technology. I do not agree with those in the administration \nwho believe that we can fix acquisition horror stories with an \ninteragency review team. It is no replacement for well trained program \nmanagers, who have the skills and experience to prevent horror stories \nfrom occurring in the first place.\n  Lastly, I am convinced that we must move boldly to dismantle the \nexisting network of perverse personnel incentives which strangle the \nentrepreneurial spirit of Government program managers. We must move to \npaying people for good performance, rather than for growing the size of \ntheir program.\n  Mr. President, while the current amendment highlights important \nissues of good management in Government, we know that most of these \nproblems are not unique to information technology. They beg a broader \nsolution. Happily, last year's acquisition reform bill established the \nframework for solving these matters. This framework simply needs to be \nstrengthened. To achieve that purpose, Mr. President, the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, in cooperation with the Armed Services and Small \nBusiness Committees, has reassembled the bi-partisan staff-level \nworking group which produced last year's round of substantive \nacquisition reform. Our group has been charged with reviewing the \nentire spectrum of Government acquisition. We are assessing all \nacquisition reform legislation currently pending and have received \ninput from many other sources. The end result of our efforts will be a \nbroadly-gauged new bill which calls for major Governmentwide \nacquisition reform. We plan to move that bill forward in the fall with \nthe intent of enacting a Governmentwide comprehensive acquisition \nreform bill in the next several months.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/05/senate-section/article/S11574-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I also say, with reference to the schedule next week, in a \nmoment I will introduce the Work Opportunity Act of 1995. That debate \nwill begin in earnest on Monday morning, at 10:30 a.m. From 9 to 10:30 \nthere will be a period of morning business. But at 10:30 a.m. we will \nstart serious debate on the Work Opportunity Act of 1995. I assume \nthere will be a number of opening statements. Amendments can be \noffered. Votes can be expected on Monday. I do not know how long the \nopening statements will take. Of course, if we are able to go back to \nthe DOD authorization bill we would have votes on that on Monday.\n  So I urge my colleagues to stay in close contact with their offices. \nI assume there will not be any votes prior to--4:30, 5 o'clock will be \nmy best guess. It will be my hope we can complete the welfare reform \nmeasure, the Work Opportunity Act, next week. That is, Monday, Tuesday, \nWednesday, Thursday, Friday. There will not be a Saturday session next \nSaturday.\n  I guess, if necessary, if we were near completion, we will come back \nthen on the following Monday and try to complete action on the Work \nOpportunity Act of 1995. I have had a discussion with the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle. I have indicated to him that is our \nhope.\n  Also, there are a couple of appropriations bills we would like to, in \nour spare time, resolve next week. One is the Interior appropriations, \nwhich can be done in a matter of hours. And the other is the DOD \nappropriation bill, which will not be taken up until we complete action \non the DOD authorization bill. That is a very, very big money bill. \nThat might take as much as a day.\n  Now, obviously, I do not believe we can do all of those things next \nweek. I hope to be in a position on Monday or Tuesday to advise my \ncolleagues what to expect for the remainder of next week and the \nfollowing week.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/05/senate-section/article/S11575-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     COMMENDATION OF JILL MAYCUMBER\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise to thank Jill Maycumber who is \ndeparting my staff after nearly 5 years of outstanding service to me, \nto the Senate, and to Kansas.\n  Like many Senate staff, Jill began her Senate career as an intern in \nmy office. She quickly proved herself and became a key member of my \nstaff.\n  For a time, Jill served as our receptionist--no doubt about it, the \ntoughest job in Washington. But her outstanding people skills and deep \ndesire to help Kansans made Jill the right choice to head my regional \noffice in southeast Kansas.\n  When the massive floods struck the midwest in 1993, Jill Maycumber \ntirelessly crisscrossed the State, inspecting damage, and coordinating \nFederal assistance to flood victims. Hundreds of Kansans who have \nneeded a helping hand knew who to call. They have Jill Maycumber to \nthank.\n  Earlier this year, Jill returned to Washington to help run my Senate \noffice--not an easy task as my colleagues can attest. But most \nimportantly, Jill took the extra time to greet thousands of \nconstituents, always making sure that their visit to Washington and to \nmy office was a special event.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Jill Maycumber for her \noutstanding service to the Senate and to Kansas. Jill can be very proud \nof what she has accomplished--she has truly made a difference.\n  I extend my heartfelt thank you and best wishes to Jill in her new \ncareer.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/05/senate-section/article/S11575-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11575-S11602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      FAMILY SELF-SUFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

There is an old saying that ``everybody talks about the \nweather, but nobody does anything about it.''\n  For the past several years, that saying could also apply to welfare \nreform. Everyone talked about it, but nobody did anything about it that \nreally mattered.\n  That will change Monday, when we begin serious debate. In fact, it \nwill change today because we will introduce the substitute here in a \nmoment. But on Monday, the Senate will begin serious debate on the Work \nOpportunity Act of 1995.\n  There is a true national consensus to transform welfare from a \nprogram that does not work into one that does. It is my intention that \nonce the Senate begins to talk about welfare reform, we will continue \nuntil we actually have done something about it. And when all the \ntalking is done, I believe we will pass legislation that will transform \nwelfare from a failed system into one that succeeds in providing work, \nhope, and opportunity for many, many Americans in need.\n  At the center of our debate will be the legislation introduced this \nweek by 33 Senate Republicans including the entire Senate Republican \nleadership. I am also very proud that our legislation has the support \nof a majority of America's Governors. Hopefully, it is bipartisan, but \nI can say that there are 30 Republican Governors out of the 50 States, \nand 30 Republican Governors represent 70 percent of the people in \nAmerica, and every one of the 30 Republican Governors support our \nlegislation.\n  Our bill is based on three conservative principles:\n  First and foremost, welfare reform should be designed and run by \nthose closest to the problem--the States. Not by Washington, not by \nsome faceless, nameless bureaucrat but by the States, by the State \nlegislators and by the Governors and the people they appoint. We \nbelieve this is the key to true conservative reform. The Congress has \ndedicated itself to restoring the 10th amendment to the Constitution \nand to getting the Federal Government out of the mandate business, and \nStates should not have to play a game of \n\n[[Page S11602]]\n``mother may I'' with the Federal Government when it comes to welfare.\n  Second: Welfare programs should include a real work requirement which \nin no uncertain terms requires able-bodied welfare recipients to find a \njob rather than to stay at home or stay in a training program forever. \nAnd make no mistake about it; our legislation contains real work \nrequirements.\n  And third: No program with an unlimited budget will ever be made to \nwork effectively and efficiently. Therefore, we must put a cap on \nwelfare spending.\n  We will be discussing those principles in greater detail during the \ndebate. I believe the entire Senate, Republicans and Democrats, begins \nthis debate united in many ways. We begin united in the knowledge that \nour current welfare system is broke, and we begin united in a \ncommitment to fix it.\n  We have made valiant efforts in the past. And I see my colleague from \nNew York who is the expert on welfare and has been for some 30 years in \nmy memory and who has made a lot of suggestions that had we followed \nyears ago, we would not be in the trouble we are today; they were not \nfollowed. I hope that he will enlist in our efforts to make some rather \nradical changes.\n  That is not to say we are not going to have disagreements. I hope it \nis not going to be party line. In my view, the best we can do when it \ncomes to the Work Opportunity Act of 1995, or whatever title other \nMembers may have on their bills, is to work together, iron out some of \nthe problems we have, and have a big vote for change in this Senate \nChamber.\n  There will be a number of close votes during the debate, but by \nremembering what unites us, I feel confident we will pass a bill with \nwide bipartisan support. I hope this is a bill we do not have to go \nthrough the cloture exercise; that we do not have a filibuster either \nby amendment or by intent because it seems to me if we have--I know \nSenator Packwood, the chairman of the Finance Committee, will be \nleading the debate on this side. He is a very early riser. He will be \nwilling to start at 7, 6, 7:30, 8 o'clock, and so there will be--I do \nnot know how many literally--not hundreds of hours but 40, 50, 60 hours \nof debate, so hopefully we can move very quickly once we start on \nMonday.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2280\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I send to the desk my amendment to the underlying bill, \nH.R. 4 in the form of a first-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Dole] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2280.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n  Mr. DOLE. I know the amendment is probably several hundred pages.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. I just say for the information of all Senators, my first-\ndegree amendment will be printed and available for all Members by late \nMonday morning. We believe we have introduced it in a way that when \nsomeone offers an amendment, they can be sure they are going to get a \nvote on their amendment. Nobody is going to be able to second degree \nit. If the Senator from New York has an amendment, there will be a vote \non that amendment. It might be a tabling motion, but there will be a \nvote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  So I think we are ready to go, and I know the Senator from New York \nhas been waiting to make a statement. I appreciate his patience.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I first thank the distinguished majority leader, \nthe Republican leader, for the tone and the openness with which he \nbegins once again a welfare debate.\n  We did this 7 years ago with the Family Support Act of 1988. I had \nintroduced it a year earlier.\n  It was a bipartisan measure. It passed the Senate 96-1. President \nReagan signed it in the company of the Governors who had been so much \ninvolved, then chairman of the association, Governor Clinton of \nArkansas; the chairman of the committee of the Governors' Association \nconcerned with this matter; then-Governor Castle of Delaware, now \nRepresentative Castle.\n  I regret that the time now has seemingly come when we will be asked \nto put an end to the Federal commitment to sharing State efforts to \nprovide for the dependent children. They are a massive number. They \noverwhelm the capacity of our great cities. Would the Senator from \nKansas believe, for example, that in the city of Los Angeles, 62 \npercent of all children are on AFDC, in Chicago 44 percent, in New York \n28 percent, and in Detroit 79 percent? This is beyond--this is a social \nexperience which we have had, of which there is no counterpart.\n  We put in place legislation in 1988, which has been working. States \nhave been innovating. The results are beginning to appear. I will have \na bill which is offered in the Finance Committee, the Family Support \nAct of 1995, bringing it up to date as I believe we should. The \ndistinguished Democratic leader, with Senator Mikulski and Senator \nBreaux, will have measures. We will have amendments. We will have a \ngood debate. It need not be an endless debate. I hope the outcome will \nbe better than is now forecast. And we will see.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senate for giving me this time late in the \nday. I look forward to 10:30 on Monday morning when we will commence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Senator from New York.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/05/senate-section/article/S11575-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Liz has \nworked in the Senate for the past 5 years, first in the Senate Library \nas a legislative reference assistant, and then as the assistant morning \nbusiness editor of the Congressional Record. In addition to her duties \npreparing the morning business section of the Record, Liz can be found \nsitting at the corner of the Reporters' table in the well of the \nSenate, listening intently to our every word, ready to chase us down to \nretrieve those materials we have asked to have printed in the Record. \nWe will miss her dedication and wonderful sense of humor. On behalf of \nall Senators, I say farewell and wish her good luck in all her future \nendeavors.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me also associate myself with the \nremarks of the majority leader with regard to Elizabeth McDonough. We \nwill miss her. She has been a delight to work with. We wish her well as \nshe goes on to school and hope that she comes back frequently. She has \nbeen a very, very important member of the floor staff, and we are \ndelighted to have had the opportunity to work with her.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/05/senate-section/article/S11602-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11602-S11603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    BASE CLOSURE COMMUNITY REDEVELOPMENT AND HOMELESS ASSISTANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the 1994 Base Closure Community \nRedevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act Public Law 103-421, signed \ninto law October 25, 1994, applied not only to bases that would \nthereafter be designated for closure, but also to bases previously \ndesignated under the 1990 and 1988 Base Closure Acts, so long as the \nrecognized redevelopment authority for the base elected within 60 days \nafter enactment to proceed under the 1994 Act. The 1994 Act then set \nout a schedule for preparation, review, and approval of redevelopment \nplans and the ultimate disposal of property by the Government pursuant \nto such plans. This process will unavoidably extend beyond the end of \nthe current fiscal year. Indeed, regulations to guide \n\n[[Page S11603]]\nthe implementing agencies and local redevelopment authorities under the \n1994 Act will be published on Monday, August 7, 1995.\n  In order to fulfill the intent and purpose of the 1994 Act, the \nDepartment of Defense must retain authority to dispose of bases closed \nin the 1988 and 1990 Acts, beyond the end of the current fiscal year. \nUnfortunately, the General Services Administration's original \ndelegation of its authority to dispose of surplus property to the DOD \nwas by its own terms set to expire October 1, 1995. Particularly in \nlight of later amendments to the base closure laws which clarified that \nDOD's disposal authority was to extend beyond that date, GSA should \nrenew--indeed, it is required--to extend its delegation of authority.\n  This matter is of great interest to the local redevelopment authority \nin East Hanover Township, NJ, which is working within the 1994 Act to \nprepare a redevelopment plan for a small base closed under the 1988 \nAct. I understand that there are one or more bases around the country \nsimilarly situated.\n  I had intended to offer an amendment to make it absolutely clear that \nDOD's disposal authority continues beyond the current fiscal year, and \nmandate the appropriate delegation of authority by GSA. However, I have \nreceived assurances from the GSA that it fully intends to extend its \ndelegation of authority. I have also received a copy of a memorandum \nfrom DOD's general counsel's office expressing its view that DOD \nretains its disposal authority. In reliance on these statements, I will \nwithhold my amendment.\n  However, I would like to seek the commitment from the chairman and \nranking member that they will seek an appropriate legislative solution \nin conference, should it appear before conference is completed that, \nfor some reason, the delegation will not be renewed by the agencies.\n  Mr. THURMOND. It is certainly the intent of the committee that the \nDOD shall continue to exercise authority beyond October 1, 1995, to \ndispose of 1988 bases whose redevelopment authorities elected to \nproceed under the 1994 Act. The appropriate agencies are apparently on \ntrack to make sure that the authority is in place. However, if there is \na snag, I assure my colleague from New Jersey that we will be prepared \nto correct the matter in conference. In the meantime, I appreciate my \ncolleague's withholding his amendment at this time.\n  Mr. NUNN. I concur with the chairman and join in his commitment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank my distinguished colleagues. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full text of a letter to me from the General Services \nAdministration be placed in the Record, along with a memorandum from \nthe general counsel's office of DOD.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              General Services    \n                                                   Administration,\n\n\n                                     Public Buildings Service,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 1995.\n     Hon.

The delegation, \n     under its own terms, will expire on October 1, 1995.\n       Last week this Office received from DOD the Fiscal Year \n     1994 Annual Report, required by the current delegation, \n     detailing DOD's exercise of the Administrator of General \n     Services' disposal authority under the Federal Property and \n     Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended. As discussed \n     with Mr. Warren on July 25, 1995, receipt of this report was \n     requisite to our extension of the delegation.\n       We are in the process of reviewing DOD's report. Upon \n     completion of our review, we intend to transmit an extension \n     to DOD no later than August 31, 1995.\n       I hope this information is responsive to your concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 David L.

The Administrator's delegation to the \n     Secretary of Defense pursuant to this provision was issued \n     with an expiration date of September 30, 1995.\n       Under the 1988 BRAC Act, the authority of the Secretary to \n     carry out any closure or realignment ``shall terminate on \n     October 1, 1995,'' except that the termination of authority \n     ``shall not apply to the authority of the Secretary to carry \n     out . . . disposal of property of [1 military installations \n     closed or realigned under this title.'' BRAC Act at Section \n     202(c). Because the 1980 BRAC Act as originally enacted did \n     not contain any exemption from the general termination of \n     authority, the limited term delegation of authority by GSA \n     was entirely appropriate. However, as the 1988 BRAC Act is \n     currently written (as the result of amendment over the \n     years), there is no question that the Administrator of GSA is \n     obligated to delegate his authority to the Secretary of \n     Defense with respect to BRAC 1988 installations. This legal \n     conclusion has been agreed to by all parties within the \n     Department of Defense who have examined the issue, including \n     the Department of the Army, and it has been agreed to by Rich \n     Butterworth, the lawyer for GSA who is responsible for all \n     BRAC-related issues.\n       The Department of the Army has been acting as DoD's \n     executive agent for purposes of securing an extension to the \n     GSA delegation. It has shared a draft request for an \n     extension with GSA, and the only issue that arose as a result \n     was the fact that DoD had failed to submit a report on the \n     disposition of properties pursuant to the delegated authority \n     to GSA, GSA told the Army that it would not extend the \n     delegation until DoD submitted the required report, but it \n     also told the Army that there were no other impediments, \n     legal or otherwise, that would therefore with the issuance of \n     a new delegation.\n       In response to inquiries about the tardy report, work on \n     the report was promptly completed, and the report was \n     submitted from DoD to GSA more than two weeks ago. I have \n     been informed by GSA that there are no remaining barriers to \n     the issuance of an extended delegation.\n       The formal request for a new delegation, however, has not \n     yet been submitted by DoD. The request is being staffed by \n     the Department of the Army, and the Army anticipates that it \n     will clear its review process shortly after the end of this \n     week, I have requested the Army to forward the request to \n     your offices, to the attention of Robert Hertfeld, for prompt \n     proceeding.\n\n                                             Robert S.

Mr. President, the impression will not go away: The $4.9 \ntrillion Federal debt stands today as a sort of grotesque parallel to \ntelevision's energizer bunny that appears and appears and appears in \nprecisely the same way that the Federal debt keeps going up and up and \nup.\n  Politicians like to talk a good game--and ``talk'' is the operative \nword--about reducing the Federal deficit and bringing the Federal debt \nunder control.

I am also \npleased to transmit my written approval, authorization, and \ndetermination concerning the agreement, and the memorandum of the \nDirector of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency with \nthe Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement concerning the \nagreement. The joint memorandum submitted to me by the Secretary of \nState and the Secretary of Energy, which includes a summary of the \nprovisions of the agreement and various other attachments, including \nagency views, is also enclosed.\n  The proposed agreement with the Republic of Bulgaria has been \nnegotiated in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended \nby the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 and as otherwise amended. \nIn my judgment, the proposed agreement meets all statutory requirements \nand will advance the non-proliferation and other foreign policy \ninterests of the United States. It provides a comprehensive framework \nfor peaceful nuclear cooperation between the United States and Bulgaria \nunder appropriate conditions and controls reflecting our strong common \ncommitment to nuclear non-proliferation goals.\n  Bulgaria has consistently supported international efforts to prevent \nthe spread of nuclear weapons. It was an original signatory of the Non-\nProliferation Treaty (NPT) and has strongly supported the Treaty. As a \nsubscriber to the Nuclear Supplier Group (NSG) Guidelines, it is \ncommitted to implementing a responsible nuclear export policy. It \nplayed a constructive role in the NSG effort to develop additional \nguidelines for the export of nuclear-related dual-use commodities. In \n1990 it initiated a policy of requiring full-scope International Atomic \nEnergy Agency (IAEA) safeguards as a condition of significant new \nnuclear supply to other nonnuclear weapon states.\n  I believe that peaceful nuclear cooperation with Bulgaria under the \nproposed agreement will be fully consistent with, and supportive of, \nour policy of responding positively and constructively to the process \nof democratization and economic reform in Eastern Europe. Cooperation \nunder the agreement will also provide opportunities for U.S. business \nin terms that fully protect vital U.S. national security interests.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested \nagencies in reviewing the proposed agreement and have determined that \nits performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable \nrisk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, I have approved \nthe agreement and authorized its execution and urge that the Congress \ngive it favorable consideration.\n  Because this agreement meets all applicable requirements of the \nAtomic Energy Act, as amended, for agreements for peaceful nuclear \ncooperation, I am transmitting it to the Congress without exempting it \nfrom any requirement contained in section 123 a. of that Act. This \ntransmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both sections \n123 b. and 123 d. of the Atomic Energy Act. The Administration is \nprepared to begin immediately the consultations with the Senate Foreign \nRelations and House Foreign Affairs Committees as provided in section \n123 b. Upon completion of the 30-day continuous session period provided \nfor in section 123 b., the 60-day continuous session period provided \nfor in section 123 d. shall commence.\n                                                  William J.

VOLUNTEER FORCE FOR PEACE OPERATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) With the end of the Cold War, the United States is \n     clearly the undisputed world economic and military leader and \n     as such bears major international responsibilities.\n\n[[Page S11619]]\n\n       (2) Threats to the long-term security and well-being of the \n     United States no longer derive primarily from the risk of \n     external military aggression against the United States or its \n     closest treaty allies but in large measure derive from \n     instability from a variety of causes: population movements, \n     ehtnic and regional conflicts including genocide against \n     ethnic and religious groups, famine, terrorism, narcotics \n     trafficking, and proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       (3) To address such threats, the United States has \n     increasingly turned to the United Nations and other \n     international peace operations, which at times offer the best \n     and most cost-effective way to prevent, contain, and resolve \n     such problems.\n       (4) In numerous crisis situations, such as the massacres in \n     Rwanda, the United Nations has been unable to respond with \n     peace operations in a swift manner.\n       (5) The Secreatry-General of the United Nations has asked \n     member states to identify in advance units which are \n     available for contribution to international peace operations \n     under the auspices of the United Nations in order to create a \n     rapid response capability.\n       (6) United States participation and leadership in the \n     initiative of the Secretary-General is critical to leveraging \n     contributions from other nations and, in that way, limiting \n     the United States share of the burden and helping the United \n     Nations to achieve success.\n       (b) Report on Plan To Organize Volunteer Units.--Not later \n     than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, \n     the President shall submit a report to Congress setting \n     forth--\n       (1) a plan for--\n       (A) organizing into units of the Armed Forces a contingency \n     force of up to 3,000 personnel, comprised of active-duty \n     military personnel, who volunteer additionally and \n     specifically to serve in international peace operations and \n     who receive added compensation for such service;\n       (B) recruiting personnel to serve in such units;

Findings.--\n       (1) the ratified START I agreement has already led to \n     significant reductions in the number of nuclear warheads \n     targeted on the United States; and\n       (2) the START II agreement, once ratified, will lead to \n     further reductions of thousands of Russian nuclear warheads; \n     and\n       (3) it is in the national security interest of the United \n     States to have thousands of Russian missiles and warheads \n     retired and dismantled; and\n       (4) the Joint Chiefs of Staff have given enthusiastic \n     support for the START II agreement in testimony before the \n     Congress, certifying that it will add to the safety and \n     security of the United States; and\n       (5) the START II agreement helps to reduce the threat of \n     nuclear war and advances the non-proliferation interests of \n     the United States; and\n       (6) the full implementation of the START II agreement by \n     the Russian Federation will greatly consolidate control and \n     improve the security of the remaining warheads, reducing \n     opportunities for unauthorized access or theft of these \n     warheads; and\n       (7) the reduced nuclear forces for both countries will lead \n     to major cost savings for the United States military; and\n       (8) by the year 2003, the United States will still maintain \n     a robust deterrent force of 3,500 nuclear warheads; and\n       (9) the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, \n     Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on \n     Their \n\n[[Page S11625]]\n     Destruction (hereafter referred to as the ``Convention'') would \n     establish a comprehensive ban on chemical weapons, and its \n     negotiation has enjoyed strong, bipartisan Congressional \n     support and the support of the last six administrations; and\n       (10) the Convention requires participating states to \n     destroy their chemical arsenals and production facilities \n     under international supervision, which would accelerate \n     progress toward the disarmament of chemical weapons in a \n     majority of the states believed to harbor them; and\n       (11) the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General \n     John Shalikashvili, has testified in support of the \n     ratification of the Convention and stated that United States \n     military forces would deter and respond to chemical weapons \n     threats with robust chemical defenses and overwhelming \n     conventional forces; and\n       (12) the United States chemical industry assisted in \n     crafting an effective verification protocol and testified in \n     support of the Convention's ratification; and\n       (13) the United States intelligence agencies have testified \n     that the Convention will provide new and important sources of \n     information, through regular data exchanges and routine and \n     challenge inspections, to improve the ability of the United \n     States to assess the chemical weapons status in countries of \n     concern; and\n       (14) the Convention will gradually isolate and \n     automatically penalize states which refuse to join by \n     preventing them from gaining access to dual-use chemicals and \n     creating a basis for monitoring illegal diversions of those \n     materials; and\n       (15) Russia has signed the Convention but has not yet \n     ratified it, and there have been reports of continued Russian \n     testing and production of chemical weapons; and\n       (16) the Convention will impose a legally binding \n     obligation on Russia and other nations that process chemical \n     weapons to cease offensive chemical weapons activities and to \n     destroy their chemical weapons stockpiles and production \n     facilities: Now, therefore, be it\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that the United States \n     Senate--\n       (1) declares that it is in the national security interest \n     of the United States to duly ratify and fully implement the \n     deep cuts in strategic forces required by the START II arms \n     reduction treaty negotiated by Presidents Ronald Reagan and \n     George Bush, and Russian leaders Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris \n     Yeltsin; and\n       (2) declares that the Senate should take up consideration \n     of the START II Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention \n     for advice and consent to ratification on a priority basis \n     during the first session of the 104th Congress.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                           Amendment No. 2216\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Sec.   .

It is the sense of the Senate that the General \n     Services Administration should increase use of direct \n     delivery for high-dollar value supplies and only stock items \n     that are profitable, that after these changes are \n     implemented, the General Services Administration should phase \n     out the supply depots that are no longer economically \n     justifiable or needed.\n                                 ______\n\n\n             SHELBY (AND KERREY) AMENDMENTS NOS. 2241-2242\n\n  Mr. SHELBY (for himself and Mr. Kerrey) proposed two amendments to \nthe bill H.R. 2020, supra; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 2241\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . NATIONAL COMMISSION ON RESTRUCTURING THE INTERNAL \n                   REVENUE SERVICE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) While the budget for the Internal Revenue Service \n     (hereafter referred to as the ``IRS'') has risen from $2.5 \n     billion in fiscal year 1979 to $7.5 billion in fiscal year \n     1996, tax returns processing has not become significantly \n     faster, tax collection rates have not significantly \n     increased, and the accuracy and timeliness of taxpayer \n     assistance has not significantly improved.\n       (2) To date, the Tax Systems Modernization (TSM) program \n     has cost the taxpayers $2.5 billion, with an estimated cost \n     of $8 billion. Despite this investment, modernization efforts \n     were recently described by the GAO as ``chaotic'' and ``ad \n     hoc''.\n       (3) While the IRS maintains that TSM will increase \n     efficiency and thus revenues, Congress has had to appropriate \n     additional funds in recent years for compliance initiatives \n     in order to increase tax revenues.\n       (4) Because TSM has not been implemented, the IRS continues \n     to rely on paper returns, processing a total of 14 billion \n     pieces of paper every tax season. This results in an \n     extremely inefficient system.\n       (5) This lack of efficiency reduces the level of customer \n     service and impedes the ability of the IRS to collect \n     revenue.\n       (6) The present status of the IRS shows the need for the \n     establishment of a Commission which will examine the \n     organization of IRS and recommend actions to expedite the \n     implementation of TSM and improve service to taxpayers.\n       (b) Composition of the Commission.--\n       (1) Establishment.--To carry out the purposes of this \n     section, there is established a National Commission on \n     Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service (in this section \n     referred to as the ``Commission'').\n       (2) Composition.--The Commission shall be composed of \n     twelve members, as follows:\n       (A) Four members appointed by the President, two from the \n     executive branch of the Government and two from private life.\n       (B) Two members appointed by the Majority Leader of the \n     Senate, one from Members of the Senate and one from private \n     life.\n       (C) Two members appointed by the Minority Leader of the \n     Senate, one from Members of the Senate and one from private \n     life.\n       (D) Two members appointed by the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, one from Members of the House of \n     Representatives and one from private life.\n       (E) Two members appointed by the Minority Leader of the \n     House of Representatives, one from Members of the House of \n     Representatives and one from private life.\n     The Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service shall be an \n     ex officio member of the Commission.\n       (3) Chairman.--The Commission shall elect a Chairman from \n     among its members.\n       (4) Meeting; quorum; vacancies.--After its initial meeting, \n     the Commission shall meet upon the call of the Chairman or a \n     majority of its members. Seven members of the Commission \n     shall constitute a quorum.

Of the cases enforced through the public child support \n     enforcement system, only 18 percent of the caseload has a \n     collection.\n       ``(5) The number of individuals receiving aid to families \n     with dependent children (hereafter in this subsection \n     referred to as `AFDC') has more than tripled since 1965. More \n     than two-thirds of these recipients are children.

Between 1970 and 1991, the \n     percentage of live births to unmarried women increased nearly \n     threefold, from 10.7 percent to 29.5 percent.\n       ``(6) The increase of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and births \n     is well documented as follows:\n       ``(A) It is estimated that the rate of nonmarital teen \n     pregnancy rose 23 percent from 54 pregnancies per 1,000 \n     unmarried teenagers in 1976 to 66.7 pregnancies in 1991.

While many parents find themselves, \n     through divorce or tragic circumstances beyond their control, \n     facing the difficult task of raising children alone, \n     nevertheless, the negative consequences of raising children \n     in single-parent homes are well documented as follows:\n       ``(A) Only 9 percent of married-couple families with \n     children under 18 years of age have income below the national \n     poverty level.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) increasing international competition, technological \n     advances, and structural changes in the United States economy \n     present new challenges to private businesses and public \n     policymakers in creating a skilled workforce with the ability \n     to adapt to change and technological progress;\n       (2) despite more than 60 years of federally funded \n     employment training programs, the Federal Government has no \n     single, coherent policy guiding employment training efforts;\n       (3) according to the General Accounting Office, there are \n     over 100 federally funded employment training programs, which \n     are administered by 15 different Federal agencies and cost \n     more than $20,000,000,000 annually;\n       (4) many of the programs fail to collect enough performance \n     data to determine the relative effectiveness of each of the \n     programs or the effectiveness of the programs as a whole;\n       (5) because of the fragmentation, duplication, and lack of \n     accountability that currently exist within and among Federal \n     employment training programs it is often difficult for \n     workers, jobseekers, and businesses to easily access the \n     services they need;\n       (6) high quality, innovative vocational education programs \n     provide youth with skills and knowledge on which to build \n     successful careers and, in providing the skills and \n     knowledge, vocational education serves as the foundation of a \n     successful workforce development system;\n       (7) in recent years, several States and communities have \n     begun to develop promising new initiatives such as--\n       (A) school-to-work programs to better integrate youth \n     employment and education programs; and\n       (B) one-stop systems to make workforce development \n     activities more accessible to workers, jobseekers, and \n     businesses; and\n       (8) Federal, State, and local governments have failed to \n     adequately allow for private sector leadership in designing \n     workforce development activities that are responsive to local \n     labor market needs.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to make the United States more competitive in the world \n     economy by eliminating the fragmentation in Federal \n     employment training efforts and creating coherent, integrated \n     statewide workforce development systems designed to develop \n     more fully the academic, occupational, and literacy skills of \n     all segments of the workforce;\n       (2) to ensure that all segments of the workforce will \n     obtain the skills necessary to earn wages sufficient to \n     maintain the highest quality of living in the world; and\n       (3) to promote the economic development of each State by \n     developing a skilled workforce that is responsive to the \n     labor market needs of the businesses of each State.\n     SEC. 703.

Mr. President, the proliferation of nuclear weapons \ncontinues to be one of the most serious threats to national security, \nwhich underscores the need for the United States to maintain an \neffective capability to detect and identify clandestine nuclear tests. \nThe challenge for seismic monitoring is the detection and \nidentification of events of small magnitude. To meet this challenge it \nis necessary to acquire regional data not less than 1,000 kilometers \nfrom a test.\n  For many years, a consortium of universities has operated a multiple-\nuse, global seismographic network that has been supported with funds \nfrom the Department of Defense and the National Science Foundation. \nThese facilities represent a small but significant investment by the \nU.S. Government, offer effective and needed nuclear test monitoring \ncapabilities worldwide, and enhance regional coverage in areas not \nadequately covered by national technical means [NTM].\n  Data provided by this global seismographic network can be used to \nlocate seismic events, discriminate natural versus explosive sources, \nand estimate magnitude and/or yield--all of which are critical in \ndetection and identification of clandestine nuclear tests. Enhancing \naccuracy of event location is particularly important in greatly \nreducing the area which must be investigated through costly on-site \ninspections or the use of NTM. The data obtained from this network thus \ncomplement, rather than compete with, data obtained from NTM.\n  This type of information will be invaluable in helping our Government \nto verify a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. We are already well \ninto the evolution of the post-cold war world, and one unpleasant fact \nof life about such a world is that professional test ban monitors no \nlonger have the luxury of simply gathering data about activities at \ncertain fixed, well-characterized sites. Now the problem has gotten \nmore complex: We are increasingly concerned about small, low-yield test \nexplosions, and we are facing a verification challenge that is truly \nglobal in scope. Given the global distribution of significant \nnongovernmental seismic monitoring capabilities, it is only prudent for \nus to exploit whatever resources are available and appropriate to get \nthe job done.\n  The network is administered by a consortium which today consists of \nover 80 research institutions and affiliates around the globe. The \nNational Science and Technology Council [NSTC] is developing a long-\nterm funding plan for the GSN and JSP. Because of delays in the NSTC \nprocess funding recommendations were not included in the \nadministration's fiscal year 1996 budget request, but are being \nincorporated in the fiscal year 1997 budget request. In the meantime, \nthis action is needed to ensure continuation of these important \nprograms.\n  My amendment specifies that $9,500,000 of prior year funds from the \nDefense Support Program which are available as a result of the omnibus \nreprogramming shall be available for continuation of the Global \nSeismographic Network [GSN] and Joint Seismic Program [JSP]. This is \nmaintained by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research [AFOSR] in PE \n601102F, project 2309. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/05/senate-section/article/S11708-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11708-S11709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO CHUCK GIFFORD\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, one of my best friends, and a true friend \nto all who fight for social and economic justice, is retiring as \nsubregional director of the United Auto Workers. Chuck has fought all \nhis life for the rights of working men and women.\n  Chuck Gifford started out working at Maytag in Newton, IA, where he \nwas an elected representative for local 997. He was appointed to the \nstaff of the national community action program [CAP] of the UAW in \n1975. He has held a number of important positions with the union, \nincluding serving as region 4 CAP coordinator for Iowa, Illinois, and \nNebraska; president of the Iowa State CAP Council, and is retiring as \nsubregional director. In addition to his work with the union, Chuck has \nbeen active for a long time in the Democratic Party, at the local and \nnational level. He was a member of the Democratic National Committee, \nand the Iowa State Central Committee of the Democratic Party. Chuck is \namong the most respected labor and political leaders in our state.\n  While Chuck could always be counted on to pay close attention to the \nperson on the shop floor, his vision and concerns were national and \ninternational in scope. He cared deeply about justice and working \nconditions for his union members, but he also cared passionately about \neconomic injustice in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. He was a leader \nin the fight to end the Vietnam war, to end apartheid in South Africa, \nand to end child labor Latin America and Asia.\n  Chuck is a true and loyal American. He has spent countless hours and \neven days in political work to make changes in U.S. policy. He was not \ncontent to sit on the sidelines and complain. He got into the arena, \nand worked to make America a better country. That, to me, is a real \ntest of good citizenship, \n\n[[Page S11709]]\nand Chuck gets an A-plus in that category.\n  Recently, Chuck was appointed by Iowa Supreme Court Justice Lou \nLavorato to an interim committee which will examine access to the \njudicial system, so I am glad to see that even in his retirement, Chuck \nwill still be active. Mr. President, I want to salute the long and \ndistinguished career of Chuck Gifford. I wish him all the best of \nhealth and happiness in the years ahead.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/05/senate-section/article/S11708-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n ALASKA POWER ADMINISTRATION SALE ACT TRANS-ALASKA PIPELINE AMENDMENT \n                  ACT OF 1995--MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 1225, just received from \nthe House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1225) to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n     1938 to exempt employees who perform certain court reporting \n     duties from the compensatory time requirements applicable to \n     certain public agencies, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, on Tuesday the House of Representatives \nunanimously passed H.R. 1225, the Court Reporter Fair Labor Amendments \nof 1995. The bill has since been received in the Senate. I rise to \nstrongly support this much needed legislation, modeled after a bill, S. \n190, I introduced last Congress and reintroduced again this January.\n  This legislation would correct a situation caused last year by a \nLabor Department interpretation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 \n[FLSA] as it relates to State and local court reporters. The bill would \nexempt from the overtime provisions of the FLSA the time official court \nreporters spend outside of work preparing transcripts of court \nproceedings for a private fee.\n  Mr. President, for purposes of legislative history, let me take a \nmoment to explain the background of this issue and why this legislation \nis so necessary. Traditionally, court reporters have enjoyed a somewhat \nunique position of being treated as both public employees and \nindependent contractors, depending on the nature of their work. While \nperforming their primary duties of recording and reading back court \nproceedings, reporters have been considered employees of the court \nentitled to appropriate compensation and benefits.\n  In addition to these in-court duties, however, official court \nreporters also are required by most jurisdictions to prepare and \ncertify transcripts of their stenographic records. Transcripts are \ntypically requested by a wide range of persons--including attorneys for \nindigent and nonindigent criminal defendants, civil litigants, and \njudges. In return, reporters are paid a per-page fee by the party \nrequesting the transcript. \n\n[[Page S11710]]\n\n  When preparing transcripts for outside parties, not including judges, \nreporters have been considered independent contractors, not court \nemployees. This makes sense because the court receives no benefit from \nthe preparation of the transcript. The work is performed after normal \nworking hours, on weekends, or when all their other court duties have \nbeen completed. Quite often, court reporters produce these transcripts \nat home using computer-aided transcription equipment, which they have \npersonally purchased, without any supervision by the court.\n  For taxation purposes, the fee income received for the work is \ntreated as separate and apart from reporters' court wages. In fact, \ncourt reporters in my home State of South Dakota are required to \ncollect and pay sales tax on this income. They also file self-\nemployment income forms with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.\n  Mr. President, the situation I have described, typical of almost all \nState and local court reporters in the country, was thrown into turmoil \nlast year by the Wage and Hour Division of the Labor Department. In a \nseries of letters, the Division took the position that official court \nreporters in Oregon, Indiana, and North Carolina were still acting as \ncourt employees, for purposes of the FLSA, when they prepare \ntranscripts of their stenographic records for private litigants, \nregardless of when or where the work is completed. Court reporters in \nmost other States operate in circumstances similar to these three \nStates.\n  None of the groups affected are pleased by the Labor Department's \nposition. Many view the Labor Department as unnecessarily intruding \ninto a situation with which everyone concerned was happy.\n  If allowed to stand, court employers would be forced to pay overtime \nfor transcription work that is not supervised by the court and from \nwhich the court does not receive a benefit. As a result, many more \nhours of overtime would be accumulated by reporters. At one and one-\nhalf times the regular rate of pay, these additional overtime hours \nwould severely strain the limited salary budgets of the courts. In \nresponse, courts would be forced to drastically cut back the number of \nhours allowed for transcription work, or cut back the number of court \nreporter positions.\n  State and local court reporters also are not happy with the Labor \nDepartment's interpretation. Though they purportedly would be the \nbeneficiaries of the ``protections'' of the FLSA, reporters are worried \ntheir ability to earn outside income would be drastically reduced, that \nthey would be subjected to court supervision when preparing \ntranscripts, and that many reporter positions could be eliminated.\n  Finally, attorneys and others who request transcripts do not wish to \nsee the current system changed. Under the traditional situation, they \nreceive transcripts quickly and accurately at a reasonable price.\n  Mr. President, this legislation fixes the problem. It would allow \nState and local court reporters to continue to prepare transcripts for \nattorneys and others in their off hours for a per-page fee. During \nthese hours, court reporters would be considered independent \ncontractors, not employees of the court. These hours would not count \ntoward the overtime provisions of the FLSA. Courts would not be \nrequired to pay reporters for these hours. The effect of the bill would \nbe to preserve the system as it has existed for years. It is strongly \nsupported by the National Court Reporters Association. I also have \nheard strong support from many judges and attorneys in South Dakota for \npreserving the present system.\n  Mr. President, this is not a partisan issue. As it progressed through \nthe House, this legislation enjoyed broad support on both sides of the \naisle. During a hearing held several weeks ago in the House Worker \nProtections Subcommittee of the Economic and Educational Opportunities \nCommittee, no witness testified in opposition. After consultations with \nmembers of both parties and the Labor Department, the House bill was \nmodified to clarify its intent. The modified version was then offered \nas an amendment in the nature of a substitute by Representative Owens, \nthe ranking member of the subcommittee, with the approval of the \nsponsor, Mr. Fawell.\n  Essentially, two conditions must be met for the exemption to apply. \nFirst, when performing transcript preparation duties, reporters must be \npaid at a per-page rate that is fair. To ensure reporters are not \nexploited, the rate must not be less than the maximum rate set by State \nlaw or local ordinance or otherwise established by a judicial or \nadministrative officer, or a fair market rate as negotiated by the \nreporter and the party requesting the transcript.\n  Second, transcription work must be performed during hours when \nreporters are not otherwise required by their court employer to be at \nwork. Reporters are clearly acting as employees subject to compensation \nwhen they are required by the court to be working, or to be on call \nduring a period of down time in a trial, for instance.\n However, when court reporters no longer are required to be at work, \nwhen they are free to go home or spend their time as they wish, and \nthey choose to prepare transcripts for a private fee, then court \nemployers are under no obligation to compensate them or count those \nhours toward the overtime provisions of the FLSA. This is common sense.\n\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned, no opposition to this legislation \nappeared in the House. I do not expect any opposition in this chamber \neither. S. 190, the bill I introduced, has been cosponsored by Senator \nKassebaum, chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, as well \nas Senators Exon, Helms, Jeffords, Cochran, Coats and Brown. I thank \nthem for their support and am confident they also will find the House-\npassed legislation satisfactory.\n  H.R. 1225 is being held at the Senate desk pursuant to my request. It \nis my intention to seek unanimous consent to move this bill at the \nappropriate time. I understand from the staff of the ranking member of \nthe Labor Committee, Senator Kennedy, that he does not plan to object \nto moving this legislation. I also have checked with other members of \nthe Labor Committee from the other party and have not heard of any \nopposition. Nor did I expect any.\n  To conclude, Mr. President, I thank all my colleagues for their \nsupport and look forward to moving this bill quickly.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be deemed to have \nbeen considered, read a third time, and passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid on the table, and any statement relating to the bill \nappear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the bill (H.R. 1225) was deemed to have been read the third time \nand passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/05/senate-section/article/S11709-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR MONDAY, AUGUST 7, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, before the leader leaves the floor, I want \nto say I have listened with keen interest to the opening remark by the \nmajority leader and the introduction of the welfare reform bill and the \nspirit of compromise that he expressed and exchanged with Senator \nMoynihan, who has been a leader in this for a long time. I am looking \nforward to the remarks by the minority leader, which I think will \nfollow, probably on this subject.\n  I just want to say that after being here 17-plus years, I do not \nbelieve there is anything that probably is more important or more \nnecessary for reform. And I hope that the spirit of compromise which \nstarted out this debate will be part of the debate, because I believe \nthat this is not something that we want to make a political issue out \nof it. This is a problem that we all know of that is very fundamental \nto the whole prospect that we have of getting our fiscal house in order \nand doing the right thing in a fair way.\n  I hope we will not have any filibuster. I hope that maybe we can be \nso bipartisan that maybe we will not even use tabling motions. Maybe we \ncan just have up-or-down votes on all of the amendments. I am not \ntrying to direct how this is moved forward, but I think if we are going \nto get something done, it is going to have to be a combination effort \nwith the combination of the majority Members and minority Members \nhaving a say so and let the body work its will on the various \namendments.\n  I will have more to say on this probably on Monday or later. I am \nvery much concerned about it. I am very happy it has finally come to \nthe fore. And I salute the majority leader and the minority leader, \nSenator Moynihan, and others, who have had a key role to play. I do not \nthink we are too far apart. I hope we will not become too far apart \nduring the debate which will ensue.\n  I thank the majority leader and the minority leader, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me concur first with the comments \nmade by the distinguished Senator from Nebraska. I hope that this can \nbe a very meaningful and productive debate. I have every expectation \nthat that is indeed what will occur. This is a very important issue, \nand we will all have much more to say about it next week.\n  Mr. President, we begin the debate today, and I must say I am \nencouraged by the remarks of the majority leader and certainly by the \nranking member of the Finance Committee, because I think it is \nindicative of the hope expressed oftentimes on the floor that we can \ndeal in a meaningful way on an issue as important as welfare reform \nthis year.\n  I believe that in many respects there are similarities between the \nRepublican and the Democratic approaches to welfare reform, but there \nare some fundamental differences as well. And those differences, of \ncourse, have to be worked out over the course of the next several days.\n  I believe that it is very important, as we look to how to achieve \nmeaningful welfare reform, that several principles guide our way, that \nseveral principles determine the degree to which we come together and \ncreate the scope within which welfare reform can be accomplished.\n  I believe that it is important to end welfare as we know it, as the \nPresident has challenged us to do. I believe that most people \nrecognize, that with all of its good intentions, we have not been able \nto cope with the myriad problems that we continue to witness and \nexperience simply because the infrastructure we have created is unable \nto accommodate the solutions that are necessary under the current set \nof circumstances.\n  The Family Support Act, a major piece of legislation offered at that \ntime by the senior Democratic member of the Finance Committee, later to \nbe chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Moynihan, was really a \nlandmark piece of legislation in 1988. Now, 7 years later, we realize \nwe have to go even beyond what we did in 1988 with the broad agreement \nthat we had in 1988 that it was a very significant step ahead, a step \nforward in the progress that we knew we had to make in achieving much \nof what we had set out to do 30 years ago.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the principles of welfare reform that \nmust be incorporated as we begin to address this issue next week, first \nand foremost, recognize that we change the infrastructure of the \nwelfare system as we have known it for so long. It is important that we \nabolish the AFDC system and create in its place an ability for us to \nput the emphasis where it ought to belong, put the emphasis on work, to \nmake the welfare office of today the employment office of tomorrow, to \ngive people an opportunity, a confidence that they do not have today \nthat they will have the jobs skills, they will have the ability, they \nwill have the resources to get jobs and to keep them.\n  Work First--an emphasis on work ought to be the emphasis of welfare \nreform. We feel so strongly about the need to make work that priority \nthat we call our bill the Work First welfare reform plan, because that \nis where the emphasis must be put, on work with skills, with education, \nwith placement, with whatever resources may be required to ensure that \npeople work.\n  Second, we think it is very important that if, indeed, we are going \nto acknowledge the importance of work, we also acknowledge that it is \nimpossible to ask a mother or a father, but in particular a mother, to \ngo out, to take perhaps a minimum-wage job if there is nothing that we \ncan tell them will happen to their children. If we tell them we are \ngoing to force you to take that job out on some hamburger line but we \nknow you have kids 2- and 4-years-old and you are just going to have to \nleave them at home or you are just going to have to figure out a way to \ndeal with them, my guess is there is not going to be much incentive to \ngo do that.\n  So what we say is somehow we have to come up with innovative ways to \nensure that parents will know that their kids are going to be cared \nfor, that somehow those children are going to have to have the ability \nto be cared for, to be protected, to be nourished, to be trained to do \nall the things that the mother would do if she was at home with those \nchildren and not at work.\n  There is an inextricable link between child care and welfare reform, \nbetween expecting a young mother to go out and work and recognizing how \nimportant it is that those kids get care.\n  It does not take a rocket scientist to find out that one of the big \nproblems we have in society today is that there are too many kids that \ndo not have any guidance, do not have any affection, do not have any \nrelationship with their mother or their father. Whatever relationship \nthey get, they get out on the street.\n  Look what happened in that brutal circumstance just the night before \nlast at the McDonald's 15 blocks from here. I do not know what happened \nto that kid. I do not know what caused him to go in at 2 o'clock in the \nmorning and blow away three of his fellow employees. But I would be \nwilling to bet he did not have a father. I would be willing to bet he \nprobably had nothing at home. I would be willing to bet he received no \nguidance in those developmental ages. I would be willing to bet we lost \nthat kid a long time ago.\n  I hope we do not have to experience that over and over and over and \nover again. Whether or not that happens, it \n\n[[Page S11712]]\nseems to me, is dependent upon whether or not we provide mothers and \nfathers with an opportunity, a confidence that we are going to deal \nwith that problem. I think if we can deal with child care, there is a \nlong way we can go in meaningful welfare reform.\n  Third, I believe that it is important to end the cliff effect. If we \ntell that mother or that father, ``You know what, we are going to force \nyou to go take a job, but as soon as you do, you lose your health \ninsurance, it's over.''\n  I have to tell you, I do not think there is a whole lot of incentive. \nI think they are going to do this all over again. I do not think there \nis any real expectation they are going to want to get a job, if they \nget a minimum wage job away from their kids and lose their health \ninsurance through Medicaid all at the same time. That ``ain't'' going \nto happen.\n  So I think we have to recognize that while they are on that job, \nsomehow we have to ensure as well, for at least a while, that they are \nentitled to Medicaid to see that they have all the incentives to go out \nand get a job that we can.\n  Next, I think we ought to tell those parents, that mother or that \nfather, unequivocally, ``Look, if you do not go out and get a job, \nthere is a timeframe within which all of your benefits are gone. We're \nnot going to give you benefits in perpetuity. It's over. A 2-year time \nlimit and you don't have access, you don't have eligibility, you don't \nhave an opportunity to get additional benefits for the foreseeable \nfuture. That is not going to happen anymore. We are going to work with \nyou. We expect you to sign a contract with us that you are going to get \na job. We're going to help you find one. You have to live up to your \nresponsibilities, we will live up to ours. But it is over in 2 years. \nAnd if it is over, you are going to work in public work jobs, you are \ngoing to work in workfare, you are going to work in some way, but you \nare going to work, and you are not going to get benefits. It is not \ngoing to be like it is today where you can just keep going forever. \nThat time is over.''\n  So there is a time beyond which we can no longer provide this safety \nnet.\n  Next, I think it is very important that States have the flexibility. \nThat is one thing that I think unites Democrats and Republicans, the \nneed to give the maximum degree of flexibility. I want to see every \nState work, but there is a big difference between Montana, the State of \nthe distinguished Presiding Officer, and a South Dakota on the one \nhand, and a California and a New York on the other. There are big \ndifferences between New York City and Missoula, MT, or Pierre, SD, or \nPhilip, SD. There are big differences and we have to recognize that, \nand the only way we can recognize it is to give States the flexibility \nthey need to adapt to a Philip or adapt to a New York City.\n  So we recognize that, and we are going to do all that we can to \nensure that States have that flexibility. But what we do not want to do \nis just simply load up all of the responsibilities in a black box, send \nit out and say, ``You do it. And we're going to somehow figure out \nwhether or not you have done it 10 years from now, and if there are \nhuge disparities 10 years from now, well, we will deal with it then.'' \nWe are not going to let that happen. We have to ensure that somehow \nthere is a minimal maintenance of effort.\n  Also, we do not want unfunded mandates to the extent potentially you \ncould see them if we do not do this right. A locally elected official \nnot too long ago said this could be the mother of all unfunded mandates \nif this thing is done wrong. If we just say we are going to give them a \nblock grant, they have to do it. We cut the funds, somebody ends up \nwith all the responsibility and no resources.\n  We are not going to let that happen. So it is very important that we \nnot make this an unfunded mandate, that we provide flexibility, that we \ndo all that we can to ensure that there is some continuity here.\n  So the bottom line, Mr. President, is this: We want to end welfare as \nwe know it. We want to ensure that children are protected, that we \ncreate a new mechanism by which children will not be punished, but will \nbe encouraged, that parents will not be punished but will come to a new \nreality about the limits with which we have the ability to help them. \nBut that during those months within which we can help them, we do all \nthat is possible to help them obtain the skills, get the jobs, be \nresponsible and become productive citizens.\n  Work First, Mr. President, will do that. The Work First plan is a \nplan that has been the product of, perhaps, more of a concerted effort \nwithin our caucus than anything else we have done this year.\n  Let me commend a number of my colleagues for the effort they have put \nforth to bring us to this point. Senator Breaux, the distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana; Senator Mikulski, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maryland; Senator Moynihan, extremely helpful and has provided us \nwithin credible leadership on this whole issue; Senator Dodd, who knows \nmore about child care than all the rest of us put together; a whole \nrange of Senators within our caucus that have come forth to give us a \nsubstantial degree of guidance and leadership and support at each and \nevery turn.\n  So we are very proud of the product, very hopeful that my colleagues \non the other side will take a close look at the Work First legislation \nwith an expectation that, partisanship aside, we may be able to find a \nsolution here. We may actually be able to produce a bill like Work \nFirst that satisfies everybody's expectations, that ultimately brings \nus meaningful welfare reform. I think it can happen. I am very hopeful \nthat it can happen in the not-too-distant future.\n  We will take this bill up again next Monday. I look forward to \nproductive debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1\\1/2\\ more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend and colleague from South Dakota for his \nexcellent remarks. I think they were right on point. I would just like \nto say to my leader, the Democratic leader and to the Republican \nleader, that I think the minority leader made an excellent point. The \nStates are going to have a key role to play in this. We know that. I \nsimply say that let us be careful that we do not make some mistakes and \njust assume that every State is going to take care of this. We also \nought to assume that this is not necessarily going to cost less money, \nbecause I suspect it is not and that we are going to pass it along to \nthe States and let them worry about it.\n  I hope that during this debate that since the Governors are going to \nbe very much involved, those of us who served as Governors of our \nStates may have a somewhat unique perspective that is not there by \nothers who have not had the responsibility of serving as Governor and, \ntherefore, Democratic former Governors, Republican former Governors \nprobably can have some pretty good input to this as to how it might \naffect the States and the responsibilities of the Governors.\n  Let me close by saying that I believe people in the United States \nrecognize that they are their brother's keepers to some extent.\n  I think the complaint has been, Mr. President, that the policy that \nwe have had in effect in the past have not worked. People stay on \nwelfare from generation to generation. That is what they object to. I \nthink that is what both plans are trying to address.\n  Let me finish up by saying how proud I was of my leader, the \nDemocratic leader, for mentioning children. Yes, we are going to have \nto have some kind of a cutoff date, if you are unsuccessful. We are \ngoing to have to raise the minimum wage if this is going to be \nsuccessful.\n  Last but not least, we are going to have to recognize what the \nDemocratic leader said. What about kids? Supposing their parents are \nnot successful after being on welfare for a length of time? They are \ngoing to have to get off, and we are going to have to have some kind of \na cutoff mechanism. But we are also going to have to recognize that we \ncannot cut off the kids. It is not their direct responsibility.\n  All of these things must be given consideration. I hope and think \nthey will be.\n  I thank the Chair and my friend and colleague from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be very brief, Mr. President. I can only respond \nby \n\n[[Page S11713]]\nsaying that the Senator from Nebraska has spoken again very eloquently \nand obviously with the experience that only a Governor can bring to a \ndebate like this. The Senator from Nebraska has been Governor for a \nlong period of time in a State that is not much different from South \nDakota, my State. He recognizes the intricacies of making a program \nlike this work and he recognizes as well the differences between a \nNebraska and a Florida or a California.\n  I am delighted he brought up another issue that is also very \nimportant as we connect the relationship between success and \nexpectation. We will only achieve success if we can truly make work \npay. If we can make work pay, part of making it pay is to recognize \nthat minimum wage today, if a person will work 40 hours a week, is \nstill below the level of poverty. That is not making work pay.\n  As the Senator from Nebraska has said so well, if we are going to \nmake this thing work, then we also have to recognize that pieces not \ndirectly related to welfare but having a significant impact on it, will \nhave to be addressed as well.\n  So the Senator from Nebraska, as always, was able to hone in on those \ntwo or three principles that are key. I appreciate the contribution he \nhas made to this effort. I look forward to working with him next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/05/senate-section/article/S11711-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECESS UNTIL MONDAY, AUGUST 7, 1995, AT 9 A.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
