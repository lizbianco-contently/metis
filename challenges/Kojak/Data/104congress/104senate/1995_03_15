There will now be 1 hour for debate on the \nKassebaum amendment No. 331, to be equally divided between the Senator \nfrom Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] and the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. \nKennedy].\n  The distinguished Senator from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nGeorgia [Mr. Coverdell].\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 331\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from \nKansas. I rise in support of her amendment.\n  I had an opportunity to speak to this issue just yesterday to several \nassembled journalists. I said one of the striking features about the \nissue that is before us is how it reminds us of a rather growing \npattern of this administration to circumvent the legislative branch. If \nyou think on it, this issue, which is very controversial, has been \nargued before this Senate repeatedly and the provision that the \nPresident is trying to put in place has been rejected here. It has not \nfound acceptance in the people's branch of our Government. So now we \nfind the President trying to accomplish by Executive fiat what the \npeople's branch of Government would not do.\n  It reminds me of Somalia, of Haiti, of Mexico, and now striker \nreplacement.\n  Time and time again we see the administration coming for acceptance \nto the legislative branch, the people's branch, for the impact and \nreflection of what the American people are arguing or are wishing for. \nAnd when that cannot be accomplished, he will just bypass it, \ncircumvent it. I do not think this is going to set very well with the \nAmerican people as they begin to focus on a pattern of moving around \ntheir interests.\n  I am always taken aback, still. I have been here going into the third \nyear. I still am perplexed by a city that seems to feel that it and it \nalone can establish the relationships in the free marketplace of this \ngreat country. And every time they do it, every time they meddle, \ninvariably the reaction is disruption in the marketplace and the very \nthing the sound bites suggest we are trying to do, to help workers, as \na result is not what happens.\n  If you destabilize the playing field that has existed between labor \nand management for the last 50 years, if management has no recourse in \nterms \n [[Page S3910]] of hiring a replacement worker if an extended strike \ntakes place, then invariably you are going to have increased consumer \ncosts, you are going to have business decisions to avoid this \ncomplexity, you will have businesses that decide this is not the place \nto build their business. And every time we add to the burden of \nmanagement and how they build businesses, we make it harder and harder \nfor people to work in their businesses. That is the outcome of this \nkind of interference in the workplace: less jobs, not more jobs--less \njobs, not more protected jobs.\n  It has to be remembered, you cannot replace a striker today if it is \na health-related issue or an environment-related issue. You can if \nthere is an argument about wages that cannot be resolved. Only 3 \npercent of the work force in all these strikes have ever been replaced \nin this country.\n  Management does not want a strike. Management does not want to \nreplace a worker. It is expensive, costly, time consuming, \ndestabilizing.\n  I can see my time is about up, Mr. President. I support the amendment \nof the Senator from Kansas. I feel we are intervening in the free \nmarketplace and it will be destabilizing to the work force of our \ncountry.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, just so colleagues are \nclear before they cast this vote after listening to my colleague from \nGeorgia--the Executive order does not resemble Somalia. It represents a \nlawful exercise of Presidential authority. The Federal Procurement Act, \nwhich was enacted by Congress in 1949, expressly authorizes the \nPresident to proscribe such policies and directives not consistent with \nthe directives of this act as he shall deem necessary to effectuate the \ndecisions of such act. And from Roosevelt to Johnson to Nixon to Carter \nto President Bush, we have seen such orders issued.\n  So let us just be clear as to what is at issue. Second of all, Mr. \nPresident, we are, of course, not talking about S. 55, which was on the \nfloor last session. But again, for the record, for the people in the \ncountry, that piece of legislation which prohibited employers from \npermanently replacing striking workers was filibustered. It was \nblocked. So it did not pass.\n  This is an Executive order by the President which applies to \nsituations where the Federal Government has a contract with an employer \nfor over $100,000 worth of business and that employer permanently \nreplaces workers. This does not cover workers who were temporary \nreplacement workers. We are talking about permanent replacement. That \nis all we are focusing on. It is really a very simple proposition that \nwe are voting on here today.\n  I say to my colleagues, who take another position on this issue, that \nI wish their characterization of labor-management relations had some \nrelationship to reality because, if it did, I would be taking a \ndifferent position in this debate. But the General Accounting Office \nreports that since 1985, employers have hired permanent replacements in \none out of every six strikes and threatened to hire replacements in one \nout of every three.\n  Mr. President, I just simply have to tell you that all too often, \nwhat happens is either employers require major and unreasonable \nconcessions of the union, then force people out to strike, then replace \nthem with workers unsympathetic to the union, and then move to \ndecertify the union. That is called union busting. And, in many ways, \nthat is the issue that is before us because either that happens or, \nbecause the United States happens to be the only country among the \nadvanced economic countries in the world that enables employers to \ncarry out this practice, many other wage earners just simply are forced \nto live with outrageous concessions that are asked of them with \nsometimes very deplorable working conditions in terms of health and \nsafety, much less wages, because they know, if they do anything about \nit, they will be permanently replaced.\n  Mr. President, the issue here is which side is the Government on? In \nthe debate last week, while I was on the floor, I happened to remember \nFlorence Reese, from Appalachia--which is my wife Sheila's home, in \nKentucky--and her famous song, ``Which Side Are You On?''\n  What the President's Executive order essentially says is, while many \nof us feel so strongly about this, if the Government is doing business \nwith a company where the labor-management dispute causes the permanent \nreplacement of striking workers, we ought not to use taxpayers' money \nto subsidize that kind of management practice.\n  Which side is the Government on? Are we on the side of union busting? \nAre we on the side of depressing wages? Are we on the side of forcing \npeople out on strike and then permanently replacing them? Are we on the \nside of unsafe working conditions? Or are we on the side of working \npeople, wage earners, and their having some leverage and ability to \nbargain for themselves and, yes, if necessary, to go out on strike--\nthough no one likes to go out on strike--so that they are just not \ncrushed?\n  Mr. President, that is the issue. Should the Government use \ntaxpayers' money to support companies which permanently replace their \nworkers in the labor-management dispute? It is that simple. That is the \nissue before us. That is why so many of us have taken such strong \nstands.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I know my colleague from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy, has been eloquent, powerful on the floor, on this \nissue. I think right now, in the 104th Congress, that so much of the \ndebate and so much of the agenda is too abstract. There are no faces. \nThere are no people.\n  Now, we look at these decisions on the House side. And we are talking \nabout in Minnesota the Low-Income Energy Assistance Program. Let me \ntell you that in a cold-weather State like Minnesota--and I imagine \nMassachusetts--this is cruel for the elderly poor, for children, to \njust cut that out; and going after the Summer Jobs Program. We have had \nthe debate here on school lunches, school breakfasts, and child \nnutrition programs. But are we going to do more for loopholes, \ndeductions, and more by way of capital gains tax for large corporations \nand wealthy people? People--we cut one place. And those people have the \nleast amount of clout, those most vulnerable citizens, and then we skew \nit to the very top of the population.\n  That is why this debate on the Kassebaum amendment has a \nsignificance. It has to do with the heart and soul of this 104th \nCongress. It has to do with where we stand. It has to do with who we \nrepresent or who we do not represent.\n  I can just say to my colleagues that I have seen all too often--I \nsaid this before on the floor of the Senate--people forced out on \nstrike. I have seen people permanently replaced. I have seen the \ndevastation of families. I have seen the devastation in communities. We \nhad testimony in the Labor and Human Resources Committee from \nministers, from business people, and others who talked about the \ndivisiveness of all of this.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor because I feel a real commitment \nto people whom I represent. To me, one that stands out in my mind more \nthan any other is C.F. Industries, where workers were forced out on \nstrike who did not want to go out on strike. I do not think they would \nmind my saying that they had a real sense of trepidation. They did not \nwant to go out on strike. They were worried what was going to happen to \nthem. But the company's offer was something they could not accept. The \nconcessions that were asked of them went sort of directly to their \nsense of dignity about themselves. So there they were, outside on a \nSunday morning. I went out there with the president of the AFL-CIO in \nthe pouring rain. Their children were there. People who had essentially \nbeen permanently replaced were devastated. I do not think that should \nbe a part of what the United States of America is about.\n  This amendment which deals with this Executive order by the President \njust deals with an Executive order that is a significant step in the \nright direction.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. \nI \n [[Page S3911]] think, as much as I respect my colleague from Kansas, \nthis amendment is profoundly wrong in its impact on working people and \nfamilies. I think it is profoundly wrong in terms of the message that \nit stands for as to what we are about. I think the Government ought to \nbe on the side of regular people, ought to be on the side of wage \nearners, and ought to be on the side of working families. I think that \nis really the large significance of this vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas [Mr. Gramm].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we should invoke cloture. We should pass \nthis amendment, and we should stop the President's effort to use \nExecutive power to do what he could not do in Congress and what, I \nbelieve, is clearly within the jurisdiction of the legislative branch \nof Government.\n  What we are debating today is nothing more than special interest \npolitics undertaken by the President to reward a special interest \ngroup--organized labor in America. The President is giving them \nsomething that is not in the public interest through Executive order \nsince he was unable in the last Congress to get a very similar \nprovision adopted into law.\n  Let me review very briefly what the issue is. Under current law, if I \ndo not want to work for you, I have the right to quit. If I feel that \nyour pay or your working conditions are unfair, I have the right not \nonly to quit, but to join with other workers to withhold our labor.\n  That is my fundamental right as a free American. That is a right \nthat, so far as I know, is supported by every single Member of the U.S. \nSenate. But the employer, who has put up capital and who has made an \ninvestment, also has rights. Those rights basically are that if I \nrefuse to work for you, or if I join other employees in denying my \nlabor, you have a right to hire someone else.\n  I, as a worker, understand that I have my rights and you have your \nrights. Under the balanced system, which is the law of the land, we \nhave not had any major labor unrest since the short period immediately \nafter World War II. That is because every worker knows what his or her \nrights are, and every worker understands the employer's rights. With \nthat balance of relative power in the marketplace, we have had \nnegotiations, we have had settlements, we have had progress, and we \nhave had labor stability. As a result, we have experienced economic \ngrowth and prosperity.\n  What is being proposed now is not really a labor issue, it is a \nfreedom issue. Basically, what the President has tried to do by \nExecutive order is that which we had previously rejected; that is, to \ntell employers that if an employee quits or, in conjunction with other \nemployees, withholds his or her labor, you do not have the right to \nhire someone else permanently to replace that worker. That is a \nviolation of the rights of Americans who have put up their capital and \nwho have made investments.\n  In my opinion, this is a freedom issue. And if you believe in \nfreedom, you ought to be for this amendment.\n  So there are three issues. First, the President has tried, by \nExecutive order, to do what he could not do through the legislative \nprocess. We ought to stop him because it is a violation of the implicit \nprinciple of separation of powers.\n  Second, the President is trying fundamentally to change labor law in \na way that is not only unfair but in a way that will clearly result in \nmore labor unrest. As a result, we will have more strikes than we have \nhad in the last quarter century.\n  Finally, we ought to stop the President's special interest power \ngrab, because this is a freedom issue. If someone proposed on the floor \nof the Senate that we stop workers from exercising their legitimate \nright to withhold their labor, I believe that every Member of the \nSenate would rise to his or her feet and denounce that effort. How can \nit be right to denounce that abridgment of freedom and yet not denounce \nthe abridgment of freedom that results from telling an employer, who \nsaved and worked and put up his capital, that he cannot hire someone to \ntake the place of a worker who voluntarily refuses to work? I think \nthat is the issue.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote for cloture and vote for this \namendment.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, with regards to the Kassebaum amendment \nconcerning striker replacement issues and the Executive order to which \nit pertains, I oppose the amendment. When this issue has arisen in the \npast I have supported substantial modifications to the striker \nreplacement bill, including mandatory arbitration. These modifications \nwould have substantially reduced strikes. Given my reservations, I have \nspent a good deal of time studying the Executive order. It is important \nto note that the provisions established by this order are much narrower \nin scope than striker replacement proposals made in the past and very \nlimited in the number of businesses that would be affected.\n  From the outset and before I go any further, let me point out that \nthe Kassebaum amendment violates the rules of the Senate which prohibit \nlegislating on an appropriations bill. The procedure in the Senate is \nto pass legislative authorization or prohibition legislation and to \ndeal with the matter of appropriations separately. The Kassebaum \namendment clearly violates these rules.\n  Next, the underlying issue before the Senate is a supplemental \ndefense appropriations bill. I do not think that bill ought to be \njeopardized by a non-germane issue that can be brought up through the \nregular legislative process.\n  In reference to the Executive order, there are two points that I \nthink should be made. The first is that the order in question does not \nrequire that Federal contractors who permanently replace workers be \nbarred from holding contracts with the Federal Government. The order \nonly gives the Secretary of Labor permission to consider terminating \ncontracts with companies who permanently fire lawfully striking \nemployees. Even if the Secretary does decide to terminate the \ncontractor on this basis, it takes only an objection from the head of \nthe involved Government agency to have the contract reinstated.\n  There is also the issue of cost to the Government and ultimately to \nthe taxpayers. We should realize that it is expensive for companies to \nhire replacement workers. For a business to change employees quickly \ncosts a great deal of money. Considering how often we have seen some \ncompanies overcharge the Government in the past, it is completely \nreasonable to expect that the costs of hiring these replacement workers \nwill be passed on to the Government and ultimately the taxpayers.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the fundamental right of American \nworkers to strike was guaranteed over a half century ago with the \nenactment of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. Section 13 of \nthe NLRA states:\n\n       Nothing in this act, except as specifically provided \n     herein, shall be construed so as to either interfere with, or \n     impede, or in any way diminish the right to strike, or to \n     affect the limitations or qualifications on that right.\n\n  As a former Assistant of Labor under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, \nI am disappointed that we find ourselves having to debate this issue at \nall. The amendment of the Senator from Kansas would prohibit the use of \nappropriated funds for implementation of President Clinton's Executive \nOrder 12954, which provides simply that the Federal Government will not \ndo business with contractors that hire permanent replacement workers.\n  Yet the hiring of permanent replacement workers directly contravenes \nthe right to strike. A worker does not have any meaningful right to \nwithhold his or her labor if his or her employer hires a permanent \nreplacement worker.\n  The President issued a lawful Executive order on March 8. The legal \nauthority for this order has been fully documented in a careful \nmemorandum of law written by Assistant Attorney General Walter \nDellinger. The memorandum has already been discussed on the floor \nduring this debate, and was made part of the Record by the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  We ought not be in the business of gutting this Executive order \nthrough an amendment to an appropriations \n [[Page S3912]] bill. It is regrettable that this amendment has not \nbeen withdrawn. Its proponents failed to invoke cloture earlier today, \nand it is time we move on.\n  The opponents of the amendment have no desire to prolong debate on \nthe DOD supplemental appropriations bill. We would prefer that the \namendment be withdrawn so that the Senate can complete its work on the \nunderlying legislation.\n  But it should be remembered that the antistriker replacement \nlegislation, of which I have been a cosponsor since 1990, was \nrepeatedly the subject of filibusters by our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle. S. 55, the Metzenbaum antistriker replacement bill \nin the 103d Congress, got 53 votes for cloture last year. The Senate \nwould have passed the bill last year had an up or down vote been \npermitted.\n  Fortunately, we still have Members in this Senate who can be counted \non to fight for the rights of the American worker. The ranking member \nof the Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Kennedy, deserves \nthanks and congratulations for his outstanding leadership on this \nissue. He has been on the floor for many hours, making his argument \neloquently and forcefully--as only the Senator from Massachusetts can. \nI join him in opposing the amendment of the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Senator from Massachusetts \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  Mr. President, many of us here in the U.S. Senate that are opposed to \nthe amendment of the Senator from Kansas believe that we ought to be \nworking on the defense appropriations bill rather than on this \namendment. I think it is important to understand who is really delaying \nthe U.S. Senate from taking action.\n  Many of us who are opposed to this amendment feel that the national \ninterest and national security would be served by moving forward on the \ndefense appropriations bill. But our Republican colleagues do not \napparently share that view and that is why we are where we are today.\n  Last week, the President issued an Executive order barring the award \nof Federal contracts to companies that permanently replace striking \nworkers. The ink was not even dry on the Executive order and the effort \nwas made here in the U.S. Senate to block the Executive order. And that \nis why we are where we are today, instead of completing action on the \ndefense appropriations bill. Those of us on this side of the aisle are \nprepared, even though we are required to go through a cloture motion, \nto go on to the underlying measure and see that it is acted on and \nacted on expeditiously.\n  I was interested a moment ago when my colleague from Texas said that \nwhat the amendment we are debating is about is the issue of freedom. I \nthought we disposed of that argument during the debate last week with \nthe very profound and eloquent words of our friend and colleague from \nWest Virginia, who talking about what real life is all about for \nworking people--not the technicalities of Presidential power to issue \nExecutive orders, but what real workers were facing at an important \ntime in history, in terms of the mines of West Virginia.\n  I can still remember those words he recalled being told to the \nminers: ``Clean up your place or you are going to lose your job.'' \nSure, you had freedom not to have that job. You also had freedom not to \nfeed your child; you had freedom not to pay your mortgage; you had \nfreedom not to live in a home. You had that freedom because if you did \nnot clean up your place at the end of a hard day's work, you had \nsomebody else that was prepared to fill in. That is what we are talking \nabout here. We are talking about the real experiences of working \npeople.\n  I want to take a couple of minutes of the time of the Senate to talk \nabout who we are protecting here today--the people who my colleague \nfrom Texas described as special interests. These are the kind of people \nthat we on this side of the aisle are interested in protecting and that \nI am glad to stand with.\n  We are protecting Joyce Moore, who is married with three children. \nShe worked at a laundry and also as a nurse's aide in a nursing home in \nCincinnati, OH, for 13 years and was forced out on strike and \nsubsequently permanently replaced. She was making $6.77 an hour. As she \nsaid,\n\n       It ain't about money; basically, it is about respect. There \n     is a lack of respect in there. I hate that we are all on \n     strike because I enjoy getting up every morning and going to \n     my job. I enjoy being around the residents, taking care of \n     them. But we want a 3-year contract and a better health plan \n     and a pension plan. Folks get sick and they need a health \n     plan. When you have been there as long as I have, you deserve \n     a pension plan.\n\n  But when Joyce Moore went on strike to get that respect, she was \npermanently replaced. That special interest was making $6.77 an hour. \nWe are interested in protecting her from being permanently replaced, so \nthat she can provide for a family.\n  Jenette Hillman, 52 years old, worked at the nursing home as a \nrehabilitation aide for 25 years, and was making $7.25 an hour before \nshe was forced out on strike February 22 and permanently replaced 3 \nweeks later. She raised six sons. Now she is surviving only because one \nof those sons has moved back in with the family.\n  Bernadette Marion, making $5.30 an hour as a nursing assistant, \nbarely enough to take care of her four daughters, after being out on \nstrike--she was permanently replaced and is living on a dwindling \nsavings and a tax refund check.\n  These are the real people that are being affected the unfair employer \ntactic of permanently replacing workers who exercise their legal right \nto strike.\n  Make no mistake about it, this is the opening skirmish in a larger \nbattle that is now unfolding in the Congress over the rights of working \nmen and women across the country. What is at stake in this battle is \nnothing less than the standard of living for working families.\n  Our Republican friends aim their opening salvo at a measure that is \nabout simple justice for American workers. Under our national labor \nlaws, it is illegal to fire a worker for exercising the right to \nstrike. But because of a court-created loophole--not a legislatively \ncreated loophole; the loophole was not enacted by the Congress of the \nUnited States; it was a footnote on a court decision--because of the \ncourt-created loophole, workers who strike can be permanently replaced, \nwhich amounts to the same thing.\n  President Clinton was right to act to close that unfair loophole. And \nI am proud to stand with him in defense of that action.\n  Working families, Mr. President, are hurting. They have suffered a \n20-year decline in real wages. Hourly pay is falling compared to other \ncountries. The gap between the top 10 percent of wage earners and \nbottom 10 percent is wider in our country than in any other industrial \nnation. Yet, the new Republican majority, through this amendment and \nnumerous other measures that are working their way through Congress, \nare advancing an agenda that is, in effect, an assault on working \nfamilies. This attempt to block the Executive order on striker \nreplacement is just one example of how this assault is being carried \nout, but it is an important one. So I want to take a few moments to \ntalk about that this morning.\n  It is not just accidental, Mr. President, that what we have seen over \nthe period of the past weeks--and it was illustrated in the excellent \narticle in the Washington Post today by Mr. Obey--is an attack on the \nlegitimate interests and rights of working men and women to be able to \nprotect their wages and to try and advance the interests of themselves \nand their families.\n  We have the actions which are being taken by the House of \nRepresentatives to basically undermine the School Lunch Program where \nworking families' children go to school, to undermine the college \nassistance programs and loan programs by which working families are \nable to have their children go to the fine colleges and universities \nthat exist in all of our States. Sixty-seven percent of the young \npeople in my State of Massachusetts need some kind of help and \nassistance to go on to college. But what is the Republican leadership \nin the House of Representatives saying? We are to cut student aid \nprograms and make hard-working families spend more to finance the cost \nof a college education.\n   [[Page S3913]] It is an assault on the children who are going to the \nhigh schools, it is an assault on the teenagers who are trying to go to \ncollege, and it is a continued assault----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 3 more minutes.\n  It is a continued assault by those who refuse to give a living wage \nto people who are trying to work.\n  That is what this is about. You can talk about the scope of \nPresidential power to issue this Executive order-- and we have put into \nthe Record the Justice Department's justification for it, which is well \nsupported--and you can talk about whether the President is really right \nto do this as a matter of social policy.\n  But I will tell you, those arguments would have a lot more \ncredibility if those on the other side were prepared to say we are \nwilling to support an increase in the minimum wage for workers in this \ncountry who are prepared to work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year. But, \nno, they say, we are opposed to that too. Come on. Come on, Mr. \nPresident. What is this battle all about? Come on. You have to be \nhonest when you are talking to the American people. You have to be \nstraightforward about what this is about.\n  My Republican colleagues say you are wrong Senator, this is just an \nissue about whether the President had the proper legal authority to \nissue this Executive order. But at the same time they are saying,\n\n       No, Senator, we are not for enacting an increase in the \n     minimum wage. No, no. You are quite right, we are for cutting \n     back on school lunch programs for kids that are going to high \n     school. Yes, we want to raise the cost of sending your \n     children to the college and university. But we are not really \n     assaulting working families. On, no, we are really for \n     working families. Why do you get so excited out here on the \n     floor of the U.S. Senate?\n\n  And only yesterday, in the Ways and Means Committee, they give tax \nbreaks to the wealthiest individuals and corporations in the country by \nvoting to lower the capital gains tax and effectively eliminating the \nminimum tax on corporations.\n  ``No,'' they say, ``it is just a coincidence that we are providing \nall these breaks and benefits to the rich at the same time we are \nmaking all these cuts in programs for working families.''\n  Come on, Mr. President. This is the first major issue we have dealt \nwith on the floor in the U.S. Senate this year that directly affects \nthe working families of this country, and we are not going to be rolled \nover and stampeded on it. We are not going to be rolled over and \nstampeded on it.\n  The President is right to do this. He is right to issue this \nExecutive order, not just from a fairness point of view and a social \ncompact point of view, he is right to do it in terms of his \nresponsibility as the Chief Executive to ensure that we are going to \nget good quality products for the Defense Department, that we are going \nto make sure that those plane engines that are going into the F-15's, \nF-16's, and F-18's are good engines, made in my own State at General \nElectric by workers who have worked there for 25 and 30 years. We are \nnot going to have to take the chance of having some replacement workers \nin there trying to fulfill a contract and not being able to produce a \ngood, quality product. We are going to make sure that those runways \nthat are being built are going to be good runways for those planes. We \nare going to ensure that the housing that is going to house our \npersonnel in the military is going to be of good quality.\n  I do not know what is the reason for this assault on all these people \nmaking barely above the minimum wage. If that isn't bad enough, the \nRepublicans are saying ``We have other good news for you, Senator, in \nterms of those construction workers. We are going to take away the \nDavis-Bacon Act, that guarantees prevailing wages on federally funded \nconstruction projects.'' We are talking about men and women in the \nconstruction industry making an average of $27,000 a year--$27,000 a \nyear. One of the first priorities of the Contract With America is to \nundermine their ability to make prevailing wages in one of the most \ndangerous occupations in this country, and that is construction work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator that his time \nhas expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 2 more minutes.\n  And we are going to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act and diminish their \nability to provide for their families.\n  What is it about working families that Republicans have it in for \nthem? Why is it that our Republican leadership in the House of \nRepresentatives and here today on the floor of the U.S. Senate, \nvirtually in lockstep, wants to deprive them of some legitimate rights? \nWhat is it about these working families? What is it about their \nchildren? What is it about their children that we want to cut back in \nterms of Medicaid? What in the world have they done, except be the \nbackbone of this country?\n  Make no mistake about it, this is the first battle, Mr. President, \nand we are not going to let this stampede that may have gone over in \nthe House of Representatives run roughshod here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Lott].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank the Senator from \nKansas for yielding me this time.\n  I think it is time, maybe, we calmed down a little bit, stopped \nshouting, and talk about what is really involved here.\n  This is not about----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will not yield. I have been sitting here listening to the \nSenator, and I have a chance here now to correct the Record a little \nbit.\n  This is not about the Contract With America. This is not about Davis-\nBacon. This is not about all the other extraneous matters we are \ntalking about.\n  What we are talking about here is an opportunity for the Senators to \nvote to stop the filibuster so that we can talk about the substance of \nthe amendment of the Senator from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum. So I urge \nthe Senators to vote to invoke cloture.\n  Last Thursday, 57 Senators voted to stop President Clinton from \nunlawfully usurping congressional authority to regulate labor-\nmanagement relations. The week before that, the President issued an \nExecutive order which sought to overturn congressional and judicial \npolicies that have stood for nearly 60 years. In so doing, the \nPresident claimed authority to defy Congress and the Constitution by \nrewriting Federal labor laws. The vast majority of the Senate has \nrejected this unlawful exercise of power, and has affirmed that the \nExecutive order is bad policy and bad law.\n  Despite Thursday's vote, a handful of Senators from the other side of \nthe aisle is filibustering this bill in an attempt to protect President \nClinton's Executive order. The other side of the aisle has even \nobjected to temporarily setting aside the Kassebaum amendment, so the \nSenate might proceed on other amendments to the defense supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  I point out that the defense supplemental appropriations bill, \nrequested by the administration, has now been on the floor of the \nSenate for 5 days. And so the routine continues, Mr. President. We \nspent weeks on the balanced budget amendment. We spent weeks on the \nuncontroversial unfunded mandates bill. We spent several days on \ncongressional coverage. Everything is to be dragged out in the Senate; \neverything is to be slowed down. Sooner or later, the Senate is going \nto have to face up to taking action on the legislation that is pending \nbefore it.\n  And now a minority of Democratic Senators is so committed to giving \naway congressional authority to the President that they are willing to \nhalt Senate action on an emergency bill the administration has \nrequested the Senate to pass immediately.\n  And what is this filibuster being used to do? Is it being used to \ndefend the ability of Congress to regulate labor- \n [[Page S3914]] management relations? No, that is not happening. Is it \nbeing used to implement a Supreme Court ruling? No, Mr. President, this \nfilibuster is being undertaken to protect an Executive action that \ncontravenes the will of both Congress and the Courts.\n  President Clinton's Executive order would bar Federal contractors \nfrom hiring permanent replacements for striking workers. Under the \norder, the Secretary of Labor will determine whether ``an \norganizational unit of a Federal contractor'' has ``permanently \nreplaced lawfully striking workers.'' He may then instruct Federal \nagencies to cancel existing contracts. The contractor can also be \ndebarred from future contracts for the duration of the labor dispute. \nThis Executive order, effective immediately, applies to companies with \nFederal contracts in excess of $100,000.\n  This Executive order is seriously flawed on both policy and legal \ngrounds, and it is a direct challenge to congressional authority.\n  Several times, Congress has tried to act in this area without \nsuccess. And so now, they have gone to the Executive order to get done \nwhat the Congress would not approve and get action in an area where the \nSupreme Court does not even agree with their action.\n  This Executive order seeks to assert that as a matter of law, the \nhiring of permanent replacements adversely affects the Federal \nGovernment. Specifically, it states that the use of replacements \nlengthens strikes, broadens disputes, and shifts the balance in the \ncollective bargaining relationship. As the lengthy debates in the House \nand Senate have shown, quite the contrary is true:\n  The Executive order will result in more strikes, inflationary wage \nsettlements and a shift in the balance of power in favor of unions.\n  This was the conclusion of the Carter administration in 1977, when it \nrejected a limited ban on permanent replacements as part of labor law \nreform. Indeed, the Canadian Province of Quebec has experienced more \nstrikes and longer strikes since it outlawed the use of any striker \nreplacements--temporary or permanent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. The President has delegated to the Secretary of Labor the \ndecision of how far this order really goes. That is one of the things \nthat really worries me.\n  This employer right is essential to maintaining balance in labor \nrelations.\n  The right has always been recognized as the necessary counterweight \nto the unrestrained right to strike guaranteed by this Nation's labor \nlaws. Because the risks are high if either side engages in economic \nwarfare against the other, neither side exercises its rights and powers \nexcept over major issues. The Executive order abolishes this \ncongressionally and judicially crafted balance.\n\n\n                          legal considerations\n\n  The fact that many, many days have been devoted to the issue in \nrecent years should leave no doubt that this is a legislative issue. \nAny Executive order that touches on this same issue is an infringement \non the separation of powers. This order goes far beyond mere \nprocurement policy and regulates private labor relations and restricts \nprivate rights guaranteed under the laws crafted by Congress.\n  It is argued that other Presidents have regulated labor relations \nthrough Executive orders. None of those orders, however, amount to the \nusurpation of congressional authority as does this action of President \nClinton. President Reagan's order firing the striking air traffic \ncontrollers was based upon his constitutional duty to enforce the law. \nPresident Bush's order requiring their Beck rights simply required that \nworkers be informed of their rights under the law. Finally, the Bush \nExecutive order barring union-only agreements on Federal construction \nprojects was consistent with the procurement authority of the \nGovernment as consistent with the procurement authority of the \nGovernment as declared in the Supreme Court's Boston Harbor decision. \nIt should be noted, however, that this Executive order was never \nchallenged in court.\n  Not merely the authority of the President is at issue. The Executive \norder raises numerous practical issues which would embroil the \nexecutive branch in legal quagmires for years. Consider the following:\n  The President has delegated to the Secretary of Labor the decision of \nhow far this order really goes.\n  Robert Reich and his successors would decide whether ``an \norganizational unit of a Federal contractor'' has used permanent \nreplacements. He is empowered in section 11 to define this term in \nregulations. At this point, we do not know whether the ban applies to \nemployees working exclusively on Government projects, plants, or site-\nwide, to all operations whether a division or subsidiary. This \nvagueness should render the order void on its face.\n  The Department of Labor is unqualified to make determinations as to \nthe legality of actions under the Federal labor statutes.\n  That expertise is housed in the National Labor Relations Board and \nthe National Mediation Board. Using the procurement power of the \nPresident, the Secretary is empowered to address such legal issues as \nwhat is a lawful strike and who are unit employees. The Labor \nDepartment has had absolutely no involvement until now in interpreting \nthese laws.\n  The order applies to all lawful work stoppages, whether or not a \nunion is involved.\n  Two or more nonunion workers are free to walk off the job, giving \nlittle or no reason except to say that they are protesting terms or \nconditions of employment. Under current law, nonunion protests of this \nnature are relatively infrequent because of the countervailing employer \nright to hire permanent replacements. Federal contractors which \nexercise their legal right to use replacements in the face of such \nextortionist tactics do so at their peril.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  So, Mr. President, it is clear that President Clinton's Executive \norder is bad policy and bad law which usurps congressional power and \ncontravenes our Nation's courts.\n  In conclusion, I think that what we are really talking about here, \nMr. President, is jobs, and what will happen if these strikes go on \nindefinitely and the companies do not have an opportunity to get \nreplacement workers. What option will the company have if they cannot \nreach a negotiated agreement? What will happen is, they will wind up \ngoing out of business and the people will lose their jobs, and other \npeople who would like to have those jobs would not have them either. We \nclearly should vote to invoke cloture and allow a full debate to occur \non the Kassebaum amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Just over 11 minutes on your side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nIowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I find the argument just made by the minority whip most \nintriguing. He is talking about a filibuster.\n  Mr. President, something is wrong here. It was the Republican side, \nfor the last two Congresses, that filibustered the striker replacement \nbill. What is going on here? Surely, the Senator from Mississippi \nunderstands that it was their side that filibustered in the last two \nCongresses the striker replacement bill. That legislation passed the \nHouse, came to the Senate, and it was the Republicans who filibustered \nthe bill, not the Democrats. We are not filibustering this bill.\n  We will have a vote on the underlying bill. For the last two \nCongresses, the Republicans would not permit the striker replacement \nbill to come up for a vote, and in both of those Congresses we had the \nmajority votes to pass it. One Congress we had 57 votes; last year we \nhad 53 votes. It was the Republicans who filibustered, not the \nDemocrats. I want to set that record straight. The Senator from \nMississippi is playing loose with the history of this bill. I see him \nsmiling over there, and he knows exactly what I am talking about.\n  Mr. President, another Senator from the other side, the Senator from \nTexas [Mr. Gramm] spoke on this issue. He equated workers exercising \ntheir legal right to strike to quitting. He says this issue is about \npeople having a right to \n [[Page S3915]] quit and employers having a right to hire people to \nreplace them.\n  The Senator from Texas apparently believes good labor-management \nrelations consist of workers taking what they are given, and not \ncomplaining. If the workers' salary and benefits and paid holidays are \ncut, because that means investors could make a nickel more dividend, \nand if they then go out on strike, that company can consider those \nworkers as having quit, and permanently replace them.\n  But in reality, Mr. President, good labor-management relations means \nboth sides are willing to talk. When we have a company like \nBridgestone/Firestone, a wholly owned Japanese company operating in \nthis country that refuses to sit down and negotiate in good faith with \nthe workers, leaving them no other option but to go out on strike, then \nit cannot be the workers' fault. They are willing to negotiate.\n  This issue shows some fundamental differences between Senators on \neach side of the aisle. First, to listen to the Senator from Texas [Mr. \nGramm] and perhaps the Senator from Mississippi, they would just as \nsoon see no unions. I think they would be happy to abolish unions if \nthey could.\n  Second, they really believe that if a person works for someone they \nhave to take what they get, no questions asked. If you produce more, \nand you then ask for higher wages, an employer can dismiss you an any \ntime--you can work 20 years, and if they want, they get rid of you and \nthrow you out the door.\n  I think that Senator Kennedy is right. What this is about is whether \nor not we will have decent management-worker relationships in this \ncountry, or whether we will take the path the Republicans want to take, \nand tell workers they do not count for anything, that a worker in this \ncountry is like a piece of machinery. Use them up, depreciate them \ndown, and they throw them out the back door when they can get another \nworker cheaper.\n  Mr. President, sometimes I wish that the Republican side would just \nquit messing around, and just go out and propose a law to ban strikes \nentirely? Better than that, they could ban negotiations, ban collective \nbargaining, because we really do not have collective bargaining any \nlonger. The only thing that a worker can bring to the table in \ncollective bargaining is his or her labor. And if they have no right to \nwithhold that labor then the cards are stacked against them. Then only \nthe employers have the power.\n  So I wish the Republicans would just go ahead and offer a law, an \namendment to ban strikes and to ban collective bargaining. It would be \nhonest, anyway, on their part. It would not be this sham that we are \noperating under now: A right to strike today is only a right to be \npermanently replaced. A right to be permanently replaced means you have \nno power in collective bargaining, and thus collective bargaining in \nthis country is indeed a sham.\n  Every cutrate cutthroat employer knows they can break a union if they \nare willing to play hardball and ruin the lives of people who have made \ntheir company what it is. Unfortunately, the small minority of union \nbusters drag down the rest of their industries in order to compete. \nEven responsible companies have to follow suit in the race to cut costs \nand salaries and cut workers' dignities.\n  I mentioned Bridgestone/Firestone. Other tire companies in this \ncountry--Goodyear, Dunlop, and Uniroyal--reached agreements. They had \nnegotiations. Some of them went out on strike, but then they \nnegotiated. They reached an agreement. But this one company, \nBridgestone/Firestone, refused to negotiate even after the workers had \nincreased their productivity to all-time record highs, even after the \nworkers agreed in the 1980's to take over $7 an hour in wage and \nbenefit cuts, and yet when it came time for collective bargaining to \nrenew the contract, the company said, ``Nope, you take what we offer or \nthat is the end of it.''\n  So, the workers went out on strike. Now, Bridgestone can win this, if \nthey can bust the union and they hire permanent replacements. They have \nactually said it in letters, ``You are permanently replaced.''\n  If they can do that, then that will drag down Goodyear because the \nboard of directors will say, ``How can we let them undercut us? We have \nto compete.'' And so will Dunlop, and so will Uniroyal, and it drags \ndown the whole industry.\n  So what the Republicans are proposing to do with this amendment \noffered----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute.\n  Mr. HARKIN. What they are proposing to do on the Republican side is \nto reward the worst companies: Those companies that will not negotiate \nin good faith and bargain with their workers; those companies that will \ndrag down the other companies. That is the effect of their amendment.\n  This amendment is counterproductive. We need more organized labor, \nnot less, to compete in international markets. We are the most \nproductive country in the world, and it is because we have had good \nlabor-management relations working together, to increase productivity \non the world market. Unions boosted productivity from 17 to 22 percent \nin construction, and a study of 20 manufacturing industries showed that \nunionized workers were from one-fifth to nearly one-quarter more \nproductive than their nonunion counterparts.\n  When I hear the statements coming from the other side of the aisle--\nand what I hear is, ``Let's break down this labor-management relations \nwe have had, let's break down collective bargaining''--the next thing I \nexpect to hear is, ``Let's reintroduce child labor, if you want to \ncompete with other countries that employ child labor.'' Well, why not?\n  Workers have no more rights in this country. Workers have no rights \nto stick up for their dignity, to demand better wages, hours, and \nconditions of employment. I hope that the Senate will speak loudly and \nclearly. The President has acted correctly, and he acted within the \nconfines of the law, in issuing that Executive order. We ought to \nuphold it for the good of America.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I would like to yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first I wish to compliment the Senator \nfrom Kansas for her amendment. I hope that my colleagues will vote with \nher on this amendment. I think it is important.\n  I note at the conclusion of the statement of my friend from Iowa that \nthe President acted within the confines of law. Let me just state the \nfacts. President Clinton issued an Executive order because he could not \npass a law. President Clinton introduces a bill, that has been \nintroduced a couple of times--I guess both years since he has been \nPresident--trying to get it passed, but he has not been successful. He \nhas tried but he did not get a bill to become law. And so the President \nis trying to do by Executive order what he could not do legislatively. \nEven in spite of the fact that he had a Democrat-controlled House and \nSenate, he was not successful because Congress did not agree.\n  I think Congress is right in not agreeing. Now I am looking at the \nExecutive order, and very clearly, if one reads this Executive order--\nand I know it has been put into the Record; if it has not, I will ask \nunanimous consent to put it in the Record--but one needs to read this \nto find out this is law. This is an Executive order where the President \nis trying to legislate.\n  I read in the Constitution--it is interesting, we have had a lot of \ndiscussion on the Constitution lately--but very clearly in article I, \nsection 1, it says:\n\n       All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a \n     Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a \n     Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n  We did not elect the President to be issuing Executive orders in \ndefiance of Congress. Congress did not pass this bill. Congress did not \npass it because we did not think it was right. I happen to agree within \nCongress' decision. I think this is a mistake.\n  I look at the power that he has vested in the Secretary of Labor: The \nSecretary of Labor shall determine everything. The Secretary of Labor \ngets to determine the bargaining, he can object to a termination of a \ncontract, he may debar the contractor. We are giving the Secretary of \nLabor the right to debar a contractor. Take, for example, \n [[Page S3916]] the Senator from Georgia, or the Senator from Virginia, \nif you take a big contractor--maybe it is Newport News --building \naircraft carriers, and maybe there is a small strike with a little \nunion that is upset with one particular division which may affect less \nthan 1 percent of their employees. But if there is a strike, is Newport \nNews and their owner, I guess Tenneco, debarred from all Federal \ncontracts? I asked that question before, and really that is to be \ndetermined by the Secretary of Labor.\n  This Executive order is written with a blank check: ``The meaning of \nthe term organizational unit of the Federal contractors shall be \ndefined in regulations that shall be issued by the Secretary of \nLabor.'' My point being, this is terrible legislation, and the \nPresident does not have a right to legislate. He does not have the \nright. He is exceeding his powers. I am confident that if we do not \nsucceed on the Kassebaum----\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. No. Let me finish my statement. I have limited time.\n  The President exceeded his power. I will state I am very confident \nthat, if we are not successful with this amendment, it will be tested \nin court and this Executive order will be thrown out on constitutional \ngrounds. I am very confident of that fact. But we should stop it now. \nThe President is playing politics. He is trying to appease a special \ninterest group. I think it is unfortunate.\n  What about the substance of it? I heard my colleague make the \nstatement, ``Well, the people who are pushing this amendment are just \nagainst organized labor.'' That is not true. I think the people should \nhave the right to organize. If people want to strike, if they do not \nwant to work, they should have that right as well.\n  Likewise, employers have to have the right to hire replacement \nworkers. If they cannot do that, they cannot keep the doors open. In \nmany cases, you might be a critical subassembly of a particular part \nthat has to happen to make this entire unit come together on time and \non budget, and if an employer cannot hire replacement workers to make \nthat happen, then they could be in violation of the original terms of \nthat contract. They could lose the whole contract. The entire country, \nif you are talking about a Government contract, could end up paying an \nenormous amount for not being on time and complying with the terms of \nthe contract.\n  This is enormous power the President is trying to delegate to the \nSecretary of Labor. It is a mistake. Congress has refused to do this. \nCongress has refused to pass it, I believe correctly so. The President \nin trying to circumvent Congress, I think, greatly exceeds his \nauthority, his power, and I hope my colleagues will agree with Senator \nKassebaum and vote for cloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will just take leader time and not take \nany time reserved for the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Let me make four very important, but simple, points.\n  First of all, the President has every right to issue this Executive \norder. The precedent set by virtually every one of his predecessors \nmakes that point loudly and clearly. President Bush, President Carter, \nPresident Nixon, President Johnson, President Truman, President \nRoosevelt--they all issued Executive orders having to do with important \nnational priorities, and they did so without anyone challenging their \nright to make those choices. Obviously, they may have been in \nsignificant disagreement, but the fact is they made those Executive \norders with the clear understanding that it was within their \nconstitutional right to do so.\n  That is what this President is doing as well. The President is simply \nsaying, ``Look, if you want to do business with the Federal Government, \nyou simply cannot replace striking workers who are conducting a \nlegitimate strike with replacement workers.'' That is all he is saying.\n  I do not think that is too much to ask. Obviously, given the \nextraordinary difficulty working families are having today, the need to \nassure balance in the workplace is all this issue is about. Giving \nworkers the right to strike, the right to maintain balance in a working \nrelationship with their employers, has been something guaranteed under \nthe National Labor Relations Act for 60 years.\n  The second point is that this is simply an issue of fairness. The \nright to strike--the right to ensure that your grievances can be heard \nin a meaningful way--is a longstanding right of workers, and one which \nmust be protected. They must continue to have the right to strike, and \nthis Executive order simply says that we are going to have that \nguarantee in writing, at least as far as Government contracts are \nconcerned. The President has made it very clear that working families \nare a priority in this country.\n  My third point, Mr. President, is this: as the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts has said, this is the first in what will be a series \nof very critical votes this Congress that directly affect working \nfamilies. What happens on this vote will send a clear message about \nwhat the Congress is going to do and the position it will take with \nregard to a number of these issues in the future.\n  If they lose the longstanding balance that has existed between labor \nand management, if they lose a fundamental right guaranteed all \nworkers, I do not know that it bodes very well for other issues that \nwill be pending. There are those who suggest we eliminate the minimum \nwage. There are those who suggest we eliminate the Davis-Bacon Act. \nThey have suggested a number of attacks on the rights of working \nfamilies, and certainly this is the first opportunity we have to defend \nthose rights. I hope that everyone understands the critical nature of \nthis vote. It goes beyond simply a question of filibusters. It goes \nbeyond a question of procedure on the Senate floor. It goes to the very \nheart of why we are here defending the rights of workers at times as \nimportant as this.\n  The fourth point, Mr. President, is one that I hope everyone can \nappreciate. As we go through the final moments of this debate, we must \nremember that the question of whether or not the rights that have been \nreaffirmed in this Executive order are respected is of fundamental \nimportance to our relationship with the President.\n  The President must make decisions with regard to executive branch \npolicy. He has made a very important decision to respect the rights of \nworking families. I think it is imperative that we respect his \nauthority to do so. That is all we are saying here, that this \nPresident, as other Presidents have done, has made a decision with \nregard to working families that, in our view, ought to be upheld and \nought to be respected.\n  So, Mr. President, in a couple of minutes, we are going to be casting \na vote that goes beyond procedure, a vote that goes beyond simply a \nmotion to invoke cloture. It goes to the very heart of whether working \nfamilies are going to have the right to maintain the balance in the \nworkplace that we all recognize is important to them and to this \ncountry.\n  So I hope we can sustain the necessary votes to defeat cloture this \nmorning and send a clear message to working families that the Senate is \non the side of families, on the side of working people, on the side of \nmaintaining the balance between labor and management that we have \nrecognized for the last 60 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Just over 9 minutes on the Senator's side.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I would like to yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, if I may just restate what this \namendment is about. It is an amendment which would bar any Federal \nfunds from being spent to implement the Executive order that was issued \nby the President last week.\n  That Executive order would effectively prohibit Federal contractors \nfrom exercising their legal right to hire permanent replacement \nworkers--a right that has been the law of the land for 60 years.\n  Mr. President, we have heard a lot about this debate being one thing \nor \n [[Page S3917]] another--an assault on working families, an assault on \nchildren. I believe, Mr. President, and perhaps I am naive in thinking \nso, that this vote should not be viewed as a test of the President's \nleadership, nor should it be viewed as a test of Republican clout. I \nhope that it would not be viewed as a vote for labor or a vote for \nbusiness.\n  I wish that this amendment would be taken for what it is. No one \nwants to see workers dismissed gratuitously and replaced by permanent \nreplacement workers. That is not what is at issue either. This is not \nthe beginning of a series of assaults on working class families. This \nis a debate on an Executive order issued by the President which \neffectively changes labor law in a significant way.\n  What this debate is all about, in my mind--and I think it is an \nimportant point--is the separation of powers between Congress and the \nexecutive branch. It is about whether our national labor policy should \nbe determined by the President rather than by an act of Congress.\n  The question at stake is whether we are prepared to allow the \nPresident to overturn 60 years of established labor law with the stroke \nof a pen.\n  We can debate this issue at another time. We have debated it before, \nand I am sure we will again. There are those who suggest we may be able \nto find some compromises that can bring all sides together. But what \nthe current law has done in over 60 years is to provide the balance to \nwhich the Democratic leader spoke. It has provided a balance between \nlabor and management, and that should be preserved.\n  It has been mentioned that there were other Executive orders which \nwere undertaken, and we have debated this before. Just to reiterate, \nhowever, no previous Executive order by President Bush or President \nReagan went this far in contradicting both the law and the will of \nCongress.\n  President Reagan's order banned illegally striking air traffic \ncontrollers from Federal employment. This was well within his rights \nand was not contrary to existing law. President Bush's order on Beck \nwas merely enforcing existing law. President Bush's order on prehire \ncontracts was not preceded by extensive debate and defeat by Congress, \nas has been the case with striker replacement legislation. He may well \nhave exceeded his authority on that Executive order on prehire \ncontracts, but it was never an order that was challenged by the courts \nor challenged in Congress.\n  I think we are seeing here that under this Executive order Federal \ncontractors will effectively be barred from exercising a longstanding \nlegal right--just as labor has the right to strike--that all other \ncompanies are permitted to do under existing labor law.\n  Regardless of which side we might take on the issue of striker \nreplacements, we should all be concerned, Mr. President, about the \nprecedent this Executive order would set for future Presidents.\n  What if a new administration decided to debar any contractor whose \nworkers decided to go on strike? Would we feel the same way about an \nExecutive order that infringed on the equally longstanding right to \nstrike?\n  It has also been argued that this Executive order will have only a \nlimited impact, that perhaps only a dozen companies would be affected. \nMr. President, the Federal Government contracts for close to 180 \nbillion dollars' worth of goods and services. Many defense contractors \nwould be affected, and that is why it is fitting this is added as a \ndebate to the defense supplemental bill. This order will potentially \naffect tens of thousands of companies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I yield myself 2 additional minutes.\n  The Defense Department alone has contracts of value greater than \n$100,000 with over 20,000 different companies. This Executive order \nwould cover Federal construction projects, potentially colleges and \nuniversities with Federal research contracts, hospitals and health care \nproviders that contract with the Federal Government. It is very unclear \nas to what exactly this Executive order might apply. As was pointed out \nby the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from Oklahoma, the \nSecretary of Labor has a great deal of discretion under this Executive \norder to decide when it may or may not apply.\n  Over 30 years ago, the Supreme Court overturned President Truman's \nattempt to seize control of the steel mills by Executive order. I \nbelieve Justice Black's opinion in the Youngstown case is relevant \nhere. He said:\n\n       In the framework of our Constitution, the President's power \n     to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea \n     that he is to be a lawmaker. The Constitution limits his \n     functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of \n     laws he thinks wise and the vetoing of laws he thinks bad.\n\n  I believe the President has exceeded his authority here by attempting \nto make the law, dictating the terms of our national labor policy, by \nmeans of the Executive order in direct contravention of current law.\n  Congress makes the law, not the President, and we should not \nrelinquish our role in setting national labor policy by allowing this \nExecutive order to stand. I urge my colleagues to support cloture in \norder to reassert the authority of the Congress and to bring this \ndebate to a close.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Just over 4 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 3 minutes and then whatever time I will \nyield back, to let the majority leader have the final word.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for both her \nexplanation and the justification for her amendment. Over the period of \nthe last several days, we have tried to go through the circumstances of \nthe Youngstown case and distinguish the executive authority that \nPresident Truman attempted to assert in that case and the executive \nauthority that President Clinton is exercising with regard to this \norder, and I think we have made that case in a very compelling way. I \nthink anyone who reads through the Record would find the analysis \npersuasive. I respect the fact that Senator Kassebaum does not believe \nthis is really about broader public policy issues. But I must take \nissue with her in that conclusion.\n  We are not debating on the floor of the Senate the issue of what we \nare going to do about increasing the minimum wage.\n  My Republican colleague have not proposed even a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution to say, for instance, that working families are falling \nfurther and further behind; that we think work ought to be adequately \ncompensated; that we think work ought to be recognized; that we think \nany American who works 40 hours a week 52 a weeks a year ought to \nreceive a decent wage. Not even a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to say \nperhaps we are not going to address this on this particular bill, but \nwe are prepared to work to protect the future of working families; we \nare prepared to work to protect their interests in terms of their \nchildren who might need a summer job or their small children who might \nneed a school lunch; we are prepared to speak up about the needs of \nworking families. Nothing to say we differ with you on this Executive \norder, but we are for working families. And that is what this debate is \nreally about.\n  What we are voting on takes place against the background of what has \nhappened to family incomes since 1980, and the fact that the only real \ngrowth in family incomes that has taken place is among the families at \nthe top--the wealthiest individuals in this country.\n  That is the background of what has happened to the income of working \nfamilies over the past 20 years, and now we are debating against this \nbackground a measure that is going to further attack the legitimate \nrights of working people who are hard-working, who are trying to make \nit, but whose incomes have been held down over the last two decades. \nThose are the people who are going to be affected by the President's \nExecutive order which my Republican colleagues are trying to block.\n  [[Page S3918]] We have illustrated in the course of this debate the \nkinds of people who will be adversely impacted if the Senator's \namendment is adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator his 3 minutes \nhave expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, therefore, it is my hope that the motion \nto invoke cloture would not pass, that the amendment itself would be \nwithdrawn and that we would go back to further consideration of the \nvery important underlying defense appropriations bill.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Just over 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me just lay it out cold. This is all \nabout politics. It has nothing to do with workers or anybody else.\n  Last week, President Clinton kicked off his 1996 reelection campaign \nby signing an Executive order that would prohibit Federal contractors \nfrom hiring permanent replacement workers during economic strikes.\n  Despite all the talk about fostering fairness in the Federal \nworkplace, the Executive order is a transparent effort on the \nPresident's part to shore up a political base that he believes is vital \nto his own reelection chances.\n  During the past several years, Congress has considered, and \nrepeatedly rejected, the so-called striker-replacement bill. That is \nwhy the President is setting a dangerous precedent if he believes he\n can revive this defeated legislation simply by issuing an executive \norder.\n\n  It is the responsibility of Congress, not the administration, to \nwrite the laws governing labor-management relations in this country.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this motion to \ninvoke cloture. The amendment offered by my friend and colleague from \nKansas, Senator Kassebaum, will help restore the careful balance--that \nis what we want--a careful balance between labor and management that \nhas been the hallmark of our system of collective bargaining for more \nthan 60 years.\n  The President's misguided directive is a politically inspired attempt \nto do an end run around the legislative process. I do not believe it \nshould go unchallenged.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/15/senate-section/article/S3909-4", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nvote on the conference report accompanying S. 1, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the House to the bill (S. 1) \n     to curb the practice of imposing unfunded Federal mandates on \n     States and local governments; to strengthen the partnership \n     between the Federal Government and State, local and tribal \n     governments; to end the imposition, in the absence of full \n     consideration by Congress, of Federal mandates on State, \n     local, and tribal governments without adequate funding, in a \n     manner that may displace other essential governmental \n     priorities; and to ensure that the Federal Government pays \n     the costs incurred by those governments in complying with \n     certain requirements under Federal statutes and regulations; \n     and for other purposes, having met, after full and free \n     conference, have agreed to recommend and do recommend to \n     their respective Houses this report, signed by all of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the conference report.\n                              section 105\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I invite the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee to engage in a colloquy with me on section 105 of the \nconference report on S. 1, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.\n  During consideration of S. 1 before the full Senate, I offered an \namendment which makes clear that nothing in this legislation denies \nFederal funding to States, local, or tribal governments because they \nare already complying with all or part of a Federal mandate. That \namendment is now section 105 of the bill.\n  The conferees modified my language by stating that my amendment made \nreference to any mandates that are funded pursuant to section 425(a)(2) \nof the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, as \nadded by section 101 of this act.\n  However, the report language accompanying S. 1 refers to section \n425(b)(2).\n  I ask the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, is this reference in \nthe conference report incorrect?\n  [[Page S3919]] Mr. DOMENICI. Yes; the Senator is correct. The report \nlanguage inadvertently refers to section 425(b)(2) when it should have \nbeen referring to section 425(a)(2). I appreciate the Senator from \nWisconsin bringing this to the Senate's attention and it is my hope \nthat this colloquy sets the record straight on the intent of the \nconferees on this language.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, when the Senate considered the \nunfunded mandates bill earlier this year, I voted against it. I am \nprepared to vote against the final version of that bill now. My \nconcerns about S. 1 were not addressed in conference and, in fact, one \ncould argue that bill comes back to us in worse shape then it left.\n  The conference made two substantive changes in the bill. First, \njudicial review has been added to an already unwieldy process and, \nsecond, the threshold above which CBO must provide cost estimates for \nprivate sector unfunded mandates has been reduced from $100 to $50 \nmillion.\n  These changes only reinforce my criticism of S. 1 as passed by the \nSenate in January: The procedural hurdles created by this legislation \nwill only add to the arsenal of dilatory tactics which already have the \nability to nuke necessary legislation and destroy public faith in the \nCongress.\n  Last year, I supported legislation that would have addressed the \nproblem of unfunded mandates in an appropriate and effective manner. \nThat bill, S. 993, would have required Congress to think carefully and \ncritically about the mandates we were about to impose upon State and \nlocal governments. We would have to acknowledge the magnitude of the \nburden before we passed legislation. Congress could no longer hide \nbehind ignorance. I believe this bipartisan effort would have remedied \nthe problem of the Federal Government imposing mandates without \nthorough consideration of the financial burdens already faced by other \nlevels of government.\n  The pending legislation, however, goes well beyond that. Not only is \nS. 1 procedurally flawed, it also enshrines the misguided principle and \nthe unjustified presumption that the Federal Government should not \nimpose requirements on the States unless it pays them to carry out the \nmandate. Supporters of the bill will respond that a simple majority can \nwaive the requirements of this bill; however, the politics of such a \nwaiver make this an unlikely occurrence. Clearly, the presumption is \nthat unfunded mandates are inherently bad. I don't agree with that \npremise.\n  Many in Washington seem to have forgotten that State and local \ngovernments benefit from a clean environment and a healthy work force. \nI believe it is the Federal Government's responsibility to act when \nState and local government don't want to spend the money to prevent \npollution or to immunize children. We should be there to stop gun-\nrunning across State lines or the spread of HIV-contaminated blood. We \nhave a role in fighting the flood of illegal immigrants across our \nborders or the flow of people across State lines as a result of benefit \nshopping.\n  I am proud to represent a State which has some of the toughest \nenvironmental laws in the country. New Jersey cares for its disabled. \nWe have tough gun control laws and occupational safety regulations. But \nthese strengths could\n become a disadvantage to us if Federal standards are weakened or \neliminated. I'll provide an example which was only too true for my \nState just a few years ago.\n\n  In the late 1980's, hundreds of millions of dollars were lost to New \nJersey's economy because of another State's negligence. Raw sewage and \nmedical waste originating from a neighboring State washed up on our \nbeaches. This well-publicized problem not only tarnished by State's \nreputation--tourism is our largest employer--it cost us millions to \nclean it up. Federal Government intervention was necessary. An unfunded \nmandate was imposed upon the polluting State, but it was a necessary \nmandate and I believe it was proper that it was largely unfunded.\n  Today we are institutionalizing a dangerous precedent: unless the \nFederal Government pays, States do not have to comply with Federal \nstandards. Many States will have no incentive to try to prevent \ntransborder pollution. Why should a State worry about its neighbors \nwhen it could spend that money on its own constituents. Would enough \nU.S. Senators look with sympathy on those States who are victims of \nanother's pollution so that they would waive the requirements created \nunder this legislation? I hope so, but I have enough doubts that I must \nvote against this conference report.\n  Why has the Federal Government set standards to prevent States from \ncutting off food stamps to children or eliminating aid to legal \nimmigrants? Because we know that some States, but for the Federal \nstandards, would do exactly that. We created these standards because we \ndid not want the kind of country where kids in one State would be \ndenied nutritional assistance while the children of another \njurisdiction received the benefits of such aid. We did not want a \nsociety that would cause some citizens to be disadvantaged merely \nbecause they had the misfortune of being born or raised in a State \nwhich did not place the same priority on pollution prevention or on \ncaring for poor children.\n  Mr. President, we do need to deal with the problem created when one \nlevel of government shifts the cost of programs to another level of \ngovernment. But we have to do so in a way which is consistent with both \nthe Federal structure of our society and the compassion which powers us \nas a people. I do not believe this bill is consistent with those \ncharacteristics of our country. And I fear that it is simply a \nprecursor of efforts to develop no-strings block grants which could, in \nthe name of flexibility, destroy the ability of all Americans--wherever \nthey live--to count on their Government to provide certain levels of \nservices and meet certain standards of conduct.\n  For me, then, this is just the first step in what I suspect will be a \nlong but ultimately triumphant fight to preserve the Federal nature of \nour system and the national character of the American experience.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, when I came to the Senate 2 years \nago, I was surprised to discover that there was almost no discussion \nabout the impact of mandates imposed by the Federal Government on State \nand local governments. Yet, today we are voting to implement \nlegislation that shows that Congress promises to curb the practice of \nimposing Federal mandates on State and local governments without \nadvance, complete disclosure of the impact of those mandates. As a \nstrong supporter of this legislation, I am happy that we were able to \ncome together to pass this long needed legislation.\n  S. 1 has achieved an important balance--a balance between the \nbenefits of mandates and their costs. We have also achieved an \nimportant balance between the Federal, State, and local governments' \nroles in the writing of Federal regulations to implement legislation. \nCreating a mechanism that will help ensure that the voice of State and \nlocal governments is heard in Washington before legislation is enacted \nis both sound policy, and something that has long been needed.\n  S. 1 will make Federal officials more accountable. The Federal \nGovernment has foisted too many of the costs of Federal mandates on \nState and local governments for too long. Asking the Federal Government \nto make its decisions with good information--with the best information \nwe can get on the State and local governments that will have to live by \nthose decisions--should not be\n controversial. Rather, it is the way decisions should always have been \nmade, and the way decisions should always be made in the future.\n\n  S. 1 requires the congressional committees to report on the costs and \nbenefits anticipated from any Federal mandates contained in the bills \nthey report to the Senate for action, including the effects of the \nmandate on health and safety, and the protection of the environment.\n  S. 1 has also achieved a better balance between the Federal, State, \nand local governments' roles in the writing of Federal regulations to \nimplement legislation. Now State and local governments are partners to \nthe Federal Government in writing these implementing regulations. \nMandates impact big cities and small communities differently, yet \nrarely are regulations \n [[Page S3920]] written to be sensitive to those differences. S. 1 \nrequires that special outreach efforts be made to ensure that the \nvoices of all State and local governments are heard.\n  S. 1 is an important step in the right direction. It creates \nequilibrium between the Federal Government and State and local \ngovernments. Now agencies will be required to estimate the costs of new \nrules to governments and industries and also analyze the effect of new \nrules on the U.S. economy, employment, and international \ncompetitiveness.\n  To further increase the Federal Government's accountability, State \nand local governments will now be allowed to challenge whether or not \nFederal agencies have completed required\n cost-benefit analysis. As State and local governments have to live by \nthose decisions, it is right that Federal officials are held \naccountable for their analysis. However, the purpose of the bill was \nnot to have courts second guess the Congressional Budget Office's \nattempts at analysis, which are often done quickly to satisfy numerous \nrequests, but to redress failures of an agency to prepare written \nstatements of mandate cost estimates.\n\n  S. 1, however is not a repudiation of the whole idea of mandates. The \nmandates that the Federal Government used to make real progress in \ncivil rights and our treatment of the disabled, for example, were \nessential to our progress as a nation, and as a people. I applaud the \nfact that S. 1 recognizes how essential those mandates were and are, \nand that under the terms of the bill, future civil rights legislation \nwhich builds on this tradition will be exempt from S. 1.\n  S. 1 is necessary not because mandates are wrong in principle. The \nreal reason it passed is because of the budgetary shell game that was \nplayed in the 1980's. The 1980's were a time when many domestic \nprograms were slashed, with mandates pushing the responsibilities onto \nhard-pressed State and local governments. I was in the Illinois House \nwhen President Reagan introduced the New Federalism. It was supposed to \nredefine the relationship among Federal, State, and local governments. \nWhat it really did was to make large cuts in Federal taxes, and push \noff the responsibilities of providing necessary services to State and \nlocal governments--without sending the money. The net result of that \nexercise in\n fiscal subterfuge was an explosion of Federal debt from only about $1 \ntrillion in 1980 to closing in on $5 trillion now.\n\n  S. 1 is designed to ensure that the kind of budget fraud we saw in \nthe 1980's won't be repeated in the remainder of the 1990's, or in the \nnext century. S. 1 cannot undo the mistakes made in the 1980's. What it \ncan do, and what we must do, is help ensure that we don't repeat those \nmistakes. Now Congress will make informed decisions that give the \ninterests of State and local governments the attention and \nconsideration that they deserve.\n  S. 1 had strong bipartisan support when it passed the Senate on \nJanuary 27, 1995, with a vote of 86-10. It also had strong support in \nthe last Congress, when the Democrats controlled both the House and the \nSenate. S. 1 has strong support from Democratic mayors such as Mayor \nRichard Daley of Chicago, and from other Democratic and Republican \nmayors across the country. Governor Edgar of Illinois wrote me \nsupporting S. 1, and numerous county boards in Illinois also wrote in \nsupport of this legislation. It is clear that unfunded mandates have \nconsumed an increasing share of State and local budgets, and that it is \ntime for a change.\n  We are all in this together, Mr. President. The Federal Government, \nState governments, and local governments, are all trying to meet their \nresponsibilities to the American people. S. 1 will promote cooperation \nbetween the various levels of government, and make it easier to address \nthe problems that the American people elected us all to solve.\n  I want to conclude my remarks by congratulating my colleague from \nIdaho, Senator Kempthorne, and my colleague from Ohio, Senator Glenn, \nfor their leadership in crafting this legislation. I am pleased that we \nhave the opportunity today to enact this important and meaningful \nreform.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the conference report on \nS. 1, the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995. It is great pleasure to \nspeak on the floor about a conference report on this bill, because it \nmeans we have come a long way.\n  I remember when Senator Domenici and I introduced our own bill on \nunfunded mandates in the fall of 1993. I have been working to rein in \nFederal mandates ever since.\n  I want to start by thanking the ranking member of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, Senator Glenn. Senator Glenn had been a leader in \nmandate reform long before this issue was popular. Under his \nleadership, the committee held three hearings on this bill before our \nmarkup last year. One of those was a field hearing that I chaired in \nMinot, ND. And of course, we had our joint hearing with the Budget \nCommittee in January.\n  I would also like to salute Senator Kempthorne for his hard work on \nthis bill. I knew it was his top priority when we both joined the \nSenate 2 years ago. And his efforts have today borne fruit with the \nadoption of this conference report on S. 1.\n\n\n                       curbing unfunded mandates\n\n  Mr. President, S. 1 has a simple premise--that the Federal Government \nshould not impose financial mandates on State and local governments \nwithout adequate consideration of those mandates, and that we should \ntry our best to provide funding for those mandates.\n  Much of this bill matches closely S. 1592, the Fiscal Accountability \nand Intergovernmental Reform Act, or FAIR Act, which Senator Domenici \nand I introduced in the last Congress. S. 1 would require that the \nCongressional Budget Office review legislation for the costs that \nmandates would impose on State, local, and tribal Governments. If a \nbill is not analyzed by CBO, a point of order could lie against the \nbill. S. 1 would also require regulatory review of proposed rulemakings \nproposed by agencies in the executive branch. This is a vital step \nbecause Congress cannot always anticipate how a regulation will be \ninterpreted. S. 1 would closely parallel the regulatory review \nExecutive orders issued by President Clinton. I am pleased to see these \ntwo principles of my own mandate relief bill at the heart of S. 1.\n  During my work on mandate relief, I have heard from State and local \nofficials in North Dakota about the costs that Federal mandates impose. \nExamples of especially burdensome\n mandates include cleanup responsibilities under Superfund. The city of \nMinot is entangled in a wrangle with potentially responsible parties \nover cleanup costs for old Minot landfill. The Minot landfill, used \nbetween 1962 and 1970, is now a Superfund site. The city of Minot has \nbeen working to clean up that site since 1986. To date, Minot has spent \n$873,000 in order to comply with environmental mandates.\n\n  Water testing mandates can also be unreasonable--Sherwood, ND, \npopulation 286, must spend $2,000 annually--half its budget--to test \nits water supply. Even small communities must have clean drinking \nwater. But they should also have flexibility in abiding by burdensome \nmandates. And they certainly are entitled to know how burdensome a bill \ncould turn out to be.\n\n\n                        private sector analysis\n\n  Another part of our society that needs notice of and information on \ncostly mandates is the private sector. I am very pleased that the \nconferees have retained an amendment on this subject that I offered in \nmarkup last year. My amendment would require that the CBO analyze \nmandates on the private sector. The requirement is not as strict as \nthat for analysis of intergovernmental mandates--if CBO cannot \nreasonably make an estimate of a private sector mandate, the bill would \ncreate no point of order--but the argument is the same.\n  My point in offering this amendment was simply that there is no \nreason not to analyze costs on the private sector if we do the analysis \nfor the public sector. To pretend we need to have CBO analyze the \nimpact of public sector mandates, while skipping over the private \nsector, is to violate elementary economics. The private sector is three \nor four times bigger than the public sector. If we should assess the \nimpact of unfunded mandates on local governments we surely should \nassess the impact on our Nation's businesses. The \n [[Page S3921]] private sector is the foundation on which we build the \nbudgets of the Federal Government and the State and local governments.\n  I know some of my colleagues are concerned about analyzing private \nsector mandates. However, the analysis required by my amendment is no \ngreat mystery. We already examine the impact of paperwork on the \nprivate sector. Federal agencies must calculate the hours required to \nfill out paper. The Internal Revenue Service performs analysis of tax \nlegislation and possible effects on the private sector. The Joint Tax \nCommittee performs the same function for proposed legislation.\n  The Office of Management and Budget's Office of Information and \nRegulatory Affairs has a regulatory review program that oversees the \ndevelopment of all Federal regulations. President Clinton's Executive \nOrder 12866--Regulatory Planning and Review--requires agencies to \nconduct analysis of costs to the private sector of proposed \nregulations. The Office of Management and Budget therefore has \ndeveloped a reservoir of knowledge on the impact of public laws.\n  Federal agencies have long experience in analyzing the costs to the \nprivate sector of relevant legislation and regulation. USDA studies the \nimpacts of laws on our Nation's farmers. The Commerce Department's \nBureau of Economic Analysis reviews economic impacts on the private \nsector. Our trade agencies study the economic impact of trade policies. \nEPA has calculated that the costs of environmental mandates to the \nprivate sector has risen from $16.2 billion in 1972 to an estimated \n$76.1 billion in 1995--constant 1986 dollars.\n  And the duties that S. 1 would impose on the Congressional Budget \nOffice are not new. The CBO has estimated private sector effects of \ncomplicated legislation--NAFTA and two proposed health care reform \nbills are outstanding examples.\n  So, Mr. President, the analysis of private sector costs is not rocket \nscience. And this information will be cheap at the price. The CBO has a \nrunning start, and can use its knowledge base from existing analyses \nand models. This conference report authorizes $4.5 million a year for \nthe CBO for this mandate review analysis work to begin.\n  I predict that CBO review will pay for itself many times over by \nenabling the Congress to avoid burdening businesses with ill-considered \nmandates. I would like to thank the conferees for retaining my private \nsector amendment in this bill.\n\n\n                            other amendments\n\n  Let me also briefly mention two other amendments of mine that the \nSenate added to this bill. A number of North Dakotans have been \nparticularly irked by the requirement that Federal building projects be \nbuilt according to metric measurements rather than English ones. This \nis increasing the cost of medical staff housing being built on an \nIndian reservation in my State. Fortunately, the Indian Health Service \nhas now agreed to drop this costly and unworkable requirement, which \nwould have delayed staffing for an Indian hospital.\n  However, as a policy matter I think we need to suspend this mandate \nnow, study its costs, and decide whether we really need it. I offered \nan amendment to do that on the floor, and after some discussion the \nSenate passed that amendment. I am pleased that the conferees have \nretained that amendment in the conference report.\n  Lastly, title III of the conference report retains my suggestion that \nwe not set up a new commission to study Federal mandates but rather \nassign that task to the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental \nRelations [ACIR]. ACIR has the knowledge, experience, trust and network \nto get this study done and do it well. I did not understand why we \nneeded a new commission when this Congress has been working hard to cut \nboards and commissions. I am glad the conferees have taken my point and \nhave provided that ACIR shall do the studying. I look forward to \nworking with the Senator from Idaho, the Senator from Ohio, and other \ninterested Senators to ensure that the ACIR receives the funding that \nthis bill authorizes for both this fiscal year and next.\n  Mr. President, let me just conclude by saying that I am pleased that \nthe long unfunded mandates debate has finally come to fruition. I would \nthank Senators Glenn and Kempthorne for their leadership on this issue, \nand for their willingness to hear out my concerns with this bill and \nmake changes. I think our consideration of this bill on the floor \nimproved it markedly, and I appreciated the opportunity to help in that \neffort.\n  This bill makes a real and positive change in the relationship \nbetween the Federal Government and State, local, and tribal \ngovernments. I hope the House will pass S. 1 tomorrow, and I look \nforward to the President's signing this bill very soon.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will be voting in opposition to the \nconference report to S. 1, because the problems I had with the bill as \nit passed the Senate have not been resolved or abated in the conference \nreport. I had hoped to be able to support legislation this year to \naddress the unfunded mandates problem of State, local, and tribal \ngovernments. I was a cosponsor of last year's bill, S. 993, which was \nwholeheartedly endorsed by all the organizations representing majors, \nGovernors, State legislators, county officials, and other local elected \nofficials. Last year's bill would have forced Congress to estimate the \ncosts of Federal mandates and authorize appropriations to the level of \nthe estimated costs. In the words of the State and local officials last \nyear, it was a tough, important, meaningful bill.\n  Having served on the Detroit City Council for many years in the \n1970's, I am well aware of the problems and constraints Federal \nmandates place on local officials. My first Senate campaign in 1978 was \nbased on my desire to make the Federal bureaucrats more sensitive to \nlocal concerns. And I know these problems continue and that Congress \nsimply hasn't paid enough attention to the costs we impose on State and \nlocal governments. Yet, I did not support S. 1 as it passed the Senate, \nand I cannot support the conference report.\n  In some respects, S. 1 simply goes too far; in other respects, it \npromises more than it can deliver. It goes too far in taking CBO cost \nestimates and locking them in for at least 5 years as the level at \nwhich we are expected to fund State and local governments. While these \ncost estimates may be useful for us in assessing the costs and benefits \nof legislating in a particular area, they are far too unreliable to \nserve as the basis for a mandated level of appropriations. An effort \nwas made to address this concern when Senator Byrd offered an amendment \nto require agencies to notify Congress when the level of appropriations \nfalls short of the CBO cost estimate. That was an improvement; but it \nwasn't enough, because absent our enactment of another law in response \nto that notice, the mandate at issue would expire. S. 1, therefore, \nends up requiring that we legislate twice on the very same issues--once \nwhen we appropriate at a level less than the estimated cost of the \nmandate and once again to affirm that prior appropriations amount.\n  S. 1 is inadequate in that it fails to address what I believe will be \nthe real life concerns of State, local, and tribal governments in the \nnext 10 years as we face scarce Federal resources. The problem won't be \nso much the number of mandates we place on State and local governments; \nit will be the fact that we will be pulling out Federal funds and \nassistance used to address problems that won't go away when the Federal \nmoney does. We will be cutting funds for education, the homeless, \ncommunity\n development, you name it, and State and local governments will be left \nto solve the problems with their own resources. S. 1 does not address \nthat situation.\n\n  Another problem with S. 1 is the inherent unfairness in the bill's \ntreatment between the public and private sector. S. 1 requires us to \novercome a point of order if we don't pay for a Federal \nintergovernmental mandate, but it doesn't create a similar point of \norder for private sector mandates. There is a presumption created \nthereby that we should fund the mandate or not apply it to the public \nsector. This is particularly troubling when the State, local, or tribal \ngovernment is acting in the same capacity as a private sector entity. \nS. 1 could put private entities at a competitive disadvantage relative \nto State, local, and tribal governments \n [[Page S3922]] that operate the same kind of businesses.\n  S. 1 also has the potential of causing havoc in the legislative \nprocess and aiding in the very gridlock we are all so desperate to \navoid. It's very important that we require an analysis of the impact of \ncosts on State and local governments and the private sector before a \ncommittee reports a bill to the full Senate for consideration. That's \nwhat the hearing process is supposed to be about. The public is \nsupposed to let us know just what the consequences of our proposals \ncould be. And, it's very important that the requirement for a cost \nanalysis be enforced by saying that a point of order will lie against a \nbill\n that doesn't have that cost analysis. But to go to the next step and \nsay that an often problematical cost estimate will now become the \nactual cost--that what CBO estimates will be the cost to State and \nlocal governments for each year of the authorization, moves from being \na cost estimate to an assertion of actual costs and that that level of \ncosts should be funded--that is an unreasonable approach. And the \nmechanisms used to enforce that approach could cause endless delays and \ntie up the legislative process.\n\n  For these reasons, Mr. President, I will vote against the conference \nreport. I do want to commend, however, Senator Glenn and Senator \nKempthorne in their successful effort on this bill. Setting aside our \ndiffering opinions on the final outcome, I think these two gentleman \nhave conducted themselves in a remarkably able fashion with good humor \nand a strong sense of fairness. I particularly appreciate Senator \nGlenn's efforts to be responsive to my concerns, and I congratulate him \non accomplishing passage of this bill. The State and local officials \nhave a great friend and supporter in the senior Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne).

Mr. President, I am very pleased at this time, along with \nmy friend and colleague from Missouri, Mr. Bond, as cochairs to lay \nbefore the Senate the Final Report of the Senate Task Force on Funding \nDisaster Relief. The task force was established pursuant to a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution contained in Public Law 103-211, the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations relief bill for victims of the Northridge, \nCA, earthquake.\n  I think I can speak for Senator Bond when I say that our sense of \naccomplishment in presenting this report is somewhat tempered by events \npast and present, in that we have just marked the solemn 1-year \nanniversary of the devastating California earthquake. For all the good \nthat has happened in the past year, thanks to selfless efforts by \nfriends, neighbors, charities and, yes, Government bureaucrats of all \nstripes, we know that for so many their lives have been irrevocably \nchanged.\n  We also share the grief and shock of the Japanese people who had a \ntragedy of their own, the horrendous Kobe earthquake. We know the \ncharacter of the Japanese people, and given some time and help--and we \nare glad President Clinton and the able Director of the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency [FEMA], James Lee Witt, have offered some \nof our technical expertise--we know the Japanese will soon be on their \nfeet again.\n  These catastrophes--and need I mention the terribly destructive \nfloods which recently rained down on California--underscore the \nimportance of having an integrated and comprehensive emergency \nmanagement system, and we are making great progress toward that goal \ntoday.\n  Our task force was commissioned to look at Federal disaster \nassistance programs, funding and effectiveness, possible program and \npolicy modifications, budgetary and funding options, and the role of \nState, local, and other service providers.\n  The report covers a spectrum of issues on how we can best ensure that \nFederal assistance will always be there when needed and how our \ndisaster response system might be made more efficient and more cost-\neffective. Given the enormity of this project, Senator Bond and I \ndecided to enlist the resources of congressional entities such as the \nCongressional Budget Office [CBO], the Library of Congress, and, in \nparticular, the General Accounting Office [GAO], which we tasked to \ncoordinate and take the lead working with our staff on the preparation \nof this study.\n  The end product, I believe, is a testament to the professional work \nand collaboration of all of these different groups and bodies. Many \nindividuals labored long and hard, and we in the Senate owe them a debt \nof gratitude.\n  One of the more striking aspects we found was the lack of \ncomprehensive Government-wide data on Federal disaster expenditures. I \nhad thought going in this would be readily available. We found it was \nnot. While most agencies can produce statistics for a particular \ndisaster or annual spending, the number of persons assisted and \nestimated benefits, these have not been systematically collected across \nGovernment--until now.\n  GAO has totaled up how much we have spent across the board between \n1977 through 1993. In doing so, they examined our disaster planning, \nmitigation response, and recovery programs, and these programs I would \nlike to describe in just a little bit more detail.\n  Our disaster preparedness and mitigation programs consist chiefly of \nFEMA grants and assistance for fire suppression, floodplain management, \nearthquake and hurricane vulnerability; flood control and coastal \nerosion works under the Army Corps of Engineers; NOAA's severe weather \ntracking programs; U.S.G.S. earthquake and volcanic reduction programs, \nand; coastal zone management activities through the Department of \nCommerce.\n  In the area of Federal disaster response and recovery programs, we \nare dealing primarily with FEMA's individual and public assistance \ngrants, temporary housing, community disaster loans, and unemployment \nbenefits; Small Business Administration loans; repairing crucial \nroadways through the Department of Transportation; aid for the \nrestoration of school facilities by the Department of Education; \ndisaster \n [[Page S3923]] recovery grants by the Economic Development \nAdministration; emergency disaster assistance loans, payments and food \nstamps administered by the Department of Agriculture, and; the Army \nCorps' emergency water supply operations and flood control and coastal \nworks repair.\n  To state the obvious, our emergency management system is far, far \nmore complex than most people realize. It involves quite a number of \nGovernment agencies.\n  I should note that these figures do not include FEMA's mission \nassignment requests of other agencies to provide specific types of \nassistance, depending on the situation and the need.\n  There is a pervasive cynicism in our land today that derides \nGovernment's ability to deliver efficient and effective services and to \nreturn taxpayer dollars in a meaningful way to those who sent them to \nWashington in the first place. In short, to touch people's lives when \nthere is a desperate need.\n  What I just listed does that and more. We may talk about cutting \nGovernment, but these programs I feel are real, they are vital, and \nthey are indispensable.\n  If in times of major emergencies we do not provide this assistance, \nthen who will? I spent many days on the floor managing the minority \nside for the unfunded mandates bill and agree with much of what is said \nby States and localities regarding Federal mandates. But what we, the \nFeds, have spent in helping States and our citizens prepare for, \nrespond to, and recover from disasters has never really been quantified \nuntil today.\n  This report shows that from fiscal years 1977 through 1993, Federal \nagencies obligated almost $120 billion for emergency management \nprograms--$120 billion in constant 1993 dollars for emergency \nmanagement programs.\n  Most of which, about $87 billion, was for post-disaster recovery \nassistance. Over $64 billion, 54 percent of the total, was in the form \nof either grants to disaster victims and communities or expenses from \ndisaster-related activities and response. Some $55 billion, 46 percent \nof the total, consisted of various disaster recovery loans made by \nFEMA, SBA, or the Farmers Home Administration.\n  Since a large portion of the loans will ultimately be repaid, the \nentire loan amount is not necessarily a Federal cost, though costs are \nincurred through subsidized interest rates and when loans are forgiven \nor are written off.\n  (Mr. THOMAS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. GLENN. For example, during this same timeframe, the Farmers Home \nAdministration [FmHA] obligated over $34 billion for disaster emergency \nloans and wrote off about $7.5 billion. That is not too bad in a \nsituation like this, I do not think.\n  To sum up, we have spent directly over $64 billion between fiscal \nyears 1977 and 1993 and some $55 billion indirectly through low-cost \nGovernment loans.\n  While this data is the best we have to date, it is not exhaustive. It \nexcludes what we have spent to repair or rebuild damaged Federal \nGovernment facilities, which we do not currently track. It also does \nnot include costs incurred by the Federal Government through subsidies \nand disaster insurance programs.\n  During this timeframe, we spent about $10 billion on the Federal Crop \nInsurance Program and almost $3 billion in costs through FEMA's \nNational Flood Insurance Program.\n  Last year, Congress did change both of these programs to make them \nmore cost-effective, to minimize potential losses but still provide \nprotection from these tragic events at a reasonable cost.\n  We soon will consider another supplemental bill to pay for additional \ncosts from the Northridge earthquake. I know this is something my \ndistinguished co-chair will be holding a hearing on, I believe \ntomorrow, in the HUD-VA Subcommittee on Appropriations, and \nparticularly how we are going to pay for this request. That is a tough \none.\n  As our communities continue to grow, so do our potential risks and \nliabilities. We need to see if there are better ways to prepare \nfinancially for such catastrophic events.\n  Increasingly, the debates on disaster relief aid and where the money \ncomes from have grown rather contentious, and that is understandable.\n  Since these measures are deemed ``emergencies,'' they have not been \nsubject to budget caps requiring program offsets, so they add to the \ndeficit.\n  Also, these bills have become too often the proverbial Christmas \ntrees for items that may have little or no bearing on our disaster \nresponse efforts.\n  In other words, people know this legislation is going to go through, \nit is going to pass in some form, so whatever their pet program is, \nwith the Senate's lack of germaneness rules, it can be brought out and \nattached. It is something I think we ought to correct in Senate rules \nand procedures sometime in the future.\n  But anyway, this tendency to treat some of these emergency bills as \nChristmas trees has attracted heightened scrutiny and distracts us and \nthe public from our purpose at hand, which is to help fellow citizens \nin their time of need.\n  The report we are releasing today proposes several funding and \nbudgetary options for consideration of the Senate.\n  By changing current procedures, these options could reduce the use of \nemergency supplementals and lower total Federal spending--but at a \nprice, making it harder to provide such aid.\n  Our mission with this report was not one of coming up with one firm, \nsolid recommendation. It was to lay out options for the Senate's \nconsideration. It was to define problems, how we have dealt with these \nthings in the past, and what options we have for dealing with them in \nthe future.\n  Each of these options is more fully described in an appendix to my \nstatement, which I ask unanimous consent be included at the completion \nof my remarks, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GLENN. Each of these options has its own advantages and \ndisadvantages, and there probably is no clean, pure and simple magic \nbullet because, for one reason, we do not have clean and simple \ndisasters out there so we can plan for them in advance like we might \nprefer to do.\n  There are five basic options:\n  First, tighten the criteria for using the emergency safety valve of \nthe Budget Enforcement Act.\n  In other words, setting a threshold on what is categorized as truly \nemergency spending. This could mean that States don't always request \nFederal funding on things that normally, in times past, could and \nshould have been taken care of by the local community or the county or \nthe State government.\n  Second, fund disaster programs at historic average levels.\n  Third, establishing a rainy day fund to cover future disaster \nexpenses for Federal disaster relief.\n  Fourth, eliminate the emergency safety valve and cut other spending \nto offset the cost of disaster assistance.\n  Fifth, allow funding only for emergencies in any supplemental \ncontaining an emergency designation.\n  Those are five options.\n  With increasing budgetary constraints, these approaches deserve \nserious consideration. I know Senator Bond is going to be on the hot \nseat grappling with these issues on his appropriations subcommittee, \nparticularly what the implications are if his subcommittee accounts \nwill have to absorb much of the current supplemental request. In other \nwords, what is going to get cut if it all has to come out of his \nsubcommittee accounts. I do not think it right that this should happen, \nbut that is one of the things he has to deal with--whether these funds \nwill come out of veterans programs, out of the space station, or out of \nlow-income housing, all of which are covered under his subcommittee.\n  And those are going to be tough decisions.\n  I hope he would not have to make those decisions from within just the \nconfines of that budget restriction, and that we could make separate \nfunds available for emergency consideration. Being forced to change the \nrules in the middle of the game is a very serious policy change and one \nwe should not adopt lightly.\n  Another area I wish to address is the rise in the number of \nPresidentially declared disasters.\n   [[Page S3924]] In 1988, just 7 years ago, we had 17 declared \ndisasters, but in 1993 there were 58.\n  Now, whether that is the result of Mother Nature becoming more testy \nor whether it is classifying more types of events as declared national \ndisasters than in the past, or more generous Presidents--or a \ncombination of all of these things--remains to be seen. But as the \nreport suggests, we might want to examine setting very explicit and \nobjective criteria for Presidential disaster declarations.\n  I also want to note two integral components of our emergency \nmanagement system. We depend on the States and localities--the \nemergency managers, the firefighters, the rescue squads and, sometimes, \nthe National Guard--to be the primary responders in times of \ndifficulty, times of disaster. And that is as it has been in the past.\n  We do not want it to be that every time some disaster occurs, the \nFederal Government is called in to do everything rather than having \nState and local people be mainly responsible themselves. The efforts of \nthese primary responders, the emergency managers, the firefighters, \nrescue squads and, sometimes, the Guard are augmented through the good \nwork of charitable organizations like the American Red Cross, the \nSalvation Army, and many other worthy religious, church, and \nprofessional groups.\n  Locally, they provide what historically has been the way in this \ncountry of ours, and that is that neighbors take care of neighbors, \nlocals take care of locals, States take care of their own situation as \nmuch as possible and only call on the Federal Government to supplement \ntheir efforts when things are basically out of control.\n  Now, our report highlights their special role and the enormous \ncontributions made by thousands of dedicated volunteers. But we, the \nFederal Government, need to supplement their efforts where disasters \nget beyond the resources of local communities.\n  By and large, this system has worked well for the vast majority of \ndisasters. It is only when we have a truly catastrophic disaster, one \nthat is beyond the capabilities of these entities, that the Federal \nGovernment enters the picture in any significant way.\n  It is not to say, however, there is no room for improvement. A \nsection of our study looks at how Federal assistance to States, \nlocalities and individuals is being spent. The short answer is: We \nreally do not know. We must do a better job in overseeing what results \nwe are getting for our money, whether the funds are being used \neffectively, and if program objectives are being met.\n  Further, I was also struck by the sheer number of Federal disaster \nprograms we currently have spread across many agencies. I think it is \nimperative we begin to look at whether any of these are redundant or \nduplicative, can be done more efficiently, or organized differently. \nCan they be streamlined or consolidated to maximize resources and \nincrease their efficiency? In a time of budget constraints, a thorough \nreview of the mission, the management and organization of these various \nagency programs is long overdue.\n  We must also remember that our disaster response system is, in fact, \na partnership which is, indeed, a hallmark of our federal system.\n  I know that some States take these matters quite seriously but \nothers, perhaps, less so. As States have been faced with their own \nfiscal constraints, too often their emergency management programs get \ncut to the bone with the assumption: ``Why bother; the Feds will come \nto the rescue.'' That is the wrong attitude.\n  Our own position is shaky enough. We must ensure that the States are \ndoing their part to uphold their end of the bargain.\n  I think it is telling that before this study took shape, neither FEMA \nnor the States had an idea of what the States were spending or getting \nfor their emergency management and related programs. And thanks to this \neffort, FEMA is now working with the National Emergency Managers \nAssociation [NEMA] to do just that. I think it is critical to know \nexactly how the States shape up in this regard.\n  The report also suggests a number of ideas to improve Federal-State \ncoordination such as: adopting performance standards; providing \nincentives for planning and mitigation; cost-sharing reductions for \nthose not up to par; more frequent exercises and training, and; very \nimportantly, I believe, post disaster analysis to learn what worked, \nwhat did not, were the money and resources well spent. In short, to \ndetermine lessons learned after each disaster.\n  We should work with the States to implement these approaches, and \nFEMA is now beginning to do that. We also must make sure FEMA itself \nhas the capabilities to effectively manage and oversee this effort so \nwe will better know how well or how poorly the States are doing their \njob.\n  So, again, I wish to recommend to my colleagues they take a look at \nour task force report. I thank all those who have devoted their time \nand effort to putting it together.\n  In particular, GAO did an outstanding job in supervising and \ncoordinating this effort. It is a job well done. And I already have \nasked unanimous consent the appendix be printed in the Record.\n  I want to close by giving full credit to my cochair in this effort, \nSenator Bond. After the election of last fall, when the leadership in \nthe Senate changed, we sort of changed roles on this a bit. He took a \nmajor role from there on in putting this whole thing together and has \ndone a superb job. I compliment him for his efforts in this regard, for \nleading this effort. It has been a pleasure to work with him on it.\n  We have made a report that does not solve all of our problems, but \nunder his leadership, and working with him, I think we have been able \nto put together a report that is the most definitive report ever on \ndisaster relief assistance, the Federal role, its historical \nconnotations, and to provide some suggestions for the Senate's guidance \nof how we should deal with this in the future.\n  It has been a pleasure to deal with Senator Bond on this. I know he \nwill submit our report on this officially. I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n           Appendix--Task Force Budgetary and Funding Options\n\n\ni. tighten criteria for using the emergency safety valve of the budget \n                         enforcement act (bea)\n\n       This option would require Congress and the President to \n     issue specific, written justifications for designating \n     appropriations as emergencies to escape funding constraints. \n     Such formal criteria could impose a higher threshold that \n     funding measures would have to hurdle to avoid the \n     disciplines of the BEA. How high the threshold would be \n     raised--and how much savings might result--is an open \n     question. But such written justifications would provide \n     Members more information and would presumably give those \n     opposing such funding a more defined target.\n\n\n         ii. fund disaster programs at historic average levels\n\n       This alternative would require appropriations for FEMA, SBA \n     disaster loans, and other disaster programs to be made in \n     regular appropriations bills in amounts equal to an historic \n     average or expected funding need for each program before the \n     emergency designation could be used for supplemental funds. \n     In theory, this should increase regular appropriations for \n     such programs and lower the amounts of emergency \n     supplementals.\n       Currently, the appropriation request for FEMA is loosely \n     based on an historic average, which was calculated years ago \n     and excludes the costs of major disasters. FEMA's regular \n     appropriation was $292 million in 1994. Had the 10-year \n     average of about $645 million been appropriated, the size of \n     FEMA supplementals would have been about $350 million \n     smaller. If the appropriations caps were unchanged--meaning \n     spending in other programs was reduced to accommodate this--\n     the Federal deficit would have been $350 million less.\n       It should be noted that, since 1993, firefighting programs \n     of the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior have \n     been funded based on a 10-year moving average. These programs \n     also have the authority to borrow from other accounts. Since \n     this practice was begun, no supplementals for these \n     activities have been necessary.\n       On the other hand, unobligated balances could accumulate in \n     the program accounts during some periods. If they grew large \n     enough, it would be awfully tempting to lower the threshold \n     of what is really a disaster, be more generous in our \n     response, or to raid it for other purposes.\n       Of course, setting strict definitions of eligible disasters \n     and developing procedures that would isolate this account \n     money could be part of any legislative package to carry out \n     this option.\n\n\n III. establishing a rainy day fund to cover future disaster expenses \n                      for federal disaster relief\n\n       This approach would create a so-called rainy day fund, or \n     reserve account, financed \n      [[Page S3925]] by cutting other discretionary spending, by \n     raising new taxes, or a combination of both.\n       Annual payments to the fund could be made until some \n     desired balance is reached. Spending from this account could \n     be subject to appropriation at the whenever the need arose. \n     Unlike the previous option--where the executive branch could \n     obligate accumulated account funds on their own--this \n     approach would allow Congress to retain the discretion over \n     using this money.\n       This option would cause disaster relief to be paid for up \n     front--either by spending cuts or higher taxes--rather than \n     borrowing and increasing the deficit, as we do now. But \n     again, there could be some temptation--particularly in times \n     of fewer, less costly disasters--for Members to be more \n     generous than envisioned in utilizing any large, accumulated \n     balances in this account.\n\n\n  IV. Eliminate the Emergency safety valve and cut other spending to \n                 offset the cost of disaster assistance\n\n       This alternative would remove the emergency safety valve \n     provided for in the Budget Enforcement Act. Disaster \n     assistance would be paid for by reducing other spending, \n     thereby lowering the Federal deficit.\n       One version of this option would require that current year \n     spending be reduced. Another approach would mandate that \n     discretionary caps be reduced in future years to offset the \n     increase in current year spending.\n       Under both these scenarios, if there is any unnecessary or \n     excess relief now provided, it would be far less likely to \n     occur in this modified pay-as-you-go procedure. Of course, as \n     spending caps grow increasingly tighter, finding the programs \n     to cut to accommodate the variable needs of disaster relief \n     is going to be all the more difficult.\n\n\nV. allow funding only for emergencies in any supplemental containing an \n                         emergency designation\n\n       This option would establish a new point of order in the \n     House and Senate against considering any bill or joint \n     resolution containing an emergency appropriation if it also \n     provides an appropriation for any other nonemergency \n     activity. While not directly addressing disaster assistance \n     funding, it seeks to eliminate the ``Christmas tree'' addons.\n       Opponents of this change could argue there is a \n     longstanding practice of considering supplemental funding \n     needs en masse, and this would be akin to requiring separate \n     votes on provisions of regular appropriations bills.\n       Whether or not this approach would actually reduce the \n     deficit is also open. Nonemergency items in supplementals \n     must be estimated to have no net effect on the deficit, since \n     there is no room left under the spending caps. So some would \n     contend that while the policy might change, the Federal \n     deficit likely would not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I express my sincere thanks to my good \nfriend and colleague from Ohio, Senator Glenn. On this as on other \nmatters he has been very easy to work with. I appreciate the tremendous \nefforts he and his staff put in and the great leadership he showed on \nthis task force.\n\n\n                      Order for Printing of Report\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Glenn that the report of the Senate Bipartisan Task \nForce on Funding Disaster Relief be printed as a Senate document. In \naddition to the usual number of copies, I also ask an additional 300 \ncopies be printed for the use of the Senate. As noted, the task force \nwas established by Public Law 103-211 in February 1994. Subsequently \nSenator Glenn and I were named cochairs of the task force.\n  I understand this request has been cleared on both sides of the \naisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have already said how much I appreciate \nthe opportunity to work with Senator Glenn. He has shown great \ndedication and concern about disaster declarations and how we provide \nassistance. I think he has given, in his remarks, an excellent overview \nof the contents of this report. I join him in commending the GAO, CRS, \nand the other agencies that worked on this, as well as the members of \nthe task force and their staffs. As my colleagues can see, this is no \nsmall task. The information was very difficult to compile. It had not \nbeen done before. I believe it is a useful effort and I commend it to \nmy colleagues. The good news is you do not have to read the whole \nthing. There is an executive summary so you can see what we are talking \nabout.\n  I also want to highlight the comments that Senator Glenn made about \nthe Red Cross, the Salvation Army, the National Guard, the other \norganizations, individual volunteers, and the State and local \ngovernments that respond in these disasters.\n  I have had more experience than I want in dealing with disasters as \nGovernor of Missouri. I found that out of the hardship, death, injury, \ndamage, and widespread devastation that nature frequently visits on our \ncountry comes a tremendous human response that is probably one of the \nmost gratifying and encouraging things one can see in a disaster. I \nalso appreciate Senator Glenn's comments about the funding difficulties \nthat Senator Mikulski, my ranking member, and I on the Veterans' \nAdministration, HUD and Independent Agencies Subcommittees on \nAppropriations will face if we have to make cuts solely in our \nsubcommittee in order to handle the disaster implications. This is \nsomething we do need to address because in no subcommittee in \nAppropriations is there a great deal of slack to cover the costs of \nmajor disasters.\n  Let me share just briefly some of my observations. There are a couple \nof points I want to highlight about this report. As most of my \ncolleagues will remember, nearly 2 years ago the Midwest experienced \none of the worst floods in the Nation's history. It was deemed a 500-\nyear flood in some areas. We in Missouri saw firsthand the devastating \npower of Mother Nature. Families were forced out of homes. Businesses \nand infrastructure, in some cases whole communities, were under water. \nOver the 3-month period of June to August 1993, northern and central \nMissouri received over 24 inches of rain. We thought that was a lot of \nrain. North of us, in east central Iowa, they dwarfed us with over 38 \ninches of rain.\n  The Missouri and Mississippi Rivers crested and fell, crested and \nfell, and then crested again. When the waters finally receded, because \nthe ground was so saturated it took weeks, not days, before people \ncould begin the nasty, dirty business of cleaning up. If you never had \nto be in an area of cleaning up after a major flood, you cannot really \nappreciate how difficult and how unpleasant a task that is. Needless to \nsay, the damage which resulted was extraordinary, and efforts to repair \nroads, levees, airports, and communities are continuing in some areas \neven today.\n  It was with this experience still fresh in my mind that I accepted \nwith pleasure the opportunity to serve as cochair, with my friend \nSenator Glenn, and accepted the responsibilities for the Senate's \nBipartisan Task Force on Funding Disaster Relief last February.\n  As a former Governor who saw several disasters during my two terms as \nwell as a 500-year flood, I was very pleased to be given the \nopportunity to take on the task of reviewing the Federal Government's \ndisaster relief programs and policies. Our task force was asked to do \nseveral things: review the history of disaster relief and its funding; \nevaluate the types and amounts of Federal financial assistance provided \nto individuals as well as State and local governments; review the \nrelationship between funding disaster relief and our budget enforcement \nrules; and report our findings, options, and any recommendations. As \nmentioned earlier, this proved to be an immense task and one which \ncould not have been done without the massive amount of work done by the \nprofessionals at GAO, CBO, and CRS, who teamed up to put together this \nfirst-ever comprehensive review.\n  Our colleagues in Congress have been concerned, and rightfully so, \nthat the cost of disaster assistance was growing exponentially while at \nthe same time the temptation to declare anything and everything a \ndisaster in order to get out from under the budget caps was also \nincreasing. Thus, after seeing the sixth large supplemental moving \nthrough the Senate, our colleagues decided the time had come to take a \nlonger look at our disaster programs. This report is the result of that \ndecision, and tomorrow I plan to hold a hearing with the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency [FEMA], and a panel composed of GAO, CBO, \nand CRS, to begin exploring where we go from here.\n  Several of our report's findings are worth highlighting. First, the \nactual amount obligated by the Federal Government on disaster \nassistance, as has already been stated, from fiscal year 1977 to fiscal \nyear 1993 has been, in constant 1993 dollars, $120 billion.\n   [[Page S3926]] The distinguished occupant of the Chair, who served \nas Governor of Missouri, was on the receiving end of some of that \nassistance. I know he and our other colleagues around the country know \nhow important that assistance can be.\n  Of this figure, $55 billion are in the form of loans, with $34.5 \nbillion originating from the Farmers Home Administration and nearly $21 \nbillion from the Small Business Administration.\n  The other major expenditures have been $16 billion from the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture for crop losses, $25 billion from the Corps \nof Engineers for hazard mitigation efforts, and $10 billion for FEMA's \ndisaster recovery programs.\n  But of interest to many of my colleagues is the number of disasters \nsince 1988. That year there were 17 disasters with a total cost of $2.2 \nbillion.\n  In fiscal year 1989 there were 29 disasters; fiscal year 1990, 35; \nfiscal year 1991, 39; fiscal year 1992, 48; and by fiscal year 1993, \nthere were 58 disasters at a cost of $6.6 billion. And then last year, \nnot included in this report's totals, an $8.4 billion supplemental \nappropriations was agreed to. As I speak, we have pending before the \nVeterans Administration, HUD, and Independent Agencies Subcommittee of \nthe Appropriations Committee a fiscal year 1995 supplemental request \nfor an additional $6.7 billion FEMA request. As has been said in many \nother instances, that begins to mount up to real money.\n  Mr. President, I believe this report will serve as a very useful tool \nin two basic ways. First, it reminds our colleagues of the costs which \nhave been occurring as a result of natural disasters and our responses \nto them; second, that we need to get everyone to take a second look at \nhow we have been evaluating the successes or failures of our disaster \nresponses.\n  For the past few years, we have been concentrating on improving the \nspeed of response and the timeliness of the payments--how fast we can \nshovel the money out the door. For the most part, there have been \ndramatic improvements. We can really shovel it out the door quickly. \nHowever, it is about time that we look to see how the money is being \nspent. Senator Glenn has already referred to that. It is not just the \nfact that we shovel it out in a timely fashion. Where does it go and \nwhat does it do? I think that his comments are right on target. And \nthis will be the subject of the hearing we will be holding tomorrow to \nbegin to explore how this money is actually spent. Where does it go \nwhen it is shoveled out the door?\n  I invite my colleague, or others who are interested, to sit in or to \nhave a staff member sit in as we begin to explore where the money goes, \nwhat it does, and if it is the kind of expenditure that we really need \nto make.\n  In the past 5 years, Congress, through FEMA alone, has provided $12 \nbillion in emergency relief. We now are faced with another request by \nFEMA of $6.7 billion for this year. It should be obvious to everyone, \nas I think it is obvious to me, that in the budget climate we face, we \nmust address these escalating costs to ensure that the billions we are \nspending is spent wisely.\n  I hope that this report will jump start the effort. I ask our \ncolleagues to review at least the executive summary of the report so \nthat they will have an idea of how we are spending billions and \nbillions of dollars--$120 billion since fiscal year 1977. That is a \nsignificant amount of money, and one which we should take care to \nassure we are spending properly.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my remarks. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I want to say once again what a great job \nSenator Bond did on this report. I think that is exactly what the \nSenate had in mind when they asked us to do this. I congratulate him. \nWe worked on it very closely together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/15/senate-section/article/S3922-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3926-S3928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND RESCISSIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask that the Senate return to regular \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am grateful for the attention that our \ncolleagues gave to our presentation earlier this morning on the issues \nat stake concerning the amendment before the Senate. Now, we will have \nsome additional time during the course of the day to discuss these \nissues before we have another Senate vote on this matter tomorrow.\n  During the course of the morning, there was an effort by my \nRepublican colleagues to characterize the amendment by the Senator from \nKansas that is before the Senate as being a rather limited measure that \nsimply addresses a serious question about the authority, the power of \nthe President to issue the Executive order.\n  I mentioned briefly before the vote that I thought what was really at \nstake in this debate before the Senate was really a broader issue than \njust the issue of whether the President has the authority to issue the \nExecutive order which the amendment of the Senator from Kansas seeks to \nrepeal. As I have stated, it is the President's judgment that \nimplementation of this Executive order is in the Nation's interest and \nalso in the interest of the American taxpayer, based upon the fact that \nthe use of permanent replacements results in many instances in a \ndiminution in the quality of work performed and the ability to perform \non time. The President, based on legislative authority provided by the \nCongress, was acting within his power in issuing that Executive order.\n  But the point I was trying to make earlier was that the broader issue \nat stake is really the standard of living for working families, and \nwhat the impact of Senator Kassebaum's amendment would be on a \nsignificant segment of working families in this country.\n  I was pointing out that if you look at the period from 1979 to 1993, \nwhat you find, as shown on this chart--which is based upon data from \nthe Department of Commerce--what you find is that it is the top tier of \nfamilies that have done exceedingly well during this period of time. \nThey are the ones whose incomes have been rising steadily and at \nsignificant levels.\n  I think all of us welcome the fact that those families are doing well \nand that there is increased opportunity for the very top-income \nfamilies in this country, and that those that are just below the very \ntop have also seen a significant increase in their income. But this \nchart also reflects the disturbing fact that the majority--60 percent--\nof American families outside of this top 40 percent, have actually \nfallen behind in terms of real family income over this same period of \ntime.\n  It is important to underscore that we are talking about family \nincome, because what we saw during the period of the 1980's is not just \na single member of the family working, supporting the family, but wives \ncoming into the work force in record numbers and contributing their \nearnings to the family income. Even with the increased number of family \nmembers in the work force, we still have 60 percent of the families \nfalling further and further behind those in the very top income \nbrackets. That is the reality. That is what is happening out there.\n  It is relevant to note that at the same time that this decline in the \nincomes of the majority of families has been happening, there has been \na dramatic and significant increase in the use of permanent striker \nreplacements. Employers have used permanent replacements to displace \nwell-paid workers and replace them with workers hired at significantly \nreduced wages.\n And even the original wages of those workers who have been permanently \nreplaced were in many cases of a very modest nature. As I pointed out \nearlier today, in many instances, workers who have been permanently \nreplaced were earning not much more than the minimum wage to start \nwith--earning $6 and $7 or $8 an hour. Those are the workers whom we \nare talking about out here on the floor of the U.S. Senate--the workers \nwho some of our Republican colleagues suggest are some kind of special \ninterest group.\n\n[[Page S3927]]\n\n  The people the President's Executive order seeks to protect from \nexploitation are people that are ready to work, that do work and have \nworked all of their lives. They are prepared to continue to work for $7 \nor $8 an hour, and they are being displaced by permanent striker \nreplacements who are being paid lower wages. The result is that there \nhas been a significant diminution in income for a great number of \nworkers.\n  Mr. President, if you were to go back and look at what has happened \nto the incomes of working families since 1950, you would find that \nduring the period from 1950 through the end of the 1970's, you would \nfind that the incomes of families in all of these income groups moved \nup together, and that families at the top in the middle and at the \nbottom all enjoyed about the same level of income growth. The whole \ncountry was increasing its standard of living. All families were moving \nup together, all participating in the benefits of economic expansion. \nBut that is not what has happened since 1980. That is not what is \ntaking place in the America of today. That is something that we should \nbe very conscious of, as we are considering the President's Executive \nOrder, which is responsive, in small part, to this phenomenon.\n  This second chart shows what has happened to those workers who are \ntrying to provide for themselves and their families and are getting \npaid the minimum wage.\n  The principle behind the minimum wage, which was first enacted into \nlaw in the 1930's, was that work ought to be rewarded, that men and \nwomen in our country who are willing to work ought to be able to earn \nenough to provide for their children, ought to be able to put a roof \nover the heads of their families and put food on the table and maintain \nsome degree of self-respect and dignity. That is a fundamental \nprinciple that has been supported by Republicans and Democrats alike, \nMr. President.\n  Here on this chart reflecting the real value of the minimum wage, \nwhere we see a bump here in the purchasing power of the minimum wage, \nthis was a result of legislation being signed into law by a Republican \nPresident, George Bush, providing for an increase in the minimum wage \nof 45 cents an hour per year for 2 years, in 1990 and 1991. And now we \ncan see on the chart that since that time, inflation has eaten away at \nthe real value of the minimum wage, and it is virtually back to where \nit was prior to the time President Bush signed that last increase into \nlaw.\n  What many of us have been arguing is that if we had then a Democratic \nCongress, a Democratic Senate, and a Republican President and we could \nwork together in order to enact an increase in the minimum wage, then \nnow when we have a Republican House and Senate and a Democratic \nPresident, we ought to be able to again work together to enact another \nincrease.\n  This chart, Mr. President, shows the real value of the minimum wage \nin terms of constant dollars. This reflects that the minimum wage is \ncurrently at $4.25 an hour, in 1995 dollars. That is where it is today. \nAnd this shows where the minimum was in terms of real dollars at other \nperiods of time going back to 1965, then 1975, when the minimum wage \nwas worth $5.82 in today's dollars. What we are really seeing is a \ndramatic decline in the value of the minimum wage in terms of its \npurchasing power for families. A full-time worker today working year-\nround at the minimum wage would make only $8,500 a year.\n  Both of these two charts are important in showing what is really \nhappening out there in the work force in the United States of America; \nand that is, that far too many individuals who are working hard trying \nto provide for their families are falling further and further and \nfurther and further behind.\n  That is why I find it so disturbing that first issue directly \naffecting working families that we have considered on the Senate floor \nin this Congress--now that we have finished consideration of the \nunfunded mandate issue and the balanced budget amendment--should be a \nmeasure whose effect would be to ensure further diminution of workers' \nbargaining power in their dealings with employers.\n  We heard earlier--and I respect my friend and colleague, Senator \nKassebaum--that in her view, her amendment is not really about the \nbroader issues of working people. But I must say that it is difficult \nfor me to accept that that is not what this amendment is really about. \nIf the proponents of this amendment are so concerned about the scope of \nthe executive power of the President--whether the President has the \nlegal authority to issue such an order, whether he has the power to do \nit--that they felt they had to go ahead and address it on the defense \nappropriations bill, you might hope that they would still say look, OK, \nwe have done the unfunded mandates bill and we have had a full debate \non the issue of the balanced budget amendment, and we feel we must go \nahead and address this issue of the President's executive authority on \nthe defense appropriations bill. But we want you to know that we are \nconcerned about what is happening to real workers and therefore we are \nproposing a sense of the Senate resolution to say that we are prepared \nto support an increase in the minimum wage, or we want to do something \nelse for working families; we want to do something in terms of \neducation for working families, or something for the children of \nworking families in terms of their day care coverage. If that is what \nour Republican colleagues were saying, that would be great. But that is \nnot the case.\n  Instead, we see cutbacks being recommended in day care, even though \nonly about 5 to 6 percent of day care needs are being attended to at \ncurrent spending levels. We are seeing cutbacks in the school lunch \nprogram and cutbacks in the summer jobs program. The Congress was not \neven in session 3 months before it eliminated the jobs programs for \nyoung people, not only for this summer but next summer as well. We are \nin that much of a hurry. The House of Representatives is voting to \neliminate that summer jobs program, and they are also in the process \nnow in the Labor/HHS appropriations subcommittee of cutting back the \nloan programs for working families. I do not know how it is in other \nMember's States, but in my State close to 70 percent of the young \npeople that want to improve themselves and improve their lives and \ntheir abilities by attending college need some kind of student loan \nassistance. Well, we are raising the cost of that assistance between 25 \nand 30 percent under the proposal that is being acted on over in the \nHouse.\n  The people getting hurt are the sons and daughters of families in \nthis group in here on this chart; not so much the families up here in \nthe upper income brackets because they can afford the universities, \nthey can pay the tuition on their own. It is these families in this \narea on the chart, the ones that are falling further behind that say, I \nknow I have not been able to make it, but, by God, my daughter or my \nson has worked hard, has done well in school, has been a good student, \nand wants to go on to college or to the university. And with these cuts \nwe are saying: No, your son or daughter can not go to college unless \nyou are going to pay out of your pocket another $3,500 to $4,500 over \nwhat it now costs in terms of interest on their student loan. That is \neffectively what the impact of these cuts is going to be on working \nfamilies.\n  So, Mr. President, the idea that somehow these matters are unrelated \nin terms of our priorities misses me.\n  I did not even mention, when I was talking about the increase in the \ninterest costs on student loans for working families the fact that even \nif they were going to pay that extra average $3,500 and have that \nindebtedness and they were able to get to the school or college, our \nRepublican colleagues want to eliminate the work-study program. That \naffects 70,000 young people in my own State. I do not know how it is in \nother States.\n  And who are these students? By definition you do not qualify for \nwork-study unless you are in this area shown on this chart--unless your \nfamily is in this income bracket. So we are not only going to raise the \ncost of the education, we are going to make it even more complicated \nand difficult for you to participate in a work-study program to help \nyou get some additional income as a result of working.\n  This is about working. We hear a great deal from our Republican \ncolleagues about people that are not working. This debate is about \nAmericans who are working, playing by the rules and working, and their \nfutures. \n [[Page S3928]] And that is why it is so important and why it is \nappropriate that the Senate really understand exactly where we are and \nwhat we are about.\n  We have had a long discussion about the steel mill seizure, about the \nscope of Presidential powers. We went through last week the various \nexecutive powers that exist inherently and those which do not. We went \nthrough the particular legislation which grants the President specific \npowers with respect to Federal procurement and the references that have \nbeen made to that in the excellent memoranda that was provided by \nAttorney General Reno. We have gone into considerable detail about \nexactly who was affected and impacted by the practice of permanently \nreplacing striking workers.\n  And then we had a review for the Senate of the public policy issues \nin question, about why this Executive order makes eminently good sense \nin terms of the President's responsibility to oversee procurement by \nFederal agencies.\n  We heard a great deal around here some years ago, and I think many of \nus joined in the sense of outrage when we heard about the costs of \nashtrays being $200 to $300, toilet seats at $1,500, $1,800, the abuses \nin terms of procurement policy, primarily in the Defense Department, \nbut in other agencies as well. We have heard those stories and all of \nus are appalled by them.\n  Now we have a President that is trying to do something about making \nsure that the taxpayer is going to get a dollar's value for a dollar \ninvested by making sure that the contracts are going to be delivered \nand delivered on time and that there is going to be good quality in \nterms of the purchases that are made primarily in the areas of defense \nand weapons and weapons systems and those contracts that are related to \nnational security, but in other areas as well.\n  We have taken some time, although I intend to take a little more time \nlater on this afternoon, to give examples of how productivity and \nquality have been adversely affected when permanent striker \nreplacements were hired-- what happens when because of the replacement \nworkers' lack of skills and experience, of the conflict that exists in \nthe plant and factory, the quality and efficiency of work is impaired.\n  The President has taken notice of that and we will share those \nexperiences with the Senate. He understands it and says: ``Look, on \nthis issue, I'm going to side with the taxpayers to make sure that we \nare going to get a good product on time with good quality from skilled \ncraftsmen and women in this country. I am not going to take a chance in \nthe areas of national security to get an inferior product, either for \nour defense or in the other areas of procurement. And, also, I am going \nto make it very clear that we are not going to give companies like \nDiamond Walnut Company, for example, that have hired permanent \nreplacements, additional financial incentives for sales overseas that \nresult in millions of dollars of profit for them at taxpayers' expense. \nWe are not going to reward companies that treat their workers this \nharshly.''\n  So, Mr. President, these are some of the points that we will have a \nchance to develop further during the course of the discussion and \ndebate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/15/senate-section/article/S3926-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, before I comment on the Kassebaum amendment \nthat is before us, let me comment on a hearing I just came from that \nSenator Kassebaum and Senator Jeffords have chaired, on the whole \nquestion of health care and where we are going.\n  The last few witnesses commented on the whole question of ERISA's \nassumption of responsibilities that prohibits States from moving ahead \nto have health care coverage for all their people.\n  Frankly, we cannot have it both ways. The American people are, more \nand more, demanding some kind of health care protection. I had three \ntown meetings a week ago Saturday in Illinois. One man got up at one \ntown meeting and said, ``I am 59 years old, I have had a heart attack, \nI cannot get health insurance that I can afford. What is going to \nhappen to me?'' When he said it, it started triggering others getting \nup, standing up, telling their stories.\n  Every other Western industrialized nation protects all their people. \nWe are the only one that does not. If that is a conscious decision we \nwant to make, not to protect all of our citizens--and incidentally the \nnumber now is about 41 million that are unprotected and the projections \nthat were made in the hearing yesterday are that will go to 50 million \n5 years from now. We have gone from 67 percent of employers covering \ntheir people in 1980, down close to 50 percent now. The problem is \ngetting worse.\n  But if the Federal Government is unwilling to act, we, at least, have \nto be willing to let North Carolina and Illinois and other States that \nwant to protect all their citizens act. We can set it up in such a way \nthat companies that are engaged in interstate commerce that protect \ntheir employees will be exempt by the State so we do not present a \nproblem for business.\n  But we cannot have it both ways. There are just too many people who \nare hurting. Mr. President, 50 million people in 5 years means one out \nof five Americans--really more than that, because those over 65 are \nalready covered through Medicare. But more than one out of five \nAmericans are without health care coverage. That is just not the kind \nof choice we can make. The people in the gallery up there, one out of \nfive are not covered. No one wants to volunteer for that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/15/senate-section/article/S3928-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3928-S3929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND RESCISSIONS ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 331\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, let me talk about the other issue that is \nbefore us and that is striker replacement. In every Western \nindustrialized nation with four exceptions permanent striker \nreplacement is illegal. The exceptions are Great Britain, Hong Kong, \nSingapore, and the United States.\n  We have by tradition not done that. The Presiding Officer used to be \nin business in North Carolina. I used to be in business in Illinois. \nAnd we operate within certain traditions in addition to the law, and \nthose traditions we have generally followed. We are starting to move \naway from those traditions and I think that is not a healthy thing. One \nof the reasons that is happening is because such a small percentage of \nour work force is organized. When you exclude Government employees, \nonly 11.8 percent of working men and women in the United States belong \nto unions. That is far lower than Canada, which is around 35 percent; \nWestern Europe 40 to 90 percent; Japan somewhat similar.\n  George Shultz, who was both Secretary of State and Secretary of Labor \nunder Republican administrations, made a speech not too long ago in \nwhich he said we have an unhealthy amount of our working force that \nbelongs to unions, because we are not getting some of the factors there \nthat we ought to have.\n  One of the things that is happening as a result of that is our wages \nare not going up. When wages do not go up then corporations and \nemployers do not buy labor-saving devices, so we become less productive \nper man-hour. Today the United States, in manufacturing pay per hour, \nwe are $14.77. France is $15.23; Canada is $16.02; Italy, $16.41; \nAustria, $17.01; Netherlands, $17.85; Denmark, $18.60; Belgium, $18.94; \nFinland, $20.76; Switzerland, $20.83; Sweden, $20.93; Germany, $21.53; \nNorway, $21.86.\n  I can remember, back in 1986 we were still at the top of the heap. \nThat is not that long ago. And the Presiding Officer will forgive me \nfor saying he is old enough to remember, along with me, when there was \na huge gap between the United States and the other countries. I can \nremember serving in Germany in the Army from 1951 to 1953 when the \naverage German was just really struggling. I do not know what their \npercentage of U.S. wages at that point \n [[Page S3929]] was. But it must have been one-fifth or one-seventh of \nthe wages of the United States.\n  I mention all of this simply to suggest that what we need in this \narea of labor-management relations is balance. I do not think the \nPresident's action takes away any of our prerogatives. The President's \naction does not pass what we turned down here, Senate Resolution 55, \nstriker replacement. That called for a major overhaul of our labor-\nmanagement relations. The President's action simply says, if you are \ngoing to have a Federal contract, you cannot have permanent striker \nreplacements. I think that makes sense in labor-management relations. I \nthink it also makes sense in terms of quality of product. If anyone \nthinks that permanent striker replacements provide the same quality of \nwork as a former employee, take a look at baseball today. Striker \nreplacements are not the same quality as those who played for the major \nleagues.\n  So I think it makes sense from the viewpoint of quality product that \nwe buy. I think it makes sense from the viewpoint of labor-management \nrelations.\n  I hope that--we have had one cloture vote and we are going to have at \nleast one more--we continue to prevent the passage of the Kassebaum \namendment. Again, my belief is that what we need is a careful balance \nbetween labor and management. I think things have moved somewhat out of \nbalance.\n  I would add I also am a great believer in labor and management \nworking together much more. The Germans have what they called \nmitbestimmung, where there is a labor representative on a corporate \nboard who is there except when they talk about labor-management \nrelations. Then he or she absents himself or herself. The advantage of \nthat is they get to know the problems of the corporation and the \ncorporation gets to understand the viewpoint of labor. I think we \nshould not wait until we are near time for contracts to expire and then \nall of a sudden we sit down and start working together.\n  So my hope is that we will continue to block the passage of this \namendment and that we can move ahead in a constructive direction, not \nonly on this issue but on many other issues in labor-management \nrelations.\n  Mr. President, I do not see anyone else seeking the floor right now. \nIf so I question the presence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, to his credit, President Clinton has \ninitiated a long-overdue review of all Federal affirmative action laws.\n  After nearly 30 years of government-sanctioned quotas, timetables, \nset-asides, and other racial preferences, the American people sense all \ntoo clearly that the race-counting game has gone too far. The President \nis responding to these pressures, and his review could not have come at \na more propitious time.\n  But first things first. As the President conducts his review, he \nshould also revisit some of the misguided affirmative action policies \nof his own administration.\n  For starters, he should take a few moments to read the Justice \nDepartment's brief in the Piscataway Board of Education case, which is \nnow pending before the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  In Piscataway, the Justice Department has taken the position that, \nwhen an employer is laying off employees, an individual American can \nlegally be fired from her job because of her race. That is right: Our \nNation's top law enforcement agency says that it is perfectly legal, as \na way to achieve work force diversity, to tell a person that she can no \nlonger keep her job because she happens to have the wrong skin color.\n  This is an insidious position--one that goes beyond current law and \none that the President should emphatically reject.\n  I note that he had a little meeting as reported in the Washington \nPost last night with a number of people. I hope they discussed the \nPiscataway case, and I hope the President might respond to this \nPiscataway case.\n  The bottom line is that the President's affirmative action review \ncannot have credibility if the affirmative action policies of his own \nadministration are fundamentally flawed. Correcting these policies, not \nreviewing old ones, should be the President's first priority.\n  With that said, let's remember that to raise questions about \naffirmative action is not to challenge our antidiscrimination laws. \nDiscrimination is illegal. Those who discriminate ought to be punished. \nAnd those who are individual victims of illegal discrimination have \nevery right to receive the remedial relief they deserve.\n  Unfortunately, America is not the color-blind society we would all \nlike it to be. Discrimination continues to be an undeniable part of \nAmerican life.\n  But fighting discrimination should never become an excuse for \nabandoning the color-blind ideal. Expanding opportunity should never be \nused to justify dividing Americans by race, by gender, by ethnic \nbackground.\n  Race-preferential policies, no matter how well-intentioned, demean \nindividual accomplishment. They ignore individual character. And they \nare absolutely poisonous to race relations in our great country.\n  You cannot cure the evil of discrimination with more discrimination.\n  Mr. President, last December, I asked the Congressional Research \nService to provide me with a list of every Federal law and regulation \nthat grants a preference to individuals on the basis of race, sex, \nnational origin, or ethnic\n background. Frankly, I was surprised to learn that such a list had \nnever been compiled before, which, I suppose, speaks volumes about how \ndelicate this issue can be.\n\n  Earlier this year, the CRS responded to my request with a list of \nmore than 160 preference laws, ranging from Federal procurement \nregulations, to the RTC's bank-ownership policies, to the Department of \nTransportation's contracting rules. Even NASA has gotten into the act, \nearmarking 8 percent of the total value of its contracts each year to \nminority-owned and female-owned firms on the theory that these firms \nare presumptively disadvantaged. They may not be disadvantaged at all.\n  As a follow-up to the CRS report, I have written to my colleagues, \nSenators Bond and Kassebaum, requesting hearings on the most prominent \nprograms identified in the report--the Small Business Administration's \nsection 8(A) program and Executive order 11246, which has been \ninterpreted to require Federal contractors to adopt timetables and \ngoals in minority- and female-hiring.\n  These hearings, I expect, will demonstrate that there are other, more \nequitable ways to expand opportunity, without resorting to policies \nthat grant preferences to\n individuals simply because they happen to be members of certain \ngroups. And unless the hearings produce some powerful evidence to the \ncontrary, it is my judgment that the section 8(a) program should be \nrepealed outright.\n\n  The hearings also provide us with the opportunity to rediscover the \noriginal purpose of Executive Order 11246. As signed by President \nJohnson, the Executive order required Government contractors to agree,\n\n       * * * not to discriminate against any employee or applicant \n     for employment because of race, creed, color, or national \n     origin * * * [and] to take affirmative action to ensure that \n     applicants are employed * * * without regard to their race, \n     creed, color, or national origin.\n\n  In other words, Executive Order 11246 defined affirmative action to \nmean ``non-discrimination.''\n  I believe in nondiscrimination. Everybody in this body should believe \nin nondiscrimination against race, color--and you can add disability to \nthat list, too.\n  There was no mention of timetables or goals. No mention of racial \npreferences. These concepts were later grafted onto the Executive order \nnot by Congress, but by regulation, the work of Federal bureaucrats.\n  [[Page S3930]] At a minimum, we should restore the original purpose \nof Executive Order 11246: to ensure that Federal contractors do not \ndiscriminate. And if they do, they should be punished. However, if the \nExecutive order continues to be used, and misused, as a hammer to force \ncontractors to adopt race-based hiring practices, then it, too, should \nbe repealed.\n  In fact, I intend to introduce legislation later this year that will \nforce the Federal Government to live up to the color-blind ideal by \nprohibiting it from granting preferential treatment to any person, \nsimply because of his or her membership in a certain favored group.\n  I might add, when I got this CRS study, we made it available to the \nWhite House. There has been a story about it. They asked for it and we \nwere happy to give it to the White House. It saved duplication. We \nwould be happy to work with the White House and anybody else. And we \nwill be working with Representative J.C. Watts of Oklahoma on overall \nlegislation, maybe at some later date.\n  Of course, the Government should fight discrimination where it \nexists, but, at the same time, it should be color-blind, race-neutral, \nboth in theory and in practice.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful about America. And I am optimistic, as we \nhead into the 21st century, that the American experiment will continue \nto be a model of self-government and a source of hope for millions the \nworld over.\n  But leadership also requires a sense of common purpose. We cannot \ncontinue to lead the world, if we are divided here at home.\n  Yes, we should celebrate our own differences. Yes, we should take \npride in our own rich ethnic heritage. It is a source of great strength \nin America.\n  But, at the same time, we should not devalue the common bonds that \ndefine us as Americans. Too often, we speak in terms of a hyphenated \nidentity: it is Italian-Americans, German-Americans, African-Americans, \nIrish-Americans, and not just ``Americans.'' We are all just Americans.\n  Historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., probably put it best when he \nwarned, and I quote:\n\n       Instead of a nation composed of individuals making their \n     own unhampered choices,\n      America increasingly sees itself as composed of groups more \n     or less ineradicable in their ethnic character. The \n     multiethnic dogma abandons historic purposes, replacing \n     assimilation by fragmentation, integration by separatism. \n     It belittles unum and glorifies pluribus.\n\n  So, Mr. President, the coming debate over affirmative action will be \nmuch more than just a debate over reverse discrimination. It will be a \ndebate that focuses us to answer a fundamental question: What kind of \ncountry do we want America to be?\n  Do we work toward a color-blind society? I hope so. A society that \njudges people by their talents, their sense of honor, their hopes and \ndreams, as individuals? Or do we continue down the path of group \nrights, group entitlements--special rights for some--judging people not \nby their character or intellect, but by something irrelevant: the color \nof their skin? Maybe it will extend to disabilities or something else.\n  America has always been a melting pot. But it should never become a \nplace where race and ethnicity exclusively define who we are, how we \nthink, and what we are supposed to believe.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letters to Senators \nBond and Kassebaum be printed in the Record, along with the report \nprepared by the Congressional Research Service.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                Office of the Majority Leader,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 2, 1995.\n     Hon. Nancy Landon Kassebaum,\n     Chairman, Committee on Labor and Human Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Nancy: As part of our review of federal affirmative \n     action policies, I am writing to request that you, as \n     Chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, convene \n     hearings on Executive Order 11246. In a recent report \n     prepared at my request, the Congressional Research Service \n     has identified Executive Order 11246 among those federal \n     programs that grant preferences to individuals on the basis \n     of race, sex, national origin, or ethnic background.\n       Executive Order 11246 was initiated by President Johnson in \n     1965. The Executive Order states, in part, that ``[i]t is the \n     policy of the Government of the United States to provide \n     equal opportunity in Federal employment for all qualified \n     persons, to prohibit discrimination in employment because of \n     race, creed, color, or national origin, and to promote the \n     full realization of equal employment opportunity through a \n     positive, continuing program in each executive department and \n     agency.''\n       As administered by the Department of Labor's Office of \n     Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Executive Order 11246 \n     requires most federal contractors to file written \n     `'affirmative action'' plans with the federal government. \n     These plans must include minority- and female-hiring \n     ``goals'' and ``timetables.''\n       In my view, hearings should seek to answer the following \n     questions: What was the original purpose of Executive Order \n     11246? Has this purpose been fulfilled over the years through \n     the Executive Order's implementation? Has Executive Order \n     11246 operated to discriminate on the basis of race, \n     ethnicity, or gender? Are there other, more equitable, ways \n     to expand opportunity for all Americans, without resorting to \n     strategies that rely on providing preferences for individuals \n     simply because they belong to certain groups?\n       The bottom line is that no federal program should be immune \n     from Congressional scrutiny.\n       Nancy, thank you for your prompt attention to this \n     important matter. I look forward to hearing from you at your \n     earliest convenience.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bob Dole.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                Office of the Majority Leader,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 2, 1995.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Kit: As part of our review of federal affirmative \n     action policies, I am writing to request that you, as \n     Chairman of the Small Business Committee, convene hearings on \n     the programs authorized by Sections 8(a) and 8(d) of the \n     Small Business Act. In a recent report prepared at my \n     request, the Congressional Research Service has identified \n     these programs as programs that grant preferences to \n     individuals on the basis of race, sex, national origin, or \n     ethnic background.\n       As you may know, applicants for certification under Section \n     8(a) must demonstrate that they are either ``socially \n     disadvantaged'' or that they ``have been subjected to racial \n     or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their \n     identities as members of groups without regard to their \n     individual qualities.'' The Small Business Administration \n     ``presumes,'' absent contrary evidence, that small business \n     owned and operated by members of certain racial and ethnic \n     groups are ``socially disadvantaged.''\n       Section 8(d) requires prime contractors on major federal \n     contracts to negotiate a ``subcontracting plan'' that \n     includes ``percentage goals'' for the utilization of small \n     socially-and economically-disadvantaged firms. To implement \n     this policy, each prime contract must contain a clause \n     stating that ``[t]he contractor shall presume that socially \n     and economically disadvantaged individuals include Black \n     Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian \n     Pacific Americans, and other minorities, or any other \n     individual found to be disadvantaged by the [Small Business] \n     Administration pursuant to section 8(a) . . . (emphasis \n     added).''\n       In my view, hearings should seek to answer the following \n     questions: What were the original purposes of the Section \n     8(a) and Section 8(d) programs? Have these purposes been \n     fulfilled? Should the federal government be in the business \n     of ``presuming'' that members of certain racial and ethnic \n     groups are ``socially disadvantaged?'' Have these programs \n     operated to discriminate on the basis of race or ethnic \n     background? Are there other, more equitable, ways to expand \n     opportunity for all Americans, without resorting to \n     strategies that rely on providing preferences for individuals \n     simply because they belong to certain groups?\n       The bottom line is that no federal program should be immune \n     from Congressional scrutiny.\n       Kit, thank you for your prompt attention to this important \n     matter. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest \n     convenience.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bob Dole.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 17, 1995.\n     To: Honorable Robert Dole.\n     From: American Law Division.\n     Subject: Compilation and overview of Federal laws and \n       regulations establishing affirmative action goals or other \n       preference based on race, gender, or ethnicity.\n       This is in response to your request, by letter dated \n     December 22, 1994, for ``a comprehensive list of every \n     federal statute, regulation, program, and executive order \n     that grants a preference to individuals on the basis of race, \n     sex, national origin, or ethnic background. Preferences \n     include, but are not limited to, timetables, goals, set-\n     asides, and quotas.''\n       To compile the list of federal legal authorities contained \n     in this memorandum, several \n      [[Page S3931]] searches on LEXIS/NEXIS and WESTLAW legal \n     databases were undertaken utilizing a variety of search \n     strategies which incorporated legal terminology most \n     frequently associated with federal affirmative action and \n     minority set-aside programs. This yielded citations to \n     several hundred statutory and regulatory programs which we \n     then examined individually to determine whether they appeared \n     to be of the nature described in your inquiry. The \n     compilation of laws included in this memorandum reflects our \n     efforts to be as ``comprehensive'' as possible, in accordance \n     with your instructions. Consequently, we have included any \n     statute, regulation, or executive order uncovered by our \n     research which appears, in any manner, to prefer or consider \n     race, gender, or ethnicity as factors in federal employment \n     or the allocation of federal contracts or grants to \n     individuals or institutions.\\1\\ Several laws and\n      regulations directed to ``socially and economically \n     disadvantaged'' individuals and institutions are included \n     because, as explained infra, that term has been defined \n     administratively and by statute to presumptively apply to \n     specific racial and ethnic minorities. As a background for \n     understanding operation of the numerous listed federal \n     laws and regulations, more extensive discussion is devoted \n     at various points to the development of major \n     ``affirmative action'' programs in federal grant, \n     contract, and employment law.\n     Footnotes at end of memorandum.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                   federal grant and procurement law\n\n       Federal efforts to increase minority and female \n     participation in contracting, federally assisted programs, \n     and employment have been a major aspect of civil rights \n     enforcement for more than three decades. Congress and the \n     Executive Branch have crafted a wide range of federal laws \n     and regulations authorizing, either directly or by judicial \n     or administrative interpretation, race or gender \n     ``conscious'' strategies in relation to jobs, housing, \n     education, voting rights, and governmental contracting. The \n     historical model for federal laws and regulations \n     establishing minority participation ``goals'' may be found in \n     Executive Orders which since the early 1960's have imposed \n     affirmative minority hiring and employment requirements on \n     federally financed construction projects and in connection \n     with other large federal contracts. Presently, Executive \n     Order 11246 as administered by the Office of Federal Contract \n     Compliance Programs (OFCCP) requires that all employers with \n     federal contracts in excess of $50,000.00 must file written \n     affirmative action plans with the government. These are to \n     include minority and female hiring goals and timetables to \n     which the contractor must commit it's ``good faith'' efforts. \n     Similar affirmative action measures relating to federal \n     government employment were enacted as part of the Equal \n     Employment Opportunity Act Amendment of 1972\\2\\ and the 1978 \n     Civil Service Reform Act.\\3\\\n       Affirmative action for minority entrepreneurs soon became a \n     focus of efforts by the Small Business Administration (SBA) \n     and other federal agencies to assist ``socially and \n     economically disadvantaged'' small businesses under a variety \n     of federal programs. Increasingly, an ``affirmative action'' \n     model, in the form of participation ``goals'' or ``set-\n     asides'' for members of racial or ethnic minorities, and \n     businesses owned or controlled by these or other \n     ``disadvantaged'' persons, found legislative expression in a \n     wide range of federal programs.\n       The Small Business Act, as amended, provides the statutory \n     prototype for a host of federal programs to increase minority \n     and female participation as contractors or subcontractors on \n     federally funded projects. First, the ``Minority Small \n     Business and Capital Ownership Development,'' or Sec. 8(a) \n     program authorizes the Small Business Administration (SBA) to \n     enter into all kinds of construction, supply, and service \n     contracts with other federal departments and agencies. The \n     SBA acts as a prime contractor and then ``subcontracts'' the \n     performance of these contracts to small business concerns \n     owned and controlled by ``socially and economically \n     disadvantaged'' individuals, Indian Tribes or Hawaiian Native \n     Organizations.\\4\\\n       Applicants for Sec. 8(a) certification must demonstrate \n     ``socially disadvantaged'' status or that they ``have been \n     subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias \n     because of their identities as members of groups without \n     regard to their individual qualities.''\\5\\ The Small Business \n     Administration ``presumes,'' absent contrary evidence, that \n     small businesses owned and operated by members of certain \n     groups--including Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, and \n     Asian Pacific Americans--are socially disadvantaged.\\6\\ Any \n     individual not a member of one of these groups must \n     ``establish his/her individual social disadvantage on the \n     basis of clear and convincing evidence'' in order to qualify \n     for Sec. 8(a) certification. The Sec. 8(a) applicant must, in \n     addition, show that ``economic disadvantage'' has diminished \n     its capital and credit opportunities, thereby limiting its \n     ability to compete with other firms in the open market.\\7\\\n       The ``Minority Small Business Subcontracting Program'' \n     authorized by Sec. 8(d) of the Small Business Act codified \n     the presumption of disadvantaged status for minority group \n     members that applied by SBA regulation under the Sec. 8(a) \n     program.\\8\\ Prime contractors on major federal contracts are \n     obliged by Sec. 8(d) to maximize minority participation and \n     to negotiate a ``subcontracting plan'' with the procuring \n     agency which includes ``percentage goals'' for utilization of \n     small socially and economically disadvantaged firms. To \n     implement this policy, a clause required for inclusion in \n     each such prime contract states that ``[t]he contractors \n     shall presume that socially and economically disadvantaged \n     individuals include Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, \n     Native Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, and other \n     minorities, or any other individual found to be disadvantaged \n     by the Administration pursuant to Sec. 8(a) . . .'' \n     Accordingly, SBA has discretion in designating a firm or \n     individual as socially and\n      economically disadvantaged for purposes of both the \n     Sec. 8(a) and Sec. 8(d) programs in conformity with \n     specified criteria.\\9\\\n       These obligations, first codified in 1978 as an amendment \n     to the SBA, were augmented a decade later by the Business \n     Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988.\\10\\ Congress \n     there directed the President to set annual, government-wide \n     procurement goals of at least 20% for small businesses and 5% \n     for disadvantaged businesses, as defined by the SBA. \n     Simultaneously, federal agencies were required to continue to \n     adopt their own goals, compatible with the government-wide \n     goals, in an effort to create ``maximum practicable \n     opportunity'' for small disadvantaged businesses to sell \n     their goods and services to the government. The goals may be \n     waived where not practicable due to unavailability of \n     disadvantaged business enterprises (DBEs) in the relevant \n     area and other factors.\\11\\ While the statutory definition of \n     DBE includes a racial component, in terms of presumptive \n     eligibility, it is not restricted to racial minorities but \n     also includes persons subjected to ``ethnic prejudice or \n     cultural bias.''\\12\\ It also excludes businesses owned or \n     controlled by persons who, regardless of race, are ``not \n     truly socially and/or economically disadvantaged.''\\13\\ \n     Federal Acquisition Act amendments adopted in 1994 amended \n     the 5% minority procurement goal, and the minority \n     subcontracting requirements in Sec. 8(d), to specifically \n     include ``small business concerns owned and controlled by \n     women'' in addition to ``socially and economically \n     disadvantaged individuals.''\\14\\\n       In addition, Congress has frequently adopted ``set-asides'' \n     or other forms of statutory preference for ``socially and \n     economically disadvantaged'' firms and individuals, following \n     the definitions of the Small Business Act, or by designating \n     minority groups and women as part of specific grant or \n     contract authorization programs. Thus, targeted funding, in \n     various forms, and minority or disadvantaged business set-\n     asides or preferences have been included in major \n     authorization or appropriation measures for agriculture, \n     communications, defense, education, public works, \n     transportation, foreign relations, energy and water \n     development, banking, scientific research and space \n     exploration, and other purposes. Other federal laws appear to \n     authorize some consideration of race or gender to enhance the \n     participation of minorities and women in federal programs or \n     employment but without directly mandating preferential goals \n     or set-asides.\n       The following statutes, regulations, and executive orders \n     governing federal contracts and grant programs are, to the \n     extent possible, grouped according to agency and subject \n     matter.\n\n               Federal Acquisitions Regulations--General\n\n       48 C.F.R.

The Office of Federal Contract \n     Compliance Programs, an arm of the U.S. Department of Labor, \n     currently enforces the E.O. 11246, as amended, by means of a \n     regulatory program requiring larger federal contractors, \n     those with procurement of construction contracts in excess of \n     $50,000, to make a ``good faith effort'' to attain ``goals \n     and timetables'' to remedy underutilization of minorities and \n     women. Another early Executive Order, No. 11478, was a \n     precursor to the 1964 Civil Rights Act and mandates \n     affirmative action hiring and employment policies by all \n     federal executive department and agencies.\n       Public and private employers with 15 or more employees are \n     also subject to a comprehensive code of equal employment \n     opportunity regulation under Title VII of the 1964 Civil \n     Rights Act.\\20\\ Except as may be imposed by court order to \n     remedy ``egregious'' violations of the law, or by consent \n     decree to settle pending claims, however, there is no general \n     statutory obligation on employers to adopt affirmative action \n     measures. But the EEOC has issued guidelines to protect \n     employers and unions from charges of ``reverse \n     discrimination'' when\n      they voluntarily take to correct the effects of past \n     discrimination.\\21\\ Federal departments and agencies, by \n     contrast, are required to periodically formulate \n     affirmative action plans for their employees and a \n     ``minority recruitment program'' to eliminate minority \n     ``underrepresentation'' in specific federal job \n     categories.\n       Section 717 of 1972 Amendments to Title VII of the 1964 \n     Civil Rights Act empowers the Equal Employment Opportunity \n     Commission to enforce nondiscrimination policy in federal \n     employment by ``necessary and appropriate'' rules, \n     regulations, and orders and through ``appropriate remedies, \n     including reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or \n     without backpay.''\\22\\ Each federal department and agency, in \n     turn, is required to prepare annually a ``national and \n     regional equal employment opportunity plan'' for submission \n     to the EEOC as part of ``an affirmative program of equal \n     employment opportunity for all . . . employees and applicants \n     for employment.''\\23\\\n       Section 717 was reinforced in 1978 when Congress enacted \n     major federal civil service reforms including a mandate for \n     immediate development of a ``minority recruitment program'' \n     designed to eliminate ``underrepresentation'' of \n     minority groups in specific federal job categories.\\24\\ The \n     EEOC and Office of Personnel Management have issued rules to \n     guide implementation and monitoring of minority recruitment \n     programs by individual federal agencies. Among various other \n     specified requirements, each agency plan ``must include \n     annual specific determinations of underrepresentation for \n     each group and must be accompanied by quantifiable indices by \n     which progress toward eliminating underrepresentation can be \n     measured.''\\25\\\n       In addition, the following statutes and regulations relate \n     to employment policies of the federal government or under \n     federal grant and assistance programs:\n       5 U.S.C. Sec. 4313(5): Performance appraisal in the Senior \n     Executive Services to take account of individuals' ``meeting \n     affirmative action goals, achievement of equal employment \n     opportunity requirements, and compliance with merit \n     principles. . .''\\26\\\n       5 U.S.C.

All contractors and \n     subcontractors with federal contracts in excess of $10,000 \n     are prohibited by the Executive Order from discriminating and \n     required to take affirmative action in the employer of \n     minority groups and women. Federal contractors and \n     subcontractors with 50 or more employees and government \n     contracts of $50,000 or more must develop written affirmative \n     action compliance programs for each of their facilities. \n     OFCCP rules direct these larger contractors to conduct a \n     ``utilization analysis'' of all major job classifications and \n     explain any underutilization of minorities and women by job \n     category when compared with the availability of qualified \n     members of these groups in the relevant labor area.

Nor are regulations of the various \n     federal departments or agencies under Title VI included for \n     the similar reason that, although they almost uniformly \n     authorize ``affirmative action'' by recipients to ``overcome \n     the effects of prior discrimination'' or otherwise, they do \n     not explicitly define the obligation in terms of ``goals'' or \n     ``setasides,'' or other forms of preference for minorities or \n     women.

We have had a lot of requests for the CRS report, not just \nfrom Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, but from a lot of \npeople who would like to study it.\n  I hope, in the final analysis, that this would be a matter that we \ncan discuss again in a bipartisan way.\n  I believe my civil rights record is impeccable, and I believe I have \nsome credibility in this area. I am not out to destroy anybody or \ndevastate anybody. I am out to take another look at what America should \nbe. Can we have a color-blind society, which I think would meet the \nhopes and aspirations of 90 to 95 percent of all Americans? Some may \nwant special rights and preferences. There may be some cases when we \nlook over this document with 160-some different laws and regulations \nthat have been compiled, where there may be some exception. There are \nsome that should be continued. But \n [[Page S3939]] certainly we ought to review it and look at it.\n  As I said earlier, unless I am totally wrong, we ought to take \nanother look at the Executive order signed by President Johnson and see \nif it has been distorted, magnified, or whatever. The goal should be \nnondiscrimination. That was the original intent of it. We ought to look \nat the Small Business Administration 8(a) program. It has been abused, \nno doubt about it. A lot of people have made a lot of money by finding \nsomeone in a minority group to sort of front for the effort. I do not \nbelieve that is right. I do not believe that is fair. So we have asked \nfor hearings. We will be reviewing this process, hopefully, on a \nbipartisan basis, not only in the Senate but in the House. I assume \nthere will be further discussion of this as we come to the floor with a \ntax bill that has been reported out by the Senate Finance Committee, \nwhich takes a step, I believe, in the right direction toward \neliminating preferences.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Affirmative Action\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I hope we can work out some bipartisan \nefforts here on this issue, but let me add that there is a lot of talk \nattacking affirmative action that is just nonsense. I see Senator Dole \nnodding that he is in agreement.\n  Affirmative action can be a very good thing. It is like religion--it \ncan be abused. It does not mean religion is wrong. But regarding \naffirmative action, if there is a company that hires 1,000 people and \nthey all happen to be white males, I do not think we ought to have to \nprove that there is some discrimination. We ought to be able to say to \nthat company that there ought to be some diversity. You ought not to \nhave to lower your standards at all. But there ought to be some \nminorities, there ought to be some disabled people and some women in \nyour work force.\n  The case at hand--and I have to say I do not remember all of the \ndetails--but a high school which has a majority of minority students \nthere in the business section of that high school had nine teachers, \nall of whom happened to be white.\n  They had to reduce the number of teachers. The two teachers who had \nthe least amount of seniority both happened to be hired the same day. \nOne was white and one was black. That school made a decision on the \nbasis of race that they felt it was important to have minority \nrepresentation in the business section of this school.\n  I am not saying that their decision was necessarily right, but I \nthink it is an understandable decision and I think the situation has \nbeen distorted. I think there are times when there should be some \nagreement.\n  I dealt with a city in Illinois that had some civil rights violence. \nIt was 40 percent black. They did not have a single black on the police \nforce or the fire department. We worked out an agreement that the next \nperson they would hire would be someone who was African-American. I \nthink that just makes sense. We did not say, ``Lower the quality,'' or \nanything. That is affirmative action. I think it makes sense.\n  I am sure Bob Dole, Senator Faircloth, Senator Baucus, like Paul \nSimon, you try to have some diversity in your office. You do not lower \nstandards.\n  Two of the lawyers in my office are Jayne Jerkins and Carlos Angulo. \nI will put them up against any staff members in the U.S. Senate. One \nhappens to be African-American; one happens to be Hispanic-American. \nThey are just quality people.\n  But I have consciously in my office tried to have some diversity. And \nI think that is a healthy thing. That is affirmative action. It does \nnot mean you lower standards or anything else.\n  So I think before we do too much attacking of affirmative action, let \nus recognize it can be a very good thing. Can it be abused? Yes, like \nany good things can be abused. But we should seek, as part of the \nAmerican ideal, that we are going to have opportunities here for all \nAmericans. I think that has to continue.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois. I know \nof his feelings in this area.\n  I think, in fact, we want to do the same thing he has already \nsuggested through nondiscrimination and penalties for discrimination. I \nmean, if you discriminate there ought to be punishment.\n  Al Shanker of the American Federation of Teachers came out against \nthe Justice Department's position on the Piscataway case. In fact, he \nhas written a column about it. There was not any evidence of any \ndiscrimination by the school board. Next time, it could be a black \nperson, a black woman or black man, who may lose their job.\n  So that is why I say if somebody discriminates, to me that is one \nthing. If somebody has 1,000 white males, as the Senator from Illinois \nsuggested, and there were good Asian, Hispanic, and black applicants, \nthere ought to be at least some presumption or some evidence that \nsomeone may have discriminated, and we ought to go after that person if \nthere is any evidence.\n  We are talking about the same result. We may have a different way of \napproaching it.\n  But I think, in any case, when we have had laws on the books for 10, \n15, 20, 25, 30 years around here, it might be time to go back and take \na look to see what has worked, what has not worked, see if they have \nworked at all, or if they have been misused or abused, taken advantage \nof by some people who may not have been in any of those special groups. \nThat has happened, too.\n  So I hope we can discuss this in a very reasonable way, because it is \na very, very touchy subject. In the past, you know, if you had two \nequally qualified people, you used to flip a coin. One might be black, \none might Asian; or one Hispanic, one white. You would say, ``Well, \nsomebody has to go.'' You flipped a coin. And we have done a lot of \nthat. I think we can all look back at the time we flipped coins. \nSometimes we won; sometimes we lost.\n  In any event, it is a very important debate. There has been a lot of \nstatements made that I think go over the edge; probably some from each \nside that go over the edge. That is not my purpose. I hope that, as we \ndelve into this on the committee level, we will have a good discussion \nand maybe get some better results.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Swingley is the \n     first non-Alaskan winner of the race in 23 years.\n\n  Well, today, many Montanans are echoing that ``yahoo'' heard up \nnorth.\n  We are saying yahoo for Doug Swingley and the hard work, \ndetermination and endurance that helped him win.\n  We are saying yahoo for the family and friends--particularly his wife \nNelda--who backed Doug up and helped him get to where he is today.\n  And we are even saying yahoo for Doug's lead dog, Elmer, and what is \nalmost certainly the fastest team of sled dogs in the world.\n  They have all made Montana proud. And to Doug, his family and his \nfriends, we say congratulations.\n  Yet I doubt there is a yahoo to be heard anywhere in the State of \nAlaska today. And that includes my good friends and colleagues from \nAlaska, Senators Stevens and Murkowski.\n  But I would urge them to not take this loss too hard. It is never \neasy to keep up with Montana. Perhaps all those cold, dark Alaska \nwinters have just slowed the Alaska mushers down. And maybe, if Alaska \nwants to stay competitive in future Iditarods, they \n [[Page S3940]] should send their mushers to Montana to train. After \nall, it is warmer. But we usually have plenty of snow. And the sun even \nshines.\n  Despite this loss, Senators Stevens, Murkowski and the people of \nAlaska can be justly proud of the rich tradition and sporting heritage \nof the Iditarod and their home State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/15/senate-section/article/S3939-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE LADY GRIZ OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

First, Doug Swingley won the Iditarod \nDog Sled Race, and tomorrow night the Lady Griz of the University of \nMontana will be playing in the opening round of the NCAA's Women's \nFinal Four Tournament being held in San Diego.\n  I have been watching the Lady Griz's trek to March madness. At the \nbeginning of the season, we all had high hopes for them. But they have \nfar surpassed what many of us expected of them--and believe me--we \nMontanans have high expectations for our sports teams.\n  This group of tough Montana and Pacific Northwest women have shown \nthat they have the grit and the discipline to be national champions.\n  Just last weekend, I saw them win their final Big Sky season game \nagainst their cross-State archrivals, the Montana State University \nLady-Bobcats.

Mr. President, last month, Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives marked the first 50 days of their efforts to pass the \nContract With America. Notably missing from their speeches was any \nmention of progress in the fight to enact health reform.\n  Indeed, this issue was not even mentioned in the House Contract With \nAmerica, nor was health reform among the priority bills introduced by \nRepublicans in either the House or Senate leadership.\n  Meanwhile, in this first 100 days, another group of citizens in my \nhome State was learning, personally and painfully, why we need to \ncontinue the fight for health reform.\n  The 3,300 retirees of John Morrell & Co., a South Dakota meat packing \nfirm, learned this January that the firm was ending all retiree health \ncoverage.\n  Many of these retirees and their families had worked for Morrell all \nof their adult lives.\n  On January 24, Morrell retirees received a simple, yet unexpected, \nletter stating that their health insurance plan was being terminated, \neffective midnight, January 31, 1995--only a week later.\n  The benefits being terminated, the letter said, included all \nhospital, major medical, and prescription drug coverage, Medicare \nsupplemental insurance, vision care, and life insurance coverage.\n  For those retirees under 65, this action poses a particular problem. \nWhile Morrell gave them the option of paying for their own coverage for \nup to 1 year, few can afford the $500 monthly premium for a couple. And \nmany cannot purchase coverage at any price, because of preexisting \nconditions like diabetes or heart disease.\n  Medicare beneficiaries would have to buy expensive supplemental \ninsurance on their own.\n  Morrell's decision was all the more painful to the retirees because \nit was so unexpected. These retirees believed they worked for a fair \ncompany; that a fair day's work resulted in a fair day's pay. They \nfound out the hard way that the company they had helped to build had \nturned its back on them.\n  They also found out that the court system was not sympathetic to \ntheir cause: The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the \ncompany's decision. The union is now planning to appeal the decision to \nthe Supreme Court.\n  Sadly, some of the retirees will not live long enough for a possible \nreversal.\n  And, if medical expenses eat up their income and assets, some Morrell \nretirees might be forced to resort to welfare.\n  All will struggle financially and emotionally to accept the change in \nbenefits that they counted on for life.\n  A recent edition of the Sioux Falls Argus Leader recounted the \nstories of several Morrell retirees and their families.\n  One 26-year veteran of Morrell is legally blind, has diabetes and \narthritis, takes heart medication, and wears a hearing aid. His $300 \nmonthly pension from Morrell will not even cover the prescription drugs \nhe needs. He fears the financial burden of high medical costs will \nforce him and his wife to sell their home.\n  Another retiree gave up $130 from his monthly Morrell pension so his \nwife could get health insurance. He now has cancer and glaucoma, and \nhis monthly prescription costs are $800. His wife's monthly drug costs \nare $200. His monthly pension from Morrell, after 30 years service, is \nabout $300.\n  Finally, a retiree who had a kidney transplant and recently had a leg \namputated, figures that he can pay for the company-offered insurance \ncoverage for the year it is available. After that he is not sure what \nhe will do to pay the $1,000 monthly cost for antirejection drugs, \nwhich Medicare doesn't cover.\n  Mr. President, the stories go on and on.\n  They describe proud people who worry that high medical costs will \nimpoverish them or force them to rely on their children for financial \nhelp.\n  They are stories about loyal employees who each day will live in fear \nof illness and injury because they have no health insurance.\n  Unfortunately, this is not an isolated situation. What happened to \nMorrell workers could happen to any of the 14 million retired workers \nwho believe they and their families have lifelong health insurance \ncoverage through their employers.\n  As companies look for ways to reduce their health care costs, they \nwill no doubt look at drastic reductions in, or outright elimination \nof, retiree health care benefits.\n  That just is not the way it should be in this country.\n  We all like to think that, if we work hard and play by the rules, we \nwill be rewarded, especially in our old age.\n  Sadly, when it comes to our health care system, this is often not the \ncase.\n  I was disappointed that the 103d Congress was unable to pass \ncomprehensive health reform, because many of the proposals we were \nconsidering would have addressed the problem the Morrell retirees now \nface.\n  A union official recently said, ``I wish that Harry and Louise could \nsee what's happened to the people at Morrell.''\n  I could not agree more. The problems we talked about in last year's \nhealth reform debate have not gone away simply because that session of \nCongress has ended.\n  The Morrell retiree situation is a painful reminder of that fact.\n  As I recently indicated in a letter to the majority leader, I remain \ncommitted to working with all of our colleagues to craft legislation \nthat will address the serious problems of the health care system that \nplague American families and businesses.\n  I will also be offering in the next few weeks a bill that will deal \ndirectly with the problem that Morrell and other retirees face.\n  I hope that those who have blocked and delayed health reform will at \nleast support the effort to ensure that our Nation's retirees get a \nfair day's wage from a fair day's work.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/15/senate-section/article/S3940-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3941]]\n           LOSS OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR MORRELL RETIREES\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Daschle, in \nefforts to find a solution for the Morrell retirees' who have lost \ntheir health benefits.\n  Nearly 1,200 Morrell retirees living in South Dakota have had their \nhealth insurance benefits terminated. Many retirees cannot purchase a \nprivate health insurance plan. Under the terms of their retirement \ncontract with John Morrell & Co., health insurance benefits were \nprovided to all retirees. But like so many retirees, they have found \nthe ground rules changed. John Morrell & Co. has terminated their \nhealth benefits. This decision has caused great hardship for many South \nDakota citizens. Benefits, which they were promised and which they \nearned, have been terminated.\n  I have taken steps to correct this problem. I have written to Mr. \nCarl Lindner, president of the Morrell parent company, Chiquita Brands. \nI asked that they reverse their earlier decision to terminate benefits. \nIn addition I have drafted legislation, which I am garnering support \nfor, which would reduce the health insurance deduction for corporations \nthat terminate health insurance benefits of their retirees. \nSpecifically, my proposal would limit a company to deduct just 25 \npercent of their health insurance costs--if they terminated the health \nbenefits of their retirees.\n  The union has appealed this decision and the matter next goes before \nthe Supreme Court. I am working on an amicus brief and hope to file \nthis on behalf of the retirees.\n  I am prepared to assist in legislation, or take any needed steps, to \nfind a solution. This will be very difficult. However, I am hopeful \nthis can be resolved.\n  I did want to rise on the Senate floor to say that I am very \nconcerned about what has happened to those retirees who have lost their \nhealth insurance in a contract dispute which sprung out of a long and \ndifficult labor dispute that has been going on near the meat packing \nplant of John Morrell & Co. in Sioux Falls, SD.\n  So, Mr. President, I wish to announce that I am also prepared to join \nin a legislative effort to protect not only these retired workers, but \nother retired workers who believed that they had health care coverage \ninto their retirement.

Mr. President, I have been planning to take the floor for \nsome time this week and have not been able to do so, given the Senate's \nschedule prior to this time. I was not aware that Senator Dole would be \ntaking the floor to talk about affirmative action.\n  First, let me say that I have the highest regard and respect for \nSenator Dole and I agree completely with what he said earlier that no \none--no one--can criticize his position on civil rights or on policies \nthat would benefit those who suffer from any sort of affliction or \ndisability.\n  Especially in the field of civil rights, he has been a leader. No one \ncan question his motivations. I think he is correct to start calling \nattention to some revisions that may be necessary in dealing with \naffirmative action.\n  Having said that, I want to point out that affirmative action has \nmoved apparently to the center stage of this country's political \nagenda. Critics of programs designed to address centuries' old \ndiscrimination range all the way from Presidential contenders to \nsyndicated columnists.\n  Some argue that our Nation is or should be colorblind and our laws \nrace and gender neutral. Some have argued--and I am paraphrasing, but I \nthink correctly--that reverse discrimination is as bad as slavery. I \nwant to repeat they believe that reverse discrimination is as bad as \nslavery. I suggest, perhaps, a reading of Alex Haley or James Baldwin \nor Gordon Parks might be beneficial in dismissing such a preposterous \nnotion.\n  One writer has written that, ``Compensatory opportunity is advocated \nby those who want to remedy the presumed victimization of certain \ngroups in the past.'' Mr. President, since victimization has only been \npresumed, apparently like the Holocaust, it has to be proven in the \npresent and in the future time and time again.\n  It is also said that preferential treatment based on race, gender or \nethnicity is inherently anti-American and contributes to the \npolarization of the American people. Finally, some say that 30 years is \nlong enough to compensate for the four centuries of our fathers' sins.\n  Mr. President, I should point out that these critics of affirmative \naction are not confined to angry white males. There are a number of \nprominent blacks, some of whom have no doubt been the beneficiaries of \naffirmative action programs, who now denounce the programs because of \nthe so-called Faustian bargain that they had to strike.\n They resent the fact that they now have scarlet letters ``AA'' stamped \non their brow, which, they believe, forever identifies them as social \nand intellectual inferiors who could not make it on merit.\n\n  Let me say, Mr. President, as a strong supporter of programs designed \nto help women and African Americans and other minorities break through \nglass ceilings and concrete walls, I believe, as I said earlier, that \nno program, however well-intentioned, should be excluded from review, \nrevision, even elimination if circumstances warrant. There is no doubt \nin my mind that some programs have been used and abused in ways that \nmany of us who are the authors and supporters of affirmative action \nnever anticipated. The Viacom deal, which is about to come before the \nSenate in the next week or two, is perhaps a classic case of a program \nthat has long since outlived its usefulness. Maybe it needs to be \nrejected and repealed.\n  But I say to those who argue that we should not consider any \npreferential treatment on the basis of group membership, I think we \nhave to look back into our history and look deep into our hearts and \nremind ourselves that we have a great deal to account for and correct \nbased on discriminatory policies of the past--policies that continue to \nthis very day. Judgments and jobs are not, as we would like to believe, \nbased on the content of our character. They are, in fact, in many, many \ncases still based on the color of one's skin, gender or ethnic \nbackground.\n  I know that affirmative action is said to be a politically defining \nissue, a wedge issue, one that is going to drive the middle-class white \nvoters fully into the arms of the Republican Party, leaving the \nminorities and women and other liberals floating in the backwash of the \nDemocratic Party. The polls actually confirm that this wedge is \npolitically powerful and popular as a force that will, in fact, succeed \nin dividing segments of our society into clearly defined political \ncamps.\n  Mr. President, let me say I believe any short-term political success \nis going to prove to be a long-term policy disaster, because what is \ntruly at stake in the coming debate is not wedges but values.\n  There are two values that lie deep within the American hearts and \nminds. One is that every person should be given a fair chance to \ncompete in the classroom, on the athletic fields and in the workplace. \nEvery person under our Constitution should enjoy equal privileges and \nprotections of the law.\n  Second, there should be no special privileges, no favoritism, no \nartificial or arbitrary rules that give something to someone that has \nnot been earned. There should be no quotas, no rules of thumb. We want \nrules of reason instead.\n   [[Page S3942]] In an ideal world, these values are not in conflict, \nthey are in complete harmony.\n  But let us suppose that the world is less than ideal. Let us suppose \nthat all the people are not treated equally over a long period of time. \nSuppose there are laws that discriminate against people because of \ntheir race or sex. Suppose that some people are treated as slaves or \npack mules or objects of hatred and violence or as simple reproductive \nvessels. And suppose that some people cannot buy a home or obtain a \nmortgage or get a job or break through that so-called glass ceiling \njust because of the color of their skin. Is there anything more un-\nAmerican than to deny a human being the chance to be the best that he \nor she can be on equal terms?\n  Is there anything more un-American than to isolate people in a \nghetto, to put up invisible barriers by denying them jobs, opportunity, \nand any hope of breaking out of that prison of poverty, and then to \nwatch in horror and outrage as their children go fatherless and the \nstreets go white with drugs and run red with the blood of mindless \nviolence?\n  Is there anything more un-American than to rob people of equal \nopportunity because of the pigment of their skin, the texture of their \nhair, the composition of their chromosomes, all while we proudly \nproclaim that our policies are colorblind and gender neutral?\n  And is there anything more hypocritical than to say that racism or \nsexism is a thing of the past?\n  Mr. President, a book I read some years ago, ``Native Son,'' written \nby Richard Wright 55 years ago, told the story of what it means to be \nblack in this country. There are many memorable scenes, but one that \nhas stayed with me over the years is one where there are two young \nboys, one named Bigger and one named Gus. They look up at a pilot who \nis skywriting on a lazy summer day. The passage goes:\n\n       ``Looks like a little bird,'' Bigger breathed with \n     childlike wonder.\n       ``Them white boys sure can fly,'' Gus said.\n       ``Yeah,'' Bigger said wistfully. ``They get a chance to do \n     everything. I could fly a plane if I had a chance.''\n       ``If you wasn't black and if you had some money and they'd \n     let you go to the aviation school, you could fly a plane,'' \n     Gus said. . . .\n\n  Then Bigger said:\n\n       Every time I think about it, I feel like somebody's poking \n     a red-hot iron down my throat. . . . It's just like living in \n     jail. Half the time I feel like I'm on the outside of the \n     world peeping in through the knot-hole in the fence. . . .''\n\n  Mr. President, that scene was memorable for me not just because it \ndepicts innocence in a novel that is filled with horror, but because it \nsays so much about the human spirit, about the significance of hope, \nand about the utter destructiveness of knowing in advance that hope can \nnever be realized.\n  Well, ``Native Son'' is fiction. It was written more than 50 years \nago now, and we know that a lot of things have changed since that time. \nWe know that we have Michael Jordan who may be, once again, skywriting \nin Chicago. We know that you can turn on your television set and watch \nBryant Gumbel or Oprah Winfrey. We know we have Justice Thomas on the \nCourt. We know that we have Colin Powell, who may be the most popular \nnon-Presidential candidate to date on the American political scene. \nThere are powerful women as well, Sandra Day O'Connor and Justice \nGinsburg, to name a few.\n  Let me just say that for every Michael Jordan, for every Colin \nPowell, for every athlete, musician, business-person who has succeeded, \nthere are millions of people locked away from opportunity to this very \nday.\n  One of the things that struck me several years ago was a program I \nwatched, I think it was on ``ABC PrimeTime.'' The producers of that \nshow took two attractive articulate male college graduates, one was \nwhite, one was black, and sent them out into the world followed by a \nhidden camera.\n  How was the black man treated? In a store, he was regarded with great \nsuspicion by a security guard who followed him wherever he went. At an \nauto dealership he was ignored for not just minutes but nearly a half-\nhour or more. He went to look for an apartment and was told, ``Just \nhappened to miss it. The last one went just a few minutes ago.''\n  Then they followed the white college graduate. Needless to say, he \nwas treated quite differently. When he went to the store, he was \nwelcomed with open arms. When he went to the auto dealership, he was \ngiven preferential treatment and terms. When he went to look for an \napartment, the same building at which the black man had just been \nturned down, they said, ``We have an apartment for you.''\n  Well, the camera never blinked, not once, not twice. And not one of \nthe participants in the film blinked. They either denied they were \nengaged in acts of racism or discrimination or they reacted with anger \nat the exposure of their behavior.\n  So for those today who say that racism is all a thing of the past, \nthat we do not have to worry about it anymore, that 30 years has really \nleveled the playing field--it isn't true. And for those who say that \naffirmative action is being used to deny qualified white males their \nopportunity--Mr. President--that was never the goal of affirmative \naction. It was never the goal of affirmative action to give preference \nto unqualified people over qualified ones, be it in college, in \ngraduate schools or the management level of business. We are not \ndiscriminating in favor of unqualified blacks and unqualified women.\n  Affirmative action is really about finding qualified people. They are \nout there in abundance. But either through inadvertence or deliberate \nneglect and rejection, they have been ignored. The pursuit has not been \nfor mediocrity, it has been for opportunity, to give everyone a chance \nto be the best that they can be.\n  Justice Holmes, one of my favorite Justices in the history of this \ncountry, said at one time that the tragedy that filled the old world's \nliterature was really about people who were taxed beyond their \nabilities. We know the story of Sisyphus forever rolling the rock up \nthe hill and it kept rolling back down. We know about those with the \nwater that kept coming up to their necks but could never drink. This \ntheme was really part of the myths and the tragedies of the ancient \nGreeks.\n  Holmes said that in modern times there is a different type of hell, a \nmuch deeper abyss, that occurs when people who are conscious of their \npowers are denied their chance. That is what affirmative action really \nhas been all about, when people conscious of their power have been \ndenied their chance. Affirmative action has provided an opportunity for \nthe U.S. Congress and the administration to work together to help bring \npeople who have the talent and the ability, who have been held down \nover the centuries--not just 30 years, over the centuries--to give them \na chance to break through the barriers. Now we are suddenly saying that \nsociety is all level, we are gender neutral, we are race neutral, we do \nnot have to worry about affirmative action anymore.\n  But we have not been fully successful. A recent Time magazine article \nshows that affirmative action has not had as positive an effect as the \ncritics claim or supporters hope. The article cites a Bureau of Labor \nStatistics study from 1994 noting that whites now hold 88.8 percent of \nmanagerial professional positions, down only slightly from 91.6 percent \nin 1983. In that same period, blacks increased their presence in the \nmanagerial professional ranks only marginally--from 5.6 to 7.1 percent. \nSo there have not been these great strides that the critics of the \nprograms have now cited.\n  Mr. President, I say it again, I have no doubt that there are some \nwho might use either their race or gender as an excuse for failure. The \nvast majority of people, however, have found that others have used \ntheir race or gender as a reason to keep them from success. So let us \nremove programs that are no longer necessary, let us revise ones that \nare not working, but let us not indulge in the delusion that the field \nof dreams is equal and level for all of our people. We still have a \nlong, long way to go.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams).

Mr. President, I want to associate myself and \nactually commend Senator Cohen for the statement he just made on the \nsubject of affirmative action. I have had the pleasure of serving with \nSenator Cohen now since I came to the Senate 2 years ago. I have seen \nhim in action, and I have been just overwhelmed and, frankly, very \ngrateful that he brings to these issues, particularly the hot-button \nissues and issues pertaining to race, a sensibility, a level-\nheadedness, fairness, and a perspective that is just so important to \nhave in this body.\n  It is because of the work of Senator Cohen and, frankly, many of the \nother Senators who approach these issues with a perspective that \nrelates to the interests of our community, that makes it easier to \naddress these issues here than might otherwise occur.\n  I come to the floor, Mr. President, though, because I just left a \nmeeting of the Finance Committee in which the committee voted to repeal \na section of the Tax Code which provided for minority and female \nownership of broadcast media. The argument around the repeal had come \nup because of a particular deal that was talked about in the \nnewspapers, one that has been debated as to whether or not it was a \ngood deal or fair deal.\n  The point is that by its action, in my opinion, the committee has \nessentially cemented the glass ceiling that keeps women and minorities \nfrom participating as full partners in an important industry that \nreally goes to the very heart of the character of our country.\n  I say that because, Mr. President, the section that was under review, \nsection 1071, was originally adopted back at a time when the concern \nwas over diversity of voices in the airwaves. The notion was that our \nentire community had an interest in hearing a multitude of voices so as \nto avoid the almost Orwellian Specter of a single point of view, a \nsingle voice being communicated to the American people over the \nairwaves.\n  And so this section was initially adopted in order to provide for \nopenness, in order to provide for inclusion, in order to provide for \ndiversity of voice in the airwaves. At the time, by the way, Mr. \nPresident, when the broadcast spectrums were initially instituted, they \nwere essentially given away. There was no cost associated with them at \nthe time.\n  As you can well imagine, Mr. President, at the time of the giveaway \nof these broadcast spectrums, no women got anything for free; no \nminorities were at the table. It was a situation in which you could \nalmost say there was a 100-percent set-aside for white males who knew \nabout broadcast spectrums and the opportunities they might provide.\n  Subsequently, Mr. President, the Congress decided that this section \nof the law that provided for openness and for inclusion and for \ndiversity of voice should be amended to provide opportunity for women \nand minorities to have ownership of broadcast facilities. So the tax \ncertificate approach was used as a way, really a tax way--it was not a \nset-aside in the sense we think of. It was a provision in the law that \nallowed for the private sector to diversify the airwaves, and allowed \nfor the private-sector actors to come together and open up ownership so \nthere would be this diversity of voices and so there would be \ndiversity, in fact, in the ownership of broadcast facilities.\n  That section of the law has been with us for awhile, and it is almost \ndisappointing, frankly, to note that in all the years since the 1980's, \nwhen this section was amended to include women and minorities, as of \ntoday women own about 3 percent of the entire broadcast industry--3 \npercent--and minorities own about 2 percent of that same industry.\n  So for all of this time and all of the effort, we still only were \nable to come up with a cumulative total of about 6 percent of the \nentire industry owned by women and minorities--a long way, I suggest, \nMr. President, from achieving the kind of diversity of voice, the kind \nof diversity that was originally intended by this section.\n  However, apparently there was a deal announced in the newspapers that \ninvolved some high-profile actors in the broadcast field, and the House \ntook it upon itself to target that specific deal--and I will use the \nname, the Viacom deal--to target that transaction as the basis upon \nwhich to repeal section 1071 and thereby constitute the first shot \nacross the bow, if you will, on affirmative action.\n  The chairman of the committee was actually--it was kind of almost \nhumorous because the chairman of the committee said he never expected \nthat the first battle on affirmative action would come in the Finance \nCommittee. But lo and behold, I guess by the law of unexpected \nconsequences, it wound up there, and so we had to take up the issue of \nwhat about this section of the law? Is there some unfairness here? \nShould we maintain it or should we repeal it?\n  Mr. President, the question underlying this tax certificate issue was \nextension of health insurance for the self-employed. We all, I think, \nsupport that. People who are self-employed ought to be able to deduct \ntheir payments for health insurance just like anybody else. And we are \njust now restoring a partial effort in that regard. But the question \nbefore the committee was not just the reinstitution of the 25-percent \ndeduction for health insurance. The question before the committee was \nhow to pay for that. Do we pay for that through the repeal of this tiny \nstep for women and minorities in the broadcast industry, do we pay for \nit with the repeal of section 1071, or do we find some other revenue \nsources?\n  Mr. President, it was, frankly, reflected in the President's budget, \nand a number of the members of the committee were interested in other \nalternative revenue sources such as a revenue source coming from those \nAmericans who renounce their U.S. citizenship to avoid paying taxes. \nThat provision, had we just changed the law a little bit for those \nbillionaires that renounce their American citizenship to avoid paying \ntaxes, would have raised twice the money, two times the money that \nwould have been raised by repealing section 1071.\n  Unfortunately--and this is why I have taken the floor this \nafternoon--the committee decided it was going to go ahead and repeal \nsection 1071 nonetheless, that somehow or another this was affirmative \naction gone amok, that somehow or another there was some problem with \nthis section, that is, it was open to abuse and fraud alike.\n  The fact is, the facts do not show that. The facts show that those \nfew minorities and those few women who participate in the broadcast \nindustry in an ownership capacity got there in large part because of \nthe existence of this statute that made it, frankly, financially \nworthwhile for sellers to sell to them. People would sell to minorities \nand people would sell to women precisely because they knew that there \nwould be some tax deferral by virtue of the ownership of these tax \ncertificates.\n  To the extent the door was open or the window was open or the ceiling \nwas cracked just a little bit, what the committee did this afternoon \nwas to seal over the crack in the glass ceiling, to shut the window on \nminority ownership, to close the door on women who would own in this \narea, and to really seal them in and make it more difficult than \nbefore, in spite of the limited success we have had so far.\n  I would like to review, just for a moment, some of the numbers. I \nhave used percentages, but just so you get a sense of it: Of the 11,586 \nbroadcast stations--11,586 broadcast stations, 420--420 are owned by \nwomen, and 323 are owned by minorities.\n  With regard to television stations, of the 1,342 television stations \noperating in the United States, 26 are owned by women and out of that \nnumber 31 are owned by minorities. I can break the figures down further \nand I certainly intend to do that at some point in the future. But the \npoint is, of this huge industry, there is just a little bit of \ndiversity of ownership. And the committee this afternoon decided to get \nrid of that.\n  In radio, out of 10,244 radio stations, some 394 are owned by women \nand 292 are owned by minorities.\n  It would be one thing if we were just talking about ownership, and \nthat certainly is the issue. But think what that says about the whole \nnotion of diversity of voice. If, to the extent we have \n [[Page S3944]] minority ownership at all, to the extent we have female \nownership at all, if we foreclose it and make that more difficult, then \nI fear we are doing a disservice to all of the American people who \nwould benefit from the opportunity to share in the diversity of \nviewpoint, the diversity of voice, the diversity of opinion, the \ndiversity of conversation, the diversity of perspective that is brought \nto this broadcast industry, which communicates information to all of \nus, by the presence of women and minorities in the field.\n  I listened to the majority leader a moment ago as he was speaking. I \nwant to say this at the outset: I did not hear all of his comments, but \nI did hear some. One of the statements was the race counting game had \ngone too far. I daresay, if anything, that almost casts this debate in \nthe wrong light altogether. No one is in favor of unfairness. No one \nwants to be unfair to white males. No one wants to be unfair to black \nmales, black women, white women, Asian, Hispanic--you can go down the \nlist and divide us up any number of ways. But the bottom line is we are \nall Americans. We are in this together and we will rise and we will \nsink as a Nation together. And to the extent we define ourselves as a \ncommunity with coherent interests, with interests that come together, \nwe will succeed as a Nation. We will not allow ourselves to be divided \nup and pitted against each other in this no-win, lose-lose game--I \nsubmit a cynical political game that suggests that race counting has \nany role in any of this.\n  That is not what affirmative action is about. I think Senator Cohen's \nremarks on this point were very well taken. Affirmative action is not \nabout race counting. It is not about quotas. What it is about is the \ntotal community recognizing the value of opening up opportunity so the \nface of opportunity in America is everybody's face; so it is not just \nwhite males who are given broadcast spectrum, but now it is the face of \nblack people, brown people, women, and all kinds of groups that were \nnot previously included in the definition.\n  When we talked about the American dream 100 years ago, it had a \nparticular meaning. It meant white male, period. I was reminded women \nin this country just got the vote 75 years ago. So even though an \nAmerican of African descent--the emancipation happened over 100 years--\nas a woman, as an African-American woman, I still would not have been \neven able to vote until 75 years ago.\n  So the face of the American dream is changed. The face of the \nAmerican dream now is a multiplicity of people. It is a multiplicity of \nfaces. It is an inclusive face. It includes everybody. It includes \neverybody who subscribes to the ideals and the values that define us as \nAmericans.\n  I submit that this debate about affirmative action goes to the heart \nof what we mean by who is included in this American dream. It goes to \nthe heart of whether or not opportunity is going to be open to all \nAmericans or just some Americans; whether or not we are going to begin \nto try to undo and fix some of the persistent problems that we have in \nour society by providing some support and some help to those who have \npreviously been excluded.\n  It is for that reason, again, I am very distressed by what happened \nin the committee this afternoon. I am very distressed by the assault on \naffirmative action. I am very distressed, frankly, by the tenor that \nthis conversation has taken--happily, so far, outside of this Chamber. \nI hope here in the Senate we will have a more reasoned debate about \nwhat are the real issues here, and not allow ourselves to get separated \nand inflamed, and not allow for the hot button appeals to pass and \nprejudice to succeed.\n  I hope in this body we will take it upon ourselves to look at the \nfacts and make our decisions based on reality and not myths, \npreconceptions, diversions, and misinformation; make our decision based \non what is actually going on in our country and what direction do we \nwant to take.\n  I think in Senator Cohen's remarks--and I would like to take a point \nthere to make the next step and talk about the next point--he talked \nabout people having a sense of opportunity, of being able to rise to \nthe highest level of their ability.\n  Certainly, ability and merit and excellence are concepts that are \nimportant and dear to all of us. But the question becomes to what \nextent do those who feel they are denied inclusion--to what extent do \nwe not exacerbate, make worse the hopelessness that besets all too many \nof our communities, that besets all too many of our people? To what \nextent do we not exacerbate the notion that you can rise just so far \nbut you cannot go any further; the notion the glass ceiling is there, \nintact; that a woman can only go so far, that a minority can only go so \nfar in maintaining the institutions and the systems that by their \noperation create whole communities of disaffection? By maintaining \nthose institutions, I believe we buy into and build up and give succor \nto the hopelessness that is beginning to erode the very foundations of \nour national character.\n  I submit this debate is going to be one of those turning debates, one \nof those critical debates that will direct the future direction of our \ncountry as we go into the next millennium which, as you know, is only 5 \nyears from now. As we go into this next century, the question before us \ntoday--whether it is in a debate as specific and as complex as 1071 and \nthe operation of a section of the Tax Code, or if the debate is on \nsomething more general and straightforward that people can grasp onto--\nthe question becomes, for this body, how shall we proceed in this \ndebate? Shall we allow it to become the kind of hot button race-baiting \nprejudicial kind of inflammatory debate that pits us against each \nother, inflames passions, distorts the debate, ignores the facts, and \nplays into myths and prejudices and fears? Or, instead of playing into \npeople's fear, do we play to and direct our comments and our \nconversation and our decisions to the hopes of the American people that \nthe American dream really is still alive; and that it lives not just \nfor white males, but it lives for black males and black women and brown \nmales and brown women and men and women of every stripe and description \nwho call themselves Americans?\n  That is what this debate is about. I know the issue is going to come \nback to the floor time and time again. I am making extemporaneous \nremarks right now about it. But I was drawn to come to the floor this \nafternoon in large part in response to some of the things that were \nbeing said earlier.\n  I just submit to you that I hope that as we go down this road it will \nbe a road we go down together and that we can appeal to, as Abraham \nLincoln said, the ``higher angels'' of our nature and which address \nwhat is in the best interests of our country as a whole. And, therein, \nI think we will find a correct answer as to what to do about the issue \nof affirmative action.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me first of all say that I am very \nglad coming down here I have the opportunity to hear the statements of \nboth the Senator from Maine and the junior Senator from Illinois about \nthe issue of affirmative action. It is again encouraging to see the \nU.S. Senate acting in a bipartisan manner to ask the questions that \nhave to be asked about certain aspects of the so-called Republican \ncontract that we are going to carefully examine the record of \naffirmative action and other such issues and make sure that in our \nhaste to address some genuine public frustration that we do not destroy \nsome of the things that have been done in the last 20 or 30 years that \nactually have helped people and made this country a fairer place.\n  So I appreciate that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/15/senate-section/article/S3943-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3944-S3949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND RESCISSIONS ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, the pending business before us I assume is the \nKassebaum amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the purpose of the Kassebaum amendment \nis to overturn the President's Executive order saying in effect that \nFederal \n [[Page S3945]] dollars should not be used to encourage strikebreaking. \nThat is what it is really about. I think it is only fair to remind \neveryone that this amendment obviously has nothing to do with the bill \nbefore us. What is this amendment about strikebreakers doing on a \nDepartment of Defense bill having to do with peacekeeping? None of us \nare completely pure in this category of offering amendments that are \nnot completely relevant to the core of a bill. The germaneness rule \nhere essentially does not exist in most instances and stands in stark \ncontrast to the rule that I got used to in the Wisconsin State Senate \nand for 10 years we really did have a germaneness rule. You can \nactually prevent this kind of confusion.\n  I want to reiterate. Of course, this has happened before. But on this \nbill it seems extremely off the mark to try to address the issue of \nstrikebreaking and the strikebreaker issue in the context of this bill \nwhich I thought was about readiness.\n  I thought the bill was about whether we are going to provide certain \nfunds for our peacekeeping forces. I thought the bill was supposed to \nbe about the identification of certain cuts within the Defense \nDepartment that would help pay for some other things that the Defense \nDepartment believes needs to be done both in this country and around \nthe world. That is what I thought the bill was about.\n  So do not let anybody be fooling you here. The effort we are making \nhere is not a filibuster again against the bill. Many of us who are \nobjecting to this amendment think the bill has tremendous merit. There \nis a lot of merit to it. But it is a rather unique way to finance \nneeded peacekeeping funds by finding other things in the Defense \nDepartment that maybe can be eliminated. It has a lot of fiscal sense \nbehind it. But this is not an effort to kill the bill. Everyone in here \nknows that. But I am afraid some of the people who might be watching \nthis would assume, given the reputation of the Senate for filibusters, \nthat this is an effort to delay the process. In fact, it is just the \nopposite.\n  It is amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas that has slowed us \ndown. Day after day is being wasted on an effort to embarrass the \nPresident on this issue that could have been used, either to move this \nbill through to deal with the some 40 amendments pending on the bill, \nand maybe we could even be on what I thought was the business at hand \naccording to the majority. According to the majority in this body, we \nwere going to pass that balanced budget amendment so we could get down \nto the nitty-gritty of identifying where the cuts would come from and \nmake the cuts now. Time and again both sides said, sure, we can pass a \nbalanced budget amendment or not, but that the real work is identifying \nwhere the cuts are and not just identifying them but coming out here on \nthe floor of the Senate and voting to cut waste in the Federal \nGovernment. Why is not that happening today? It is not happening today \nbecause we have this amendment before us that is completely extraneous \nto the deficit issue and that is intended to embarrass the President \nand that is intended to further drive a stake into the heart of the \nworking people of this country.\n  I want to talk a little bit today about the merits of the issue. But \nbefore I do I hope we do not hear any complaints from the majority or \nthe talk radio people about how the balanced budget amendment took up \nso much time. It did take time. It was a terribly important issue. It \ndeserved to have that kind of consideration. I think the whole process \nwas better for it. But what is happening here is that day after day we \nare arguing about a Federal Executive order about strikebreakers that \nis preventing us from getting on to the real work of identifying what \nmust be eliminated from our Federal budget so we can have not just a \nbalanced budget amendment, Mr. President, but a balanced budget, not \nnecessarily waiting to the year 2002 but so that we can do it now.\n  In fact, it is one of the reasons I voted against the balanced budget \namendment because it is an opportunity for people to say I am for \nbalancing the budget but then talk about everything else in the world \ninstead of getting down to the work of finding the cuts and \nimplementing them. This amendment helps that process. Putting us off \nthe track, putting us onto the effort to kick down, kick people who are \nalready hurting in the labor movement, is a great way to stay away from \nthose hard choices that we made in the 103d Congress and that the 104th \nCongress claims it intends to address. But so far we have seen none of \nthe debate that is involved in reducing the Federal budget.\n  Sometimes I wonder if the Republicans in this body forgot that they \nwon. This is the kind of amendment you bring up when you are in the \nminority. Say there is a bill coming up, and the bill has to pass--an \nappropriations bill. We know we have to do it. That is when you bring \nup these amendments to kind of put them off the track. But what you are \ndoing is delaying your own agenda here. In the House they are moving \nmuch faster than you are here. I think generally that is not good. But \nin the case of this bill, what would be wrong with moving this issue \nforward and not getting sidetracked? You are slowing yourself down. You \nare slowing down the Republican contract for one specific aspect of the \nRepublican contract which has to do with not just trying to prevent the \nuse of permanent replacement workers or allow the use of permanent \nreplacement workers but specifically to say it is OK to have Federal \ndollars flow to companies that use permanent replacement workers.\n  Mr. President, I hope everyone understands exactly what is going on \nhere. It is a completely extraneous amendment that does not have to do \nwith this bill and has even less to do with the main business that this \nCongress should be addressing which is reducing the Federal deficit.\n  Mr. President, to discuss this amendment we must because it is the \nbusiness before us. The effort to embarrass the President continues \ndespite the failure of two cloture votes now to cut off debate.\n  Mr. President, last week I spoke at some length on the issue of the \nuse of permanent replacement workers by employers during labor \ndisputes. I had a chance to come to the floor and follow the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts in describing the history of the use of permanent \nreplacement workers in my own State of Wisconsin, the border State of \nthe Senator in the chair. As I indicated then, I was the author of \nlegislation in Wisconsin that would have prohibited the use of \npermanent strikebreakers. And I had the chance years ago when I was \nstill in the State senate to come to Washington and testify before a \ncommittee of the other body on behalf of the Federal law that has been \nproposed over the years because I do think in the end it is better that \nwe have a Federal law banning the use of permanent replacement workers. \nWe have not achieved that yet. That was killed last session by a \nfilibuster. We had enough votes in both the Senate and the House and \nthe President ready to sign the bill. It was killed by a Republican \nfilibuster.\n  So our President, President Clinton, who is a supporter of the \nantistrikebreaker legislation, at least has done \nwhat he could do. The Executive order issued last week by the President \nis actually just a very modest step which would only say that employers \nwho receive Federal contracts would be prohibited from engaging in this \nunfair practice. To me that is almost a disappointment. It is just a \nminimal requirement to impose upon those who want to do business with \nthe Federal Government. But it is what the President can do. And I am \nvery proud of him for having the nerve and the courage to make that \nExecutive order.\n  To me those who would take Government money should be held to certain \nstandards of fundamental fairness. That is why Presidents have in the \npast issued Executive orders directing Federal contractors to do things \nlike maintain discriminatory-free workplaces and to take affirmative \nsteps to eliminate discriminatory practices. There are a number of \nimportant issues raised by the debate around the use of permanent \nreplacement workers. My friends in Wisconsin, who work so hard, \ndescribe them as striker breakers. At the core of this however, is \nreally one central question, the question that goes to the heart of the \nwhole debate on this amendment. The question is should workers have the \nright to use the strike as an economic voice during \n [[Page S3946]] times when negotiations with their employers break \ndown? That is the question. I, of course, have answered in the \naffirmative. They must have that right to collectively bargain, the \nright to join together in a union to have any meaning at all.\n  Mr. President, let me examine this a little more closely in three \nareas. First, I want to talk a little bit about what other countries do \nwith regard to the use of permanent replacement workers in the strike \ncontext. Secondly, I would like to turn to some of the comments of not \npolitical people but religious and community leaders that have strong \nmoral feelings about the appropriateness of the use of permanent \nreplacement workers. Finally, I would like to take a few minutes to \nillustrate yet a few more examples of the great harm and cruelty that \ncan come from the abusive practice of using permanent replacement \nworkers to resolve labor disputes.\n  First, turning to other countries. We ought to take a look, as some \nSenators have had us do, at what is done by other countries, what our \ninternational competitors do in this area. So often, when it comes to \nlabor law or other laws having to do with health or safety, people say, \nlet us look at this because we do not want to put American businesses \nat a disadvantage. That sometimes is a reason that people raise, that \nit is very legitimate for us not to pass legislation to protect our own \npeople, saying it could hurt us competitively. But the senior Senator \nfrom Illinois, who has spoken on this issue very eloquently, has \npointed out time and again that virtually all countries in the world \nthat are involved in serious industrial and trade activity do not allow \nthe use of permanent replacement workers.\n  I will give you a few examples from a report prepared by the Library \nof Congress in 1990. With the exception of Great Britain and some of \nthe Canadian Provinces, the law in practice in all of the countries \nsurveyed--Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, \nand Sweden--all prohibit employers from dismissing striking workers.\n  One example is France. French law does not allow the firing of \nworkers during or because of a strike. Indeed, according to the first \nparagraph of article L.521-1 of the Labor Code, a strike is not a \nbreach of contract. According to the third paragraph of the same \narticle, any dismissal in violation of paragraph 1, which is the right \nto strike, is null and void. French law, as a consequence of this \narticle, also prohibits the permanent replacement of striking workers. \nMoreover, article L.122-3 of the Labor Code specifically forbids the \nuse of temporary replacements during a strike. French law regulates \nthis issue to the point that even temporary workers hired before a \nstrike cannot be used as replacements for permanent employees. Indeed, \nthe notion of replacement for strike purposes is simply forbidden by \nlaw.\n  So I hope nobody says that our efforts to compete with the French and \nAfrican trade opportunities is going to be impaired by this Executive \norder. It will not, because they do not allow it. We do.\n  The same is true of Greece. The right to strike in Greece is \nguaranteed by the Constitution of 1975, as amended. Article 23 states \nthat the right to strike could be exercised by lawfully established \ntrade unions in order to protect and promote the financial and general \nlabor interests of employees. The fundamental law that governs workers' \nfreedom in general and the right to strike in particular is Law 1264/\n1982 on Democratization of the Syndicalistic Movement and the \nEstablishment of Syndicalistic Freedom of Working People. In article 19 \nof this law, only trade unions have a right to declare a strike to \nsupport economic and labor interests. Article 22 of Law 1264 explicitly \nprohibits the hiring of replacement workers. Specifically, it states: \n``During a legal strike, the hiring of strikebreakers is prohibited. \nThe lockout is also prohibited.''\n  Consequently, Mr. President, in Greece, a lawful strike does not \nbring about a breach of an employment contract. As in France, the \ncontract is merely suspended during a strike, and the employer does not \nhave the right to either dismiss the workers or hire replacement \nworkers. That European nation does not permit permanent replacement \nworkers.\n  Let us turn to another country nearby--Italy. Article 40 of the \nItalian Constitution recognizes the right to strike. In the absence of \nany legislative regulation expressly called for by the Constitution, \nthe right is recognized in its broadest form and is intended to be used \nfor the improvement of working and economic conditions. As a \nconsequence of this recognition, a strike is considered as a cause of \nlegitimate suspension of the individual employment relationship, with \nconsequent suspension of compensation. The Italian law says a strike \ndoes not empower the employer to dismiss the strikers or permanently \nhire other workers to replace them.\n  Furthermore, in Italy, the right to strike finds strong, indirect \nprotection under the provisions of Decree No. 300 of 1970, known as the \n``Workers' Statute.'' Article 28 of this decree punishes employers who \ncarry out any actions aimed at preventing or limiting a worker's free \nexercise of union activities, as well as his or her right to strike. \nArticle 15 of the decree nullifies any act or pact aimed at dismissing \nor discriminating against or hurting a worker in any way because of his \nunion membership or because of his participation in a strike.\n  Finally, let me turn to another part of the world of our great \ncompetitors in international trade, if not our ultimate competitor--\nJapan. The senior Senator from Illinois, not just during this debate \nbut in previous debates, has pointed out time and again that Japanese \ncompanies cannot use permanent replacement workers and strikebreakers \nin Japan. But, apparently, companies owned by the Japanese in this \ncountry have gone ahead and done that to break strikes. That is a great \nirony and unfortunate irony of the current state of our law.\n  Looking at the Japanese law, article 7, paragraph 1, of the Labor \nUnion Law of Japan provides that:\n\n       The employer shall not engage in the following practices: \n     1) discharge or show discriminatory treatment towards a \n     worker by reason of his being a member of a labor union or \n     having tried to join or organize a labor union or having \n     performed an appropriate act of a labor union. . ..\n\n  These last few words in the Japanese law, the words ``an appropriate \nact of a labor union'' are construed under Japanese law to include acts \narising from collective bargaining with the employer, such as strikes, \npicketing, and so on. Therefore, under Japanese law, as with the other \ncountries I mentioned, it is unlawful for an employer to discharge a \nstriking employee.\n  The validity of the above provisions was upheld by the Supreme Court \nin that country, which stated that since the prohibitory clause as set \nforth in article 7, paragraph 1, of the Labor Union Law originated from \narticle 28 of the Constitution and was intended, according to the \ncourt, to guarantee the workers' right to organize and to bargain \ncollectively, and therefore any acts on the part of the employer done \nagainst the above provision is illegal per se.\n  For that reason, I believe it is fair to say that the use of \nstrikebreakers, permanent replacement workers, would, of course, also \nbe illegal under Japanese law.\n  So I hope we do not hear too much argument that our competitive \nposition is about to suffer if we do not join the rest of the \nindustrialized countries in the world in saying that the use of \npermanent replacement workers is unfair labor practice, that it is \nharsh and the unfair to people who have chosen to join together in a \nlabor union.\n  Having mentioned some of the other countries' positions on this, let \nme turn to a completely different angle on this issue--some of the \ncomments of some religious and community leaders, who are not \naddressing this issue because they intend to run for office, who are \nnot addressing this issue because they like to always get into the \npolitical fray. I assume they address the issue because they have a \nresponsibility to reflect and think and talk about what is fair and \nmoral conduct in this society. What is the way one human being should \ntreat another, I think, would be the perspective of the people I am \nabout to discuss.\n  Mr. President, reviewing support for legislation prohibiting \npermanent replacement workers, I was struck by the \n [[Page S3947]] number of religious and community leaders who agreed \nthat no company--and certainly not the Federal Government--should \nengage in conduct that would promote the use of strikebreakers. The \nMost Reverend Frank Rodimer, bishop of Paterson, NJ, had this to say on \nbehalf of the U.S. Catholic Conference in testimony in 1991:\n\n       The role of unions in promoting the dignity of work and of \n     workers is very important in Catholic teaching. In the words \n     of Pope John Paul II, through labor unions workers can ``not \n     only have more, but be more.'' Rooted in the basic human \n     right to freedom of association, the right to organize unions \n     and to bargain collectively remains essential in order to \n     prevent the exploitation of workers and to defend the human \n     person as more than just a factor in production. For one \n     hundred years the Church has called on governments to respect \n     and defend labor unions in their essential roles in the \n     struggle for justice in the workplace and as building blocks \n     for freedom and democracy.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       Mr. Chairman, an essential tool for unions in pursuing the \n     just rights of their members is the possibility of a strike; \n     without the threat of a strike unions would be next to \n     powerless to resist unjust demands by employers. Without the \n     right to strike, workers come to the bargaining table at a \n     serious disadvantage, facing employers who are holding most \n     of the cards. This relative weakness of workers in a market \n     economy is the reason that Catholic teaching supports the \n     legitimacy of the resort to a strike when this is the only \n     available means to obtain justice. The right to strike has \n     not always been used wisely; nor are unions above criticism, \n     but neither the corruption that has plagued some--not all--\n     unions nor the violence associated with some--not all--\n     strikes can justify the denial nor the erosion of workers \n     basic rights.\n\n  The bishop continues:\n\n       Forty years ago when I become a priest it would have been \n     unthinkable for an employer in my community to respond to a \n     strike by hiring permanent replacements. I am told that \n     because of a Supreme Court decision in 1938 it would have \n     been legal to do so, but in those days employers knew better. \n     Labor unions represented a large proportion of workers, and \n     union values permeated the community. In those days, \n     solidarity was not the name of a union in Poland but a \n     working principle in American communities.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       However, economic restructuring and social change have \n     undermined the cohesiveness of our communities, and devotion \n     to the common good is often sacrificed in pursuit of personal \n     gain. The painful recessions of the 70's and the relentless \n     individualism of the 80's have left many without either the \n     financial cushion or the community connections to ride out \n     strikes or prolonged unemployment. In such an atmosphere, \n     some employers feel free to use strikes as an opportunity to \n     get rid of the union and collective bargaining and their \n     union workforce. I know many employers who wouldn't do this, \n     but, unfortunately there are those that have done so and \n     others that are open to it.\n       The results have been predictable and damaging. Not only \n     have unions been weakened in their ability to defend the \n     rights of workers, but communities have experienced savage \n     struggles, with neighborhoods in turmoil, families divided \n     and workers without hope. The promise of permanent employment \n     made to the replacement workers becomes an impediment to \n     settling the strike, and negotiations are stymied. The \n     victims are the original workers and their families who often \n     have no place else to go and even the replacement workers who \n     are later discharged when the business closes because of the \n     damage of a prolonged strike. In some places, whole \n     communities suffer wounds that won't heal for generations.\n\n  Mr. President, I am reading from the bishop's comments, but I would \njust say that I, too, in my work have had a chance to see whole \ncommunities wounded and damaged in Wisconsin, places like De Pere, WI, \nby the use of permanent replacement workers.\n  Returning to the comments:\n\n       When employers are allowed to offer permanent jobs to \n     strikebreakers, strikers lose their jobs. It's that simple. \n     If workers lose their jobs, what does it mean to have a right \n     to strike? If there's no effective right to strike, what does \n     it mean to have a right to organize?\n       Human dignity is clearly threatened in our country. The \n     evidence is visible on our streets and in our shelters where \n     a growing number of people are forced to live even though \n     they work every day. In our cities and in our rural areas \n     throughout this country working people are homeless because \n     their wages have fallen so far below the cost of housing. \n     Recent immigrants and single mothers, newcomers to the labor \n     force and those least likely to have union representation, \n     are mired in poverty.\n\n  Bishop Rodimer concluded:\n\n       The right to strike without fear of reprisal is fundamental \n     to a democratic society. The continued weakening of worker \n     organizations is a serious threat to our social fabric. I \n     think we have to decide whether we will be a country where \n     workers' rights are totally dependent on the good will of \n     employers or whether we will be a country where the dignity \n     of work and the rights of workers are protected by the law of \n     the land.\n\n  I think this was an eloquent statement by the bishop that gives us \nsome guidance about how appropriate this amendment before us is today.\n  Very briefly, here is what some other national religious leaders have \nsaid.\n  From the United Methodist Church, Council of Bishops and General \nBoard of Church and Society, this statement:\n\n       Since the early years of the trade union movement, \n     Catholic, Orthodox Christian, Protestant and Jewish leaders \n     have supported collective bargaining as a democratic way to \n     settle differences in the workplace. Permanent replacement of \n     strikers upsets the balance of power critical for achieving \n     peaceful, negotiated settlements between labor and \n     management. As a result, both collective bargaining and the \n     democratic values that created this nation are under attack.\n\n  From the Christian Church--Disciples of Christ--Department of Church \nand Society, Division of Homeland and Ministries, the following:\n\n       The record is clear that major religious groups in this \n     country for many years have supported workers' rights against \n     abusive tactics and treatment by employers.\n       We deplore the tactics of ``permanent replacement'' and we \n     urgently call for new federal legislation that will protect \n     workers from such tactics.\n\n  Mr. President, from Jewish organizations, the National Council of \nJewish Women has said: ``The practice of hiring permanent replacement \nworkers has had a chilling effect on collective bargaining. The \nlegislation currently under consideration by Congress''--referring, I \nam sure, to S. 5 of last session and similar bills--``would help \nrestore the balance between labor and management * * *''\n  From the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Reference and \nCounsel Committee, a resolution which they passed which ``calls for an \nend to recriminations against workers who participate in strikes, and \ncalls upon the appropriate churchwide units, synods, congregations, and \nmembers to support legislation that would strengthen the viability of \nnegotiated settlements and prevent''--not slow down, but prevent--``the \npermanent replacement of striking workers.''\n  Mr. President, not only in other countries but from some of our \nleading religious leaders and leading religious denominations in this \ncountry, not just my own words, but words of condemnation for the \ncruelty and harshness and immorality of throwing people out of their \njobs permanently when they have exercised their legitimate right to \nstrike.\n  Mr. President, I would like to turn now, third, to just add a few \nmoments of real-life situations, concrete examples, of where workers \nhave been forced to pay dearly for asserting their legal right to \nstrike when collective bargaining efforts have failed.\n  Naturally, I begin with one from my own State of Wisconsin, one that \nI recall to have been very painful for the whole community of Racine, \nWI, and, of course, especially for the working families of that area.\n  I already talked about similar incidents in De Pere, WI, near Green \nBay, and Cudahy, WI, near Milwaukee, and the area near my own home in \nsouthern Wisconsin, in towns like Madison, Stoughton, and Janesville.\n  But this is about Racine, WI, where the Ladies' Garment Workers Local \n187 had not had a strike for 50 years at Rainfair, Inc., a manufacturer \nof protective clothing at Racine, WI. That, unfortunately, changed on \nJune 20, 1991, when the workers did walk out over management demands \nthat seemed designed to actually force a strike.\n  It appeared to the workers not just that they needed to go on strike, \nbut that somebody was pushing them, shoving them, trying to get them to \ngo out on strike.\n  The company had demanded the health insurance copayments more than \ndouble, and offered the low-wage workers only a 15-cents-an-hour \nincrease over a 3-year period.\n  Unfortunately, and not surprisingly in this new era of permanent \nreplacement workers, soon after the strike began, Rainfair began to \nhire permanent replacements, and seemed bound and determined to break \nthe union.\n  The workers, most of them women, many of them single mothers, \nworking \n [[Page S3948]] single mothers--not single mothers on welfare, but \nworking single mothers--held out, with virtually no one crossing the \npicket line.\n  I recall that five strikers joined a protest fast. Two of them went \n35 days with no food.\n  The union launched a nationwide boycott of the protective gear sold \nto many union members, including police officers, firefighters, \nconstruction, postal and chemical workers.\n  But the presence of these permanent replacement workers did not help \nresolve the dispute. It greatly prolonged the dispute.\n  The primary issue soon became whether there would be an opportunity \nto return to work for all of the strikers. The issue divided the \ncommunity and embittered once amicable labor-management relations.\n  Finally, the Rainfair Co., under pressure from the boycott and the \nnational attention drawn to it by the fast, finally agreed to a new \ncontract on December 3, 1991. To enable all strikers to return, the \nworkers agreed to work 6-hour days temporarily.\n  But obviously, the situation was made worse by the use of permanent \nreplacement workers, not better.\n  Another example, having to do with the General Dynamics Corp. In the \nsummer of 1987, 3,500 machinists in San Diego were forced to strike in \na division of General Dynamics Corp. when the aerospace firm demanded \ncutbacks in medical benefits and seniority rights.\n  Even before the final strike vote was taken, General Dynamics was \nthreatening the members of IAM Local 1125, issuing handbills that told \nworkers in advance that the intent of the company was to permanently \nreplace them if they struck, and instructing union members on how to \nwithdraw from the union. They were trying to undercut the union in \nadvance.\n  During the second week of the strike, the company carried out its \nthreat and resorted to scare tactics and coercion, cutting off workers' \nhealth benefits and pressuring union members to cross picket lines.\n  Those workers who did return to their jobs were directed to call IAM \nmembers at home, reminding them of the company's threat that they were \ngoing to be permanently replaced.\n  After the strike was finally settled, nearly 700 union members had, \nin fact, been permanently replaced. They were forced to wait on a \nrecall list for a year or more just for a chance at a job that they \nwere supposed to have in the first place. During that time, IAM members \nexhausted their savings, lost their homes, cars, and sometimes their \nfamilies, as they struggled desperately to help each other out.\n  It was also a heartbreaking story of a woman from Indiana having to \ndo with a company called Arvin Industries. One of the statements made \nwas, ``I always felt obligated to do a good job. I thought that honesty \nand obligation were a good way to live my life, but now I'm not sure. \nThat company robbed me.''\n  She said of the workers, ``I look at the replacement workers and I \nwonder how they can feel good about taking our jobs. I try to put aside \nmy feelings, but it's hard.''\n  That is the status of Marcina Stapleton, for whom being permanently \nreplaced brought bankruptcy and forced her daughter out of college.\n  The single mother of two was permanently replaced when Electrical \nWorkers Local 1331 struck Arvin Industries in Columbus, IN. She had \nworked 6 years as a press operator. Even though the strike was settled \nin 7 months she was not called back for 17 months.\n  ``It was hard making it'' through those months, she said. Her only \nincome was a $200 a month in child support and whatever she could earn \nfrom odd jobs. She had rent payments of $325 a month, car payments, \nutilities, college costs for her daughter, and it all proved to be too \nmuch.\n  Her daughter had to drop out of school and Stapleton declared \nbankruptcy. She said, ``I am not proud of it but it was the only way \nout.''\n  But the biggest toll was the emotional strain it put on her and her \nfamily. She felt the pressure of bills, including $2,300 in back rent, \nand the relationship with her children suffered from the strain. The \nchildren were fighting with each other and her teenage son ended up in \ncounseling.\n  She went back to work in October 1990, making $8.80 an hour and \npaying $9 a week for health insurance. Before she went on strike she \nmade $11.57 an hour with $2.25 an hour incentive bonus and employer-\npaid insurance, complete.\n  She said, ``I had to go back into work, I have to keep living.'' But \nit is not easy to work alongside people who benefited from her pain. \n``What I did was the right thing. I would do it again if I had to,'' \nshe said.\n  So, Mr. President, I assure you I could continue to read descriptions \nof these heartbreaking real life stories. I am tempted to do so. I may \nbe back to do so later. I think at least for now the point has been \nmade that these are real human examples and real human tragedies that \nare caused by the heartless practice and abuse of the use of striker \nreplacement.\n  This is not, as the Senator from Massachusetts has pointed out time \nand again, just a dry academic argument about labor law. This is about \npeople who simply want the opportunity to make a decent living and to \nbe paid fairly and not be thrown out of their jobs because on occasion \nthey may have to use their legitimate right to strike.\n  This is not just a debate about a Federal order from the Executive. \nThis is a debate about whether this country cares about American \nworkers. Whether we are prepared to stand by and watch the tremendous \ngains accomplished to be eroded by this kind of cruel practice aimed at \nbreaking the backs of workers who exercise their right to engage in \ncollective labor efforts and to strike when negotiations fail.\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude shortly, but in doing so I \nwould like to quote from an article recently written by the new \npresident of our Wisconsin AFL-CIO, Mr. David Newby. David wrote:\n\n       Let's cut through the rhetoric to the central issue: What \n     is a strike? It is a situation where workers voluntarily \n     leave their jobs--simply walk away--because they can't agree \n     with their employer on a contract covering wages, working \n     conditions, health insurance, or pension? Or is it that \n     workers retain their jobs but temporarily withhold their \n     labor until they and the employer come to an agreement?\n\n  Which is it? Just walking away or a legitimate part of the collective \nbargaining agreement, he was asking. Dave Newby says:\n\n       The distinction is fundamental.\n       The anti-union crowd means that workers have no bargaining \n     power at all. As long as management can find others to work \n     for whatever they offer (not hard to do when decent paying \n     jobs are so scarce), they have no incentive to bargain \n     serious with a union. And without strong unions that can \n     bargain on equal terms with management, we will continue to \n     see workers' wages fall and good paying jobs disappear.\n       In the workplace, a ``right'' means nothing if you can be \n     fired (or permanently replaced) for exercising it.\n\n  Mr. President, David Newby says that.\n\n       If the right to strike means anything at all, it has to \n     mean you can't be fired for striking. You lose your paycheck, \n     but you don't lose your job. Win, lose, or draw, workers must \n     have the right to return to their jobs when a strike is over.\n\n  Mr. Newby says:\n\n       Workers don't strike for frivolous reasons. A strike is an \n     action of last resort. Workers don't strike in order to \n     bankrupt or close down the companies they have worked for: \n     They realize better than anyone that their companies need to \n     be profitable in order to have jobs at good wages.\n       The issue for workers is simply getting their fair share \n     and having the effective right to strike for their fair share \n     when management won't voluntarily grant it.\n       During the 1950's and 1960's, employers almost never used \n     ``permanent replacements during strikes''--temporaries, yes; \n     permanent replacements, no. Both business and community \n     values held that the permanent replacement of workers and \n     strikers was abhorrent.\n\n  That is the way people felt, Mr. Newby points out.\n\n       That changed 15 to 20 years ago. Many employers decided to \n     destroy unions instead of bargaining with them. Indeed, this \n     vicious management practice is becoming even more common. In \n     a recent Congressional General Accounting Office survey, 35 \n     percent of CEO's said they would use permanent replacement \n     strikers during a strike; 17 percent reported actually doing \n     so.\n\n  Mr. Newby concludes:\n\n       It's time that American workers had the same rights and \n     protections that workers have in the industrialized countries \n     that are \n      [[Page S3949]] our main competitors and trading partners-- \n     countries such as Germany, Japan, and Canada. We're tired of \n     being second-class citizens in the industrial world of global \n     competition.\n\n  Mr. President, I don't think any statement could have pulled together \nthese themes better than Mr. Newby's. The theme of competition \ninternationally, the theme of what religious and communities leaders \nhave to say about this practice, and the theme of the actual \nheartbreaking stories of what happens to the people in these \ncommunities when their jobs are ripped away from them simply because \nthey are trying to exercise their right to strike.\n  It is time that American workers have the same rights and protections \nthat workers have in the industrialized countries that are our main \ninternational competitors and trading partners. American workers should \nnot be second-class citizens in the industrial world of global \ncompetition.\n  The President's Executive order is only a small step in the right \ndirection. We ought to provide these protections against permanent \nreplacement workers for all Americans, but at a minimum, we should \nuphold President Clinton's action to provide these protections for \nthose employed by Federal contractors.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to commend my friend and colleague \nfrom Wisconsin for an excellent presentation. This presentation was, I \nthought, one of the most thoughtful and comprehensive reviews of the \nsignificance of the Kassebaum amendment and what its implications would \nbe in the real world.\n  We have heard a great deal of speeches about Executive orders, the \npower of the President, whether this Executive order was issued to \nbenefit a special interest. But I think the Senator has in a very \ncomprehensive and thoughtful way provided an insight about what is \nreally before the Senate in terms of the people of his State. I just \nwant to commend him and thank him for his thoughtfulness and for his \ninsight in analyzing this issue and for sharing with the Senate a \nsuperb presentation on what is a very, very important issue.\n  When this amendment was initially proposed, it was really what I \nwould call a seat-of-the-pants amendment. The President signed an \nExecutive order, and the ink was not even dry when there was an \namendment to try to undermine what the President was attempting to do.\n  I hope the American people have gained an insight into the human \ndimension of this debate. If they have, it is because of the \npresentation of the Senator from Wisconsin. I am very grateful to him \nfor his presentation and, most importantly, I think our colleagues will \nbe if they take the time to read and study this superb speech. I thank \nthe Senator.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would just like to thank the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and say he has truly been an inspiration on this \nissue and during this debate. Not only has he spent a lot of time out \nhere debating the amendment, trying to defeat it, but he has brought \npassion to the issue that it deserves.\n  It is an issue that should involve passion. It is an issue that \nshould involve condemnation and that should bring forth the human \nelement, which the Senator from Massachusetts has done so well.\n  I would just like to reiterate, this amendment is slowing down the \nprocess in the Senate. It is not helping us get our work done; it is \nhurting us getting our work done. We have no choice but to fight it \nbecause we believe it is off the point and it is fundamentally damaging \nto the very families that we have based our careers on and trying to \nfight for.\n  So it can be ended right away if this amendment is taken back. We can \nget back to the Department of Defense bill, but that is not the choice \nthat the majority has made.\n  I am eager to work with the majority on a number of issues, including \neven some that are in the Republican contract--some. But when it comes \nto this kind of conduct suggesting that Federal dollars should be used \nto break unions and break the families that are part of them, we will \nfight and we will resist such a harsh verdict for the American people.\n  So, again, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his kind \ncomments but, more importantly, for his strong leadership on this \nissue.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham).

The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank you. Those are procedural matters we \njust dealt with in order to clean up some business on the floor.\n  Quickly, before my colleague from Wisconsin leaves the floor, let me \njoin in the comments of my colleague from Massachusetts. I want to \ncommend Senator Feingold for a very, very thoughtful set of remarks \nregarding the cloture motion on the Kassebaum amendment. It is an \nhistorical perspective that is not something we do with great frequency \naround here, but it is always nice to have a sense of history as to why \nwe are in this particular debate and what has happened over the last \nnumber of decades that brought us to this particular debate when it \ncomes to the issue of permanent replacements for strikers.\n  I just think he has added immeasurably to the knowledge base of this \ndiscussion and debate, and I think if Members do read it, particularly \nthose who may be unclear in their own minds about whether or not we are \non the right track with insisting that this Executive order issued by \nthe President be given a chance to proceed, they will be enriched as a \nresult of reading his remarks. I commend him for them.\n  Mr. President, as well, I commend my colleague from Massachusetts \nwho, once again, is taking a very strong leadership position on a \nmatter that many of us care very, very strongly about, and I rise, as \nwell, today in opposition to the motion to invoke cloture on the \nKassebaum amendment.\n  Throughout much of the 20th century, economic growth broadly \nbenefited Americans of all income levels. We grew together and an \nexpanding economy meant better jobs for everyone.\n  I will point out, Mr. President, in reading some history of the early \npart of World War II the other evening, I was shocked--maybe we should \nnot be if we read a little more history--but shocked to discover that \nin 1940 in this country, which is not that long ago--there are many \npeople working today who were at work in 1940 in this country--one-half \nof all the adult males in the United States in 1940 had an annual \nincome of $1,000 a year; two-thirds of all working women outside the \nhome had an annual income of $1,000 a year; one-third of all the homes \nin this country roughly had no indoor plumbing to \n [[Page S3950]] speak of; almost 60 percent had no central heating. \nOnly 1 in 20 in this country went beyond high school. In fact, only one \nin four actually had a high school diploma in 1940. And of the adult 75 \nmillion people in this country at that time who were above the age of \n21, 2 in 5 only had eighth-grade educations.\n  That is not 100 years ago. It is within the living memory, the \nworking memory of many Americans. We have come a long way since the \nearly days of the 1940's and the outbreak of World War II. We were \nsuccessful over the years in generating and creating wealth; in raising \nthe living standards because of efforts made to see to it that people \ncould improve their educational opportunities, that they could improve \nworking conditions; in improving the ability of people to earn wages \nand salaries that would make it possible for them to buy homes and \neducate their children like no other generation has been able to do in \nthe past.\n We were reaching down to people who would have been stuck permanently \nin a status economically in this country with little or no hope of \nmoving up the income ladder. I think this country has benefited \ntremendously because of those efforts. In fact, it was one of those \nefforts that will be the subject, I gather, later this year of a \nsignificant debate here on the minimum wage, which has raised, if you \nwill, the tide that made it possible for the hopes of people who could \nnot otherwise dream of doing better to actually do better. And many of \nthe laws that we put in place to protect people on the job also \noccurred during those days.\n\n  So there is much to be proud of as Americans over the success that we \nhave made of our country in a generation and a half since the days of \nWorld War II and immediately thereafter. A typical family over these \npast number of decades could work hard and, year by year, build a \nbetter life, whether that meant buying a home or putting a child \nthrough college or taking a simple family vacation--things that were \nbeyond the reach of an awful lot of people in this country not that \nmany years ago.\n  But since 1979, Mr. President, the situation has changed \ndramatically, and I do not think most people are aware of this, except \nthose who may be caught in it themselves and wonder what has happened. \nThanks to rapid technological change, global competition and other \npolitical and economic factors, during this period from 1979 forward, \nthe American engine of economic growth has continued almost unabated. \nIn fact, during the last 15 years, real household income in the United \nStates grew by $767 billion.\n  Let me repeat that. In the last 15 years in this country, real \nhousehold income has grown by $767 billion--an incredible amount of \ngrowth. But, unlike the past, those gains have not been broadly shared. \nI am not engaging here in some sort of hypotheses or fiction. These are \nfacts. Ninety-seven percent of our real income growth--that $767 \nbillion--has gone to the top one-fifth of households incomewise in the \ncountry. The top 20 percent of households saw their real family incomes \nclimb by 18 percent during the last 15 years while people in the middle \n20 percent economically in this country actually suffered a 3-percent \ndecline in that income growth. And the poorest families, the poorest \none-fifth in this country, who previously had been the principal \nbeneficiaries of economic growth in the decades of the 1940's, the \n1950's, the 1960's, and up through the 1970's, saw between 1979 and \n1993 their incomes decline by a staggering 17 percent.\n  So the top one-fifth has gone up 18 percent, the middle 20 percent \nhas actually declined by 3 percent, and the bottom 20 percent, those \nworking families out there struggling to make ends meet, to hold their \nfamilies together, have seen their incomes decline by 17 percent in \nthat same period.\n  So here we have this staggering increase in growth overall, and yet \nwe can begin to appreciate, with that $767 billion of income growth, \nwhich part of our economy, what percentage of those in the economy have \nactually seen their lifestyles benefited the most.\n  The falling living standards of the vast majority of Americans \nshould, I think, be of grave concern to all of us regardless of party \nor political ideology or persuasion. This country has historically done \nbetter when those at the lower income levels have had the chance to \ngrow and become stronger, to be better consumers. We all benefit as a \nresult of that.\n  I believe the President and many of us here are committed to doing \nsomething about raising those standards of living. The President wants \nto raise incomes for ordinary Americans. I mentioned already the debate \nthat will ensue on the minimum wage law in this country in the coming \ndays. Unfortunately, there are those who seem to be trying to block \nevery effort to make a difference in this area. The minimum wage, we \nhave already heard people say, they will filibuster. The last \nPresident, to his great credit, who raised the minimum wage was George \nBush. It was a bipartisan effort. And here we are talking about 45 \ncents a year for 2 years, 90 cents, to a little over $5 an hour.\n  So the minimum wage says you make $8,500 a year in America. That is \nalmost $4,000 less than the poverty level in this country for a family \nof three. How are we ever going to induce people on welfare to go to \nwork when you start out with a minimum wage level that leaves you \n$4,000 less than the poverty level in this country?\n  If we are going to reward work, we are going to have do a bit better, \nit seems to me, than suggesting we cannot increase the minimum wage.\n  Summer job programs. Here we are talking about 600,000 summer jobs \nfor kids in our inner cities. The Presiding Officer comes from \nMichigan. In the city of Detroit, and my city of Hartford, we have a \nlot of inner-city children who can get into a lot of trouble in the \nsummer. Here is a chance--we have seen the benefit of it--to put these \nyoung people to work, and yet we are being told that the summer job \nprogram should be eliminated. We are also hearing no to job training, \nno to education, no to child care.\n  Again, I come back to the issue of trying to get people off welfare \nand reward work. Two-thirds of all families on welfare have at least \none child of preschool age today. How are we going to convince those \npeople to get off public assistance if we do not have an adequate child \ncare system in this country? But our colleagues say no to that as well.\n  So you begin to see a pattern here that develops. It is no to \neverything except one thing. And that is that we are now going to \nprovide, apparently, a significant tax break to that top 20 percent who \nare earning incomes in excess of $100,000 or more a year. The top 1 \npercent will get the kind of tax break that is being advocated in areas \nlike capital gains.\n  I am not making this up. Before too long, the House of \nRepresentatives will try to cut $17 billion out of hot lunch programs, \nnutrition programs, drug free schools, higher education, a long list--\n$17 billion. Where did it go? Was it for deficit reduction? Oh, no. It \nwas for the tax cuts, despite all of the great debate and a lot of heat \naround here about deficit reduction. We had an extensive debate about \ndeficit reduction. But where does the first $17 billion in spending \ncuts go? It goes for a tax cut for those people who, as I said already, \ndid the best in the last 15 years economically in the country.\n  In short, Mr. President, the message from the other side seems to be \nto working Americans: Tough luck; you are on your own.\n  And by blocking this Executive order on permanent replacement \nworkers, the Kassebaum amendment would tell ordinary Americans that \nafter years of losing ground on pay and benefits, they could lose their \njobs, as well, solely for exercising their fundamental right to strike.\n  Let me talk about this point, because this is a serious one, and it \ngoes to the sense of balance we should have in labor relations. \nManagement has the power of salaries and wages which it offers to \npeople. Labor has their work. That is what they have.\n  That is the balance here. And we have struck this balance \nhistorically between management and labor where labor, working people, \nsay I will withhold my labor if we cannot strike an agreement on \nworking conditions, wages, salaries. Management says we will not pay if \nwe cannot strike a bargain.\n  So both sides have had some leverage, that is, working people say \nthey \n [[Page S3951]] will not work; they will go on strike. Management says \nwe will not pay you.\n  And that has been the tension that has kept the process moving \nforward. Both sides have something to withhold.\n  What has happened lately is that management has said, look, we are \ngoing to take away the one thing working people have, that is, the \nright to strike, because we are going to hire permanent replacements. \nYou go out on strike; we hire permanent replacements to fill your job.\n  The equation gets destroyed, in effect. If working people are told \nthat withholding their labor no longer can be a factor or used as \nleverage, then how do you get to collective bargaining? How do you \nachieve the balance that has brought us the kind of working conditions \nand improvement in our plant floors that we have seen over the years?\n  What we are suggesting here is that, at least in the area of Federal \ncontracts for employers who engage in this practice--that is to \npermanently replace people who are out on strike--we are saying if you \nare that kind of employer and you have Federal contracts, we are going \nto stop giving you contracts because we do not think what you are doing \nis right. It is not right for you to say to your striking employees, we \nare sorry, but we are going to hire permanent people to take your jobs.\n  I do not know anybody who thinks that is fair. It is one thing to \nsay, look, you go out on strike, you do not get paid. You do not get \nwork.\n  Here is a pressure then on working people and labor to come to that \ntable. Obviously, if the management is not producing their widgets, \ntheir products, then there is pressure on management to get back to the \ntable. But if you take away the major leverage point that working \npeople have, that is, what they produce with their hands or otherwise, \nthen you destroy that equation.\n  All we are trying to do here is to see to it that with those who get \nFederal contracts, that equation not be destroyed. We might even give \nit a chance to see what it does. It might improve the situation out \nthere so we would not be asked all the time to get involved in strikes \nand negotiations where the Federal Government gets drawn into these \nprocesses.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that we might even give this a chance, this \nExecutive order that has been issued by the President--to his credit, I \nwould add--for dealing with the issue of permanently replaced striking \nworkers, and see how it goes for awhile instead of denying this \nexperiment, because we are obviously not going to pass a bill that \nwould ban it all across the board.\n  The President has exercised his Executive powers, which he has the \nright to do. Why not wait a few years and see how this works instead of \ntrying to destroy this idea and attempt to test whether or not the \nsituation might improve?\n  So, again, I commend our colleague from Massachusetts for taking a \nleadership role on this. I hope our colleagues who have been supporting \nthe effort to not invoke cloture will continue to do so, or that those \nwho have been trying to invoke cloture would let us move on to other \nmatters because many of us here feel very, very strongly about this. I \nthink it would be a tragic day, indeed, to not give this a chance to \nwork.\n  It has been tough enough on working people over the last 15 years, \nwatching their wages and salaries remain stagnant or decline, as I have \nalready pointed out. Now they have their jobs in jeopardy by hiring \npermanent replacements when they exercise their right--this is a right \nwe are talking about--the right to strike. It is a right. It is not a \nprivilege; it is a right. When you come in and hire permanent \nreplacements and destroy people's ability to exercise their rights, it \nis a setback for all of us.\n  So I hope we will be able to continue to muster the votes necessary \nor, better yet, I hope we'll drop this amendment. Let the President's \nExecutive order go into place. Let us see what happens over the next \nfew years. We will come back and revisit this issue--we can at any \ntime--and let us move on to the other important matters that are before \nus.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be glad to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank my friend and colleague from Connecticut for \nreally a splendid presentation. I hope our colleagues will pay \nparticular attention to the comments of the Senator from Connecticut as \nthey relate to how this proposal really impacts children. The Senator \nfrom Connecticut has been the chairman of the Children's Caucus and has \nreally been the leader in this body, now and in the past, for the day \ncare programs that we have as well as for family and medical leave and \nother very important programs.\n  One of the points we have been emphasizing over the course of this \ndebate are the different concerns of the two parties. The Senate has \njust debated the unfunded mandates and the balanced budget, and the \nfirst issue we debate is an Executive order which makes more sure the \neconomic security of working families. When the President issues an \nExecutive order, the ink is not even dry on it when an amendment is put \nin which is going to diminish the economic interests and power of \nworking families.\n  When we talk about the working families and the workers who are being \npermanently replaced, as the Senator knows, we are talking about people \nwho are making $5, $6, $7, $8 an hour. Some maybe make $6 an hour and \ntrying to get to that 7th dollar. To be a parent with two or three \nchildren making those kind of wages and then to be permanently replaced \nis a terrible thing.\n  I know the Senator is concerned as he looks back over the period of \nthe past years and sees what has happened to real family income over \nthe period from 1980 to 1993 and he takes into account that total real \nfamily income includes the income of the many mothers who have entered \nthe work force. What you see is that families with small children have \nnot even stayed even but are falling behind. And then look at who gains \nunder the Republican contract? Just take a look at the most obvious \nparts of that contract which the Ways and Means Committee took up \nyesterday--the capital gains tax and the elimination of the minimum tax \nfor corporations. Who gains? Who are the individuals benefitting from \nthese proposals? Again, large corporations and the wealthy are the \nblock benefitting from these contract proposals.\n  I ask whether the Senator is concerned not only about the impact on \nthe workers who are being replaced but also on the impact on children. \nBecause this is not the only proposal being made. There is a proposal \nto cut back on child care, cut back on the school nutrition programs, \ncut back on the WIC programs, cut back on lead paint poisoning to try \nto help parents who are trying to do something about lead paint \npoisoning and who are trying to stop the ingestion of lead paint by \nchildren. The Carnegie Commission report of several months ago talks \nabout the importance of giving nutrition to children from 1 to 3 so \nthey can develop and be able to develop cognitive skills, learning \nskills, so they can take an active part in learning--does the Senator \nbelieve this amendment will also impose a heavy burden on children in \nour country and that this is something that ought to be addressed as \nwell?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Massachusetts \nfor his question. I think it is instructive to note the chart here as I \nam looking at it on my left. That points out what happened to incomes, \nreal family incomes, between 1979 and 1993. I will come directly to the \nSenator's point regarding children right now.\n  But I think it is worthwhile for people to know that the sense of \nfrustration people feel in a lot of working families in this country, \nwondering what is happening to them, is entirely justified. It is \nworthwhile to note in the economy of the Nation, household income grew \nat an incredible rate, $767 billion of family household income growth \nin that 15-year period. There was a staggering amount of growth. But 97 \npercent of that growth in the last 15 years grew in the top 20 percent \nof income earners in the United States.\n  I was trying to point out earlier that in the decades of the 1940's, \n1950's, 1960's and 1970's, the distribution of income growth was fairly \nlevel. That is, \n [[Page S3952]] all income groups did roughly the same and the country \ngot stronger as a result of it. It has only been in this last 15 years \nthat we have found unprecedented growth of our country and yet the \ngrowth has been pretty much locked in to the top 20 percent--97 percent \nof the $767 billion has been concentrated in the top 20 percent.\n  The middle 20 percent actually saw their household incomes decline by \n3 percent in the midst of this unprecedented growth. That middle 20 \npercent found themselves losing ground.\n  And the lower 20 percent saw their household incomes decline by 17 or \n18 percent, a tremendous drop, in the midst of great growth.\n  Now we are confronted with a situation where people lose their jobs. \nHow does it affect children? I asked, back this fall, for the General \nAccounting Office to give me an update of how many children of working \nfamilies are covered by health insurance, a subject very near and dear \nto the heart of the Senator from Massachusetts. We got the numbers back \nyesterday. Let me just share some numbers with my colleague.\n  Mr. President, 89 percent of uninsured children have at least one \nworking parent, and 61 percent have a parent working full time for a \nfull year. So even in these working families, the basic necessity of \nhealth insurance for these young children is being lost. Add to that \nthe economic difficulty of a job lost to these children because their \nparents have exercised a right to strike, then you begin to see that \nthe problem becomes even greater.\n  It is tough enough as it is right now for these kids. My Lord, you \ntalk about a child starting out life without having basic health care, \nwhat are the implications to that child learning and being a productive \ncitizen in their adulthood? Again, I am not stating anything that most \nof our colleagues are unaware of here. The data and information are \noverwhelming. A child that does not begin life with the proper \nnutrition and immunizations does not learn right. The child that does \nnot learn right from the beginning drops out of school, does not get \nthe kind of job he or she needs. The problem explodes down the road.\n  When you are talking about the economy here and how it affects \nchildren, the Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely proper and right \nto raise the issue.\n  We talked about adults and their jobs. But it is these kids who are \nthe ones who pay an awful price. And it is that bottom 20 percent who \nreally do not get a golden parachute. You lose your job on a factory \nfloor; you may get a month or 6 weeks, if you are lucky, of paycheck. \nAfter that it is over with. We all know what happens to you if you are \ntop management and you lose your job in this country. You get taken \ncare of for life and two or three generations do pretty well in your \nfamily because they have worked out the deal. God help you if you are a \nworking person out there every day trying to hold body and soul \ntogether and raise a family and do so on your own and not be dependent \nupon anybody else. You lose that job and the bottom falls out from \nunder you. There is no golden parachute for you whatsoever.\n  So we are talking about here a basic right to protect your family and \nto negotiate through the normal processes of wages and benefits. When \nyou strip that away, then you make the situation of these families that \nmuch more difficult for them to cope with.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This is really a point that I think needs underlining. \nThere are those who are supporting this amendment that say, ``Look, I \ndo not know why there is a discussion about what is happening to \nworking families. All we are talking about is a narrow, little \nExecutive order.''\n  Would the Senator not agree with me that those that are in lockstep \nin support of that proposal would have more credibility if they were \nout here on the floor of the U.S. Senate today saying we will join you \nin passing a resolution to increase the minimum wage? For example, \nwouldn't this proposal have more credibility if its proponents also \nsupported the same increase in the minimum wage that was signed by a \nRepublican President in 1990 of 45 cents? That 45-cent increase in \nminimum wage has lost its purchasing power. When we had Democratic \nCongresses and a Republican President, we were able to get together and \npass that. Now we have a Republican Congress and a Democratic President \nwho wants to do that. If they were out here saying we are really for \nthose working families, we want to reward them, we are here to help \nminimum wage families, we are out here to help children and the sons \nand daughters of working families go on to school, but we are bothered \nby this Executive order, I daresay there might be a greater sense of \nbelief on our part that this is not just a further attempt to diminish \nthe real purchasing power of working families.\n  I want to mention one thing to the Senator. We had a forum last \nFriday of those who are concerned about the increase in the minimum \nwage. And we had a young couple, David Dow and his wife. Both of them \neffectively make the minimum wage. Both of them work hard. They want to \ngo to school. They have a child. And as is typical, both have to go out \nand work, effectively at minimum wage. Mr. Dow has glasses. His young \ndaughter used to get his glasses in the early morning when he woke up \nfor his job and give them to him. One morning he woke up and he said, \n``Where are my glasses?'' And she walked in and pointed into the \ntoilet. She had dropped them down there. It would be humorous if it \nwere not so sad and tragic. He has now been without those glasses for 3 \nmonths putting aside $5, $6, $7 in order to try to build a kitty to be \nable to purchase some replacement glasses.\n  The point is that this family believes that it is not only important \nto work and had a desire to work to provide for themselves and their \nwonderful young daughter, but the fact of the matter is both of them \nare working two jobs. They have 45 minutes every Saturday and 30 \nminutes on Sunday to spend time with that child; an hour and a half. \nWhat Member of the Senate would tolerate that policy? An hour and a \nhalf to spend with a child, and how do we expect that child to develop? \nLet alone the kinds of additional pressures these parents have--the \ntoys that are not bought, the fact that the child cannot go to visit \nanother child for her birthday party because she will not be able to \nbring a toy. All of these other issues aside, how can the time spent \nbetween a parent and a child, be denied? These are not people, as the \nSenator pointed out, that are not playing by the rules. These are \npeople that want to work, honor work, have a pride in work, want to go \nto school, are trying to go to school. This one person is paying back \n$80 a month with the money he makes in the minimum wage to pay for his \nschool loan because he wants to keep ahead so he can go back to school. \nBut he just wonders when that tide is going to take over, when it is \ngoing to push him under.\n  That is what we are talking about in terms of the Senator from \nConnecticut, the Senator from Wisconsin, and others who talked about \nthis measure and where we are as an institution and what is happening \nto people. That is what this measure is about.\n  I was interested in whether the Senator, as someone who has spent \ntime working with children, wonders if this is not something more than \nan economic issue, not something more than just a bottom line of \ndollars and cents. That is important, but I am always impressed by the \namount of time we spend on trying to understand the cost of so many \nthings and the value of so little around this institution. Aren't we \ntalking about providing these people who have become parents through a \nwonderful act of God and who have a wonderful opportunity as parents to \nlove and adore their children, with a real opportunity to spend time \nwith their children? Don't we have some responsibility to make sure \nthat we are going to be attendant to their needs to care for their \nchildren?\n  Mr. DODD. I will conclude, Mr. President, by saying I think the \nSenator put it well by saying some people talk about the price of \neverything and the value of nothing. We can argue the numbers. Maybe we \nshould not always talk numbers because I guess people's eyes glaze over \nif you start talking about the size of the economy, the percentages of \ngroups of people that lose or gain in all of this. But it is not any \ngreat leap of knowledge to know what \n [[Page S3953]] happens when you lose your job or are gripped by the \nfear of losing your job.\n  Most people in this country do not wake up in the morning wondering \nwhether or not they are a Democrat or a Republican or conservative or \nliberal or who is winning or losing in Washington. Many families get up \nin the morning and there is a knot in their stomach because they do not \nknow whether or not at the end of that day that job is going to be \nthere. If that job is not there, how do you keep up the rent payments \nor the mortgage? How do you take care of those kids and their \neducational opportunities? If you have a parent that is living with you \nor down the street, you worry about what will happen if they get sick. \nHow do you make the choice between the child and your parent who may \nneed the money or the mortgage on the house or the car payment? That is \nwhat most people think about every day. That is what they think about.\n  They just like to know that occasionally somebody stands up for them \nbecause they do not have political action committees. They are not \nheavyweights who are in Washington. But they would like to think that \nsomebody might stand up and say, ``If I fight for a better wage or \nfight for a better salary or fight for better working conditions so \nthat my family might do a bit better''--somebody might stand up and \nsay, ``I have a right to do that.'' They look around and they see that \npeople do not seem to care about it at all. When they lose everything \nand they look in those children's eyes at night and wonder how they are \ngoing to put food on the table or provide for them down the road with \ntheir educational desires knowing full well how important it is, what \nis the price of that? I cannot tell you--$10, $20, $1,000, $10,000? \nThat really is not the issue so much. It is about dreaming. It is about \naspirations. It is about hope. That is what most people do. They dream \nfor their families. They try to plan. They save. They think about how \nthey might make it possible for their kids to do better than they have \ndone.\n  So what we talk about with this issue here in many ways is pulling \nthe rug out from under people and pulling the rug out from under these \nfamilies who really make up the glue that holds this society together. \nThese are the people who vote. These are the people who fight the wars. \nThese are the people who pay the taxes. This is the working crowd in \nAmerica. They believe in this country. It is a pretty depressing sight \nto see that when their right to fight for themselves and to fight for \ntheir concerns or wages or salaries, that that basic right is going to \nbe denied them; that someone can be hired permanently to replace them \nif, God forbid, they stand up to defend themselves and their families \nand their children. That is basically what this is about. You do not \nhave that right any longer. You can stand up and fight but you can get \nthrown out of a job tomorrow. You are gone, and ``We will hire somebody \nelse. Let me warn you. When we hire you as a new person, you had better \nnot try it either. God forbid if you try to defend your family. We will \ndo the same thing to you that we did to that person.''\n  That is what this is about. It is that simple: Should people have the \nright to be able to protect themselves and protect their families? They \nare not asking the Government to come in and wage the battle for them. \nGood management-labor negotiations have produced fairness in this \ncountry. What the Senator from Massachusetts is talking about is how \ndoes it affect these children? I do not know, I suppose we can search \nout the actuaries and others to come up with the numbers.\n  But I know that it gets impossible for those parents to provide for \nthose children, to give them much hope when their basic rights to \ndefend themselves and their rights in the workplace are gone. I hope my \ncolleagues will think long and hard about this. This issue may go away. \nMaybe the votes will be there to defeat us, and they think it will \ndisappear. It is not going to go away. It is going to come back over \nand over again because peoples' rights ought not to be denied when they \nare trying to protect themselves.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I am happy to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I did not come over to speak to this issue, but listening \nto my colleagues, with whom I agree with on this issue, I was struck by \nhow much things have changed since I arrived here in the Senate in \n1973. Back in 1973, which is not that long ago--I guess my kids think \nit is 100 years ago, but it is not that long ago. It is not like \nlistening to my Grandfather Finnegan telling me about strikes in the \n1920's and that kind of thing. It was the beginning, looking back on \nit, of sort of the end, if not the demise, of the balancing power of \nAmerican organized labor in the country, where they were able to be \nmajor players in determining wages, hours, working conditions, their \ninput on the economy, and which direction the economy could go.\n  Over the last 23 years, something interesting has happened. If this \ndebate were taking place in 1973, you would have some of our Republican \ncolleagues standing up--and maybe even a few Democrats standing up--and \nsaying, you know, the problem is that organized labor has become too \npowerful; organized labor is fat; organized labor is resting on its \nlaurels; organized labor is not productive, and all of the list of \nhorribles we used to hear. I find it kind of interesting in this debate \nthat nobody who opposes our position--which is that you should not be \nable to replace people who are legitimately striking under the law--to \nmaintain, not to gain but maintain, where they are. Nobody is making \nthe argument we used to hear about how powerful and bullying the \nAmerican labor movement is. Nobody is even making the argument that we \nused to always hear about how this is so unfair to business. What \nhappened to them?\n  When I attend chamber of commerce dinners in my home State--a \ncorporate State, and I suspect the same is true in Massachusetts and \nConnecticut--I do not hear businessmen complaining about organized \nlabor; because, in effect, organized labor has already given at the \noffice, already gotten the living devil kicked out of them. Without \nmaking a judgment that I think is unfair, the point is that this is \nlike beating up on a kid now. Organized labor now frequently gets put \nin the position where, because of horrible management practices over \nrecent decades, they are told that, by the way, if you do not make the \nfollowing concessions, we are going to shut down. We are just going to \nclose the company.\n  So organized labor is scared to death; the workers are scared to \ndeath. And they give much more than management gives in terms of \nconcessions to keep a lot of these outfits open and running. And now \nthey have gotten to the point where what happens--and it rarely \nhappens--is that when they are truly being abused and when there is no \nserious good faith collective bargaining going on, they decide they \nhave nothing left to do but go out on strike. And now some in American \nbusiness are saying, we are about to strip you of the last bit of \nleverage you have. If you go out on strike, we are going to replace \nyou. And thus union members are deterred because of what the Senator \nfrom Connecticut said: Fear.\n  People are scared to death. They are scared to death to exercise what \nthey believe to be even their legitimate rights. Even when they are \nbeing maltreated, they do not go on strike because they are afraid of \nthe alternative because of the nature of the economy, the downsizing of \nAmerican corporations, the way things are; the whole world is turning \nupside down. I find it interesting that on this issue, which you would \nthink would be so basic, this is not even taking place in an \nenvironment where anybody is legitimately making the argument that \nthese people who are going on strike are doing it because they are \ngreedy and trying to take over a company, or because they are trying to \nput somebody under. You do not even hear that argument. When these \npeople go on strike--I think this is an interesting point people should \nremember--it is desperation. It is not deciding whether they want to go \non strike to get a better wage to be able to have a second car and a \ntrailer and a vacation at the beach. That is the argument we heard in \nthe 1960s and 1970s. They are going on strike now because they say, \nhey, wait a minute, I have given at the office; I have been giving at \nthe office for the last 15 years. I have already had my standard of \nliving lowered and now you are telling me \n [[Page S3954]] again that I cannot even maintain where I am. I do not \nthink it is fair, you are not treating me fairly, and I am going on \nstrike, which I am allowed to do under the law.\n  It amazes me why we are even having this fight. When is the last time \nany of the people in this Chamber picked up a paper and read about how \nunions and organized labor have taken such horrible advantage of \npeople? All they have done for the last 10 to 12 years is given \nconcessions and increased their productivity. And now, we have reached \nthe point that--to steal a phrase from Mr. Stockman, who commented on \nthe Reagan tax policy--these folks are like pigs in a trough now. They \nnot only want them to continue to give at the office, but they want to \ntake away the last thing they have under the law. I, quite frankly, did \nnot ever think this would be a debate we would be having on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate.\n  Again, look at all the strikes that are taking place nationwide. Look \nat the effects of the strikes taking place nationwide. Look at what is \nbeing requested by those strikes that are taking place nationwide. I \nwill lay you 8 to 5 that 85 percent of the people would say what is \nbeing asked is reasonable. They may or may not agree, but it is \nreasonable.\n  No one is even making the claims anymore, I say to my friend from \nMassachusetts, that this is some muscle-bound organized labor, who is \njust out there ripping off everyone and intimidating companies. This is \njust people who are just trying to be in a position where they can--to \nuse the expression of my friend from Massachusetts--``keep their heads \nabove the water.'' And now they are being told they do not even have a \nright. What prompted me to say all this was the word used by the \nSenator from Connecticut: Fear. Can you imagine the fear and \nintimidation of an individual who, in today's circumstances, thinking \nthat after roughly 60 years of practice under the NLRB, they are going \nto be put in the position if they even stand up and try to stop further \nerosion, that the alternative for them in an environment where there \nare no other jobs is that they lose their job permanently? That is \nsimply not fair.\n  Our former colleague from California, the present Governor of \nCalifornia, ran an ad I remember seeing. He was talking about \nimmigration, but I will take the words he used and apply it here, \nbecause I disagreed with his view on immigration. He said something \nlike this: Some people are playing by the rules. They are doing it the \nAmerican way. Other people are not playing by the rules and they are \nbeing rewarded for it. That is not the American way.\n  Striker replacement in circumstances where there is no evidence that \nthere has been a violation of the labor laws is not the American way.\n  It is a reflection of greed, the greed and avarice of those who want \nto make a fundamental change that working women and men are put into \ntheir proper place, from their perspective. I think it is, quite \nfrankly, outrageous.\n  The Senator said, ``Who is going to stand up and fight for them?'' \nWell, I know of no two people who have been better champions of their \ncause in making sure they are never left unspoken for than the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and the Senator from Connecticut, and I compliment \nthem.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for his \ncomments and for his historical perspective. I think the Senator has, \nin his brief but I think pointed comments, reflected what this issue \nand what this battle is really all about. In the last day or so, as we \nfocused on it, there have been those who say, We do not understand why \nwe are talking about these broader themes of equity, about fear, about \nthe real America. This is really just an Executive order.\n  The Senator has stated very clearly and effectively what really is at \nissue on the floor of the U.S. Senate and why this battle is so \nimportant. I thank the Senator for his statement and for his excellent \nsupport for working families, which has been a trademark of his career \nin the Senate.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to go \ninto morning business for the purposes of discussing an issue totally \nunrelated to this, the introduction of a bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN.

Mr. President, before I get into the issue that my \ncolleague, Senator Kennedy, and others have addressed for the past few \nlegislative days, I felt it is important to discuss briefly the \ndisasters that have hit my State of California. I will tell you that \none wonders when we are going to stop seeing these floods and these \nearthquakes, fires, and droughts. It seems as if our State is for some \nreason just getting much more than its share of these natural \ndisasters. But it was interesting today that the Senate task force \npresented its report on disaster funding. I am a member of that task \nforce, and we have been working hard to come up with some solutions as \nto how are we going to deal with these future disasters.\n  I want to say that the President moved very quickly to declare 39 \ncounties disaster areas eligible for both individual and family \nemergency grants, and for infrastructure repairs. Federal Emergency \nManagement Director James Lee Witt once again has proved that he is \nsomeone who wants to cut through the redtape that used to accompany \nFEMA wherever it went in this country. The President sent him out along \nwith Acting Agriculture Secretary Rominger, and with Leon Panetta, the \nChief of Staff who is so familiar with California. They saw for \nthemselves the damage that we are facing.\n  I have to say that when Leon Panetta saw Monterey County, which he \nrepresented in Congress for many years, I am sure his heart stopped for \na minute because so much damage greeted him. We have infrastructure \nproblems there. We have communities shut off. We have crop damage to \nfruits and vegetables which is going to cause a lot of financial harm \nto the farmers. But also we are going to feel it in our pocketbooks--as \nconsumers when we go to the stores.\n  We have already seen 2,900 applications for assistance from the \nstorms that started on January 3. That was the first one, and then we \nhad the one February 10. Those resulted in 90,000 applications for \nassistance. More than $51 million in emergency housing assistance \nchecks have been mailed for the first disaster. In addition, $40 \nmillion in Small Business Administration loans have been approved for \n2,000 people for losses to homes and businesses.\n  I cannot count how many times I have stood in this U.S. Senate and in \nthe House telling my colleagues about these disasters. It just does not \nget any easier.\n  Interstate 5, a major north-south economic artery in the West, is \nstill closed. I think many people saw the tragic photographs of cars \nthat plunged into the waters and were swept away when a bridge failed. \nAnd we are trying very hard to get a temporary bridge constructed \nthere.\n  We are looking at crop losses of about $300 million or more. This \nstorm was very, very harsh on the crops. I talked about the fruits and \nvegetables. To be specific, the severe losses are lettuce, broccoli, \ncauliflower, almonds, and strawberries. California is the salad bowl of \nour Nation, and we got hit very, very hard. We have had damage to \nvineyards of $11.5 million. I have spoken to local elected officials in \nMonterey County, in Napa County, throughout the southern California \nregion, and the Los Angeles area.\n   [[Page S3955]] I have told them that we are going to do everything \nwe can here. We will be getting an emergency supplemental to deal with \nthis problem. We are working now on a defense emergency supplemental \nbill. But unfortunately--and I say this really from the heart--the \nHouse has chosen to use this needed emergency spending to relieve the \nsuffering of the people in California, and I might add, other States \nwho are recovering from other disasters, to rush through a $17 billion \nbudget cut, rescissions of $17 billion, onto a bill that is about a $6 \nbillion emergency relief bill.\n  I want to tell you that I intend to fight that bill, and I am not \ngoing to go into too many of the details other than to say that it \nwipes out many important programs, including summer youth job programs. \nIt is very interesting, because today I received a letter from the Los \nAngeles Board of Supervisors and they have a lot of damage, of course, \nleft over from the earthquake, and yet they are saying we should oppose \nthat rescissions bill. They wrote to House Speaker Gingrich and House \nMajority Leader Armey, and the county supervisors basically say that \nthis bill, which would fund the disaster relief, but also offset it \nwith very devastating cuts, is not the way to go.\n  People used to complain that we would load down these emergency bills \nwith extraneous spending items, and that was true, and we stopped doing \nit. Why should we see it loaded down with rescissions of programs that \nare so very important? For example, on the one hand, the House says, \nCalifornia, we know you need money to rebuild. Yet, they cut emergency \nhighway funding in the same bill, which could well be used to repair \nfreeways and to make them safe from future earthquakes.\n  So I am very hopeful that when this bill gets into the U.S. Senate, \nwe will look at it a little differently here. I am often reminded about \nwhat our Founders said about the U.S. Senate, that we act like the \n``saucer'' and the House is the ``cup.'' When the legislation comes \nover here, it cools down and people get a chance to look at it. This is \ncertainly one that we have to look at.\n  Well, I will say, Mr. President, we need disaster reform. We do not \nhave the perfect way to pay for disasters, that is for sure. I am \nworking with my colleagues, really, from all over the country. This is \na bipartisan task force that was set up here. Senators Bond and Glenn \nhead it up, and I am on that task force. We are going to look at all of \nthe ways we can to prepare here for the next disaster, to make sure \nthat we can meet the needs of our people when our people cry out after \nan earthquake, flood, fire, or volcano, wherever that might be. And \nduring the debate on the balanced budget amendment, I remember bringing \nto the floor photographs of disasters from all over the country, and \ntruly there is not a place in America that is immune from a flood or \nsome natural disaster that could lead to an emergency.\n  So, Mr. President, that concludes my remarks on the update on the \ndisaster.\n  (Mr. THOMPSON assumed the chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/15/senate-section/article/S3954-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3955-S3961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND RESCISSIONS ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. At this time, I will speak about the business before us. \nI think some very important issues have been raised in this debate. I \noften try to put myself in the position of an average American turning \non the television set, looking at the U.S. Senate, and seeing a Senator \nspeak from either side of the aisle and wondering why is a Senator \nspeaking about this issue or that issue, when on the schedule it says \nwe are taking up a defense emergency supplemental bill.\n  In fact, that is what we are doing. We have been asked by the \nPentagon to meet their needs because they are engaged in some foreign \noperations for which they did not have a budget, and for which there \nwere costs that they need to be reimbursed for. So in the middle of \nthis debate that we are having on this very important defense emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill, there is an amendment offered which \nhas absolutely nothing to do with the bill before us, not even in the \nmost remote sense of the word.\n  I try to make some type of connection between the amendment that is \npending and the bill that is pending, too. And unless I am missing \nsomething, I cannot see a connection, because the bill is about \nreimbursing the Pentagon for items that were needed for this country to \nengage in military or peacekeeping assignments. And the Kassebaum \namendment before us, which has been before us for days now, deals with \na worker issue, a workplace fairness issue, an Executive order that has \nto do with replacing legally striking workers. It has nothing to do \nwith the military emergency supplemental bill.\n  I heard Senator Feingold make this point, and I think it is worth \nrepeating. It is interesting that the Republicans are in charge of this \nbill; they brought it out of the committee, and now they are amending \nit with a very controversial amendment which has nothing to do with the \nbill. They are slowing down their own bill.\n  One has to ask oneself why this would be. I have looked at that, \nalso. I tried to look at the merits of it. They said, well, the \nPresident signed this Executive order and he now says that the \nGovernment should not do business with companies that permanently \nreplace legally striking workers. The President said that. And so the \nargument is that he has no right to do that; he is trampling on the \nrights of the Congress. Yet, as you go back in history--and I will \nbring this out later--I never heard one Republican come to the Senate \nfloor and complain that President Bush was overstepping his bounds when \nhe made similar moves. So that is not an issue here.\n  So I come down to this: I think it is a way to slap working people, \nto put them in their place, to tell them that they do not have rights. \nAnd I think that is very sad. I do not see how--and I try \nintellectually to be fair about this--you can look a worker in the eye, \nwhether it is a nurse or whether it is a construction worker, whether \nit is someone whose fingernails are dirty or clean, and say to that \nworker: You, my friend, have a right to strike; you, my friend, have a \nright under the laws of the United States of America to withhold your \nlabor if you feel you are being treated unfairly. That is your ultimate \nhuman right. How could you look that worker in the eye, male or female, \nyoung or old, rich or poor, and say to that worker: You have the right \nto strike; and yet, in the same breath say: However, if you go out on \nstrike, your boss can permanently replace you, even if you are out on \nstrike legally and you have done everything right and you want to \nnegotiate.\n  This is a very simple issue. You do not have the right to strike if \nyou know the minute you step out the door you do not have a job.\n  What really interests me is that during the heyday of the Soviet \nUnion, when we were all so excited about the fact that the Wall could \ncome down, the Soviet Union would break up, and countries like Poland \ncould be free at last, Republicans embraced the union movement in \nPoland called Solidarity.\n  I will never forget it. Lech Walesa came here. Republicans and \nDemocrats alike said, ``Solidarity. Show your strength. Stand up \nagainst the Communists. We support you. You are right. The Communists \nare not treating you fairly. They are treating you brutally.''\n  Everyone embraced Lech Walesa and everyone invited him to speak. \nRepublicans and Democrats here in America, we were united for \nSolidarity.\n  But, wait a minute. What happened? What happens in our own country \nwhen workers asked for that same dignity in this Nation? You get \namendments like this one, amendments like this one that are so hurtful \nto people who believe they have a right to strike, to people who want \nto work but who want to know that they have that ultimate leverage.\n  I wish to compliment the President, because he looked at this issue \nand he knew that for many years we had a majority in this U.S. Senate \nwhich would have outlawed the permanent replacement of these striking \nworkers. We did not have 60 votes, so we fell victim to filibuster.\n  He knew he had the ability to do something about this. And the \nRepublicans do not like it. But he did it. He signed an Executive \norder. Guess what? \n [[Page S3956]] We have a President. He has the ability to take some \nsteps on his own.\n  My goodness, we have Republicans here who want to give him so much \nline-item veto power that it is too much for this U.S. Senator. I do \nnot want to give the President too much power. But the President has a \nright to issue an Executive order like this one.\n  The Kassebaum amendment would say the President does not have this \nright, this very simple Executive order that says that we cannot \ncontract with companies who fire legally striking workers. The \nKassebaum amendment would wipe out that Executive order.\n  I will tell you what I hope. I hope, if that survives this bill and \nit is attached to this bill, I hope the President vetoes this bill, \nbecause I think that working people in America today need to know that \nthey get some respect, that you do not have to be a striking worker in \nPoland and belong to Solidarity before you get respect from the \nGovernment of the United States of America.\n  The President, as head of the executive branch agencies, is well \nwithin his right to issue this order.\n  I said before, I never heard one Republican complain when George Bush \nissued his Executive order which required all unionized Federal \ncontractors to post a notice in their workplace informing all employees \nthat they could not be required to join a union. George Bush made sure \nthat that kind of language was posted. The order says workers had a \nright to refuse to pay dues for any purpose unrelated to collective \nbargaining. I did not hear any Republican Senator complain that the \nPresident had overstepped his authority.\n  Oh, but now President Clinton stands up for workers and all you hear \nis complaints about it and we are going to stop him.\n  Well, I hope we do not succeed in overturning that Executive order, \nbecause I think working people are getting the shaft.\n  And why do I say that? Common sense. I am not a labor lawyer, but I \nhave common sense. If somebody says to me, ``You have a right to \nstrike, but the minute you walk out the door someone is going to \npermanently replace you and you are out, no health insurance, no \nbenefits, no nothing,'' I do not have a right to strike at all. It is \njust a paper right.\n  President Clinton understands this and he is showing leadership. The \nRepublicans around here do not like it, so they put up the Kassebaum \namendment. They slow down their own bill to slap working people.\n  There is a lot of talk in this country that people are insecure about \nthis economy. In California, there is a lot of talk about affirmative \naction. And they are saying, ``Well, this is the reason that people are \nhaving trouble getting jobs, affirmative action.''\n  Well, let me tell you, if you look at the facts, you will find that \nis not so; that what is hurting the working person today is the fact \nthat we do not see any policies coming out of this Congress that are \ngoing to help them.\n  Let me tell you, you read the contract for America or with America or \non America. I think it the Contract With America, the Republican \nContract With America. You read every line of that contract and you \nshow me one place in that contract where there is one thing said about \njobs, where there is one thing said about the rights of working people, \nwhere there is one thing said about increasing a minimum wage that is \nat a 40-year low. And there is a modest proposal by this President to \nincrease it and no way will this Republican Congress even consider it.\n  But if they get a chance to slap the worker, here it is. I say it is \nwrong. It is wrong. These are the people that should be respected, not \nshunned, and this amendment that has been offered by the Senator from \nKansas should be defeated.\n  The threat of using replacement workers is a veiled iron glove \nhovering over workers at the bargaining table. It upsets that delicate \nbalance.\n  I have known some wonderful people in California who are very good \nbosses, who have very good relations with the working people that they \nhire. And I can tell you, those people would never replace workers who \ngo out on strike. They would not do it because they have come to \nrespect those workers and the workers' families and the workers' \nchildren and they know that their success has been brought about \nbecause of those workers. So this is not aimed at them--the good \nbosses, the management people who bring their workers in.\n  But I will tell you, there are those management people--and I have \nseen them, too, in California--who do not really care about the \nworkers, who really do not care. Sometimes it is new management that is \nbrought in when a company is bought out, some kind of a hostile \ntakeover. They come in and they throw everybody out the door.\n They goad workers until they go out on strike, and then they \npermanently replace them.\n\n  We have a lot of companies to choose from when we hire companies to \nwork for the Federal Government. President Clinton is right. Do not \nhire those firms that treat their people so badly, who care so little \nabout them and their families, who would throw them out at the drop of \na hat the minute they walk out on strike.\n  Let me say when people go out on strike, that is not a happy \noccasion. That is not something they do lightly. People suffer when \nthey are out on strike. The family suffers when a person is out on \nstrike. It is very hard. No one knows when the strike will end. It is \nvery difficult to know that you will be replaced the minute you walk \nout the door. It changes the entire balance between workers and \nmanagement. A stable and productive relationship can be put out of \nkilter if you know the minute you walk out that door you can be \nreplaced.\n  Now let me say why I think what the President did is not only good \nfor workers, it not only honors workers, but why it is good for \nAmerica. It is a very important point. Strikes involving permanent \nreplacements last far longer than other strikes. On average, strikes \ninvolving permanent replacements last seven times longer than other \nstrikes. They are bitter. They are disruptive because business targets \nnot just wages and benefits but the very right of the worker to strike.\n  I will tell Members as I have looked at these strikes in the past, \nthe bad feelings linger. The bad feelings linger because permanent \npeople have replaced workers, and finally if workers even do get their \njob back, it is after a very long struggle. It is not the right way to \nproceed.\n  So I say if we do not deal with companies that do that, that treat \ntheir people so badly, we will be dealing with better companies. We \nwill be contracting with companies that will do a better job for the \nAmerican people. I think that argument is sometimes lost.\n  So it is not only that this Executive order by the President is good \nfor workers and honors workers, it is good for America because we will \nbe contracting with companies that have a better labor track record \nand, therefore, are more reliable.\n  Now, I said before, we have had many incidents in California, and I \nwant to talk about one that I talked about before. It is a situation \nwhere more than 400 nurses at the California Nurses Association went \nout on strike at the City of Hope Medical Center, in Duarte, CA. They \nwere protesting contract demands that cut their vacations in half, and \nreassigned large portions of their duties to lower paid and in some \ncases unlicensed personnel.\n  I do not have to say how committed nurses are. They are committed to \ntheir work. They are proud of their work. They do not walk out on \nstrike easily. They love their jobs. But they knew they had no choice. \nThe minute they walked out the hospital management began to hire \nreplacement workers. Let me tell Members, it was a bitter, bitter pill \nfor those nurses to swallow.\n  Carol Beecher-Hoban, a pediatric nurse, found out on her sixth \nanniversary at the hospital that she would be permanently replaced. The \nday she went out on strike--a legal strike--a single mom with two kids, \nwithout her job, she was without health insurance for her and her \nfamily. Believe me, a registered nurse knows what it means to be \nwithout health insurance.\n  She had to take two jobs and sell her house to make ends meet, all \nbecause she exercised her right under laws passed by this Congress and \nsupported, presumably, by everyone--the right to strike. That is \nsupported by everybody. This is an amendment, my friends, to \n [[Page S3957]] end the right to strike. If ending the right to strike \nwas the amendment before the Senate, it would be more direct. But this \ndeals with permanent replacement of strikers, which I say, is \nequivalent to ending the right to strike.\n  So here is a nurse who walks out to protest the working conditions of \nher job--and she's been there for 6 years--and she loses her job. Right \naway, a single mother, two kids, no medical insurance. She has to take \ntwo jobs, sells her house, because her employer chose to permanently \nreplace her.\n  Let me underline the word ``permanent.'' We are not talking about \ntemporary replacements. Employers can do that if they want to. We are \ntalking about permanent replacements. People go out on strike because \nthey believe they have the right to strike. It is guaranteed to them \nhere in the laws of our land, and then they are permanently replaced.\n  How about this other woman: Betty Razor, a specialist in a certain \ntype of therapy which is very difficult to deal with. She deals with \npatients who have colostomies or other kinds of artificial diversions \nin place for bodily functions. It is a very tough and stressful job.\n  This woman, Betty Razor, was nurse of the year and employee of the \nyear at that hospital, in Duarte, CA. She went out on strike. She was \nnurse of the year and voted employee of the year by the management. \nWhat do they do with Betty Razor? They permanently replace her. In a \nsnap. In a snap. That is what they thought of her.\n  I say that is wrong. That is wrong. If a company wants to temporarily \nbring in a replacement because they have a need to fill, that would be \nsomething that could be understood. But to permanently replace the \nemployee of the year, the nurse of the year, with no feeling at all \nabout this person, is wrong. Yet this amendment would say, ``It's fine. \nGo ahead. We love it. Congress says it's great. Permanently replace \nyour people.''\n  Not me. I say it is wrong.\n  What is she doing now? She is working in home care. She called my \noffice when this debate was raging a few months back. She said when \nthey told her they were replacing her she said, ``You must be kidding. \nI didn't seem to think that they could do that.'' She said, ``I thought \nwhen they told me I was being permanently replaced that it was a ploy \nto make us knuckle under.'' She said, ``I didn't think they could just \npick anyone to replace us. They let go the cream of the crop. Everyone \nwho has professional influence with other nurses was replaced.'' So \nthey got rid of the cream of the crop.\n  Five nurses of the year were replaced permanently. What did they do? \nWere they bad? Did they treat their patients badly? No, they were the \nnurses of the year. Their patients loved them. But they exercised their \nright to strike. Their human right to withhold their labor to protest. \nThey thought once the strike was over, they would be working again, \nbecause they loved their work and they wanted to work, but they were \npermanently replaced.\n  This amendment will send a signal all over this country. Go ahead, \neveryone, fire people if they dare go out on strike, and permanently \nreplace them. That is wrong.\n  She said to me, ``I always felt you strike because of the issues, and \nwhen you settle the issues, you go back to work. You don't win every \nissue,'' she says, ``You compromise.''\n  She said, ``That's how we do it in America. I never thought you would \npermanently replace the workers. Why would anyone strike then?''\n  I think the American people are fair, and I do not think the American \npeople think it is unfair to tell someone ``You have a human right to \nwithhold your labor, to strike; now, remember, when you do it, you \nwon't get a paycheck, it's going to be hard, you may have to stand out \nwith a picket sign, you're going to have problems, people may not like \nyou, it may be tough. But you have a right to strike while you bargain \ncollectively until all the issues are resolved; you have a right to \nstrike.'' I think the American people believe that is right.\n  Now, when it comes to certain public employees, we know that is \nanother problem, that is another issue, and we are not talking about \nthat here. We are talking about private contractors. So to tell someone \nyou have the right to strike, we support your right to strike, and yet \nthen say to them, ``But the minute you walk out the door, you're \nhistory; you'll be thrown off health insurance, you can't get your job \nback,'' I think the American people would say that is not fair.\n  So Nurse Razor learned it the hard way.\n  Mr. President, there are other instances in California of the sheer \ninhumanity of hiring replacement workers. Last year, Senator Metzenbaum \ntalked about an issue in California, the Diamond Walnut workers. It is \na very, very, very tough issue. Four hundred members of a union \nexercised their right to strike more than 2 years ago. In 1985, they \nhad given huge wage concessions to the employer because they were \nwanting to help the company avoid bankruptcy, and they said, ``Look, we \nare part of the team here. We are not going to insist on higher wages \nif you are having trouble in the company.''\n  They said, ``We will give concessions. We will take lower wages,'' \nand they gave huge wage concessions.\n  The company turned around. It did amazingly well. But the concessions \nwere not restored, despite renewed profitability and what they thought \nwas an implied promise that things would change for them if the \ncompany's fortune reversed.\n  More than half of the striking workers happened to be women in that \ncase. In a special report to Secretary of Labor Reich, Karen Nussbaum, \nDirector of the Department's Women's Bureau, said, ``The workers' sole \nprecondition is to return to work while retaining union \nrepresentation.'' That is all they wanted. They want to go back and \nstill stay in their union. They cannot do that right now. They were \npunished, and they cannot go back to work, punished for exercising an \nAmerican right, a right that is so American that we said to the workers \nin Poland when they were under the Soviet Union, ``We back you.'' \nSolidarity was the union. ``We back you,'' Republicans and Democrats on \ntheir feet, greeting the President of Poland, Lech Walesa. ``We love \nyou,'' we said. Solidarity. The workers overthrew communism, and yet \nright here, the workers in America are getting the shaft. The President \nsays that is wrong and about 42 of us said that is wrong, and whether \nor not we hold ranks, I do not know. But I hope we hold our ranks. I \nhope we stick together for these working people.\n  I think the message that we send out from this Chamber is very \nimportant to the workers of America to know that someone is on their \nside. Maybe it is not so popular to be on the worker's side anymore, \nbut it is popular with me, because I believe in America and the \nAmerican dream and hard work, like the nurse of the year, who worked \nwith patients who were sick, and they loved her and the bosses loved \nher, and the minute she said, ``Wait a minute, you're not treating me \nfairly in these negotiations,'' and she walked outside the door, the \ndoor slammed shut on her.\n  What kind of a message is that to send to the hard-working people of \nAmerica? We have a lot of contracts with companies. We can choose and \npick the best. Let us choose and pick the best, and that means those \nthat are the best to their workers. Does it mean that workers are \nalways right? Of course not.\n  When I was a member of the board of supervisors, the union struck \nagainst me. I did not like that. I did not think they were right. I \nfelt terrible about that. They struck me. They held signs against the \nboard of supervisors. They said we were wrong, and I said to them that \nI thought they were asking for too much compensation, and we sat at the \ntable. They went out on strike, and we had to work hard.\n  We had management people doing their jobs. It was not easy, but we \nnegotiated in good faith, and when the strike ended, those employees \ncame back to work and they said to me, I remember at that time, \n``Supervisor Boxer, we didn't agree with you, but let's put it behind \nus.'' That is what America is all about. We should not lord our power \nover working people and fire them the minute they have the temerity to \nwalk out the door. This is America. That is wrong. We should not punish \npeople for exercising their rights. We should argue with each other \nwhen we do not agree. I argued \n [[Page S3958]] with those employees. I said, ``You're asking for too \nmuch. You're making a mistake. You're going to get burned because you \nare not going to get everything you want. Don't go out on strike. It's \nwrong.'' But I never said to them, ``If you walk out that door, you're \nhistory.''\n  Why would I not say that? Because they are good people; they cared \nabout the county. They worked in public works; they worked in all kinds \nof important parts of the county in Marin. They were good, hard-\nworking, decent human beings who very rarely went out on strike, and \nwhen they did it, I said, ``You're wrong.'' When it was over, we shook \nhands.\n  That is what America is about, not saying, ``We're changing the lock \non the door and you can never come back because you legally exercised \nyour rights.'' That is wrong. That is what this Kassebaum amendment is \nabout. It is slapping working people. It is a message that they do not \nhave the right to withhold their labor and to have in any way a level \nplaying field.\n  So I hope we are going to stand up for those who work for a living, \nwhether they are cracking walnuts in Stockton or providing specialized \nnursing care in Duarte, CA, or any other economic pursuit you can name.\n  If people want to fight about the right to strike, let us have it out \non that issue. That is what is so interesting to me about the \nRepublican Contract With America, because I look at it as a war on \nchildren, on families, on consumers, on the environment. But if you \nlook at the contract, it says ``The Commonsense Legal Reform Act.'' \nThat is how they talk about their legal reforms.\n  You tell me what is reform about saying there are no punitive damages \nthat can be leveled against a corporation that goes ahead with a \nproduct that has FDA approval--let us say something like the Dalkon \nshield--and you say, ``Well, you got FDA approval. Therefore, if it \nmakes women sterile or it hurts them or it kills them or it gives them \ncancer, no punitive damages.''\n  That is the commonsense legal reform act. I say it is a war against \nconsumers, just as this amendment is a war against working people. But \nthey never put it in those terms. There are other parts of the \ncontract--regulatory reform--that deal with issues that can really hurt \nthe health and safety of the people of this Nation.\n  What is a reform about stopping a regulation that is going to stop E. \ncoli from getting into the hamburgers that people eat all through this \ncountry? I have constituents who have died because they ate a hamburger \nthat had E. coli.\n  Regulatory reform, my friends, is going to do a lot for those people \nbecause it is going to stop that regulation from going into effect that \nwill protect the meat supply. But they call that regulatory reform.\n  How about this one? A bacteria called cryptosporidium showed up in \nthe Milwaukee water supply. We are finally getting around to regulating \nstandards for the water supply. Oh, the Republican contract: Moratorium \non all regulations. So they call it regulatory reform. I call it a war \non consumers, a war on the environment. And this amendment, stopping a \nPresident from issuing an Executive order that he has every right to \ndo, to me is a war on the working people of this Nation.\n  In a way, I am discouraged about having to fight these battles, but \nin a way it energizes me because I think the American people have to \nengage in what is going on here in Washington. A hundred days to change \nAmerica, 100 days to turn back the clock on progress we have made in \nproviding this country the toughest consumer law, the best in \nenvironmental protection, the best protections for water, for air. All \nthat, we turn it back in 100 days because that is what the politicians \nsaid the last election meant.\n  Let me tell you, I think the last election meant change. People want \nchange. People are tired of politics as usual. There is no question \nabout it. People do not want waste. They want an end to fraud. They do \nnot want useless regulation. But the election was not about leaving \nthis country unprotected, unprotected from pollution and bacteria that \ngets in our meat supply, from drugs that have not been adequately \ntested.\n  What I find very interesting about the contract is it does a couple \nof different things. First, it says if a company issues a product that \nhas Federal Drug Administration approval, you can never sue that \ncompany for punitive damages if you die or get cancer or something like \nthat. At the same time, they want to go after the FDA and make it \nreally an agency that cannot function. They attack the FDA. As a matter \nof fact, the Speaker of the House said, ``Let's privatize the FDA. \nLet's not even have an FDA.''\n  Well, imagine that combination: an FDA that is neutered and at the \nsame time, you give them the power to protect companies from ever being \nsued if their product received FDA approval. That is a lethal \ncombination, and that is in the Republican contract which, by the way, \nis moving very quickly.\n  But earlier in my remarks I said that when the Founders founded this \nNation, they said that we would act in the Senate here as the saucer \nand in the House as the cup, and when these ideas spill over, they will \ncool down here because people are getting to see what they are.\n  I was very pleased that the majority leader gave us 2 extra days on \nthe balanced budget amendment because my people in California now \nunderstand if Social Security wasn't exempted from that amendment, it \nwould be raided and looted and gone. So where the balanced budget \namendment was so popular, when people realized that Social Security was \ngoing to be looted, the polls totally switched and 70 percent opposed \nit.\n  I am glad that we have the time here to look at some of these issues, \nso I could tell you about some of these nurses, so I could tell you \nabout the strikers at the Diamond Walnut plant. All they want now is to \nget their jobs back and stay in their union. They cannot do that.\n  I have to say that if you look at this contract, nowhere in it will \nyou see anything that even mentions the word environment. Nowhere in it \nwill you really see anything that mentions the words ``consumer \nprotection.'' And I hope that we will slow it down, just as we are \nslowing this debate down.\n  I do not know if we are going to win this debate on striker \nreplacement. I do not know if we are going to win this debate. There \nmay be some who say, look, we have had this discussion long enough. Let \nus get on with the bill. But I can tell you now, if the Republicans \nwithdrew the amendment, if the good Senator from Kansas withdrew the \namendment, we would be in good shape. We could move this bill forward. \nBut if we insist on keeping this amendment alive, I think the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts is willing to talk about it for a long time. I am \nwilling to talk about it for a long time. Frankly, if we do not have \nthe votes to stop it, President Clinton may veto this bill. He may veto \nthis bill, just as I think President Bush would have vetoed a bill that \nin fact reversed his Executive order.\n  There is a town in California called Hawthorne, and a firm there that \nmakes hardware. There was a strike over a health care issue. When the \nworkers went on strike, they were told that replacement workers would \nbe brought in but they would not be permanent. They would only be \ntemporary replacements.\n  On November 29, the members voted to call off the strike and accept \nthe company's last offer. But--but--at that point, the company withdrew \nthe proposal and declared the replacements permanent, leaving these \nunion members without jobs.\n  Now, that to me is an extraordinary story, because I grew up to \nbelieve that when someone gives you their word, that is golden. That is \ngolden. So the employer said: We are just going to replace you \ntemporarily, but in the end the employer did not mean it. And I have to \nsay that the NLRB, the National Labor Relations Board, still has not \ncome down with a decision, and that has gone on for a long time. In the \nmeantime, those workers are without health care, and they are close to \nexhausting their unemployment benefits.\n  Only 10 percent of those workers got other jobs. But those other jobs \nthat they got, they are nothing like the ones they had before. \nBasically they are minimum wage jobs with no benefits. It is a very \nunhappy story, a very unhappy story.\n   [[Page S3959]] Then there is a story, again out of San Bernardino, \nCA, of 150 workers at a bakery. They had very low wages. Many of them \nfelt they were being passed up for promotions. After 5 months of \nnegotiating, the workers went on strike. The union said let us bring in \nmediation, but the company refused to bargain. They hired 125 \nreplacement workers, built a new facility somewhere else, and \neventually closed the San Bernardino facility. Only 60 of those workers \nout of the 125 ever got back to work.\n  It goes on and on. I think that this amendment on this defense bill \nis totally uncalled for. This is not an amendment that deals with the \ndefense supplemental bill. This is an amendment that I think is a \ngratuitous slap at people who work for a living. It is not necessary.\n  Why not have a hearing, I would say to my friend from Kansas, and \nbring in the administration? Let them explain why they feel this is \nimportant to the dignity of working people and, by the way, for the \ntaxpayers who will benefit when companies with good labor records are \nhired by the Federal Government because they will not be dislocated. \nThey will fulfill their obligations to be good contractors for the \nAmerican people.\n  There is one element of disaster reform that I am prepared to \nintroduce today. This component would repeal the current 10-percent \nincome threshold for casualty loss deductions arising from a \npresidentially declared natural disasters. It is identical to \nlegislation I offered 1 year ago to help the victims of last year's \ntragic Northridge earthquake.\n  We have all seen the devastating images of flooded farms and homes on \ntelevision. But it is important to remember that many Californians \naffected by the flooding suffered serious, but moderate, damage. Their \nbasements are filled with mud and their carpets and furniture need to \nbe replaced, but their homes still stand. These people have $5,000 in \ndamage, or maybe $10,000. These are the taxpayers who may not get the \nrelief they need.\n  Suppose a middle-class family with adjusted gross income of $50,000 \nsustains $4,000 in flood damage. Under current law, only losses in \nexcess of $5,100 can be deducted. But under my bill, that family could \ndeduct all losses over $100, or $3,900. And where would their tax \nsavings go? It would go back into the economy as a direct stimulus. It \nwould create jobs for contractors and those who produce the raw \nmaterials they use. The economic benefits would ripple throughout the \ncommunity.\n  This bill would allow nearly full tax deductibility of all casualty \nlosses attributable to disasters declared on or after January 14, 1994. \nVictims of the Northridge earthquake could take advantage of this tax \ndeduction as could victims of the current flooding. And most \nimportantly, future disaster victims would gain a valuable tool to help \nthemselves recover from these disasters.\n  Offering this amendment on this bill is not necessary. I hope my \nfriend from Massachusetts will continue to lead this fight.\n  I ask him at this point if he has remarks planned or if he wishes me \nto continue a few remarks for a short period of time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all I thank my friend and \ncolleague, the Senator from California, for her comments. These have \nbeen comments, not just this afternoon, but I know and I can tell the \nSenate that she has been there every hour, every minute of this battle. \nShe has worked with our minority leader and others who have been \nworking on this issue for the past several days. She has spoken on this \nand has been ready to continue the battle for working people.\n  I want to thank her for her immense contribution to this debate. It \nhas been enormously interesting. As she has pointed out, the time that \nwas taken both in the balanced budget amendment and also particularly \non this issue, I think, has been enormously informative to our Members. \nI find that has been the case.\n  We had, initially, the question about the Executive order, whether \nthe President had the power to take this action. We went through that \nhistory. We went through the past Executive orders by past Presidents. \nThere was some confusion. But we went through it.\n  We went through exactly the types of people who were going to be \naffected and impacted, and we were able to demonstrate these were, by \nand large, workers who were making $6, $7, $8 an hour at the tops--the \nones who were being permanently replaced. So it was hard-working men \nand women who were trying to provide for their families who were going \nto be impacted by the amendment.\n  We went through the course of the history of the results of contracts \nthat were being performed by permanent replacements. There were serious \nquestions in terms of on-time delivery and also the quality of the \nwork. And we went on in the broader context about how this issue that \nhas affected the legitimate rights of working families, how this fits \nin with other actions or nonactions of the Congress during the past 3 \nmonths.\n  I think it has been enormously informative for our Members and also, \nI think, for those who have been watching and listening and following \nthe debate. I am enormously grateful to her for her contribution.\n  I see the Senator from Kansas is prepared to perhaps make a comment. \nSo I am prepared to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I regret that we have been unable to \nhave a final vote on my amendment. There are those who do not wish to \nsee it come to a resolution with an up-or-down vote, and that is their \nright. I respect that.\n  The Executive order that we have been talking about--whereby striking \nworkers now cannot be permanently replaced, as has been the law for \nsome 60 years and which will now be overturned by this Executive \norder--is very important and very troubling.\n  The implications of the Executive order go far beyond just saying \nthere will only be a few companies affected and it really will not make \na lot of difference. It is very important for us to understand what, \nindeed, the ramifications of the order will be. I would argue that \nusing Executive orders in this way can affect labor as well as \nmanagement. And it will further destabilize the relationships in the \nwork force.\n  So I just want to say, Mr. President, I will be back. This is an \nissue of vital importance and I intend to bring it up again and again \nbecause I think it is so very important.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that it has been a good debate. \nThere have been, I think, some well-stated views on both sides. I \nsuggest that this issue is one that will not be laid to rest until, I \nhope, we can reach some resolution on what basically is at stake here--\nand that is the separation of powers between the executive and \nlegislative branches.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, earlier today, due to inescapable \ncircumstances I was absent from a cloture motion vote on the Kassebaum \namendment No. 331. On my journey to the Senate Chamber I was trapped in \nan elevator in the Senate Dirksen Building for 40 minutes. I extend my \nmost sincere thanks to the Senate superintendent's office for its \nassistance in my rescue. I must say that crawling out of the elevator \nwas certainly a new and exciting experience, but not one I hope to \nrepeat anytime soon. As I have said in prior statements I support \nSenator Kassebaum's amendment and would have voted in favor of cloture \nhad I been able.\n\n\n                      the defense industrial base\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, H.R. 889, the defense supplemental \nappropriations bill, has provided us an early rehearsal for a larger \ndebate that will no doubt last throughout this session of Congress and \nbeyond.\n  This debate takes place at two levels: First, we will be deciding how \nbest to provide for our Nation's defense--for now, and for the long \nterm. At another level, we will be setting priorities for the \nmonumental task of restoring balance to the Federal budget.\n  This bill is before us today because we must fund unanticipated \nDefense Department expenses--for our operations in Haiti, Somalia, \nBosnia, Cuba--out of funds that were originally intended to support \nnormal, peacetime functions.\n  [[Page S3960]] Eventually, the cost of those unforeseen operations \ntook their toll on the ability of our armed services to pay for some of \nthose training functions. I believe that it is now clear that we need a \nbetter way--a contingency fund, for example--to deal with the \ninevitable, but unpredictable tasks that our Armed Forces will be asked \nto undertake.\n  Unfortunately for colleagues in the House took a very short-sighted \napproach in their search for the funds needed to meet this year's \nneeds.\n  They decided to cut funds from two programs that are essential to our \ncountry's economic and military security.\n  They eliminated the technology reinvestment program, cutting $502 \nmillion from this year's and next year's budgets. And they cut 25 \npercent, $107 million from the advanced technology program.\n  These programs are part of an established, bipartisan decision to \nmaintain the technological advantage that we displayed so convincingly \nin the Gulf War and will continue to need to meet the threats the world \nnow presents.\n  These programs are at the heart of an emerging base on domestic, \nAmerican high-technology manufacturing capacity, the base we need to \nassure that we will continue to foster the discovery and development of \nthe new ideas and products that the world's most sophisticated military \ndemands.\n  To establish and maintain that base, these programs take advantage of \nour country's historical strength--our private economy. By making our \nNation's high-technology industries partners in the development of the \nkinds of technologies and processes that future defense systems will \nrequire, we are building the essential foundation for our national \nsecurity.\n  These programs are critical investments, in areas where there is the \npotential for both commercial and military applications. The potential \nspillover from these programs in both kinds of applications means that \nwithout the incentives they provide, we would engage in wasteful \nduplication of commercial and military research, on the one hand, or \nmiss the opportunity for important breakthroughs, on the other.\n  Mr. President, recent history and economic logic tell us that \nindividual firms will not find it cost-effective to undertake the \nresearch and development that these programs support, because the \npayoffs are often unpredictable and many years in the making.\n  In addition to promoting the private sector's involvement in this \nkind of long-term undertaking to preserve our Nation's competitive edge \nin the world economy--our Government has the responsibility to provide \nfor the common defense.\n  In this day and age, and certainly into the future, that \nconstitutional responsibility will require the maintenance of an \nadvanced manufacturing\n capability, along with the scientific knowledge, engineering skills, \nand information management that support it.\n\n  Consider, Mr. President, the kinds of projects that these program \nmake possible. TRP is supporting the development of advanced composite \nmaterials for advanced aircraft propulsion systems. Advanced engine \ndesigns now being considered for future production could increase \nperformance and fuel efficiency for both commercial and military \naircraft.\n  This potential can only be realized if much of the metal engine \nstructure in conventional designs is replaced with polymer composites \nthat can be produced at reasonable cost.\n  Another TRP Program supports private industry in the development of \nlow- and high-power high-temperature superconductor microwave \ncomponents for commercial and defense satellites. These new components \ncould radically reduce the size and the power consumption of critical \nsatellite components, creating longer-lasting communications and \nweather satellites.\n  The ATP is supporting the development of manufacturing processes that \ncan reduce by at least one third the cost of producing advanced \ncomposite components for use in thousands of different applications.\n  These advanced manufacturing processes are the key to reducing the \noverall cost of employing new materials, such as the aircraft engine \nparts in the TRP Program I mentioned.\n  And to illustrate the important public investment component in these \nprojects, Mr. President, a recently awarded ATP grant supports the \ndevelopment of very large scale component parts that can be used on \ncivilian as well as military infrastructure projects, such as auto and \nrail bridges.\n  As we look for ways to rehabilitate our neglected public facilities, \nat all levels of our Federal system, these new materials offer ways of \nrepairing conventional structures as well as constructing new ones, \nwith longer lasting, low-maintenance components.\n  Mr. President, only by supporting these innovative ATP and TRP \nPrograms can we maintain the cutting-edge commercial manufacturing \ncapacity that is essential to meeting the rapidly evolving demands on \nour military capabilities.\n  At the same time, they provide the additional security of knowing \nthat we are doing all we prudently can to assure that our domestic \neconomy remains at the leading edge of commercial applications of new \ntechnologies.\n  We can no longer afford--if we ever could--wasteful duplication of \nmilitary and commercial development of the same technologies.\n  And we certainly cannot afford to miss the next breakthrough in \nmaterials, information management, or communications, that could leave \nthe men and women of our Armed Forces needlessly exposed to danger.\n  The greater their exposure--if we allow our technological edge to \ngrow dull with false economies--the more reluctant we will be to face \nthreats to our security. For want of the next generation of nails, Mr. \nPresident, the next century's battles may be lost.\n  These are difficult times--we must invest for long-term economic \ngrowth here at home and confront the confusing variety of new threats \nto our security abroad.\n  The Technology Reinvestment Program and the Advanced Technology \nProgram are prudent, cost-effective means of dealing with both of those \nproblems.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend the distinguished managers of this \nlegislation, the members of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, \nSenators Bingaman and Lieberman, and the other members who have spoken \nup for these programs, for showing the foresight to restore these \nimportant programs to more adequate levels of funding.\n  I am sure we will find ourselves revisiting these issues in the \ncoming months and years. I will continue to support efforts that \nprotect the technological foundations of our economic and military \nsecurity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if I could inquire of the Chair, what is \nthe pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Kassebaum \namendment to H.R. 889. That is the pending question.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I would say these comments represent \nmy point of view on this issue at this point. The majority leader is in \ndiscussions now. I think he will announce the outcome of those \ndiscussions in a few minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my friend \nand colleague, the Senator from Kansas. I want to say, every person in \nthis body knows the seriousness with which the Senator from Kansas \ntakes her responsibilities as the chair of the Labor and Human \nResources Committee and as someone who delves deeply and is concerned, \ninterested, and attentive to the range of public policy issues that \ncome before that committee. In particular, the Senator spends a great \ndeal of time and gives a great deal of thought to issues involving the \nrelationship between workers and employers. This has been a matter of \nvery great seriousness, I know, to her.\n  I understand that and respect it. She has indicated she will be back \nat another time to address these issues. We regret we have not been \noverwhelmingly persuasive to her and to others as to the legitimacy of \nour position.\n  But we welcome the opportunity to continue the dialog not just here \non the floor but otherwise to see if we can find areas of common ground \nin this area as we have found common ground \n [[Page S3961]] with her and our other members of that committee in a \ngreat number of areas. We have been appreciative of the way that this \ndebate and discussion has taken place.\n  We await the announcements of the majority leader as to the Senate \nbusiness.\n  Again, I am grateful to both the Senator and her supporters as well \nas all of those who have spoken on this measure over the period of the \npast days, and for the courtesies and the attentiveness which they have \ngiven to this issue. I am also grateful to the leadership Senator \nDaschle and many of my other colleagues have personally demonstrated on \nthis measure.\n  I thank all the Members. I yield the floor with the expectation that \nwe will be on other matters after the majority leader speaks.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe).

Madam President, it is my sad duty to advise the Senate \nthat Arthur Winstead, former Congressman of Mississippi, died last \nnight at the age of 91.\n  William Arthur Winstead represented the 3d Congressional District of \nMississippi from 1943 to 1965. During his 22 years of service in \nCongress, he was firmly loyal to his constituents and his principles. \nIn an ironic twist of history, in spite of his conservatism, he was the \nfirst Mississippi Congressman in this century to be defeated by a \nRepublican. Reflecting the changing nature of politics in the South, he \nsubsequently became a strong supporter of several Republican \ncandidates.\n  I was flattered and honored that I had the privilege to become his \nfriend. It was only about 2 weeks ago that he called to talk about his \nimpressions of our efforts to bring about changes in the Washington \nGovernment. He was very proud of the role the members of our State's \ndelegation were playing in this period of transition.\n  Prior to entering Congress, Arthur Winstead served his community as a \nteacher and subsequently as county superintendent of schools for \nNeshoba County. During the administration of the late Gov. John Bell \nWilliams, he served as commissioner of the Mississippi Department of \nPublic Welfare.\n  Arthur Winstead was a personal friend of mine and a friend of many \nthroughout Mississippi. I offer my personal condolences to his wife and \nfamily. In honoring his memory, we honor a good and dedicated man who \nserved with distinction in Congress with a deep sense of public duty \nand principle.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Madam President, Cecil Romine, the former president of the \nWest Virginia American Postal Workers Union and long time national \nbusiness agent for the American Postal Workers Union, passed away \nearlier this year at age 67. He was born and raised in West Virginia, \nand served in the Navy at a very young age in World War II. He came \nhome to reside in Parkersburg, where he went to work in the post \noffice. When postal workers were given the right to bargain \ncollectively by Congress in 1971 he established his home Local in \nParkersburg--the Mountaineer Area Local--and then the West Virginia \nState organization.\n  Cecil Romine was then elected as national business agent for the \nClerk Craft for the three-State region of Maryland, Virginia, and West \nVirginia in 1976. It is a mark of his extraordinary skill as an \nadvocate and a negotiator that someone from a small Local like \nParkersburg would be elected--and consistently reelected--in a region \nin which most voters come from much larger Locals such as Baltimore, \nRichmond, or Washington, DC. He was equally respected by postal \nmanagement not only as one of the union's most resourceful and talented \nrepresentatives, but also as a man of his word. He loved the union and \nthe Postal Service and fought tirelessly to better both. Even after \nretirement, he worked hard and effectively with my office to preserve \nservice in West Virginia.\n  Mr. Romine turned down many chances to take better paying and more \nsecure jobs in management. Perhaps if he had, he would have enjoyed a \nlonger and more normal retirement. But he knew his place was in the \nfront line fighting for working people, and he was never interested in \ndoing anything else.\n  He had 7 children, 13 grandchildren, and recently 2 great \ngrandchildren. The pillars of his life were his family, his church, and \nhis Union. He was a man of traditional values in the true sense of \nthose words.\n  I know that Cecil Romine is deeply missed by both his personal family \nand his larger family of postal workers. In submitting this statement, \nI want to let his wife Betty and all of his family know that his memory \nis respected here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/15/senate-section/article/S3961-4", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3961-S3962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE? THE VOTERS HAVE SAID YES!\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, the enormous Federal debt which has \nalready soared into the stratosphere is in about the same category as \nthe weather--everybody likes to talk about it but almost nobody had \nundertaken the responsibility of trying to do anything about it until \nimmediately following the elections last November.\n  When the 104th Congress convened in January, the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives approved a balanced budget amendment. In the Senate, \nhowever, while all but one of the 54 Republicans supported the balanced \nbudget amendment, only 13 Democrats supported it. The balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment, needing 67 votes, failed by just 1 vote. \nThere will be another vote later this year or next year.\n  This episode--the one-vote loss in the Senate--emphasizes the fact \nthat a lot of politicians talks a good game when they are back home \nabout bringing Federal deficits and the Federal debt under control. But \nso many of them come back to Washington and vote in support of bloated \nspending bills rolling through the Senate.\n  As of the close of business yesterday, Tuesday, March 14, the Federal \ndebt stood--down to the penny--at exactly \n [[Page S3962]] $4,846,819,443,348.28. This debt, remember, was run up \nby the Congress of the United States.\n  The Founding Fathers decreed that the big-spending bureaucrats in the \nexecutive branch of the U.S. Government must never be able to spend \neven a dime unless and until authorized and appropriated by the U.S. \nCongress.\n  The U.S. Constitution is quite specific about that, as every school \nboy is supposed to know.\n  So, do not be misled by politicians who falsely declare that the \nFederal debt was run up by some previous President or another, \ndepending on party affiliation. These passing-the-buck declarations are \nfalse because as I said earlier, the Congress of the United States is \nthe culprit. The Senate and the House of Representatives have been the \nbig spenders for the better part of 50 years.\n  Madam President, most citizens cannot conceive of a billion of \nanything, let alone a trillion. It may provide a bit of perspective to \nbear in mind that a billion seconds ago, Mr. President, the Cuban \nmissile crisis was in progress. A billion minutes ago, the crucifixion \nof Jesus Christ had occured not long before.\n  Which sort of puts it in perspective, does it not, that Congress has \nrun up this incredible Federal debt totaling 4,846 of those billions--\nof dollars. In other words, the Federal debt, as I said earlier, stood \nthis morning at 4 trillion, 846 billion, 819 million, 443 thousand, 348 \ndollars and 28 cents. It'll be even greater at closing time today.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/15/senate-section/article/S3961-5", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          FRIENDS OF IRELAND ST. PATRICK'S DAY STATEMENT--1995\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, over the last year, we have witnessed \ntruly historic progress in Northern Ireland which gives great hope that \nlasting peace and reconciliation are at hand.\n  The Friends of Ireland is a bipartisan group of Senators and \nRepresentatives opposed to violence in Northern Ireland and dedicated \nto maintaining a United States policy that promotes a just, lasting, \nand peaceful settlement of the conflict that has cost more than 3,100 \nlives over the past quarter century.\n  Since 1981, the Friends of Ireland have joined together in an annual \nSt. Patrick's Day statement which focuses on the situation in Northern \nIreland. I believe that all our colleagues will find this year's \nstatement of particular interest, and I ask unanimous consent that it \nmay be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Statement by the Friends of Ireland, St. Patrick's Day, 1995\n\n       On this St. Patrick's Day, all friends of Ireland rejoice \n     in the historic developments of 1994 and early 1995 that have \n     led to a cease-fire in Northern Ireland and that offer the \n     best hope for a negotiated and lasting peace since the \n     Troubles began more than a quarter century ago.\n       We welcome the release last month by the British and Irish \n     Governments of the Framework Document, which provides a fair \n     and balanced basis for all-party talks in Northern Ireland--\n     talks we hope will begin soon. The way forward can be found \n     only if all parties work together to find a peaceful solution \n     that will have the support of the people of Northern Ireland.\n       We commend all those in Ireland, Northern Ireland, and \n     Britain, who deserve enduring credit for the achievements so \n     far--especially John Bruton, John Major, Dick Spring, Sir \n     Patrick Mayhew, John Hume, Gerry Adams, and Albert Reynolds.\n       We also commend the constructive role which President \n     Clinton, U.S. Ambassador to Ireland Jean Kennedy Smith, and \n     U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain William Crowe have played in \n     advancing this process. The combined efforts of the Congress \n     and the Administration played a critical role in the process \n     which led to the IRA's historic cease-fire announcement in \n     August 1994 and the Loyalist cease-fire declaration which \n     followed in October. We commend both the IRA and Loyalist \n     paramilitaries for deciding to seek a peaceful settlement to \n     the conflict.\n       We support the total demilitarization of Northern Ireland. \n     We urge the Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries to begin \n     turning in their weapons. We are encouraged by the \n     announcement by the British Government that it will begin to \n     withdraw troops from Northern Ireland and we are hopeful that \n     this process will continue.\n       Both the British and Irish Governments responded to the \n     cease-fire announcements with significant steps to advance \n     the cause of peace. The British Government opened cross-\n     border roads, lifted the broadcast ban and exclusion orders, \n     and removed British troops from daytime street patrols in \n     Northern Ireland. The Irish Government established the Forum \n     for Peace and Reconciliation, released prisoners, and lifted \n     emergency laws.\n       Many Unionists and their leaders have shown a willingness \n     to consider new proposals with an open-mindedness crucial to \n     genuine progress. This development is welcomed. We are also \n     greatly encouraged by visits of Unionist leaders to this \n     country. The United States is a friend of both communities \n     and we hope Unionists will continue to visit. It is important \n     that their voices be heard.\n       Recognizing that economic progress is also essential, the \n     Friends of Ireland support measures to encourage economic \n     development in Northern Ireland and the border counties of \n     Ireland damaged by the years of conflict. The cease-fire has \n     already led to new investment that will create needed jobs.\n       We welcome President Clinton's support for additional \n     private economic development as demonstrated by the \n     appointment of George Mitchell as the President's economic \n     envoy. We look forward to the Conference on Investment and \n     Trade for Ireland to be held in Washington in May. The aim of \n     the conference, according to its mandate, is ``to show U.S. \n     companies that sustained peace is dramatically improving \n     business opportunities on the island of Ireland, and \n     particularly Northern Ireland and the border counties.'' We \n     are confident it will encourage new American investment and \n     enhance the prospects for peace.\n       We support the International Fund for Ireland as an \n     important part of the search for peace. The Fund has helped \n     create more than 25,000 jobs in the most disadvantaged areas \n     of Northern Ireland and the border counties, and has had a \n     major beneficial impact on the people in these areas.\n       We agree with the Committee on the Administration of \n     Justice, an independent human rights organization in Northern \n     Ireland, that ``respect for and defense of human rights must \n     be the cornerstone of any lasting settlement to the \n     conflict.'' Britain should follow Ireland's lead and repeal \n     emergency legislation with respect to Northern Ireland. There \n     should be a thorough review of policing in Northern Ireland, \n     with the goal of creating a police force that has the \n     confidence of both communities. A Bill of Rights should be \n     enacted to provide full protection for all people in Northern \n     Ireland. Employment discrimination must be ended. We welcome \n     advances in legislation involving fair employment; but twice \n     as many Catholics as Protestants continue to be unemployed, \n     and new economic initiatives are needed to address this \n     injustice.\n       Finally, we are mindful that 1995 marks the 150th \n     anniversary of the beginning of the Great Irish Famine. \n     Though the Irish had already established a strong presence in \n     the early years of our nation, many of the 44 million Irish \n     Americans today are descendants of victims of the Famine. As \n     President Mary Robinson of Ireland has eloquently stated, \n     ``Irishness is not simply territorial * * * \n     emigration is not just a chronicle of sorrow and regret. It \n     is also a powerful story of contribution and\n      adaptation.'' Irish-Americans have contributed immensely to \n     this country, while maintaining lasting ties of heritage, \n     history, and affection for the land of our ancestors.\n       As Friends of Ireland on St. Patrick's Day 1995, we commit \n     ourselves to ever closer ties with the island of Ireland and \n     all its people. It is our hope and prayer that 1995 will \n     bring even greater progress toward lasting peace.\n\n\n                 FRIENDS OF IRELAND EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE\n\n                                 SENATE\n\n       Edward M.

Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to Robert \nPerrin Griffin, a good friend who passed away last year.\n  Bobby Griffin was a native son of South Carolina. Born in Bishopville \nin 1992, he served as a U.S. Senate page for our beloved former \ncolleague, Senator ``Cotton Ed'' Smith of South Carolina, from 1937 to \n1939, and as chief page for Vice President John Nance Garner of Texas. \nHe graduated from the Citadel in 1943, 1 year after I did.\n  After college, Bobby joined the Army. As a soldier, he distinguished \nhimself as a brave leader. As a patrol officer in World War II under \nGen. George Patton in the 3d Army, 26th Division, Captain Griffin led \nhis men into the first occupation of many enemy towns in Europe. In \nfact, he commanded his company in the first contact with German troops \nin the Ardennes campaign of 1944.\n  Madam President, Bobby Griffin was a man of enormous courage. He \nserved our country with great distinction and \n [[Page S3963]] honor. Bobby was one of the few U.S. soldiers who was a \nprisoner of war twice. He was captured at the Battle of the Bulge in \n1994 and was a German prisoner of war. He then escaped, but was \nrecaptured. For his bravery, Bobby was awarded numerous medals and \nhonors including: the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars, four Purple \nHearts, a P.O.W. medal, the American Campaign medal, the World War II \nVictory medal, and the European African Middle Eastern Campaign medal.\n  Following the war, he continued to serve our country as commander of \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars Post, 3181, in Florence and as State \ncommander of VFW in 1951.\n  Many around South Carolina remember Bobby best from his racing days. \nIn 1950, he ran the first stock car in the first Southern 500 in \nDarlington. He was also one of the original owners of the Darlington \nInternational Raceway and past member of the board of directors.\n  Bobby was an auto dealer from the 1950's through the mid-1960's. In \nthe Pee Dee, you can still spot an Oldsmobile from Griffin Motors that \nBobby probably sold. After retiring from the car company, as a vice \npresident, he spent many years in Myrtle Beach as a real estate \ndeveloper.\n  Madam President, I would like to extend my thoughts and prayers to \nBobby Griffin's friends and family. We will all miss him every much.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/15/senate-section/article/S3962-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   REPORT RELATIVE TO IRANIAN PETROLEUM RESOURCES--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                            PRESIDENT--PM 33\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the section 204(b) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(b)) and section 301 of the National \nEmergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1631), I hereby report that I have exercised \nmy statutory authority to declare a national emergency to respond to \nthe actions and policies of the Government of Iran and to issue an \nExecutive order prohibiting United States persons from entering into \ncontracts for the financing of or the overall management or supervision \nof the development of petroleum resources located in Iran or over which \nIran claims jurisdiction.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to issue regulations in \nexercise of my authorities under the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act to implement these prohibitions.

We have \nworked energetically to press the Government of Iran to cease this \nunacceptable behavior. To that end we have worked closely with Allied \ngovernments to prevent Iran's access to goods that would enhance its \nmilitary capabilities and allow it to further threaten the security of \nthe region. We have also worked to limit Iran's financial resources by \nopposing subsidized lending.\n  Iran has reacted to the limitations on its financial resources by \nnegotiating for Western firms to provide financing and know-how for \nmanagement of the development of petroleum resources. Such development \nwould provide new funds that the Iranian Government could use to \ncontinue its current policies. It continues to be the policy of the \nU.S. Government to seek to limit those resources and these prohibitions \nwill prevent United States persons from acting in a manner that \nundermines that effort.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to prohibit insured depository institutions and credit \nunions from engaging in certain activities involving derivative \nfinancial instruments; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n                 the derivatives limitation act of 1995\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I reintroduce my legislation \ncalled the Derivatives Limitation Act to prohibit banks and other \nfederally insured financial institutions from engaging in risky, \nspeculative derivatives trading on their own accounts. In my judgment \nsuch proprietary trading involves a degree of risk that is totally out \nof step with safe banking practices.\n  Last year, the General Accounting office [GAO] issued a major report \nraising a red flag about the risks of derivatives trading. Since this \nreport, a number of financial institutions and other derivative \ninvestors have suffered enormous losses totaling billions of dollars. \nBecause of tremendous growth of the derivatives market, which is now \nestimated at $35 billion worldwide, a major default, Fortune magazine \nsaid, could ignite a chain reaction that runs rampant through the \nfinancial markets in the United States and overseas. ``Inevitably, that \nwould put deposit insurance funds, and the taxpayers behind it, at \nrisk.''\n  Most of us know that derivatives are essentially a form of gambling. \nDerivatives may be the most complicated financial device ever, \ncontracts based on mathematical formulas, involving multiples and \ninterwoven bets on currency and interest rates and more in a burgeoning \ngalaxy of permutations. Generally, investors stake a position that \ninterest rates, or the dollar, or commodities, or whatever, will rise \nor fall. Up to a point, this is simply a form of hedging risk. Some \nbusinesses including banks have hedged in this manner for many years, \nand my bill would not affect these traditional and conservative hedging \ntransactions.\n  Far from hedging, some of largest players speculating in the \nderivatives game are banks. Three New York banks are into this market \nfor over $6 trillion alone. All of these banks have federal deposit \ninsurance. The purpose of my bill is to ensure that the banks don't \nhave to use it to cover losses on derivatives trading for their own \naccounts.\n  The importance of preventing banks from gambling on risky derivatives \nis highlighted by the recent collapse of Barings PLC in London. As \neveryone knows, a 28-year-old trader for Barings Bank engaged in a \nspeculative trading binge in the derivatives market. His actions have \nresulted in at least a $1 billion loss to Baring PLC, wiping out all of \nits capital and throwing it into insolvency. It is still unclear \nwhether the failure of Barings will trigger others problems for the \nglobal financial markets.\n  This is not an isolated problem affecting a single foreign \ninstitution. The list of U.S. companies that have suffered from \nderivative losses is impressive, and is still growing. For example, our \nregulators were recently forced to take over Capital Corporate Credit \nUnion [CapCorp], a large corporate credit union, because it loaded up \non derivatives called collateralized mortgage obligations [CMO's] which \nsoured over the past year. The General Accounting Office attributed \nCapCorp's failure, in part, to its inappropriate investment strategy \nand poor regulatory oversight.\n  We can't ignore the lessons to be learned from both Barings and \nCapCorp, or others hurt by derivatives like Orange County, CA, Piper \nJaffray and Procter & Gamble. Banks, thrifts, and credit unions ought \nnot be allowed to gamble on derivative investments because of the \npotential exposure to the deposit insurance fund. In my judgment, this \nfinancial roulette wheel is at odds with everything we know about sound \nbanking principles.\n  I think that yesterday's Washington Post op-ed piece on derivatives \ncalled ``Lessons from Barings'' also makes a strong case for my \nlegislation. It correctly states that ``if banks are to be allowed to \ntrade on their own accounts, with their own money--as Barings was doing \nin Singapore--that operation needs to be absolutely segregated from the \npart of the bank that takes insured deposits from the public.'' And my \nbill accomplishes this by prohibiting banks and other insured \ninstitutions from gambling with derivatives on their own accounts. It \nexempts derivatives activity that is conducted in separately \ncapitalized affiliates operating without the protection of the deposit \ninsurance safety net.\n  Again, let me point out that not all derivatives are bad. Some are \nimportant to lower capital costs and reduce interest and other \nfinancial risks. That's why I do not cover traditional hedging \ntransactions under my legislation.\n  But, it's been clear to me that highly leveraged speculation by \nlarge, federally insured banks on price changes and the like is not \nhealthy for our economy. It also threatens the long-term stability of \nthe financial markets and to continued viability of the deposit \ninsurance fund system.\n  Of course, what individual investors knowingly do with their own \nmoney is their own business. But when financial institutions are \nsetting up what amount to keno pits in their lobbies, it's something \nthat should concern us all.

A bill to amend the Lanham Act to require certain disclosures \nrelating to materially altered films; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                    the film disclosure act of 1995\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Film \nDisclosure Act of 1995.\n  This legislation would recognize the interest we all have in \npreserving the integrity of one of the most uniquely American of art \nforms--the motion picture. I personally recoil at the thought of \ncolorizing such classics as ``Casablanca'' or ``The Maltese Falcon.'' \nThese films were intended to be shown in black and white by their \ncreators.\n  Perhaps the most vivid example of an inappropriately altered film is \nthe colorization of ``Lost Horizon.'' That film was necessarily filmed \nin black and white because the mythical paradise in which it is set--\nShangri-La, a name that has come down through the decades--is formed by \nthe author's and the audience's imagination. I personally knew one of \nthe stars of the movie, Isabel Jewell, a marvelous woman, she filled me \nwith imagination as she described the filming of that remarkable film. \nIt is up to the viewer of ``Lost Horizon'' to ``fill in the blanks'' \nwhen visualizing that paradise. Quite frankly, I find colorization of \nthat particular film to be demeaning and wholly inappropriate--unfair, \nif you will.\n  However, I also believe that any legislation that addresses film \nalteration must recognize the realities of the international market. \nThe motion picture industry ranks high among all industries in \nproducing a positive cash flow in the U.S. balance of trade. While \nprotecting the artistic integrity of motion pictures, I believe it is \nalso essential that Congress do nothing to impede or harm the financial \narrangements by which motion pictures are made and distributed.\n  The object of this legislation is to ensure that the artistic authors \nof motion pictures--principal directors, screenwriters and \ncinematographers--may be able to inform the viewing public about any \nsignificant changes that are made to their work by studios or by \ntelevision stations. The bill requires that labels be affixed to all \nfilms that are exhibited in a ``materially altered'' form. The label \nwould contain two parts: first, the nature of the alterations would be \ndescribed, and second, the objection, if any, of the principal artistic \nauthors to the alterations would be clearly stated.\n  This bill does not prohibit the exhibition of materially altered \nfilms. Nor does the bill allow the principal artistic authors to have \ntheir names stricken from the altered versions of the film. The bill is \n``truth in packaging.'' That is what it is, nothing more. It simply \ngives the consumers of films vital information on: first, the changes \nthat have been made to the film, and second, the objection of the \nfilm's author to those changes, if such an objection exists. I might \nadd that film authors in many European countries have much more \nextensive rights to object to significant alterations of their work \nthan this bill would provide.\n  Here are the types of alterations--made by people other than the \nartistic authors--that this bill would require to be labeled: first, \ncolorization; second, panning and scanning--changing the film's image \nto fit wider movies onto the narrower television screen; third, \nlexiconning--altering the sound track; fourth, time compression or \nexpansion--speeding up or slowing down a film; and fifth, editing--\nremoval of material or insertion of new material.\n  I know people understand that these alterations occur with surprising \nfrequency. It is my personal belief that many of these alterations pass \nunnoticed by a viewing public which might wish to see the original \nversion intended by the artist. I also believe that these alterations \ncould discourage some artistic authors of films from making innovative \nfilms in the future. This would be a sad result.\n  However, let me emphasize again that this bill does not prevent \nalterations. It does not prevent copyright owners from changing the \nmovie when it is distributed into the secondary markets--such as \ntelevision or video stores. The bill simply will provide consumers with \ninformation on the workings of the market place for movies: it merely \nallows consumers of films to make the most informed choice possible \nwhen making their marketplace decision about what films to watch.\n  Mr. President, a little more knowledge never hurt anyone. I have \nvisited over the years on this issue with directors and artists and \nactors and actresses who are offended to see the work that they have \nplaced all of their energy and effort and skill and reputation into, \nseeing it jerked around, if you will, by people who have no sense or no \nsensitivity about the meaning of the train scene in a certain movie or \nthis particular scene in ``High Noon'' or whatever was done with power, \npassion and skill by directors and actors and actresses.\n  That is what it is about. It is about knowledge. It is about the \npublic's right to know. I hope that as this bill is reported to the \nAmerican public, we will wrap around the cherished phrase of all \njournalists, the public's right to know. That is exactly what this is. \nMore knowledge will not hurt any of the consumers. This is all the bill \nprovides, more knowledge to the consumer about the original artist's \nintent when a film is publicly shown.\n  Mr. President, I commend this bill to my colleagues and ask for their \nsupport and ask unanimous consent a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 559\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend section 6901 of title 31, United States Code, \nto entitle units of general local government to payments in lieu of \ntaxes for nontaxable Indian land; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n                        indian land legislation\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to amend section \n6901 of title 31, United States Code. This bill will provide payment in \nlieu of taxes to nontaxable Indian land that is conveyed to the \nownership of an Indian or Indian tribe or to the United States in trust \nfor an Indian or Indian tribe.\n  In 1976, Congress authorized a program to help compensate counties \nand units of local government for the loss of property taxes from the \npresence of tax-exempt Federal lands within their jurisdictions. This \nprogram, commonly referred to as payments in lieu of taxes, or PILT, is \nadministered by the Bureau of Land Management. Payments are made for \ntax-exempt Federal lands administered by the BLM, Forest Service, \nNational Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and for Federal \nwater projects and some military installations.\n  This amendment will provide compensation to local governments for \nlost revenue from land that is conveyed to an individual Indian or \ntribe and then converted to trust status. This amendment does not apply \nto Indian land that was not originally subject to property taxes or \nland converted to trust status prior to the enactment of this bill.\n  The purpose of the amendment is to provide a means for local \ngovernments to be compensated for the loss of revenue that results from \nthe tax-exempt status of Indian land without discouraging individual \nIndians and tribes from converting recently purchased land holdings \ninto trust status.\n  The additional PILT compensation will be minimal. Far more Indian \nland is converted from trust status to fee status. During the past 5 \nyears, less than 1,000 acres have been converted to trust status in \nSouth Dakota.\n  This amendment is a fair and sensible approach to remedying an \ninequity effecting local governments in South Dakota and across the \nNation.\n  Mr President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 560\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for State bank representation on the Board \nof Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n                   the state bank representation act\n\n Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, our system of State and federally \nchartered banks has served Americans well over the years. Many of the \nbank products that are most popular with consumers were first developed \nby State banks.\n  Today, together with the chairman of the Financial Institutions \nSubcommittee, Senator Shelby, I am introducing legislation to \nstrengthen the dual banking system by providing for State bank \nrepresentation on the board of Directors of the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation [FDIC]. The FDIC Board currently is made up of \nfive members: the Chairman of the FDIC, the Comptroller of the \nCurrency, the Chairman of the Office of Thrift Supervision, and two \nindependent members.\n  Mr. President, while the FDIC insures the deposits of both State and \nnational banks, no one is seated at the table who can be counted on to \npresent the perspective of State-chartered banks.\n  Decisions made and regulations issued by the FDIC have a powerful \nimpact on banks, whether they have a State or national charter. We are \nin some degree, a dangerous degree, flying blind without having both \nelements of our dual banking system participating on the FDIC Board.\n  Our legislation contains several procedural safeguards. The bill \nwould ensure that no one State would be favored over other States in \nserving on the FDIC Board. First of all, the State bank supervisor \nwould be appointed to the Board by the President and confirmed by the \nSenate. Second, such a supervisor would serve for only 2 years and \ncould not be reappointed. Neither could supervisors from the same State \nserve consecutive terms on the Board.\n  Finally, to ensure that it is the point of view of State bank \nsupervisors that is being represented, should the individual while \nserving on the FDIC Board cease to be a State bank supervisor, then \nmembership on the FDIC Board would also be lost. The President, in that \ncase, would need to appoint another supervisor, with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate, to serve for the remainder of the unexpired \nterm. Such new appointment could be, but would not have to be, an \nindividual from the same State as the individual originally appointed \nto that term.\n  As with the Comptroller of the Currency and the Chairman of the \nOffice of Thrift Supervision, a State bank supervisor would receive no \nFederal salary for service as a member of the FDIC Board.\n  Mr. President, I believe that provision should have been made for a \nState bank supervisor on the FDIC Board when the Comptroller of the \nCurrency was included on the Board. This legislation will rectify that \noversight and bring about the balance that currently does not exist.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 562\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat \nrecycling facilities as exempt facilities under the tax-exempt bond \nrules, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n [[Page S3969]] the environmental infrastructure financing act of 1995\n\n Mr. GREGG.\n Mr. President, I introduce the Environmental Infrastructure Financing \nAct of 1995. The bill will amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nallow recycling facilities to be eligible for tax-exempt bond \nfinancing.\n\n  A continuing problem in the development of recycling efforts is the \nneed for markets for the materials that are being collected. Processes \nexist for remanufacturing the recycled materials into new products, but \nthey frequently require extensive capital investment.\n  An approach that is often attempted is the use of the Federal tax-\nexempt bond program, which does have a subcategory for solid waste \nprojects. Solid waste recycling facilities should constitute a \nlegitimate application of these funds; however, certain sections of the \nTax Code define solid waste as being ``material without value.'' With \nrecycled materials now being traded as commodities, they do, in fact, \nhave value, making the facilities which might process them ineligible \nfor tax-exempt financing. This definitional problem impedes the \nconstruction of recycling facilities and hurts the development of \nrecycling materials markets.\n  My bill will correct this problem in the Tax Code and allow recycling \nfacilities to obtain tax-exempt financing. The Environmental \nInfrastructure Financing Act of 1994 will foster the further \ndevelopment of the recycling industry and promote increased recycling.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 563\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to confer and confirm Presidential authority to use \nforce abroad, to set forth principles and procedures governing the \nexercise of that authority, and thereby to facilitate cooperation \nbetween the President and Congress in decisions concerning the use or \ndeployment of U.S. Armed Forces abroad in situations of actual or \npotential hostilities.\n\n\n                            use of force act\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a piece of \nlegislation that I worked on for the last several years. As time has \npassed, I believe my arguments for the legislation in the first \ninstance are even more relevant today than they were then.\n  This legislation will replace the War Powers Resolution of 1973, and \nit is designed to provide a framework for joint congressional-Executive \ndecisionmaking about the most solemn decision that a nation can make: \nto send women and men to fight and die for their country.\n  Decades ago, a noted scholar, Edwin Corwin, characterized \nconstitutional provisions regarding the foreign policy of the Nation as \nan invitation to struggle--a struggle between the executive branch and \nthe legislative branch.\n  Professor Corwin's maxim accurately describes over 200 years of \nconstitutional history--two centuries of tension between the executive \nand the legislative branches regarding the war power.\n  But over the past four decades, what was intended as a healthy \nstruggle between the executive and legislative branches has become an \nextremely excessively divisive and chronically debilitating struggle.\n  The primary cause, in my view, is that Presidents have pushed the \nlimits of Executive prerogative, Democratic Presidents as well as \nRepublican Presidents. Their rationale has been the supposed burden of \nPresidential responsibility imposed by the stresses and dangers of the \ncold war.\n  The era began in 1950, when President Truman deployed forces to \ndefend South Korea without any congressional authorization.\n  With elaborate legal argument, Truman asserted an inherent \nPresidential authority to act unilaterally to protect the broad \ninterests of American foreign policy.\n  A nearly lone voice of concern, Senate minority leader--Mr. \nRepublican--Robert Taft--known, as I said, as Mr. Republican--declared \nthat the President had usurped authority, in violation of the laws and \nthe Constitution.\n  But Taft's pronouncements availed him little, a fate that would often \nbefall similar Executive attempts to restrain Executive aggrandizement.\n  The dissenters were overwhelmed by the proponents of a thesis: The \nthesis that in the nuclear age--when the fate of the planet itself \nappeared to rest with two men thousands of miles apart--Congress had \nlittle choice, or so it was claimed, but to cede tremendous authority \nto the Executive.\n  By the beginning of the 1970's, that thesis had become doctrine.\n  In 1970, when President Nixon sent United States forces into Cambodia \nwith neither congressional authorization nor even consultation, his \naccompanying assertions of autonomous Presidential powers were so \nsweeping and so extreme that the Senate began a search--a search led by \nRepublican Senator Jacob Javits and strongly supported by Democratic \nSenator and hawk John Stennis--the Senate began a search for some means \nof rectifying what was now perceived as a dangerous constitutional \nimbalance in favor of the Executive.\n  The result was the enactment, in 1973--my first year in the U.S. \nSenate--of the War Powers Resolution over a Presidential veto.\n  Today, over two decades later, few would dispute that the War Powers \nResolution has failed to fulfill its intent and has been, to state it \nquite simply, ineffective.\n  It is commonly said that every President has disputed the \nconstitutionality of the War Powers Act, but that is not wholly true. \nPresident Ford took no issue with the act while he was in office.\n  And President Carter explicitly vowed to comply with its provisions, \ndeclaring that he would neither endorse nor challenge its \nconstitutionality.\n  Moreover, the Carter Justice Department conducted a detailed analysis \nof the resolution and declared, quite explicitly, that its most \ncritical mechanism--the timetable for congressional authorization of \nuse of force abroad--is fully and unambiguously constitutional.\n   [[Page S3970]] Unfortunately, under the Ford and Carter \nadministrations, no body of practice under the resolution developed, \nbecause the only two military actions of that period--the Mayaguez \nincident under President Ford and Desert One under President Carter--\nwere over almost before they began.\n  Then came President Reagan and President Bush, who dealt with the \nresolution pragmatically while declaring their blanket opposition to \nits provisions.\n  Their assertion of the doctrine of broad Executive powers--what I \ncall the monarchist viewpoint--is best exemplified by President Bush's \nstatement on the eve of the gulf war.\n  With half a million American forces standing ready in Saudi Arabia, \nPresident Bush petulantly declared that he did not need permission from \nsome old goat in the Congress to kick Saddam out of Kuwait.\n   Although Mr. Bush eventually sought congressional support in the \ngulf, he did so reluctantly, and continued to assert that he sought \nonly support, refusing to concede that congressional authorization was \na legal necessity.\n  More recently, the notion of broad Executive power was claimed on the \neve of the invasion of Haiti--an invasion that, thankfully, was averted \nby a last-minute diplomatic initiative.\n  Last summer, Clinton administration officials characterized the Haiti \noperation as a mere police action, a semantic dodge designed to avoid \nthe need for congressional authorization.\n  Some of my Democratic colleagues suggested that the war clause of the \nConstitution was entirely ceremonial and that the President had \nvirtually unlimited discretion to order an invasion of Haiti. These \nwere some of the same Democrats who stood here on the floor and said \nPresident Bush did not have the authority to act in the gulf without \ncongressional assent; proving the axiom that Senators and Congressmen \ntend to pick what side of their issue they are on depending on the \npartisan need.\n  We have the interesting phenomena, Republicans on the floor who said \nthere was a broad range of congressional authority, but when it came to \nClinton exercising it, saying, no, he did not have the authority; and \nDemocrats who were on the floor telling President Bush he did not have \nthe authority but saying, no, President Clinton does. To be sure, there \nwere some of my Republicans and Democratic friends who were \nconsistent--who may have questioned the President's policy in Haiti but \ndid not question the right to deploy those troops in the absence of \ncongressional consent.\n  In my view, the assertions expressed during the Haitian crisis \nunderscore that the doctrine asserted by President Nixon 25 years ago \nstill grips the executive branch. More alarming, the congressional \nviewpoints I summarized suggest that the legislative surrender of the \nwar power continues, based in part on whether or not the man or woman \nin power is a man of your party and whether you agree with him on the \nsubstance of the action.\n  With all respect to my colleagues and the administration, I believe \nthis President, the last President, and the Presidents under whom I \nhave served have misread the Constitution. Article I, section 8, clause \n11, grants to the Congress the power ``To declare War, grant Letters of \nMarque and Reprisal and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and \nWater.''\n  To the President, the Constitution provides in article II, section 2, \nthe role of ``Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United \nStates.'' It may fairly be said that with regard to many constitutional \nprovisions, the framers' intent was ambiguous, but not on the war \npower. Both the contemporaneous evidence and the early construction of \nthese clauses, in my view, do not leave much room for doubt.\n  The original draft of the U.S. Constitution would have given the \nCongress the power to ``make war.'' At the Constitutional Convention in \nPhiladelphia, a motion was made to change to ``make war,'' to ``declare \nwar.''\n  The reason for the change is very instructive. At the convention, \nJames Madison and Elbridge Gerry argue for an amendment solely in order \nto permit the President the power ``to repel sudden attacks.'' They \nwere fearful if you said it was the power of the Congress to make war, \nthat could be read to deny the President the authority without \ncongressional power to repel sudden attacks.\n  Just one delegate at the convention, Pierce Butler of South Carolina, \nsuggested that the President should be given the power to initiate war. \nAll others disagreed. Only one to suggest that the President had the \npower to initiate war. The rationale for vesting the power to launch \nwar in the U.S. Congress was quite simple: The framers knew their \nhistory. The framers' thoughts were dominated by their experience with \nthe British king who had unfettered power to start wars and spend the \ntreasure and blood of his nation. Such powers the framers were \ndetermined to deny the President of the United States.\n  George Mason, for example, explained that he was opposed to giving \nthe power to initiate war to the President because the President, the \nExecutive, he believed, was not to be safely trusted with that power. \nEven Alexander Hamilton, a staunch advocate of Presidential power, \nemphasized that the President's power as Commander in Chief would be \n``much inferior'' to the British kings, amounting to ``nothing more \nthan the supreme command and direction of the military and naval \nforces,'' while that of the British king ``extends to the declaring of \nwar and the raising and regulation of fleets and armies--all which [by \nthe U.S.] Constitution would appertain to the legislature.''\n  It is frequently contended by those who favor vast Presidential \npowers that Congress was granted only ceremonial power to declare war, \nin effect, a designation to provide fair notice to the opposing States, \nand legal notice to neutral parties. At least that is what they argue.\n  But the framers had little interest, it seems, in the ceremonial \naspects of war. The real issue was congressional authorization of war. \nAs Hamilton noted in Federalist 25, ``The ceremony of a formal \ndenunciation of war has of late fallen into disuse.'' Indeed, by one \nhistorian's account, just 1 war in 10 was formally declared in the \nyears between 1700 and 1870--1 in 10.\n  The proposition that Congress had the power to initiate all wars \nexcept to repel attack on the United States is also strengthened in \nview of the second part of the war clause. That is the power to ``grant \nLetters of Marque and Reprisal.''\n  Now, most Americans, I daresay most Members of Congress, I daresay \nmost members of Government, do not even know what the ``power to grant \nLetters of Marque and Reprisal'' means and why it is in the \nConstitution. An anachronism today, letters of marque and reprisals \nwere licenses issued by governments, usually to private citizens, but \non occasion to government agents, empowering these private citizens or \ngovernment agents to seize enemy ships or take action on land, short of \nall-out war.\n  In essence, it was the 18th century version of what we now regard as \nlimited war or police actions. That is what letters of marque and \nreprisal were. If you are having trouble with pirates off the coast, \nyou are not looking to declare war. The Federal Government, in this \ncase the Congress, could go out and hire out, give permission to, give \na letter of marque and reprisal to a local. Think of it in terms of a \nlocal security agency that comes by and patrols your neighborhoods. You \ncould give letters of marque or reprisal and say, ``You are authorized \nunder the law, through the Congress, to go seize those pirate ships.''\n  That is what it was about. A leading commentator of the day--that is, \nthe late 1700's--a leading commentator of the day on international law \nexplained the distinction this way: ``A perfect war is that which \nentirely interrupts the tranquility of the state. An imperfect war, on \nthe contrary, is that which does not entirely interrupt the peace. \nReprisals are that imperfect kind of war.''\n  So, when we hear people talk about imperfect wars, it is used as a \nterm of art as it was used back in the late 1700's. The framers \nundoubtedly knew that reprisals or imperfect wars could lead to general \nor all-out wars. England, for example, had fought five wars between \n1652 and 1756 which were preceded by public naval reprisals.\n   [[Page S3971]] That is, if you gave these letters of marque to \nsomeone or a group of people to go out and seize shipping, it was \nacknowledged that that could lead to a larger war. If the nation from \nwhich those ships came decided that it was not in their interest, they \nmay very well send a larger armada and you are at war. You move from \nthat imperfect war to the so-called perfect war--an odd phrase, \n``perfect war.''\n  Surely, those who met at Philadelphia, all learned men, knew and \nunderstood this history of marque and reprisals. Given this \nunderstanding, the only logical conclusion that the framers intended by \nvesting the power to grant these letters of marque and reprisal \nauthorizing imperfect war in the Congress, could be that it was \ndesigned to grant to Congress the power to initiate all hostilities, \neven limited wars.\n  To review for a second, they changed from ``make'' to ``declare\" in \nthe Constitution for the purpose of allowing the President not to \ninitiate a war, perfect or imperfect, large or small, but for the \npurpose of allowing the President to respond to a sudden attack.\n  Then to be sure everyone understood what they meant, they said, ``And \nby the way, we are going to vest in the section of the Constitution \nthat relates to congressional power the exclusive power to the Congress \nof issuing these letters of marque and reprisal.''\n  So they not only said Congress can only initiate war and the \nPresident can only respond, but even limited war only the Congress can \ninitiate.\n  A comparison of the war clause to related constitutional provisions \nsuggest that this interpretation is the correct one. Unlike other \nforeign affairs provisions in the Constitution which grant to the \nPresident and the Senate the shared power to make treaties and appoint \nambassadors, when it comes to the war power the Constitution provides a \nrole for the Senate and the House of Representatives--but not a shared \nresponsibility between the branches.\n  The inclusion of the House, in particular, suggests a determination \nto mandate that public consensus be achieved before the initiation of a \nwar.\n  Think about it. If the Founders thought that they should not give the \npower to raise taxes to the Senate because we were more like the House \nof Lords, and that all taxes must be initiated in the House of \nRepresentatives, why did they do that? They did that because they knew \nthat taxation could affect people's lives so drastically that it should \nbe a democratic decision and it should be made first and foremost in \nthe people's house, that group of legislators who stand for election \nevery 2 years and are immediately answerable to the public.\n  If they thought it was so important and so critical that taxes should \nbe determined by the people's house because it had such an impact on \nthe lives of the average citizen, what do you think they thought about \nthe power of a Government to take your son or daughter and send them to \nwar and die? It is illogical to me, and those who say that the \nPresident has this exclusive authority, to suggest that they would \nworry about taxation but not worry about taking a nation to war, which \ncan cost them their lives, their monetary treasure, their lifeblood.\n  The inclusion of the House in the decision to go to war was because \nthe House was designed to be closely attuned to the views of the Nation \nand thereby would provide a means for gauging and ensuring public \nsupport for any war.\n  Moreover, with both Chambers involved in the decision to go to war, \nthe initiation of war could necessarily be slowed by the simple fact \nthat securing passage of statutory authorization or a declaration of \nwar through both Houses is potentially a time-consuming and cumbersome \nprocess. That is what it was intended to be, because when one goes to \nwar, you cannot say, short of surrender, 2 weeks into it or 1 month \ninto it, ``By the way, we made a mistake, we're passing legislation to \ncorrect it.'' You can do that with taxes. You can pass a tax bill and 2 \nmonths later, 3 months later say, ``We made a mistake and rescind it.'' \nYou do not rescind a war.\n  So it was intended--it was intended--in the Constitution that \ndecision to go to war--not to repel attack, to go to war--to initiate \nwar, to alter the state of peace, it was intended that it should be a \nprocess that consumed some time.\n  It is bordering on the irrational, in my view, to suggest that the \nframers thought the appointment of ambassadors, although an important \ntask, but not of the same consequence as war, that the appointment of \nambassadors was so critical that they gave the Senate a veto power over \nit, but they considered the war powers so trivial that the decision to \nsend Americans to fight and die was left deliberately vague so as to \npermit the Executive reasonable discretion to launch hostilities at his \nor her whim.\n  I think that is irrational for anyone to think that is what the \nFramers thought, that who we have as Ambassador to England is so \nimportant that we are not going to leave it to a President alone, we \nare going to require the Senate to go along with it, but going to war \nwith England was so trivial that we did not have to consult the United \nStates Senate or did not have to consult the people's House before a \nPresident could take us to war. That is, in my humble opinion, an \nirrational view.\n  In the same vein, I am continually amazed that many of my colleagues \nwho zealously guard the Senate's power to advise and consent to \ntreaties and to ambassadorial appointments, so cavalierly cede the war \npower to the Executive. I find that fascinating. What more can impact \non the life of the average American than taking the Nation to war? Why \nwould they possibly have left that to the President alone but said, \n``By the way, when you want to stop a war, when you want to have a \ntreaty, the President has no authority to do that. He has to come to us \nand get a supermajority.''\n  Does that make any sense? Talk about tortured logic. Yet, we have \npeople on this floor, in the 22 years I have been here--and when I got \nhere, the Vietnam war was still going on; that is one of the reasons I \nran for the Senate in the first place--we have Members in both \npolitical parties with whom I have served and have great respect \nsaying, ``War is up to the President, but who the Ambassador is, you \nbetter check with me.''\n War is up to the President. But whether there is a peace treaty, you \nbetter check with me.\n\n  I would respectfully suggest the reason that many have adopted that \nposition is they do not have the political courage to take a stand on \nwhether or not we should go to war.\n  In sum, to accept the proposition that the war power is merely \nceremonial, or applies only to big wars, is to read much of the war \nclause out of the U.S. Constitution. And such a reading is supported \nneither by the plain language of the text or the original intention of \nthe Framers of the Constitution.\n  In describing the Framers' intent, I hasten to add a caveat. We \nshould always be cautious about our ability to divine the intentions of \nthose who came 200 years before us, particularly when the documentary \nrecord is not at all voluminous.\n  But any doubt about the wisdom of relying on original intent alone, \nin my view, is dispelled in view of the actions of the early \nPresidents, early Congresses, and early Supreme Court decisions.\n\n\n         Early practice--shedding light on the Framers' intent\n\n  Let me speak to that a minute. Advocates of Executive power often \nassert that Presidents have used force throughout our history without \ncongressional consent. But with all due respect, history does not \nsupport that claim.\n  Indeed, our earliest Presidents, who were involved in the \nratification of the Constitution, were extremely cautious about \nencroaching on Congress' power under the war clause.\n  Our first President, George Washington, adhered to the view that only \nCongress could authorize offensive action. Writing in 1793, President \nWashington stated that offensive operations against an Indian tribe, \nthe Creek Nation, depended on congressional action alone.\n  Let me quote from what Washington wrote. Washington as President \nsaid:\n\n       The Constitution vests the power of declaring war with the \n     Congress; therefore, no offensive expedition of importance \n     can be undertaken until after they have deliberated upon the \n     subject, and authorized such a measure.\n\n  That was George Washington.\n   [[Page S3972]] During the Presidency of John Adams, the United \nStates engaged in an undeclared naval war with France. These military \nengagements were clearly authorized by the Congress in a series of \nincremental statutes.\n  The naval war with France also yielded three important Supreme Court \ndecisions regarding the scope of the war power.\n  In 1799, Congress authorized the President to intercept any United \nStates vessel headed to France. President Adams subsequently ordered \nthe Navy to seize any ship traveling to or from France. The Supreme \nCourt declared the seizure of a United States vessel traveling from \nFrance to be illegal, thus ruling that Congress had the power not only \nto authorize limited war but also to limit Presidential power to take \nmilitary action.\n  The Court ruled in two other cases bearing on the question of limited \nwar. Wars, the Court said, even if ``imperfect,'' are nonetheless wars.\n  In still another case, Chief Justice Marshall opined that:\n\n       The whole powers of war [are] by the Constitution . . . \n     vested in the Congress . . . [which] may authorize general \n     hostilities . . . or partial war.\n\n  Now, modern monarchists, those who lean and tilt so far to the \nPresident on this, refer habitually to the actions of our third \nPresident, Thomas Jefferson, in coping with the Barbary pirates. But \nJefferson's actions provide little solace to advocates of that \nposition.\n  In May of 1801, President Jefferson deployed a small squadron of \nships to the Mediterranean to deter attacks against American shipping. \nActing under the authority of an act of Congress which mandated that \nsix frigates be maintained in the Navy during peacetime, Jefferson \ninstructed the naval commander that if he arrived and found that the \nBarbary powers had declared war against the United States, to take \naction if necessary ``to protect commerce.''\n  But when he learned that the leader of Tripoli had, in fact, declared \nwar, Jefferson referred the matter to the Congress.\n  Reporting on a small skirmish won by a U.S. ship, Jefferson noted \nthat the American ship was authorized by the Constitution, without the \nsanction of Congress, to go beyond the line of defense, and thus the \nU.S. commander did not take possession of the ship or retain its crew \nas prisoners of war.\n   Jefferson sought further guidance from Congress about the next step, \nand I quote:\n\n       The legislature will doubtless consider whether, by \n     authorizing measures of offence also, [Congress] will . . . \n     place our forces on an equal footing [with the Tripolitan \n     forces].\n\n  Congress promptly enacted a statute empowering Jefferson to protect \nU.S. shipping, and to seize vessels owned by the Tripoli regime. The \nlegislation passed 2 years later gave explicit support for ``warlike \noperations against Tripoli or other Barbary powers.''\n  I believe this episode, and the historical record of actions taken by \nother early Presidents, has significantly more bearing on the meaning \nof the war clause than the record of Presidents in the modern era.\n  The reasons should be obvious. The men who were at Philadelphia and \nwrote the Constitution--or, as in Jefferson's case, participated in the \nratification debates in the States--had a much better understanding of \nthe intended meaning of the constitutional provisions than those of us \n200 years later have. They participated.\n  Their actions while in office should, therefore, be given great \nweight in interpreting the constitutional clauses in question. As Chief \nJustice Warren once wrote, ``The precedential value of [prior practice] \ntends to increase in proportion to the proximity'' to that \nConstitutional Convention.\n\n\n                  Restoring the Constitutional balance\n\n  Unfortunately, this constitutional history seems largely forgotten, \nand the doctrine of Presidential power that arose during the four \ndecades of the cold war continues to remain in vogue--even, to my \ndismay, among many of my colleagues in the Congress.\n  To accept this situation requires us to believe that the \nconstitutional imbalance serves our Nation well. But it can hardly be \nsaid that it does.\n  As matters now stand, Congress is denied its proper role in sharing \nthe decision to commit American troops, and the President is deprived \nof the consensus he needs to help carry that policy through.\n  Only by establishing an effective war powers mechanism can we ensure \nthat both of these goals are met. More importantly, we will guarantee \nthat the will of the American people will stand behind the commitment \nof U.S. forces.\n  The question then is this: How to revise the War Powers Resolution in \na manner that gains bipartisan support as well as the support of the \nExecutive?\n  In the past two decades, a premise has gained wide acceptance that \nthe War Powers Resolution is fatally flawed. Indeed, there are flaws in \nthe resolution, but they need not have been fatal.\n  For that law was designed--by legislators who were statesmen of a \nmarkedly conservative stripe--to embody constitutional principles and \nto set forth practical procedures.\n  Ironically, a law designed to improve executive-legislative branch \ncomity on the war power has instead contributed to frequent squabbles \nabout the minutiae of the law's provisions.\n  In 1988, determining that a review of the War Powers Resolution was \nin order, the Foreign Relations Committee established a special \nsubcommittee to assume the task.\n  As chairman of the subcommittee, I conducted an exhaustive series of \nhearings, the most extensive hearings held in recent times on this \nsubject.\n  Over the course of 2 months, the subcommittee heard from many \ndistinguished witnesses: Former President Ford, former Secretaries of \nState and Defense, former Joint Chiefs of Staff, former Members of \nCongress who drafted the law, and many constitutional scholars.\n  At the end of that process, I produced a lengthy law review article \ndescribing how the War Powers Resolution might be thoroughly rewritten \nto overcome its actual and perceived liabilities.\n  I envisaged its replacement by a new act entitled ``The Use of Force \nAct''--which would aim to achieve, at long last, the goal of its \npredecessor: To restore the balance of power between the executive and \nlegislative branches regarding the war power for purposes of complying \nwith the intent and will of the American people as well as the \nConstitution.\n  That effort provided the foundation for the legislation I introduce \ntoday. The bill that I offer has many elements; I will briefly \nsummarize the most important.\n  First, it bears emphasis that my bill would replace the War Powers \nResolution with a new version. But I should make clear that I retain \nits central element: A time-clock mechanism that limits the President's \npower to use force abroad.\n  That mechanism, I should repeat, was found to be unambiguously \nconstitutional in a 1980 opinion issued by the Office of Legal Counsel \nat the Department of Justice.\n  It is often asserted that the time-clock provision is unworkable, or \nthat it invites our adversaries to make a conflict so painful in the \nshort run so as to induce timidity in the Congress, forcing the \nPresident to remove troops.\n  But with or without a war powers law, American willingness to \nundertake sustained hostilities will always be subject to democratic \npressures. A statutory mechanism is simply a means of delineating \nprocedure.\n  And the procedure set forth in this legislation assures that if the \nPresident wants an early congressional vote on a use of force abroad, \nhis congressional supporters can produce it.\n  Recent history tells us, of course, that the American people, as well \nas Congress, rally around the flag--rally around the President--rally \naround the Commander in Chief--in the early moments of a military \ndeployment.\n  Second, my bill defuses the specter that a timid Congress can simply \nsit on its hands and permit the authority for a deployment to expire.\n  As noted above, it establishes elaborate expedited procedures \ndesigned to ensure that a vote will occur. And it explicitly defeats \nthe timid Congress specter by granting to the President the authority \nhe has sought if these procedures nonetheless fail to produce a vote.\n  Thus, if the President requests authority for a sustained use of \nforce--one outside the realm of emergency-- \n [[Page S3973]] and Congress fails to vote, the President's authority \nis extended indefinitely.\n  Third, the legislation delineates what I call the going-in \nauthorities for the President to use force.\n  One fundamental weakness of the War Powers Resolution is that it \nfails to acknowledge powers that most scholars agree are inherent \nPresidential powers, such as the power to repel an armed attack upon \nthe United States or its Armed Forces, or to rescue Americans abroad.\n  My legislation corrects this deficiency--and thus avoids the endless \ndispute over where the exact location of the line between what the \nPresident already possesses independently and what Congress was \nbestowing upon him by legislation--where that line rests.\n  The bill enumerates five instances where the President may use force:\n  First, to repel attack on U.S. territory or U.S. forces;\n  Second, to deal with urgent situations threatening supreme U.S. \ninterests--i.e. the Cuban missile crisis;\n  Third, to extricate imperiled U.S. citizens;\n  Fourth, to forestall or retaliate against specific acts of terrorism; \nand\n  Fifth, to defend against substantial threats to international sea \nlanes or airspace.\n  It may be that no such enumeration can be exhaustive. But it is worth \nnoting that the circumstances set forth would have sanctioned virtually \nevery use of force by the United States since World War II.\n  This concession of authority is circumscribed by the maintenance of \nthe time-clock provision. After 60 days have passed--2 months--the \nPresident's authority would expire, unless 1 of 3 conditions had been \nmet:\n  First, Congress has declared war or enacted specific statutory \nauthorization; or\n  Second, the President has requested authority for an extended use of \nforce but Congress has failed to act on that request, notwithstanding \nthe expedited procedures established by this act--that is, Congress, if \nhe asks to continue the force must act to tell him he cannot or it is \npresumed he can continue--or;\n  Third, the President has certified the existence of an emergency \nthreatening the supreme national interests of the United States; in \nwhich case he can continue the force in place.\n  The legislation also affirms the importance of consultation between \nthe President and Congress and establishes a new means to facilitate \nthat consultation.\n  To overcome the common complaint that Presidents must contend with \n``535 secretaries of state''--that is 535 Members of Congress--the Use \nof Force Act establishes a congressional leadership group with whom the \nPresident is mandated to consult on the use of force.\n  Another infirmity of the War Powers Resolution is that it fails to \ndefine ``hostilities.'' Thus, Presidents frequently engaged in a verbal \ngymnastics of insisting that ``hostilities'' were not ``imminent.'' \nEven when hundreds of thousands of troops were positioned in the \nArabian desert opposite Saddam's legions,\n President Bush argued that they were not in an area of hostilities \nand, even if they were, there was no prospect of imminent hostilities. \nTherefore the War Powers Act would not be triggered and engaged.\n\n  Therefore, my legislation includes a more precise definition of what \nconstitutes the use of force. And this definition contains two \nelements:\n  First, a new commitment of U.S. forces, and second, the deployment is \naimed at deterring a specific threat, the forces deployed have incurred \nor inflicted casualties, or are operating with a substantial \npossibility of incurring or inflicting casualties.\n  If those conditions are met then there is a use of force as defined \nin the law.\n  Finally, to make the statutory mechanism complete, the Use of Force \nAct provides a means for judicial review.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I am reluctant to inject the judiciary \ninto decisions that should be made by the political branches. \nTherefore, the provision is extremely limited: It empowers a three-\njudge panel to decide only whether the time-clock mechanism has been \ntriggered.\n  I have no illusions that enacting this legislation will be easy. The \nexperience of the War Powers Resolution gives witness to the difficulty \nof finding the proper balance between the executive and legislative \nbranches on war powers.\n  But I am determined to try. The status quo, with Presidents asserting \nbroad executive powers, and Congress often content to surrender its \nconstitutional powers, serves neither branch, and clearly does not \nserve the American people.\n  More fundamentally, it does not serve the men and women who risk \ntheir lives to defend our interests. For that, ultimately, must be the \ntest of any war powers law.\n  Mr. President, some would argue now that the cold war is over there \nis less need for this delineation of authority, this new set of ground \nrules. I would argue nothing could be further from the truth. We are \nmore likely to be pulled into hostilities--although not a world war III \nin all probability. More Americans have been engaged in areas of \nhostility, have been killed, and have been put on the battlefield since \nthe cold war has ended than all during the cold war but for Korea and \nVietnam, in little parts of the world all over the world: Bosnia, \nSomalia, and Haiti. What happens in a decade, a year from now--in the \nUkraine, Byelarus, Russia--or any number of places where there might be \nhostilities and Americans or entire divisions of Americans may be \ncalled to action?\n  So, Mr. President, I think to have an ordered plan to diminish the \nbickering between the executive and legislative branches on this issue \nis more needed today than it has been at any time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill that \nI have sent to the desk and the accompanying section-by-section \nanalysis be included in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 564\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress affirms that--\n       (1) the provisions of the United States Constitution compel \n     the President and Congress to engage actively and jointly in \n     decisions to use force abroad;\n       (2) joint deliberation by the two branches will contribute \n     to sound decisions and to the public support necessary to \n     sustain any use of force abroad; and\n       (3) a statutory framework, devised to promote consultation \n     and timely authorization as may be needed for specific uses \n     of force, can facilitate cooperation between the Congress and \n     the President in such decisionmaking.\n\n     SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The purpose of this Act is to confer and \n     confirm Presidential authority to use force abroad, to set \n     forth principles and procedures governing the exercise of \n     that authority, and thereby to facilitate cooperation between \n     the President and Congress in decisions concerning the use or \n     deployment of United States Armed Forces abroad in situations \n     of actual or potential hostilities.\n       (b) Exclusivity of Provisions.--Because this Act confirms \n     all of the President's inherent constitutional authority to \n     use force abroad and confers additional authority, this Act \n     applies to all uses of force abroad by the United States.\n\n     SEC. 5.

INTERPRETATION.\n\n       (a) Construction.--Nothing in this Act may be construed as \n     requiring any use of force abroad.\n       (b) Specific Authorization Required.--Authority to use \n     force may not be inferred--\n       (1) from any provision of law, unless such provision states \n     that it is intended to constitute specific statutory \n     authorization within the meaning of this Act; or\n       (2) from any treaty heretofore or hereafter ratified unless \n     such treaty is implemented by a statute stating that it is \n     intended to constitute specific statutory authorization \n     within the meaning of this Act.\n       (c) Status of Certain Congressional Actions.--The \n     disapproval by Congress of, or the failure of Congress to \n     approve, a measure--\n       (1) terminating, limiting, or prohibiting a use of force; \n     or\n       (2) containing a finding described in section 105(b);\n\n     may not be construed as indicating congressional \n     authorization or approval of, or acquiescence in, a use of \n     force abroad, or as a congressional finding that a use of \n     force abroad is being conducted in a manner consistent with \n     this Act.\n\n     SEC. 109. SEVERABILITY.\n\n       (a) Severability.--Except as provided in subsection (b), if \n     any provision of this Act or the application thereof to any \n     person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the \n     Act and the application of such provision to any other person \n     or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\n       (b) Exception.--If section 101(b), 103, 104, or 106 of this \n     Act or the application thereof to any person or circumstance \n     is held invalid, section 101(a) of this Act shall be deemed \n     invalid and the application thereof to any other person or \n     circumstance shall be null and void.\n\n     SEC. 110.

CONGRESSIONAL PRIORITY PROCEDURES.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n       (1) the term ``resolution'' means any resolution described \n     in subsection (a) or (b) of section 105; and\n       (2) the term ``session days'' means days on which the \n     respective House of Congress is in session.\n       (b) Referral of Resolutions.--A resolution introduced in \n     the House of Representatives shall be referred to the \n     Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives. A resolution introduced in the Senate shall \n     be referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the \n     Senate.\n       (c) Discharge of Committee.--(1) If the committee to which \n     is referred a resolution has not reported such a resolution \n     (or an identical resolution) at the end of 7 calendar days \n     after its introduction, such committee shall be discharged \n     from further consideration of such resolution, and such \n     resolution shall be placed on the appropriate calendar of the \n     House of Congress involved.\n       (2) After a committee reports or is discharged from a \n     resolution, no other resolution with respect to the same use \n     of force may be reported by or be discharged from such \n     committee while the first resolution is before the respective \n     House of Congress (including remaining on the calendar), a \n     committee of conference, or the President. This paragraph may \n     not be construed to prohibit concurrent consideration of a \n     joint resolution described in section 105(a) and a concurrent \n     resolution described in section 105(b).\n       (d) Consideration of Resolutions.--(1)(A) Whenever the \n     committee to which a resolution is referred has reported, or \n     has been discharged under subsection (c) from further \n     consideration of such resolution, notwithstanding any rule or \n     precedent of the Senate, \n      [[Page S3976]] including Rule 22, it is at any time \n     thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the \n     same effect has been disagreed to) for any Member of the \n     respective House of Congress to move to proceed to the \n     consideration of the resolution and, except as provided in \n     subparagraph (B) of this paragraph or paragraph (2) of this \n     subsection (insofar as it related to germaneness and \n     relevancy of amendments), all points of order against the \n     resolution and consideration of the resolution are waived. \n     The motion is highly privileged in the House of \n     Representatives and is privileged in the Senate and is not \n     debatable. The motion is not subject to a motion to postpone. \n     A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed \n     to or disagreed to shall be in order, except that such motion \n     may not be entered for future disposition. If a motion to \n     proceed to the consideration of the resolution is agreed to, \n     the resolution shall remain the unfinished business of the \n     respective House of Congress, to the exclusion of all other \n     business, until disposed of, except as otherwise provided in \n     subsection (e)(1).\n       (B) Whenever a point of order is raised in the Senate \n     against the privileged status of a resolution that has been \n     laid before the Senate and been initially identified as \n     privileged for consideration under this section upon its \n     introduction pursuant to section 105, such point of order \n     shall be submitted directly to the Senate. The point of \n     order, ``The resolution is not privileged under the Use of \n     Force Act'', shall be decided by the yeas and the nays after \n     four hours of debate, equally divided between, and controlled \n     by, the Member raising the point of order and the manager of \n     the resolution, except that in the event the manager is in \n     favor of such point of order, the time in opposition thereto \n     shall be controlled by the Minority Leader or his designee. \n     Such point of order shall not be considered to establish \n     precedent for determination of future cases.\n       (2)(A)(i) Consideration in a House of Congress of the \n     resolution, and all amendments and debatable motions in \n     connection therewith, shall be limited to not more than 12 \n     hours, which, except as otherwise provided in this section, \n     shall be equally divided between, and controlled by, the \n     Majority Leader and the Minority Leader, or by their \n     designees.\n       (ii) The Majority Leader or the Minority Leader or their \n     designees may, from the time under their control on the \n     resolution, allot additional time to any Senator during the \n     consideration of any amendment, debatable motion, or appeal.\n       (B) Only amendments which are germane and relevant to the \n     resolution are in order. Debate on any amendment to the \n     resolution shall be limited to 2 hours, except that debate on \n     any amendment to an amendment shall be limited to 1 hour. The \n     time of debate for each amendment shall be equally divided \n     between, and controlled by, the mover of the amendment and \n     the manager of the resolution, except that in the event the \n     manager is in favor of any such amendment, the time in \n     opposition thereto shall be controlled by the Minority Leader \n     or his designee.\n       (C) One amendment by the Minority Leader is in order to be \n     offered under a one-hour time limitation immediately \n     following the expiration of the 12-hour time limitation if \n     the Minority Leader has had no opportunity to offer an \n     amendment to the resolution thereto. One amendment may be \n     offered to the amendment by the Minority Leader under the \n     preceding sentence, and debate shall be limited on such \n     amendment to one-half hour which shall be equally divided \n     between, and controlled by, the mover of the amendment and \n     the manager of the resolution, except that in the event the \n     manager is in favor of any such amendment, the time in \n     opposition thereto shall be controlled by the Minority Leader \n     or his designee.\n       (D) A motion to postpone or a motion to recommit the \n     resolution is not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote \n     by which the resolution is agreed to or disagreed to is in \n     order, except that such motion may not be entered for future \n     disposition, and debate on such motion shall be limited to 1 \n     hour.\n       (3) Whenever all the time for debate on a resolution has \n     been used or yielded back, no further amendments may be \n     proposed, except as provided in paragraph (2)(C), and the \n     vote on the adoption of the resolution shall occur without \n     any intervening motion or amendment, except that a single \n     quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if requested in \n     accordance with the rules of the appropriate House of \n     Congress may occur immediately before such vote.\n       (4) Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the \n     application of the Rules of the Senate or the House of \n     Representatives, as the case may be, to the procedure \n     relating to a resolution shall be limited to one-half hour of \n     debate, equally divided between, and controlled by, the \n     Member making the appeal and the manager of the resolution, \n     except that in the event the manager is in favor of any such \n     appeal, the time in opposition thereto shall be controlled by \n     the Minority Leader or his designee.\n       (e) Treatment of Other House's Resolution.--(1) Except as \n     provided in paragraph (2), if, before the passage by one \n     House of a resolution of that House, that House receives from \n     the other House a resolution, then the following procedures \n     shall apply:\n       (A) The resolution of the sending House shall not be \n     referred to a committee in the receiving House.\n       (B) With respect to a resolution of the House receiving the \n     resolution, the procedure in that House shall be the same as \n     if no resolution had been received from the sending House, \n     except that the resolution of the sending House shall be \n     considered to have been read for the third time.\n       (C) If the resolutions of the sending and receiving Houses \n     are identical, the vote on final passage shall be on the \n     resolution of the sending House.\n       (D) If such resolutions are not identical--\n       (i) the vote on final passage shall be on the resolution of \n     the sending House, with the text of the resolution of the \n     receiving House inserted in lieu of the text of the \n     resolution of the sending House;\n       (ii) such vote on final passage shall occur without debate \n     or any intervening action; and\n       (iii) the resolution shall be returned to the sending House \n     for proceedings under subsection (g).\n       (E) Upon disposition of the resolution received from the \n     other House, it shall no longer be in order to consider the \n     resolution originated in the receiving House.\n       (2) If one House receives from the other House a resolution \n     before any such resolution is introduced in the first House, \n     then the resolution received shall be referred, in the case \n     of the House of Representatives, to the Committee on \n     International Relations and, in the case of the Senate, to \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations, and the procedures in \n     that House with respect to that resolution shall be the same \n     under this section as if the resolution received had been \n     introduced in that House.\n       (f) Treatment of Identical Resolutions.--If one House \n     receives from the other House a resolution after the first \n     House has disposed of an identical resolution, it shall be in \n     order to proceed by nondebatable motion to consideration of \n     the resolution received by the first House, and that received \n     resolution shall be disposed of without debate and without \n     amendment.\n       (g) Procedures Applicable to Amendments Between the Houses \n     of Congress.--The following procedures shall apply to dispose \n     of amendments between the Houses of Congress:\n       (1) Upon receipt by a House of Congress of a message from \n     the other House with respect to a resolution, it is in order \n     for any Member of the House receiving the message to move to \n     proceed to the consideration of the respective resolution. \n     Such motion shall be disposed of in the same manner as a \n     motion under subsection (d)(1)(A). Such a motion is not in \n     order after conferees have been appointed.\n       (2)(A) The time for debate in a House of Congress on any \n     motion required for the disposition of an amendment by the \n     other House to the resolution shall not exceed 2 hours, \n     equally divided between, and controlled by, the mover of the \n     motion and manager of the resolution at each stage of the \n     proceedings between the two Houses, except that in the event \n     the manager is in favor of any such motion, the time in \n     opposition thereto shall be controlled by the Minority Leader \n     or his designee.\n       (B) The time for debate for each amendment to a motion \n     shall be limited to one-half hour.\n       (C) Only motions proposing amendments which are germane and \n     relevant are in order.\n       (h) Procedures Applicable to Conference Reports and \n     Presidential Action.--(1) Either House of Congress may \n     disagree to an amendment or amendments made by the other \n     House to a resolution or may insist upon its amendment or \n     amendments to a resolution, and request a conference with the \n     other House at anytime. In the case of any disagreement \n     between the two Houses of Congress with respect to an \n     amendment or amendments to a resolution which is not resolved \n     within 2 session days after a House of Congress first amends \n     the resolution originated by the other House, each House \n     shall be deemed to have requested and accepted a conference \n     with the other House. Upon the request or acceptance of a \n     conference, in the case of the Senate, the President pro \n     tempore shall appoint conferees and, in the case of the House \n     of Representatives, the Speaker of the House shall appoint \n     conferees.\n       (2) In the event the conferees are unable to agree within \n     72 hours after the second House is notified that the first \n     House has agreed to conference, or after each House is deemed \n     to have agreed to conference, they shall report back to their \n     respective House in disagreement.\n       (3) Notwithstanding any rule in either House of Congress \n     concerning the printing of conference reports in the \n     Congressional Record or concerning any delay in the \n     consideration of such reports, such report, including a \n     report filed or returned in disagreement, shall be acted on \n     in the House of Representatives or the Senate not later than \n     2 session days after the first House files the report or, in \n     the case of the Senate acting first, the report is first made \n     available on the desks of the Senators.\n       (4) Debate in a House of Congress on a conference report or \n     a report filed or returned in disagreement in any such \n     resolution shall be limited to 3 hours, equally divided \n     between the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader, and \n     their designees.\n       (5) In the case of a conference report returned to a House \n     of Congress in disagreement, an amendment to the amendment in \n     disagreement is only in order if it is germane and relevant. \n     The time for debate for such an amendment shall be limited to \n     one-half \n      [[Page S3977]] hour, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the mover of the amendment and the manager of \n     the resolution, except that in the event the manager is in \n     favor of any such amendment, the time in opposition thereto \n     shall be controlled by the Minority Leader or his designee.\n       (6) If a resolution is vetoed by the President, the time \n     for debate in consideration of the veto message on such \n     measure shall be limited to 20 hours in each House of \n     Congress, equally divided between, and controlled by, the \n     Majority Leader and the Minority Leader, and their designees.\n       (i) Rules of the Senate and the House.--This section is \n     enacted by the Congress--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is \n     deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of a resolution, and it supersedes \n     other rules only to the extent that it is inconsistent with \n     such rules; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change rules (so far as relating to the \n     procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and \n     to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that \n     House.\n\n     SEC. 202. REPEAL OF OBSOLETE EXPEDITED PROCEDURES.\n\n       Section 1013 of the Department of State Authorization Act, \n     Fiscal Years 1984 and 1985 (50 U.S.C. 1546a), relating to \n     expedited procedures for certain joint resolutions and bills, \n     is repealed.\n                                                                    ____\n\n             Use of Force Act--Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1. Short Title. The title of the bill is the ``Use \n     of Force Act (UFA).''\n       Section 2. Table of Contents.\n       Section 3. Findings. This section sets forth three findings \n     regarding the need to provide a statutory framework to \n     facilitate joint decisionmaking between Congress and the \n     President regarding decisions to use force abroad.\n       Section 4. Statement of Purpose. The key phrase in this \n     section is ``confer and confirm Presidential authority.'' The \n     Use of Force Act is designed to bridge the long-standing--\n     and, for all practical purposes, unresolvable--dispute over \n     precisely what constitutes the President's ``inherent'' \n     authority to use force. Whereas the War Powers Resolution \n     purported to delineate the President's constitutional \n     authority and to grant no more, the Use of Force Act sets \n     forth a range of authorities that are practical for the \n     modern age and sufficiently broad to subsume all presidential \n     authorities deemed ``inherent'' by any reasonable \n     constitutional interpretation.\n       Section 5. Definitions. This section defines a number of \n     terms, including the term ``use of force abroad,'' thus \n     correcting a major flaw of the War Powers Resolution, which \n     left undefined the term ``hostilities.''\n       As defined in the Use of Force Act, a ``use of force \n     abroad'' comprises two prongs:\n       (1) a deployment of U.S. armed forces (either a new \n     introduction of forces, a significant expansion of the U.S. \n     military presence in a country, or a commitment to a new \n     mission or objective); and\n       (2) the deployment is aimed at deterring an identified \n     threat, or the forces deployed are incurring or inflicting \n     casualties (or are operating with a substantial possibility \n     of incurring or inflicting casualties.\n\n\n                      title i--general provisions\n\n       Section 101. Authority and Governing Principles. This \n     section sets forth the Presidential authorities being \n     ``conferred and confirmed.'' Based on the Constitution and \n     this Act, the President may use force--\n       (1) to repel an attack on U.S. territory or U.S. forces;\n       (2) to deal with urgent situations threatening supreme U.S. \n     interests;\n       (3) to extricate imperiled U.S. citizens;\n       (4) to forestall or retaliate against specific acts of \n     terrorism;\n       (5) to defend against substantial threats to international \n     sea lanes or airspace.\n       Against a complaint that this list is excessively \n     permissive, it should be emphasized that these are the \n     President's initial authorities to undertake a use of force--\n     so-called ``going in'' authorities--and that the ``staying \n     in'' conditions set forth in section 104 will, in most cases, \n     bear heavily on the President's original decision.\n       This section also sets forth two governing principles; \n     necessity and proportionality. Although unavoidably imprecise \n     in definition, these principles set important criteria \n     against which any use of force can be evaluated.\n       Section 102. Consultation. Section 102 affirms the \n     importance of consultation between the President and Congress \n     and establishes a new means to facilitate it. To overcome the \n     common complaint that Presidents must contend with ``535 \n     secretaries of state,'' the UFA establishes a Congressional \n     Leadership Group with whom the President is mandated to \n     consult on the use of force.\n       A framework of regular consultations between specified \n     Executive branch officials and relevant congressional \n     committees is also mandated in order to establish a ``norm'' \n     of consultative interaction and in hope of overcoming what \n     many find to be the overly theatrical public-hearing process \n     that has superseded the more frank and informal consultations \n     of earlier years.\n       Note: An alternative to the Use of Force Act is to repeal \n     (or effectively repeal) the War Powers Resolution and leave \n     in its place only a Congressional Leadership Group. (This is \n     the essence of S.J. Res. 323, 100th Congress, legislation to \n     amend the War Powers Resolution introduced by Senators Byrd, \n     Warner, Nunn, and Mitchell in 1988.) This approach, which \n     relies on ``consultation and the Constitution,'' avoids the \n     complexities of enacting legislation such as the UFA but \n     fails to solve chronic problems of procedure or authority, \n     leaving matters of process and power to be debated anew as \n     each crisis arises. In contrast, the Use of Force Act would \n     perform one of the valuable functions of law, which is to \n     guide individual and institutional behavior.\n       Section 103. Reporting Requirements. Section 103 requires \n     that the President report in writing to the Congress \n     concerning any use of force, not later than 48 hours after \n     commencing a use of force abroad.\n       Section 104. Conditions for Extended Use of Force. Section \n     104 sets forth the ``staying in'' conditions: that is, the \n     conditions that must be met if the President is to sustain a \n     use of force he has begun under the authorities set forth in \n     section 101. A use of force may extend beyond 60 days only \n     if--\n       (1) Congress has declared war or enacted specific statutory \n     authorization;\n       (2) the President has requested authority for an extended \n     use of force but Congress has failed to act on that request \n     (notwithstanding the expedited procedures established by \n     Title II of this Act);\n       (3) the President has certified the existence of an \n     emergency threatening the supreme national interests of the \n     United States.\n       The second and third conditions are designed to provide \n     sound means other than a declaration of war or the enactment \n     of specific statutory authority by which the President may \n     engage in an extended use of force. Through these conditions, \n     the Use of Force Act avoids two principal criticisms of the \n     War Powers Resolution: (1) that Congress could irresponsibly \n     require a force withdrawal simply through inaction; and (2) \n     that the law might, under certain cricumstances, \n     unconstitutionally deny the President the use of his \n     ``inherent'' authority.\n       To defuse the specter of a President hamstrung by a \n     Congress too timid or inept to face its responsibilities, the \n     UFA uses two means: first, it establishes elaborate expedited \n     procedures designed to ensure that a vote will occur, second, \n     it explicitly defeats the ``timid Congress'' specter by \n     granting to the President the authority he has sought if \n     these procedures nonetheless fail to produce a vote. Thus, if \n     the President requests authority for a sustained use of \n     force--one outside the realm of emergency--and Congress fails \n     to vote, the President's authority is extended indefinitely.\n       The final condition should satisfy all but proponents of an \n     extreme ``monarchist'' interpretation under which the \n     President has the constitutional authority to use force as he \n     sees fit. Under all other interpretations, the concept of an \n     ``inherent'' authority depends upon the element of emergency: \n     the need for the President to act under urgent circumstances \n     to defend the nation's security and its citizens. If so, the \n     UFA protects any ``inherent'' presidential authority by \n     affirming his ability to act for up to 60 days under the \n     broad-ranging authorities in section 101 and, in the event he \n     is prepared to certify an extended national emergency, to \n     exercise the authority available to him through the final \n     condition of section 104.\n       Section 105. Measures Eligible for Congressional Priority \n     Procedures. This section establishes criteria by which joint \n     and concurrent resolutions become eligible for the expedited \n     procedures created by Title II of the UFA.\n       A joint resolution that declares war or provides specific \n     statutory authorization--or one that terminates, limits, or \n     prohibits a use of force--becomes eligible if it is \n     introduced: (1) pursuant to a written request by the \n     President to any one member of Congress; (2) if cosponsored \n     by a majority of the members of the Congressional leadership \n     Group in the house where introduced; or (3) if cosponsored by \n     30 percent of the members of either house. Thus, there is \n     almost no conceivable instance in which a President can be \n     denied a prompt vote: he need only ask one member of Congress \n     to introduce a resolution on his behalf.\n       A concurrent resolution becomes eligible if it meets either \n     of the cosponsorship criteria cited above and contains a \n     finding that a use of force abroad began on a certain date, \n     or has exceeded the 60 day limitation, or has been undertaken \n     outside the authority provided by section 101, or is being \n     conducted in a manner inconsistent with the governing \n     principles set forth in section 101.\n       While having no direct legal effect, the passage of a \n     concurrent resolution under the UFA could have considerable \n     significance: politically, it would represent a clear, \n     prompt, and formal congressional repudiation of a \n     presidential action; within Congress, it would trigger \n     parliamentary rules blocking further consideration of \n     measures providing funds for the use of force in question (as \n     provided by section 106 of the UFA); and juridically, it \n     would become a consideration in any action brought by a \n     member of Congress for declaratory judgment and injunctive \n     relief (as envisaged by section 107 of the UFA).\n       Section 106. Funding Limitations. This section prohibits \n     the expenditure of funds for any use of force inconsistent \n     with the UFA. \n      [[Page S3978]] Further, this section exercises the power of \n     Congress to make its own rules by providing that a point of \n     order will lie against any measure containing funds to \n     perpetuate a use of force that Congress, by concurrent \n     resolution, has found to be illegitimate.\n       Section 107. Judicial Review. This section permits judicial \n     review of any action brought by a Member of Congress on the \n     grounds that the UFA has been violated. It does so by--\n       (1) granting standing to any Member of Congress who brings \n     suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia;\n       (2) providing that neither the District Court nor the \n     Supreme Court may refuse to make a determination on the \n     merits based on certain judicial doctrines, such as political \n     question or ripeness (doctrines invoked previously by courts \n     to avoid deciding cases regarding the war power);\n       (3) prescribing the judicial remedies available to the \n     District Court; and\n       (4) creating a right of direct appeal to the Supreme Court \n     and encouraging expeditious consideration of such appeal.\n       It bears emphasis that the remedy prescribed is modest, and \n     does not risk unwarranted interference of the judicial branch \n     in a decision better reposed in the political branches. The \n     bill provides only that the court may declare that the 60-day \n     period set forth in Section 104 has begun.\n       Section 108. Interpretation. This section clarifies several \n     points of interpretation, including these: that authority to \n     use force is not derived from other statutes or from treaties \n     (which create international obligations but not authority in \n     a domestic, constitutional context); and that the failure of \n     Congress to pass any joint or concurrent resolution \n     concerning a particular use of force may not be construed as \n     indicating congressional authorization or approval.\n       Section 109. Severability. This section stipulates that \n     certain sections of the UFA would be null and void, and \n     others not affected, if specified provisions of the UFA were \n     held by the Courts to be invalid.\n       Section 110. Repeal of WPR. Section 110 repeals the War \n     Powers Resolution of 1973.\n\n\n                     title ii--expedited procedures\n\n       Section 201. Priority Procedures. Section 201 provides for \n     the expedited parliamentary procedures that are integral to \n     the functioning of the Act. (These procedures are drawn from \n     the war powers legislation cited earlier, introduced by \n     Senator Robert Byrd et al. in 1988.)\n       Section 202. Repeal of Obsolete Expedited Procedures. \n     Section 202 repeals other expedited procedures provided for \n     in existing law.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for being so gracious as \nto not only sit there, but to pay attention to what I had to say. I am \nflattered he would listen. I hope that he and others will engage their \nsignificant legislative skills in trying to work out a feasible war \npowers mechanism--whether it is exactly what I have proposed or \nsomething else--so we avoid the kind of gridlock that has occurred \nalready in the last several years.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my good friend from California who has \nbeen waiting to be recognized.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  I want to say to my friend from Delaware that it is very important \nthat he continue to work on this matter of the War Powers Act because \nwhat happens to us so often is we get into a discussion about it just \nwhen we are in the middle of a conflict. That is not the time that is \nappropriate, and this is.\n  So I just wanted to thank him for his leadership.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Gorton, Mr. McConnell, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Pressler, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Exon, Mr. \n        Inhofe, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. Chafee):\n  S. 565. A bill to regulate interstate commerce by providing for a \nuniform product liability law, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n               the product liability fairness act of 1995\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nProduct Liability Fairness Act of 1995 with my esteemed colleague from \nWashington, Senator Gorton. Senator Gorton and I have joined together \nto introduce this much needed legislation to improve our Nation's \nproduct liability laws with a bipartisan group of our colleagues, Mr. \nMcConnell, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Pressler, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Exon, \nMr. Inhofe, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. Chafee. We believe the time has \ncome to reform our current system so that injured people are more \nlikely to be compensated and so that businesses are not crushed by the \ncosts of nonmeritorious inappropriate lawsuits.\n  Senator Gorton and I have worked diligently over recent months to \nhone this product liability reform legislation in order to insure that \nit strikes the right balance between the interests of both consumers \nand business, and recognizing that under our current system, legal \nprofessionals are most often the biggest and often sole winners in \nproduct liability cases. Adjustments were made to reflect substantive \nand other concerns which we concluded were obstacles to the enactment \nof this necessary legislation. We believe we have significantly \nimproved the legislation from earlier drafts and been responsive to the \nissues which prevented earlier enactment of this legislation.\n  Before I review the reasons why I believe reform of this system is \nimperative and what has motivated me to work so hard to refine this \nbill, year after year, I want to take a moment to express my deep \nadmiration for the work of the Senator from Washington and that of his \nstaff. I have great respect for Senator Gorton's intellect and insight, \nand want to acknowledge his contribution to the improvement in this \nlegislation--and the role he will play in pushing it to final \nenactment. It is a privilege to work with the distinguished new \nchairman of the Commerce Committee in crafting this year's bill.\n  Our bill will encourage alternative dispute resolution as a way of \ngetting parties to have their cases heard without going through the \ntime and expense of a court trial. It will apply different \nresponsibilities to a product seller as opposed to a manufacturer to \navoid the kind of lawsuits that cast a wide net in the hopes of \ncatching a cash cow. Our bill will give consumers more time to pursue \nlegal action and it will allow consumers greater awards for punitive \ndamages.\n  This effort is nothing new for me. For years I have called for legal \nreforms to make the system more efficient, less costly, and fairer to \nconsumers and business alike. I am tired of West Virginia \nbusinesspeople and workers and consumers paying the price for this \ninequitable, ineffective legal tangle. Paying higher costs for things \nor being denied new products because manufacturers are scared to assume \nthe exposure that comes with it. And then, when a problem does arise, \nbeing forced to spend ridiculous amounts of money and invest years in \nthe hopes of maybe getting some satisfaction.\n  The product liability system is broken, and it is hurting the people \nof West Virginia, and Washington, and every State in between. The \nRockefeller-Gorton bill aims to reform the laws so product liability is \nnot an anchor around the American economy. Our approach is bipartisan \nand balanced and, I think, far-removed from the extreme bill in the \nHouse that is long on special interest needs and short on public \ninterest fairness.\n  If today's product liability laws achieve one thing, it is that it is \nan equal opportunity victimizer. Injured consumers oftentimes find it \nimpossible to get a just and prompt resolution, and just as frequently, \nblameless manufacturers are forced to spend thousands of dollars on \nbaseless lawsuits. The system frequently allows negligent companies to \navoid penalties and even rewards undeserving plaintiffs.\n  Product liability law should deter wasteful suits and discipline \nculpable practices but not foster hours of waste and endless \nlitigation.\n  Under the patchwork system we now have, depending on which of the 51 \ndifferent jurisdictions you are in, product liability is not more \nreliable than a roll of the dice. Today a consumer, seeking fair \ncompensation for harm done by a manufacturer must brace for a legal \nordeal, often tilted in favor of business. Consumers generally recover \njust one-third of their actual damages. And that is when they can \nrecover damages at all after fighting their way through statutes of \nlimitation and corporate shell games that make assigning true liability \nofttimes impossible. If a consumer can plow through this maze, they \nmust be able to endure years of litigation that wrack up legal fees \nfaster than a taxi meter in rush-hour traffic.\n   [[Page S3979]] And businesses are little better off. Perhaps the \nbiggest manufacturers can ride out costly litigation with less \nfinancial drain than consumers, but businessowners face a dizzying \nnumber of lawsuits too often without merit. The result? Manufacturers \nabandon research and development on new products that could invite \nfuture lawsuits, and prices on products are inflated to compensate for \nliability insurance or huge legal retainers. Price inflation passed on \nto consumers who are now doubly squeezed by the liability labyrinth.\n  The Product Liability Fairness Act aims to correct this. Today, \nSenator Gorton and I introduce our bipartisan bill, with an impressive \ngroup of Senate cosponsors, and expect to begin hearings in his \nCommerce Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs in about a month.\n  Just the other day, the Washington Post quoted a business executive \nwho said, basically, that American businesses can be lumped into two \ngroups: those that have been sued and those that will be sued. That is \nno way for American industry to operate and it results in pitting \nconsumers against business to the detriment of both. The Rockefeller-\nGorton bill is a step at easing this tension and restoring some common \nsense to the American legal system.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 565\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

UNIFORM TIME LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) Statute of Limitations.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2) and \n     subsection (b), a product liability action that is subject to \n     this Act may be filed not later than 2 years after the date \n     on which the claimant discovered or, in the exercise of \n     reasonable care, should have discovered, the harm that is the \n     subject of the action and the cause of the harm.\n       (2) Exceptions.--\n       (A) Person with a legal disability.--A person with a legal \n     disability (as determined under applicable law) may file a \n     product liability action that is subject to this Act not \n     later than 2 years after the date on which the person ceases \n     to have the legal disability.\n       (B) Effect of stay or injunction.--If the commencement of a \n     civil action that is subject to this Act is stayed or \n     enjoined, the running of the statute of limitations under \n     this section shall be suspended until the end of the period \n     that the stay or injunction is in effect.\n       (b) Statute of Repose.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), no \n     product liability action that is subject to this Act \n     concerning a product that is a durable good alleged to have \n     caused harm (other than toxic harm) may be filed after the \n     20-year period beginning at the time of delivery of the \n     product.\n       (2) State law.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if pursuant \n     to an applicable State law, an action described in such \n     paragraph is required to be filed during a period that is \n     shorter than the 20-year period specified in such paragraph, \n     the State law shall apply with respect to such period.\n       (3) Exception.--A motor vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or train \n     that is used primarily to transport passengers for hire shall \n     not be subject to this subsection.\n       (c) Transitional Provision Relating to Extension of Period \n     for Bringing Certain Actions.--If any provision of subsection \n     (a) or (b) shortens the period during which a product \n     liability action that could be otherwise brought pursuant to \n     another provision of law, the claimant may, notwithstanding \n     subsections (a) and (b), bring the product liability action \n     pursuant to this Act not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 10. SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR NONECONOMIC LOSS.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--In a product liability action that is \n     subject to this Act, the liability of each defendant for \n     noneconomic loss shall be several only and shall not be \n     joint.\n       (b) Amount of Liability.--\n       (1) In general.--Each defendant shall be liable only for \n     the amount of noneconomic loss allocated to the defendant in \n     direct proportion to the percentage of responsibility of the \n     defendant (determined in accordance with paragraph (2)) for \n     the harm to the claimant with respect to which the defendant \n     is liable. The court shall render a separate judgment against \n     each defendant in an amount determined pursuant to the \n     preceding sentence.\n       (2) Percentage of responsibility.--For purposes of \n     determining the amount of noneconomic loss allocated to a \n     defendant under this section, the trier of fact shall \n     determine the percentage of responsibility of each person \n     responsible for the amount of noneconomic loss caused to the \n     claimant, whether or not such person is a party to the \n     action.\n\n      SEC. 11. WORKERS' COMPENSATION SUBROGATION STANDARDS.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--\n       (1) Right of subrogation.--\n       (A) In general.--An insurer shall have a right of \n     subrogation against a manufacturer or product seller to \n     recover any claimant's benefits relating to harm that is the \n     subject of a product liability action that is subject to this \n     Act.\n       (B) Written notification.--To assert a right of subrogation \n     under subparagraph (A), the insurer shall provide written \n     notice to the court in which the product liability action is \n     brought.\n       (C) Insurer not required to be a party.--An insurer shall \n     not be required to be a necessary and proper party in a \n     product liability action covered under subparagraph (A).\n       (2) Settlements and other legal proceedings.--\n       (A) In general.--In any proceeding relating to harm or \n     settlement with the manufacturer or product seller by a \n     claimant who files a product liability action that is subject \n     to this Act, an insurer may participate to assert a right of \n     subrogation for claimant's benefits with respect to any \n     payment made by the manufacturer or product seller by reason \n     of such harm, without regard to whether the payment is made--\n       (i) as part of a settlement;\n       (ii) in satisfaction of judgment;\n       (iii) as consideration for a covenant not to sue; or\n       (iv) in another manner.\n       (B) Written consent.--Except as provided in subparagraph \n     (C)--\n       (i) an employee shall not make any settlement with or \n     accept any payment from the manufacturer or product seller \n     without the written consent of the insurer; and\n       (ii) no release to or agreement with the manufacturer or \n     product seller described in clauses (i) through (iv) of \n     subparagraph (A) shall be valid or enforceable for any \n     purpose without the consent of the insurer.\n       (C) Exemption.--Subparagraph (B) shall not apply in any \n     case in which the insurer has been compensated for the full \n     amount of the claimant's benefits.\n       (3) Harm resulting from action of employer or coemployee.--\n       (A) In general.--If, with respect to a product liability \n     action that is subject to this Act, the manufacturer or \n     product seller attempts to persuade the trier of fact that \n     the harm to the claimant was caused by the fault of the \n     employer of the claimant or any coemployee of the claimant, \n     the issue of that fault shall be submitted to the trier of \n     fact, but only after the manufacturer or product seller has \n     provided timely written notice to the employer.\n       (B) Rights of employer.--\n       (i) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, with respect to an issue of fault submitted to a trier \n     of fact pursuant to subparagraph (A), an employer shall, in \n     the same manner as any party in the action (even if the \n     employer is not a named party in the action), have the right \n     to--\n\n       (I) appear;\n       (II) be represented;\n       (III) introduce evidence;\n       (IV) cross-examine adverse witnesses; and\n       (V) present arguments to the trier of fact.\n\n       (ii) Last issue.--The issue of harm resulting from an \n     action of an employer or coemployee shall be the last issue \n     that is presented to the trier of fact.\n       (C) Reduction of damages.--If the trier of fact finds by \n     clear and convincing evidence that the harm to the claimant \n     that is the subject of the product liability action was \n     caused by the fault of the employer or a coemployee of the \n     claimant--\n       (i) the court shall reduce by the amount of the claimant's \n     benefits--\n\n       (I) the damages awarded against the manufacturer or product \n     seller; and\n       (II) any corresponding insurer's subrogation lien; and\n\n       (ii) the manufacturer or product seller shall have no \n     further right by way of contribution or otherwise against the \n     employer.\n       (D) Certain rights of subrogation not affected.--\n     Notwithstanding a finding by the trier of fact described in \n     subparagraph (C), the insurer shall not lose any right of \n     subrogation related to any--\n       (i) intentional tort committed against the claimant by a \n     coemployee; or\n       (ii) act committed by a coemployee outside the scope of \n     normal work practices.\n       (b) Attorney's Fees.--If, in a product liability action \n     that is subject to this section, the court finds that harm to \n     a claimant was not caused by the fault of the employer or a \n     coemployee of the claimant, the manufacturer or product \n     seller shall reimburse the insurer for reasonable attorney's \n     fees and court costs incurred by the insurer in the action, \n     as determined by the court.\n\n     SEC. 12. FEDERAL CAUSE OF ACTION PRECLUDED.\n\n       The district courts of the United States shall not have \n     jurisdiction under section 1331 or 1337 of title 28, United \n     States Code, over any product liability action covered under \n     this Act.\n                                                                    ____\n\n             Summary of the Product Liability Fairness Act\n\n       Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR): Either party may \n     offer to participate in a voluntary, non-binding state-\n     approved ADR procedure. If a defendant unreasonably refuses \n     to participate and a judgment is entered for the claimant, \n     the defendant must pay the claimant's reasonable legal fees \n     and costs. There is no penalty for claimants who refuse to \n     participate in an ADR procedure. No penalty may be assessed \n     against a defendant unless judgment is entered for the \n     claimant.\n       [[Page S3982]] Product Sellers: Product sellers will be \n     liable only for their own negligence or failure to comply \n     with an express warranty. However, if the manufacturer cannot \n     be brought into court or is unable to pay a judgment, the \n     seller shall be liable as if it were a manufacturer. This \n     assures that injured persons will always have available an \n     avenue for recovery.\n       Alcohol and Drugs: The defendant has an absolute defense if \n     the plaintiff was under the influence of intoxicating alcohol \n     or illegal drugs and the condition was more than 50 percent \n     responsible for plaintiff's injuries.\n       Misuse and Alteration: The bill limits a defendant \n     liability if the product user has misused or altered the \n     product in an unforeseeable manner.\n       Punitive Damages: Punitive damages may be awarded if a \n     plaintiff proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that the \n     harm was caused by defendant's ``conscious, flagrant \n     indifference to the safety of others.'' To streamline \n     litigation, trials may be bifurcated so the punitive damages \n     phase is separate from the proceedings on compensatory \n     damages. Courts may award punitive damages up to three times \n     economic damages, or $250,000, whichever is greater.\n       Statute of Limitations: The pro-plaintiff statute of \n     limitations is two years, which begins to run when the \n     claimant reasonably should have discovered both the harm and \n     cause.\n       Statute of Repose: The statute of repose is for capital and \n     durable goods used in the workplace, and is set at 20 years.\n       Joint and Several Liability: The bill abolishes joint \n     liability with respect to non-economic damages, such as pain \n     and suffering. States are permitted to provide joint \n     liability for economic damages, such as medical expenses and \n     lost wages, so that these damages are always fully \n     compensated in all cases.\n       Workers' Compensation Offset: An employer's right to \n     recover worker's compensation benefits from a manufacturer \n     whose product allegedly harmed a worker is preserved unless \n     the manufacturer can prove, by clear and convincing evidence, \n     that the employer caused the injury.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator \nRockefeller to introduce legislation that will bring common sense back \nto America's product liability system. The Product Liability Fairness \nAct of 1995 is a bipartisan proposal that takes a moderate, sensible \napproach to product liability reform.\n  As an attorney myself, I recognize that America's trial lawyers would \nlike to see me disbarred for introducing this bill.\n  It should come as no surprise that they are planning to spend $20 \nmillion to defeat this legislation. They're making millions off the \ncurrent system, and the legislation we're introducing today will put an \nend to the lawyers' financial free-for-all.\n  Consider just a couple of cases from my own State of Washington. \nConnelly Water Skis of Lynnwood pays $345,000 a year for liability \ninsurance even though they have never lost a liability case. They paid \nmore than $83,000 in legal expenses to defend themselves in a case in \nwhich the plaintiff has asked be dismissed. They paid more than $12,000 \nto defend themselves in a case in which no Connelly product was \ninvolved.\n  Commercial Plastics of Seattle, which manufacturers candy dispensers, \nhas been sued in a case involving a drunken woman who pulled a unit off \na grocery store shelf on New Year's Eve. She wasn't hurt, but she is \nsuing for mental anguish caused by the embarrassment of the incident.\n  Bayliner Boats of Everett manufactures a 25-foot hard-top boat with \nthe steering station inside. The plaintiff sawed a hole through the \nhard top--kind of like a sunroof. He was sitting on the top driving the \nboat with his feet. He saw an oncoming boat and tried to honk the horn \nwith his toe. He turned the boat to the left with his feet, and shifted \nhis weight to the right to counter the turn. He fell overboard, was \ninjured, and is now suing Bayliner.\n  Keep in mind that these examples come from a State where limits on \npunitive damages are already in place.\n  Does it make sense for consumers to pay higher prices for water skis \nor other equipment because the person used the product incorrectly? \nDoes it make sense for consumers to pay higher costs for products \nbecause someone did something that defies all common sense? Does it \nmake sense for consumers to pay higher prices for products because some \ninebriated person injures, and\n even embarrasses him or herself?\n\n  And most importantly, does it make sense that trial attorneys are \nripping off consumers around the country when they make millions of \ndollars off these cases?\n  Out of every dollar spent on product litigation, more than 50 percent \nof the money goes to the lawyers. They're the only ones winning \nanything. Their opposition to this legislation is only about protecting \ntheir fees--not protecting consumers.\n  Consider the Chicago law firm that issued a bulletin to its clients \nstating: ``We are pleased to announce that we obtained for our client \nthe largest verdict ever for an arm amputation: $7.8 million.''\n  Consider the new Florida company, called ``Went For It,'' that \nresearches the names of accident victims and sells them to lawyers.\n  Consider the New York lawyer found guilty of using a pickax to \nenlarge a pothole before he photographed it for a client with a \npersonal injury claim.\n  It's outrageous.\n  This country desperately needs a fair and efficient product liability \nsystem. A fair and efficient product liability system should have \nconsistent standards and yield predictable results. It should award \ndamages in proportion to the harm suffered and those damages should be \npaid only by those responsible. A fair and efficient system should \naward damages in a timely manner without incurring large, wasteful \ntransaction costs.\n  The status quo defended mightily by the trial lawyers is far from \nfair or efficient. Consumers, those injured by faulty products, and \nAmerican businesses all suffer as a result of selfish lawyers.\n  Fair compensation is not awarded in a timely fashion. Cases drag on \nfor years. Over 20 percent of seriously injured persons receive no \ncompensation for 5 years. A 1989 GAO study says that the average case \ntakes nearly 3 years to resolve, and longer if there is an appeal. When \ncompensation is awarded, transaction costs--such as attorney's fees--\nabsorb too much money that should have gone to injured persons.\n  Not only does the present product liability system generate excessive \ncosts and delay, it does not compensate injured persons in proportion \nto their losses. If a person's injuries are minor, they can expect to \nreceive a windfall of nearly nine times their losses. If their injuries \nare severe, they should expect to receive only 15 percent of their \nlosses. A severely injured person cannot afford to gamble on the \noutcome of lengthy\n litigation. As a result, many are forced to settle for an amount far \nless than their injuries merit.\n\n  Injured persons are not the only ones that are treated unfairly by \nthe tort system. That system imposes inordinate costs on the U.S. \neconomy. Domestic manufacturers face product liability costs up to 20 \nto 50 times higher than those paid by foreign competitors.\n  These excessive costs put American business at a competitive \ndisadvantage in world markets. Important sectors of our domestic \neconomy are losing substantial market shares to foreign competitors. \nFor example, the Association of Manufacturing Technology estimates its \nmember companies have lost, in recent years, nearly 25 percent of their \nmarket share to foreign competitors. Much of this loss is attributed to \nthe excessive costs of the current product liability system, which \nwastes vital resources and inhibits the development and marketing of \ninnovative products. The U.S. machine tool industry spends seven times \nmore on product liability costs than on research and development.\n  When the job creators have to pay insurance premiums instead of \nsalaries, we've got a lot of people on unemployment for no good reason. \nListen to the small business owner in Hoquiam who pays more in product \nliability premiums than he does in Federal taxes. Listen to the small \nbusiness owner in Spokane who says his insurance premiums often equal \nhis before-tax profits.\n  This is outrageous.\n  Innovation is also squelched because manufacturers decide not to \nmarket new products due to these excessive transaction costs and the \npossibility of unjustified, unpredictable but nonetheless crushing \nliability. These concerns further stifle innovation because scientific \nresearch essential for advanced product development, is foregone.\n  For instance, promising AIDS vaccines have been shelved. New \nhazardous waste cleanup technologies have been shelved. Asbestos \nsubstitutes have been \n [[Page S3983]] shelved. The list of valuable products and life-saving \nmedicines that have been shelved and kept from the market goes on, and \non, and on, and on.\n  The current system is clearly broken, and it must be fixed. I hope \nthat my colleagues will join with Senator Rockefeller and me in \nsupporting a bill that seeks in a balanced way to introduce fairness \nand efficiency to our product liability system.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in \nthe introduction of the Product Liability Reform Act of 1995. Our \nlitigation system needs repair; less than half--43 cents to be \nprecise--of every dollar spent in the liability system goes to injured \nvictims. More than half of every dollar represents transactions costs--\nlawyers' fees, the cost of keeping the courts running, and other \nassociated expenses of the legal system. Something is seriously wrong \nwith a system that pays out more to those who run the legal system than \nto those who need it for dispute resolution.\n  And, litigation costs drain billions of dollars from our economy. We \nknow there is a litigation tax associated with putting goods and \nservices in the stream of commerce. For example, the price, on average, \nof an 8-foot ladder is $119.33. But the actual cost is only $94.47, \nwith the litigation tax representing 25 percent of the cost. And, the \nlitigation tax for a heart pacemaker is 20 percent, driving the cost up \nan additional $3,000. (Source: Newsweek, Oct. 25, 1993, reprinting \nfrom, ``The 96 Billion Dollar Game,'' Philip Hermann.)\n  This litigation tax impedes innovation and invention. Companies \nhesitate to put products on the market because of the high risk of \nlitigation. That means fewer choices for consumers and a shrinking \nshare of the global market for American companies.\n  And unless we fix the problems of our legal system, the situation is \nbound to get worse. Longer delays in the courts, increased inefficiency \nand unpredictability in getting compensation to victims, and more \nburdens on productivity and invention.\n  This bill is a significant step in the right direction. It offers a \nnational answer to a nationwide problem--uniformity and certainty in \nAmerica's product liability laws.\n  The bill will not prevent those injured by defective products from \nreceiving fair compensation for their injuries. Rather, it will offer \nsome protection for those parties who had no connection to the defects \nin the product from unfairly and unreasonably having to pay the tab in \na lawsuit. But, make no mistake about it, those who are responsible for \nthe defects will be held accountable for the injuries they cause.\n  In addition, this bill restores the element of punishment to punitive \ndamages. In the current environment, the quest for punitive damages is \nlike taking a chance on the lottery--some plaintiffs win big and many \nwin nothing at all. Often times, the award of punitive damages bears no \nrelationship to the injuries suffered. The bill will link punitive \ndamages to the economic loss by providing that where punitive damages \nare awarded, they should be awarded in an amount of three times the \neconomic loss or $250,000, whichever is greater.\n  The time for this bill is long overdue. I look forward to its prompt \nconsideration in the Commerce Committee and speedy action on the Senate \nfloor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join a broad bipartisan \ngroup of eight Senators led by my distinguished colleagues, Senators \nRockefeller and Gorton, in introducing a bill to address one of the \nmost important issues facing this Congress--product liability reform. \nThis is my third effort to pass much-needed changes to the product \nliability system and, after years of frustration, I believe we are \nfinally going to succeed. This year's bill builds on last year's effort \nand is the fairest and strongest bill possible.\n  No one should be praising the status quo. The current system is \ninefficient, unpredictable, costly, slow, and inequitable. And everyone \npays: plaintiffs, defendants, manufacturers, product sellers, and \nconsumers. This bill addresses these problems by making a number of \nbalanced and limited changes intended to reduce transaction costs, \nprovide greater certainty to everyone, and increasing the \ncompetitiveness of U.S. firms. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I did not join the fight for product liability reform \nuntil my second year in the Senate. I came here as a former State \nattorney general who had been active in consumer protection. I knew \nthat some consumer groups opposed Federal product liability \nlegislation, and as a former State official, I was hesitant to step \ninto an area that had traditionally been the province of State law. In \nfact, as attorney general of Connecticut and a member of the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General, I voted for resolutions opposing \nearlier Federal product liability legislation that would have swept \naway virtually all State product liability laws and repealed the \ndoctrine of strict liability for product defects.\n  But as I traveled around the State of Connecticut, this problem--\nproduct liability litigation--kept coming up in my discussions with \nsmall business men and women, with small and large manufacturing \ncompanies, and with plant managers. They told me of problems they had \nexperienced with the product liability system, of the expense of \ndefending yourself even when you win, of the cost of settlements to \navoid paying litigation costs, and of the time and energy that product \nliability suits diverted away from the business of designing new \nproducts and bringing them to market.\n  One of my favorite examples concerns an experience of Mr. Robert \nLyons, who runs the Bilco Co. in New Haven, CT. Bilco, a small company, \nmanufactures roof hatch doors. Several years ago, Mr. Lyons and his \ncolleagues at Bilco invented an ingenious safety feature called the \nLadderUP Safety Post. This device attached to the ladder that led to \nthe roof hatch. When the hatch was opened, the LadderUP Safety Post \nwould automatically extend through the opening to a height several feet \nabove the level of the roof. This allowed a person climbing out of the \ntop of the hatch to hold on to the pole as he or she stepped up onto \nthe roof.\n  After Bilco put the LadderUP Safety Post on the market, Bilco was \nsued by a person who had fallen when using a Bilco hatch without the \ndevice. The plaintiff argued that Bilco should only have sold its roof \nhatch with a LadderUP device, and that Bilco should not have permitted \nits customers simply to buy a hatch. The plaintiff also argued that \nBilco should have more widely advertised its product. Despite the fact \nthat anyone who uses a ladder surely must know that you have to be \ncareful when climbing on the top rungs, and the fact that the builder \nhad chosen not to buy or retrofit the hatch with a LadderUP device, \nBilco ended up paying $20,000 to settle this case out of court, judging \nthat to be cheaper than going through full litigation.\n  Now there are some people who will say, so what is wrong with that? \nAfter all, a person who was injured received $20,000 to help compensate \nfor his injuries. But the flaw with the reasoning should be apparent. \nPrivate businesses cannot print money. A $20,000 payment here was \n$20,000 less to be invested in new plant equipment, in developing new \nproducts, or hiring new people. And what did Mr. Lyons and Bilco \nactually do to deserve having to pay $20,000? They invented and put on \nthe market a new product, a new safety device. They did not build the \nbuilding with the roof hatch, they did not install the hatch, they were \nnot the ones who decided to forego purchasing a LadderUP Safety Post \nfor use with the hatch. All they did was to build a better mousetrap. \nAnd for that, a lawyer beat a path to their door.\n  The injustice of this case points out a fundamental problem with our \nproduct liability system. At a time when we need to be rebuilding our \ncountry's manufacturing base, to be promoting innovation in our \nmanufacturing sector, to be designing, building and bringing to market \nthe next generation of high-quality, high-value added products the \nworld will need, our liability system chills innovation like a bucket \nof cold water.\n  The debate should really center around consumers, because it is \nconsumers who suffer because of this system, not simply businesses. \nConsumers are the ones who have to pay higher prices in order to cover \nproduct liability-related costs. If a ladder costs 20 \n [[Page S3984]] percent more because of liability-related costs, \nconsumers--not businesses--end up paying that 20 percent premium.\n  Consumers are also the ones who suffer when valuable innovations do \nnot occur, or when needed products like life-saving medical devices or \nearthquake shock absorbers do not come to market because no one will \nsupply the necessary raw materials.\n  Last term, at a hearing on product liability and sales of raw \nmaterials for medical devices, Mr. Mark Reily described what life would \nbe like for his then 9-year-old son, Thomas Reily, if he could no \nlonger obtain a replacement for the silicone shunt in Thomas' head: \n``The fluid builds pressure inside the head, like steam building inside \na locked pressure cooker. If left untreated, it is a well-documented \nfact that the patient will initially suffer severe brain damage, become \ncomatose and ultimately die.'' Mr. Reily pleaded for us to reform our \nproduct liability laws to ensure that raw materials for Thomas' shunt \nwill continue to be available to the shunt's makers. Mark and Thomas \nReily are consumers who are being hurt, not helped, by our product \nliability system.\n  The point that Mr. Reily and his son drove home is that the best \ninterests of consumers as a whole are not always identical to the \ninterests of people who are seeking compensation. The people who suffer \nor die because a new drug or medical device was never developed, or was \ndelayed in its development, are hurt as surely as those who suffer \nbecause a device malfunctioned or a drug was improperly designed. These \nsilent victims of our product liability system's chilling effect on \ninnovation are consumers whose interests also deserve protection.\n  Of course, even for its putative beneficiaries, people who are \ninjured by defective products, the legal system hardly can be said to \nwork well. GAO, in its five-State survey, found that product liability \ncases took an average of 2\\1/2\\ years just to reach trial. If the case \nwas appealed, it took, on average, another year to resolve. This is a \nvery long time for an injured person to wait for compensation.\n  In some instances too, our product liability laws have erected \nbarriers to suit that just do not make sense. For example, in some \nStates, the statute of limitations--the time within which a lawsuit can \nbe brought--begins to run even though the injured person did not know \nthey were injured and could not\n have known that the product was the cause. In those States, the time \nin which to bring a suit can expire before the claimant knows or could \never know there is a suite to bring.\n\n  Mr. President, no one will argue that this bill will cure all the \nills in our product liability system. That would require a gargantuan \noverhaul and I doubt we can reach agreement as to what that would look \nlike. But we can, I believe, work to enact a balanced package of \nreforms that works incrementally to eliminate the worst aspects of our \ncurrent system, to restore some balance to our product liability \nsystem. I believe this bill is just such a balanced package.\n  For people injured by defective products, this bill makes a set of \nvery important and beneficial changes. First, it enacts uniform, \nnationwide statute of limitations of 2 years from the date the claimant \nknew or should have discovered both the fact he or she was injured and \nthe cause of the injury. Injured people will no longer lose the right \nto sue before they knew both that they were hurt and that a specific \nproduct caused their injury.\n  Second, this bill will force defendants to enter alternative dispute \nresolution processes which can resolve a case in months rather than \nyears. If the defendant unreasonably refuses to enter into ADR, it can \nbe liable for all of claimant's costs and attorney's fees. On the other \nhand, if a plaintiff unreasonably refuses to enter ADR, she will suffer \nno penalty.\n  For workers who face possible injury in the workplace, this bill will \nreform the product liability system to give employers a stronger \nincentive to provide a safe workplace. Under current law, an employer \nis often permitted to recoup the entire amount of workers compensation \nbenefits paid to an employee who was injured by a defective machine, \neven if the employer contributed significantly to the injury by, for \nexample, running the machine at excessive speeds or removing safety \nequipment. This essentially means that an employer can end up paying \nnothing despite the fact that their misconduct was a significant cause \nof the injury.\n  This bill would change this. When an employer is found, by clear and \nconvincing evidence, to be partly responsible for an injury, the \nemployer loses recoupment in proportion to its contribution to the \ninjury. This does not change the amount of money going to the injured \nperson, but it makes the employer responsible for its conduct.\n  For manufacturers, this bill reforms the product liability system to \nestablish a nationwide standard for punitive damages of proof of \nconscious, flagrant indifference to public safety by clear and \nconvincing evidence. The clear and convincing evidence standard is \nalready the law in over 25 States. Punitive damages in these product \nliability cases would also be limited to the greater of $250,000 or \nthree times the amount of economic damages. The American College of \nTrial Lawyers and ALI support this provision. It will bring some \nreasonable limits to what too often just results in windfalls to \nparticular claimants instead of the original purpose--punishing \ndefendant's wrongful behavior.\n  Manufacturers of durable goods--goods with life expectancy over 3 \nyears that are used in the workplace--will also be assured that they \ncannot be sued more than 20 years after they deliver a product. This \nwill bring an end to suits such as the one in which Otis Elevator was \nsued over a 75-year-old elevator that had been modified and maintained \nby a number of different owners and repair persons through the decades. \nBy the way, this same provision will not apply to household goods such \nas refrigerators, and is only intended to cover those workplace \ninjuries that are already covered by workers compensation.\n  Manufacturers will also have some protection against ``deep pocket'' \nliability. While the bill still permits States to hold all defendants \njointly liable for economic damages such as lost wages, foregone future \nearnings, past and future medical bills, and cost of replacement \nservices, noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering will be \napportioned among codefendants on the basis of each defendant's \ncontribution to the harm. In addition, if the plaintiff misused or \naltered a product, or used the product under the influence of drugs or \nalcohol, the manufacturers share of the damages will also be reduced.\n  For wholesalers and retailers, they will, in the majority of cases, \nbe relieved of the threat that they can be held liable for the actions \nof others. Under current law, for example, the owner of the corner \nhardware store could be sued for injuries resulting from a power saw \njust as if she was the manufacturer of a power saw, even if she had no \ninput in the design or assembly of the power saw and had done nothing \nother than to inspect a sample to make sure there were no obvious flaws \nand to put the items on the shelf.\n  For our American economy and industrial base, passage of this product \nliability reform legislation will move us back to promoting innovation \nand the development and commercialization of new products. Passing this \nbill will create and save jobs here, not overseas.\n  After years of debate, this compromise bill balances important \nissues: It is pro-business and pro-consumer. It is pro-innovation and \npro-safety. But most importantly, it finally balances the scales of \njustice properly to ensure that victims of defective products remain \ncompensated while consumers receive the best products available. It is \nincremental reform. And it is a key component of any strategy for long-\nterm economic growth, and for rebuilding our country's manufacturing \nbase.\n  Let me say finally, that in the upcoming months, this bill will be \ndebated over and over. In that rhetoric and inevitable soundbites, one \nthing should not be lost. This bill does not absolve a company from \nmaking an unsafe product. If a company has made a defective product, it \nmust be held fully accountable. Period. But when a company does follow \nthe rules and makes a safe product, it should not have to settle \nfrivolous claims simply to avoid the expense of litigation and protect \n [[Page S3985]] against the risk that a huge and irrational judgment \nwill be awarded against it.\n  The time has come for us to move forward, to give this balanced \npackage a chance for full consideration by this body. We owe it to the \nAmerican people to look beyond the rhetoric. We owe it to the American \npeople to pass this bill. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport and enact these overdue reforms.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the bipartisan \ngroup of Senators who are original cosponsors of the Product Liability \nFairness Act of 1995. I would also like to commend Senators \nRockefeller, Gorton, and Lieberman for all of their hard work on this \nlegislation.\n  The current product liability system simply does not serve anyone \nwell. The American people know the problem--the results in a product \nliability case depend primarily on a person's ability to afford a good \nlawyer. That's true whether you are a consumer injured by an unsafe \nproduct, or a businessperson trying to defend yourself against an \nunjustified lawsuit.\n  For consumers, the studies show that injured people must wait too \nlong for fair compensation. A recent study by the General Accounting \nOffice found that cases take about 3 years to be resolved--longer if \nthere is an appeal.\n  Other studies show dramatically different compensation for similar \ninjuries incurred in the very same way. Wealthier and better educated \npeople fare far better than low-income people and less well-educated \npeople.\n  So the present system is not serving the needs of our injured \ncitizens. At the same time, it's not serving the needs of American \nbusinesses. They are reluctant to introduce new products because they \nare not sure what kind of liability they will face under the laws of 55 \nStates and territories.\n  This uncertainty is particularly difficult for small businesses, who \ncannot afford the huge legal costs of the present system. And these are \nnot legal costs that fall only on unscrupulous manufacturers--many \ncompanies have run up enormous legal bills only to be vindicated by the \ncourts. Of course, those victories are hollow at best.\n  And what happens if an American business is afraid to innovate, or \nforced to defer investment on research and development? Are those only \nproblems for particular businesses, and unworthy of serious attention--\nof course not. If American businesses are unable to bring innovative \nproducts to the marketplace, or forced to take helpful products off the \nmarket, we all lose.\n  The search for an AIDS vaccine is a good example. At least one \ncompany, Biogen in Massachusetts, terminated its investment in an AIDS \nvaccine because of product liability fears.\n  And this problem is not limited to particular products or companies. \nThe current product liability system threatens entire industries. The \ncontraceptive industry is one example. A 1990 report issued by the \nNational Research Council and the Institute of Medicine concluded that \n``product liability litigation has contributed significantly to the \nclimate of disincentives for the development of contraceptive \nproducts.''\n  The American Medical Association has documented this problem:\n\n       In the early 1970's, there were 13 pharmaceutical companies \n     actively pursuing research in contraception and fertility. \n     Now, only one U.S. company conducts contraceptive and \n     fertility research.\n\n  Is our country well-served by a system that prevents contraceptives, \nand other critical medical products, from coming to the market? Who \nbenefits from that result?\n  And if the present system is not working--if it helps neither people \nwho are injured by products nor the businesses who are trying to \ndevelop life-saving products--what should we do? Should we simply give \nup and walk away? Should we say that there's nothing we can do--the \nproblem's too big for us too handle? Of course not--we owe it to the \nAmerican people to try to do better.\n  With passage of the Product Liability Fairness Act we will do better. \nThis legislation may not solve all of the problems in the product \nliability system, but it will improve that system for everyone--for the \ninjured people who need fast and fair compensation, for consumers who \nneed quality products to choose from, for those businesses who are at \nthe cutting edge of international competition, and for workers who \ndepend on a strong economy to support their families. The moderate \nreforms in this measure will reduce the abuses in the current system \nwithout eliminating solid protections for those who are victimized by \ndefective or dangerous products.\n  Let me highlight some of the key provisions. First, this measure will \nprovide a more uniform system of product liability. Since about 70 \npercent of all products move between States, it makes sense to have a \nfederal system for resolving disputes. With Federal rules in place, \nthere will be more certainty in the system, and the excessive costs in \nthe present system should come down.\n  The provisions in the bill that encourage alternative dispute \nresolution will also help reduce the costs in the current system. \nCurrently, too much money goes to transaction costs, primarily lawyers \nfees, and not enough goes to victims. A 1993 survey of the Association \nof Manufacturing Technology found that every 100 claims filed against \nits members cost a total of $10.2 million. Out of that total, the \nvictims received only $2.3 million with the rest of the money going to \nlegal fees and other costs. Clearly, we need to implement a better \nsystem in which the money goes to those who need it--injured people.\n  Most importantly, and I cannot emphasize this enough, the moderate \nreforms in this bill offer a balanced approach to the needs of both \nconsumers and businesses. Consumers will benefit, for example, from a \nstatute of limitations provision that preserves a claim until 2 years \nafter the consumer should have discovered the harm and the cause. In \nmany cases, injured people are not sure what caused their injuries and, \nunder the current system, they lose their ability to sue. With this \nlegislation, people injured by products will have adequate time to \nbring a lawsuit.\n  Businesses will also benefit from this legislation. For example, in \norder to recover punitive damages, the plaintiff will have to prove, by \nclear and convincing evidence, that the harm was caused by the \ndefendant's ``conscious, flagrant indifference to the safety of \nothers.'' This provision will allow defendants to have a clear \nunderstanding of when they may be subject to this quasi-criminal \npenalty.\n  Under this measure, defendants also have an absolute defense if the \nplaintiff was under the influence of intoxicating alcohol or illegal \ndrugs and the condition was more than 50 percent responsible for \nplaintiff's injuries. This provision, it seems to me, is nothing more \nthan common sense. Why should manufacturers pay for the misconduct of \nintoxicated people?\n  Furthermore, product sellers will only be liable for their own \nnegligence or failure to comply with an express warranty. But as an \nadded protection for injured people, this rule will not apply if the \nmanufacturer cannot be brought into court or if the claimant would be \nunable to enforce a judgment against the manufacturer. This provision \nwill eliminate the need for sellers to hire lawyers in a high \npercentage of the roughly 95 percent of the cases where they are \npresently not found to be at fault.\n  Mr. President, this is an issue that many of us have spent a great \ndeal of time on. My involvement dates back to 1986, when I worked on a \nreform proposal with our distinguished former colleague, Senator \nDanforth. We did not get very far with that bill. But the effort to \nimprove the product liability system has gained momentum in recent \nyears, and I am optimistic that we can pass this legislation during \nthis Congress.\n  Because of the enormous costs associated with the product liability \nsystem, both economic and social, we must address this issue with the \nseriousness that it deserves. Unfortunately, in the past, some have \ncharacterized the debate as a battle between the manufacturers and the \ninsurance companies on the one side, and consumers and trial attorneys \non the other. Some have viewed this legislation in antagonistic terms, \nwith one side winning and one side losing.\n  Of course, the problem is much more complex than that and the \nsolution \n [[Page S3986]] will be much more complex. As this bill moves forward, \nwe will hear from many concerned citizens who can help us refine this \nlegislation. I also look forward to working with my colleagues and the \nClinton administration to strengthen this measure. But our Nation \ncannot afford to maintain the status quo, and this bill will take us a \nlong way toward a fairer product liability system.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof this important legislation. Our existing product liability system is \na disaster. It is inefficient and unfair. The Senate Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation has long recognized these \nproblems and has reported favorably a reform bill in six previous \nCongresses.\n  The Product Liability Fairness Act of 1995 is a balanced bill that \nwill make substantial progress in addressing the many problems with our \ncurrent system. This bill is good for consumers, good for businesses--\nespecially small businesses--and good for those legitimately injured by \nfaulty products.\n  I thank Senator Gorton and Senator Rockefeller for their excellent \nwork in preparing this bill. Their solid working relationship on this \nissue is indicative of the bipartisan support for these essential \nreforms.\n  Mr. President, I have long been a supporter of product liability \nreform and will make every effort to advance the reform effort.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to cosponsor the \nProduct Liability Fairness Act of 1995 with Senators Rockefeller and \nGorton, and many others. I commend their longstanding leadership on \nthis issue.\n  This act represents a truly bipartisan effort to correct what many \nhave long recognized to be malfunctions in our product liability \nsystem. We want American business to grow, to provide more jobs and \nmore affordable consumer goods, and to continue to make medical and \ntechnological breakthroughs that benefit the people of Utah and all \nAmericans. We can do that as well as make sure those who are wrongfully \nharmed in the marketplace are properly compensated, if we go about it \nin a rational way.\n  Under the current system, however, American manufacturers have been \nforced to devote far too many resources to the costs of product \nliability actions, and consumers have ultimately had to bear those \ncosts. Punitive damage awards have particularly grown out of control \nand have crippled our manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. We \nhave all heard about astronomical punitive damage awards for spilled \ncoffee and other horror stories. What we often fail to focus on is \nwhere these terrific sums are coming from and the insidious economic \ndamage that is caused by forcing the reallocation of millions of \ndollars away from productive, job creating uses.\n  The long and short of it is that the current system is harming both \ncompanies, workers, and consumers and is desperately in need of the \nreforms we propose today.\n  Let no one misunderstand what this bill does. It does not prevent \ninjured people from being compensated for the harms caused to them by \ndefective products. I strongly believe that those who are unfortunate \nenough to be harmed by defective products should have appropriate \nremedies and should be compensated for the harm they suffer.\n  However, product liability law as it stands today is severely skewed. \nWhat this law does is correct certain specific inequities in the law as \nit stands and make those corrections uniform nationwide. Many States, \nfor example, have already enacted reforms at the State level that art \nsimilar to those we introduce today.\n  Under the law as it stands in many other States, however, \nmanufacturers and others can be held responsible for striking amounts \nof damages for harm that they did not cause--just because another party \ncannot or will not pay its fair share. In addition, juries may award \nrunaway amounts of punitive damages for a relatively small amount of \nharm, and courts can lack the power to adequately restrict those awards \nonce made.\n  The threat alone of excessive punitive damages can force parties to \nsettle under conditions in which they otherwise would not. Finally, as \nin numerous other areas of the law, litigation costs in product \nliability cases continue to soar.\n  All of this harms our economy. It removes companies' incentives to \ninvest and discourages them from researching and developing newer and \nsafer products. It limits the amount companies can spend on wages, \nresearch, and technology. All of this hurts consumers and workers. \nLitigation costs and the higher insurance costs that companies must pay \nto cover their expected liability are ultimately passed on to \nconsumers. Of the cost of a simple ladder, for example, a shocking 20 \npercent goes to paying the costs of product liability litigation. Those \ncosts impact the prices we pay for all sorts of other goods and \nservices that we need and use everyday, and prevent the development and \nmarketing of products we would like to use but cannot because companies \nare afraid to develop them.\n  These problems cannot be addressed comprehensively without a uniform, \nnationwide solution. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nget this bill to the President.\n  Mr. President, I should also note that I expect to introduce civil \njustice reform which goes beyond product liability issues in the near \nfuture.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 566. A bill for the relief of Richard M. Sakakida; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n\n\n                       private relief legislation\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, in behalf of myself and Senator \nInouye, I am re-introducing today legislation I offered in the previous \nCongress for the private relief of Richard Motoso Sakakida of Fremont, \nCA. My bill would require the military to review whether the retired \nlieutenant colonel deserves the Congressional Medal of Honor, \nDistinguished Service Cross, or Silver Star for actions related to his \nservice in the Philippines during World War II.\n  Despite many courageous and daring actions he undertook as an Army \nundercover agent before and during the Japanese occupation of the \nislands, Colonel Sakakida has never been officially recognized for his \nservice there, largely because much of his work was classified, and \ntherefore unknown, until well after the war. Despite efforts undertaken \nin his behalf by fellow veterans and Members of Congress to accord him \nthe honors he deserves, the Army has refused to consider his case, \nciting a statute limiting the Medal of Honor or Distinguished Service \nCross to those whose recommendations are received within 2 years of the \nact justifying the awards, or, in the case of World War II veterans, by \n1951.\n  Mr. President, I believe a brief review of Colonel Sakakida's wartime \nexploits will convince my colleagues of the need to enact this \nlegislation.\n  In March 1941, 9 months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, \nRichard Sakakida, the son of Japanese parents who immigrated to Hawaii \nat the beginning of the century, and another nisei from Hawaii became \nthe first Japanese-Americans recruited to the Army's Counter \nIntelligence Police [CIP]. This unit would later become the Army \nCounter Intelligence Corps, or CIC.\n  Sworn in as a sergeant. Sakakida was sent to the Philippines, then an \nAmerican possession; his mission was to spy on Japanese with possible \nconnections to the Japanese military. There, Sakakida was able to \nmasquerade as a draft evader from Hawaii and talk himself into being \nadmitted to an all-Japanese residential hotel in Manila. Under cover of \na prearranged job, and without any prior training or experience, he \nsucceeded in establishing a clandestine intelligence collection \noperation out of his hotel room. As a measure of the success of his \npenetration of the Japanese community, Sakakida was even offered a post \nwith the Japanese consulate in Mindanao.\n  The outbreak of war abruptly ended that possibility. Instead of \nreturning to the American side, Sakakida was asked to stay with the \nJapanese community to continue his work. He relied on sheer \nresourcefulness to talk his way past unwitting American and Filipino \nsecurity guards at the gate to the emergency Japanese relocation \ncompound, where Japanese nationals were \n [[Page S3987]] being detained. His vulnerability was compounded by the \nfact that only a few men were aware of his secret work. In fact, he was \neventually arrested on spy charges by the Philippine Constabulary\n and subjected to punishing interrogation at Bilibid Prison. Throughout \nthe ordeal Sakakida maintained his cover story, as he was later able to \ndo with his Japanese captors.\n\n  Fortuitously, he was eventually recognized by a Filipino agent who \nwas aware of his undercover status; unfortunately, this also \ncompromised his cover among Philippine authorities. A ruse involving \nhis return to the Japanese compound and unceremonious arrest by \nAmerican agents was staged in an attempt to maintain his cover in the \nJapanese community, but the rapid advance of the Japanese Army ended \nhopes for his return to the Japanese. For the first time since he \narrived in the islands, he reentered the American fold.\n  Back in military uniform with the CIP, Sargent Sakakida was tasked \nwith interrogating Japanese civilians and POW's in Manila, Bataan, and \nCorregidor. He translated Japanese diaries and Bataan, and Corregidor. \nHe translated Japanese diaries and combat documents, prepared \npropaganda leaflets in Japanese, and called upon the Japanese to \nsurrender in loudspeaker broadcasts. He also monitored Japanese air-\nground communications and deciphered enemy codes. At Bataan, he singled \nout and translated a key captured Japanese document that led to the \ndestruction of a large battalion-size force that was attempting a \nlanding there. It was one of the few, perhaps only, major American \nbattlefield successes in a string of setbacks that led to the downfall \nof Bataan.\n  When the final surrender of the Philippines became imminent at \nCorregidor in 1942, General MacArthur ordered Sakakida's evacuation to \nAustralia. In spite of the prospect of certain imprisonment, possible \ntorture, and perhaps execution at the hands of the Japanese, he chose \nto give up his seat on one of the last escape aircraft to a nisei \nlawyer. Sakakida was aware that the lawyer had a family and for various \nreasons would have faced serious reprisals had he been captured. As a \nresult, by his own hand, Sakakida became the only Japanese-American to \nbe captured by the Japanese forces in the Philippines.\n  Sakakida spent 6 months in a Manila prison, where he would be \nmercilessly interrogated and tortured. His situation was compounded by \nthe fact that, under existing Japanese law, everyone of Japanese \nancestry was considered a citizen of the empire; thus, Sakakida was \nviewed as a traitor. He was strung up by the arms in such a way that \nhis shoulders were literally dislocated. His captors forced water into \nhim, and struck his swollen stomach repeatedly; they also burned his \nbody with lighted cigarettes. Incredibly, through it all, Sakakida \nwould adhere to his story that he was a civilian forced to work for the \nU.S. Army.\n  After being tortured, Sakakida spent more time in Bilibid Prison, \nwhere he underwent more interrogation for alleged treason. When treason \ncharges against him were dropped, he was assigned to work for the \nJapanese judge advocate of the 14th Army Headquarters, although \nJapanese counter-intelligence agents continued their attempts to elicit \nhis true identity through trick questions and other stratagems. He took \nadvantage of his position to aid secretly a number of allied prisoners \nof war who were being held there for trial for\n attempting to escape; Sakakida smuggled food to them and imaginatively \ninterpreted for them during their trials. One of these men, a naval \nofficer who was later to become an Oklahoma supreme court justice, \nbelieves he escaped execution only through Sakakida's intervention and \nassistance during the trial.\n\n  During this time, he established contact with the Filipino guerrilla \nunderground, through which he funnelled important Japanese troop and \nshipping information to MacArthur in Australia. Sakakida's reporting \nfrom Manila also contributed to the destruction of a major Japanese \ntask force headed for Davao by American submarines that lay in wait for \nthe convoy. The huge Japanese setback abruptly ended the Japanese \nadvance toward Australia, saving it from an invasion.\n  Sakakida then engineered a daring prison break from Mantinlupa Prison \nthat freed the guerrilla leader Ernest Tupas and 500 of his men. \nSakakida himself chose to remain behind in order to continue his \nintelligence activities from the enemy's midst. Thereafter, Sakakida \nwas able to relay additional tactical information to MacArthur through \nthe guerrillas.\n  After American forces invaded the Philippines, Sakakida escaped from \nthe retreating Japanese forces at Baguio. During a firefight between \nAmerican and Japanese troops, he suffered shrapnel wounds in the \nstomach. For the next several months Sakakida wandered alone in the \njungle, living off the land, debilitated by his wound. He finally \nhappened upon American troops, whom he eventually convinced of his \nidentity. At that point, he was informed that the war was over.\n  Mr. President, this is a thumbnail sketch of Richard Sakakida's \nrecord of service in the Philippines. Naturally, it cannot do justice \nto the full tale of his courage, daring, sacrifice, and endurance. I \nhave omitted many other incidents that displayed Sakakida's courage and \nfortitude. In fact, for a variety of reasons, including the secrecy \nsurrounding his intelligence activities, his story has never been told \nin its entirety until relatively recently.\n  Mr. President, because Sakakida's activities were classified, few \nwere in a position to recommend him for the Medal of Honor or other \nhigh award for valor. Much of what we know is largely anecdotal, \nbecause circumstances dictated that the presence of any official \nrecords would be damaging not only to his personal safety but also to \nthe diplomatic and military efforts of the United States. Now, time has \nlifted the veil of secrecy, but many of the records of his activities \nare missing or were never kept; in addition, many witnesses who could \nhave spoken of his exploits were either killed during the war or have \nsince passed away in the period between the end of the war and the \nvitiation of the official blackout on Sakakida's operations. In spite \nof this catch-22 situation, I believe that ample evidence exists to \nsupport the awarding of the Congressional Medal of Honor to Colonel \nSakakida. I believe this especially in view of the fact that the whole \nof his activities is informed by a supreme consistency, validated by \nobjective events, that only the truth bears.\n  Nevertheless, after Colonel Sakakida's story was publicly\n   revealed several years ago, and his record formally brought to the \nArmy's attention by fellow veterans as well as by my Hawaii colleague, \nRepresentative Patsy Mink, the Army's Military Awards Branch refused to \nconsider him for the Medal of Honor. The Army, citing the statute I \nhave referred to earlier, stated that Sakakida's recommendation must \nhave been submitted through official military channels shortly after \nthe end of the war, by 1951. The Army refused to consider the special \ncircumstances surrounding Sakakida's case, namely, that the nature of \nhis intelligence work prevented his story from being appropriately \nconsidered prior to the delimiting date. In fact, as I have alluded to \nbefore, he was officially enjoined from talking about his intelligence \nactivities during World War II until 1972, more than 20 years after the \nstatutory deadline, when they were declassified and he was no longer \nbound by his secrecy oath. As a result, Colonel Sakakida's \ncontributions to the allied victory have been overlooked by history and \nby his country.\n\n  This is a tragic oversight. Colonel Sakakida has been inducted into \nthe Military Intelligence Hall of Fame. He has been honored repeatedly \nby his Japanese-American comrades-in-arms, notably members of the all-\nNisei Military Intelligence Service and the 100th Infantry Battalion/\n442d Regimental Combat Team. At least one book, and chapters in many \nothers, has been devoted to his wartime accomplishments. And, he has \nbeen awarded four different medals by the Philippine Government, \nincluding the Philippine Legion of Honor Award.\n  Thus, it seems that everyone but our own Government has recognized \nColonel Sakakida's heroic military service in the Philippines. Indeed, \nthe Army has never accorded Sakakida a single award or commendation for \nbravery associated with his undercover work in the archipelago.\n  [[Page S3988]] Mr. President, I cannot help wondering if Colonel \nSakakida's ethnic heritage has had something to do with this slight. \nWhile the Army apparently does not keep statistics on the ethnic \nbreakdown of valor awards, one could make the case that Japanese-\nAmericans have been underdecorated with respect to the Medal of Honor.\n  According to the book, ``Nisei: The Quiet Americans,'' by Bill \nHosokawa, no Japanese-American had been awarded a Medal of Honor at the \nend of World War II. It was only when a member of the all-Nisei 100th/\n442d, the most highly decorated military unit in American history made \nthis known to Congress that the medal was awarded posthumously to one \nof its members.\n  Hosokawa noted that a number of the Japanese-Americans in the 100th/\n442d were recommended for the Medal of Honor, but in each case, \nsomewhere along the line, the request was denied and the lesser, \nDistinguished Service Cross presented instead. As of the late 1960s, \naccording to Hosokawa, only one other Japanese-American received the \nMedal of Honor, for his service in the Korean war. I have been unable \nto find data on Vietnam or post-Vietnam conflicts, which is significant \nin itself. I have no doubt Nisei like Colonel Sakakida suffered racial \nprejudice at the onset of hostilities with Japan; the unjust internment \nof Japanese-Americans is proof enough of this.\n  There have been other allegations of discrimination in the medal \nawarding process. Apparently, only one black American received the \nMedal of Honor for World War I service, and that happened only after \nthe Army conducted research to determine if there had been any barriers \nto black soldiers in the medal recognition process. And, recently, a \nretired lieutenant colonel who is African-American alleged he was \ndenied the Medal of Honor for his heroics in Korea because of \ndiscrimination.\n  The Army has contracted a second study on black winners of the Medal \nof Honor in World War II that will presumably throw additional light on \nthis sensitive subject. However, I also understand there are no plans \nto study Asian-Americans or any other ethnic group.\n  In any event, Mr. President, whether Colonel Sakakida is a victim of \ndiscrimination, an outdated law, or merely circumstance, his record is \ncompelling enough to warrant formal review.\n  My bill would accomplish this by authorizing the President to award \nthe Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Cross, or Silver Star to \nColonel Sakakida. The award would be made on the basis of a positive \nreview of his military records by the Secretary of the Army, free of \nany statutory time restrictions that may pertain to these awards.\n  Let me stress that this bill does not direct the President to award \nthe Medal of Honor to Colonel Sakakida outright, but to do so only if a \nreview of his records determines that he is indeed deserving of the \nNation's highest military decoration.\n  This bill has the strong support of the Japanese-American veterans \norganizations as well as the Japanese-American community at large. I \nalso have a letter of support from the Philippine Embassy for this \neffort. I ask unanimous consent that these messages of support, as well \nas a copy of the bill, be included in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  Mr. President, I do not offer this legislation entirely in Richard \nSakakida's behalf. For Richard Sakakida is already amply bestowed with \nbadges of honor--in the scars that deface his body, in the medication \nhe takes to dull the constant pain he suffers from his wounds, and in \nthe silent knowledge that he rendered extraordinary services to the \nNation in its time of need. Rather, I offer this legislation in our \ncollective behalf. For, in honoring individuals such as Richard \nSakakida, we honor ourselves--by reaffirming the value of the freedoms \nthat men and women like him have sacrificed so much to preserve.\n  In closing, I should note that since I last introduced this bill, \nColonel Sakakida has suffered serious health problems. It is therefore \nimportant that Congress act with dispatch, if Colonel Sakakida is to be \nappropriately honored for his courageous actions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                            Japanese American Citizens League,\n\n                              San Francisco, CA, January 31, 1995.\n     Hon.

Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: Our MIS Veterans club is pleased to \n     resubmit a letter in behalf of your efforts to gain belated \n     but deserved official recognition for Richard Sakakida for \n     his heroic military actions before and during World War II in \n     the Philippines. Clearly Richard Sakakida's efforts and \n     contributions toward a just victory deserve the highest \n     awards that a grateful nation can bestow.\n       It is perhaps fitting to recognize that our nation is a \n     great social experiment--proving to a world torn by ethnic \n     and cultural strife that citizens from diverse origins and \n     environments can live together and can demonstrate their \n     courage and loyalty to that experiment. Our heroes can come \n     from a variety of sources, and Richard Sakakida's humble but \n     somewhat typical background adds to that variety. It is also \n     fitting that this nation should seek out, recognize and honor \n     those who rise above their challenges to add their names to \n     our roster of heroes. It is unfortunate that the passage of \n     time often dims our ardor for recognition because too often \n     we are a nation of instantaneous celebrities. It is also \n     unfortunate that there are no official records of Richard \n     Sakakida's exploits because the circumstances of his actions \n     precluded their presence. These conditions do not however \n     diminish the magnitude and heroism of his actions and this \n     nation can do no less than to acknowledge his valiant \n     contributions.\n       All of our club members share a military intelligence \n     background and we have lived with the knowledge that the use \n     of a foreign language in a military confrontation is not \n     given adequate recognition. The ability to use that language \n     is often the crucial difference between success and failure \n     of a military operation. Richard Sakakida's language skills \n     enabled him to earn significant military gains as well as his \n     own survival in an extended and tense situation. We heartily \n     endorse and encourage your efforts to gain belated but hard \n     earned recognition for Richard Sakakida.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Dr. Sueo Ito,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Rocky Mountain Military Intelligence Service Veterans \n           Club,\n                                      Denver, CO, August 14, 1994.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: Our MIS Veterans Club has been advised \n     of your very laudable efforts in getting official recognition \n     for Richard Sakakida for his valiant and largely unheralded \n     military efforts before and during World War II in the \n     Philippines. Clearly Richard Sakakida's heroic actions merit \n     the highest recognition that this nation can bestow.\n       We recognize that the accounts of Sakakida's contributions \n     are largely anecdotal because his circumstances dictated that \n     the presence of any official records would be damaging not \n     only to his personal safety but also to the diplomatic and \n     military efforts of the United States. Also his actions \n     during and after capture by the Japanese precluded any \n     written records.\n       Our club is composed of veterans with a Military \n     Intelligence background and we all recognize the important \n     contributions made by the citizens of the United States \n     through their knowledge and use of language. We therefore \n     heartily endorse and encourage your efforts in securing \n     belated but well-earned recognition for Richard Sakakida.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Dr. Sueo Ito,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           444D Veterans Club,\n\n                                   Honolulu, HI, January 26, 1995.\n     Hon.

Akaka,\n     U.S. Senator from Hawaii.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: I consider it a great honor to support \n     the effort to have the highest military award bestowed upon \n     Lt. Col. Richard M. Sakakida, one of the forgotten and unsung \n     heroes of World War II.\n       In more ways than one, Lt. Col. Sakakida placed devotion to \n     duty and country above all else, disregarding any personal \n     harm or danger to himself. When the opportunity came for him \n     to evacuate from the Philippines for Australia as part of \n     General MacArthur's group, he turned it down to give his \n     place to a fellow nisei. He knew full well the horrible fate \n     that awaited him as a prisoner of the Japanese, yet he felt \n     that he would be \n      [[Page S3990]] more useful by remaining behind. Lt. Col. \n     Sakakida suffered months of indescribable torture, but he \n     never broke. Eventually his captors accepted his cover story \n     that he was an army deserter and was given a certain degree \n     of freedom and responsibility. He continued to gather and \n     send valuable information on the Japanese forces to General \n     MacArthur's HQ in Australia through the Filipino guerrilla \n     network. One of the most vital pieces of intelligence which \n     he sent was about the formation of a Japanese invasion task \n     force against Australia. Corroboration of this plan by other \n     sources resulted in a successful Allied action against this \n     invasion effort. While working with the guerrillas, Lt. Col. \n     Sakakida planned and carried out the escape of several \n     hundred Filipino Guerrillas from the prison camp. He managed \n     to escape with a group of guerrillas, but was wounded in the \n     stomach and separated from them in the process. Already \n     severely wounded, Lt. Col. Sakakida's indomitable will to \n     survive carried him through to eventual rescue by U.S. \n     forces.\n       The requirement of documentation should be waived in this \n     case because of the highly classified nature of the \n     undercover work involved and because of the lapse of over \n     half a century since these events occurred. It should be \n     noted that the Philippine Government has recognized Lt. Col. \n     Sakakida's service in the Philippine liberation campaign and \n     has awarded him the Legion of Honor (Degree of Legionnaire).\n       Lt. Col. Sakakida's unparalleled and unselfish service to \n     his country under the most adverse of situations with \n     complete disregard for personal safety and survival is \n     certainly ``above and beyond'' the call of duty. It calls for \n     his country's gratitude and recognition by the awarding of \n     the highest military decoration commensurate with his service \n     record.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Sunao (Phil) Ishio\n\n                                                  Col.

Those of us who met him at \n     recent linguist reunions were overwhelmed with the story.\n       Further delay in recognition of his heroic exploits would \n     be unconscionable, and we are in full support of your \n     introduction of a private Bill to award him (albeit \n     belatedly) the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                    Sam Yoshinari,\n     Post Commander.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       Office of Veterans Affairs,\n\n\n                                   Embassy of the Philippines,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 1994.\n     Mr. John A. Tagami,\n     Legislative Assistant, Office of Senator Daniel K. Akaka, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Tagami: In August 1993 I recommended the award of \n     Philippine Legion of Honor to Lt. Col. Richard Sakakida on \n     the basis of the Military Intelligence report compiled by \n     Diane L. Hamn, (copy enclosed). My recommendation was \n     addressed to his \n      [[Page S3991]] Excellency President Fidel V. Ramos, \n     President of the Philippines through the Secretary of \n     National Defense. This was referred to G2, Armed Forces of \n     the Philippines which went over the attached report. I do not \n     know what exactly happened. I can only surmise that the \n     herein report had been confirmed by records we have in the \n     Philippines and President Fidel V. Ramos approved the award.\n       Let me tell you that at one time, I was informed that the \n     recommendation may not be approved because of the \n     prescriptive period during which the achievement may be \n     recognized. I made appropriate representation that this \n     prescriptive period may be waived, my reason being that the \n     recommendation for the award could not be made earlier \n     because the record of Lt. Col. Sakakida had been declassified \n     very much later.\n       I understand from Ms. Barbara Joseph that the same \n     objection is being raised in connection with this award of \n     Congressional Medal of Honor. Maybe the same argument may be \n     used.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                            Tagumpay A.

Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: If you recall, His Excellency President \n     Fidel V. Ramos of the Republic of the Philippines approved \n     the award of the Philippine Legion of Honor (Degree of \n     Legionnaire) to Lt Colonel Richard M. Sakakida, USAF (Ret) \n     for his role in the Philippine campaign during WWII. The \n     formal presentation was held at the Carlos P. Romulo Hall of \n     the Philippine Embassy, Washington, D.C. on April 15, 1994. \n     You were represented at the awarding ceremony by Mr. John \n     Tagami who read your message and that of Senator Daniel \n     Inouye.\n       I am enclosing herewith a copy of the General Orders issued \n     by the General Headquarters, Armed Forces of the Philippines \n     announcing the award.\n       In my private capacity as a former enlisted man in the 31st \n     Division (PA) called and ordered into the service of the \n     United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) in 1942 \n     and as a guerrilla intelligence officer of the Vera's Tayabas \n     Guerrillas, a combat batallion which was recognized by the \n     Sixth Army, USA in 1945, I join in the recommendations for \n     the award of the Congressional Medal of Honor to LtCol. \n     Sakakida.\n       Enclosed is a brief summary on LtCol. Sakakida's role in \n     the Philippine campaign which is chronicled in the \n     intelligence operation reports of the Armed Forces of the \n     Philippines.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Tagumpay A. Nanadiego,\n     BrigGeneral, AFP (Ret).\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n    award of the philippine legion of honor--(Degree of legionnaire)\n\n       By direction of the President, pursuant to paragraph 1-6e, \n     Section II, Chapter 1, Armed Forces of the Philippines \n     Regulations G 131-053, this Headquarters, dated 1 July 1986, \n     the PHILIPPINE LEGION OF HONOR in the degree of Legionnaire \n     is hereby awarded to Mr. Richard M. Sakakida for \n     exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of \n     outstanding service to the Filipino--American freedom \n     fighters as the United States undercover counterintelligence \n     agent from 22 April 1941 to 20 September 1945. At the \n     outbreak of World War II, then Sergeant Sakakida was shipped \n     out from Honolulu to the Philippines to monitor the \n     activities of the Japanese community in Manila. When \n     Corregidor surrendered to the Japanese Imperial Forces in \n     1942, he was taken as prisoner of war, was tortured and \n     brought to Bilibid Prison. Later, he was utilized as \n     interpreter for court martial proceedings for American and \n     Filipino prisoners and on many occasions, interceded on \n     behalf of the POWs by translating testimony in their favor. \n     He engineered and successfully carried out a daring prison \n     break from Muntinlupa Prison, releasing over 500 Filipino \n     guerrillas with the assistance of some Filipinos. In July \n     1945, after his escape from prison, he was wounded in a \n     skirmish between Filipino guerrillas and Japanese forces. He \n     rejoined General Douglas MacArthur's returning forces in the \n     liberation of the Philippines after a long trek across miles \n     of jungle terrain. By these achievements, Mr. Sakakida \n     contributed immeasurably to the liberation of the \n     Philippines, thereby earning for himself the respect and \n     admiration of the Filipino people.\n       By Order of the Secretary of National Defense.\n                                                Lisandro C Abadia,\n                                     General, AFP, Chief of Staff.\n     \n                                                                    ____\n                          Richard M. Sakakida\n\n       Richard Sakakida's undercover intelligence work during \n     World War II parallels Arthur Komori's in that both were from \n     Hawaii and were selected over a number of candidates in March \n     1941 for the secret CIP (Counter Intelligence Police) \n     undercover mission, until they sneaked ashore in Manila.\n       Once landed, Sakakida, pretending to be a draft evader from \n     Hawaii, checked into the Nishikawa Hotel. He soon got a \n     clerical job there checking passports and filling out \n     passport entry forms of visiting Japanese. He obtained \n     valuable information during this time. He even found work as \n     a sales representative of Sears Roebuck to complete his \n     cover, while he wove himself into the fabric of Manila's \n     Japanese business community, passing on his findings to CIP \n     chief, Major Nelson Raymond. One of Sakakida's assignments \n     was to befriend a Nisei serving as local advisor to the \n     Japanese Consulate in Manila and collect information from \n     that source.\n       On December 8, 1941, when the Japanese bombed Manila and \n     the United States declared war on Japan, Sakakida, as \n     previously planned, voluntarily turned himself in at the \n     Nippon Club Evacuation Center with the rest of the Japanese \n     in Manila. One day, Sakakida, escorted by the Philippine \n     Constabulary, went marketing for foodstuff for the other \n     detainees. When he stopped at the Nishikawa Hotel to pick up \n     his belongings, the Filipino Secret Service arrested him as a \n     spy and hauled him to Philippine Constabulary headquarters \n     for interrogation. U.S. CIP agents eventually rescued him.\n       Back in military uniform with the CIP Sakakida interrogated \n     Japanese civilians until December 23, 1941, when the \n     advancing Japanese Army forced the evacuation of the American \n     military in Manila to Bataan and Corregidor. On Bataan, \n     Sakakida interrogated Japanese POWs, translated Japanese \n     diaries and combat documents, prepared propaganda leaflets in \n     Japanese, and called upon the Japanese to surrender by \n     loudspeaker broadcasts Assisting Army Signal Intelligence, he \n     monitored Japanese air-ground communications and deciphered \n     Japanese codes. He preformed critical intelligence work in \n     Malinta Tunnel on Corregidor which came under intense daily \n     bombing by Japanese planes.\n       After three months of bitter fighting, the lack of relief \n     supplies and replacements forced the exhausted, malnourished, \n     disease-ridden Americans to capitulate. Bataan fell on April \n     8, 1942, and 76,000 defeated American and Filipino troops \n     embarked upon the infamous ``Bataan Death March'' that killed \n     over half their numbers. General MacArthur ordered the \n     evacuation to Australia of his two valuable Nisei linguists, \n     Komori and Sakakida, but the latter chose to give up his seat \n     on the escape aircraft to a civilian Nisei. With no chance, \n     therefore to escape, Sakakida became one of General \n     Wainwright's tragic survivors of Corregidor to surrender to \n     the Japanese Army.\n       As the only American Nisei POW known to have been captured \n     by the Japanese, Sakakida spent six months incarcerated on \n     Corregidor. The Kenpei Tai quizzed him mercilessly and \n     tortured him. Sakakida steadfastly endured, adhering to his \n     story of being a civilian, forced to work for the U.S. Army \n     after the war began. In December 1942, Sakakida was thrown \n     into Bilibid Prison. The enemy questioned Sakakida's \n     renunciation of his Japanese citizenship prior to the war \n     but, because he was born of Japanese parents, considered he \n     could be tried for treason. He faced an almost certain death \n     sentence if tried before a Japanese military tribunal. The \n     Japanese 14th Army HQ verified from the Foreign Minister that \n     Sakakida's Japanese citizenship had indeed been voided \n     (fortuitously, Sakakida's mother had cancelled his dual \n     citizenship in\n      August 1941 after his departure). On February 11, 1943, \n     ``Kigensetsu,'' (Empire Day), Sakakida was advised the \n     treason charge would be dropped. Despite the hideous \n     torture suffered at the hands of his Japanese captors, the \n     marks of which remain evident today, Richard Sakakida \n     never broke down and never revealed his undercover role \n     and mission against the Japanese.\n       Sakakida was then assigned to work for Chief Judge Advocate \n     Col. Nishiharu and remained under continued surveillance, \n     subjected to periodic attempts at entrapment to elicit his \n     true identity. During this period, Sakakida established \n     contact with the Filipino guerrilla underground through which \n     he managed to funnel vital military information to \n     MacArthur's HQ in Australia. His most crucial report cited \n     Japanese troop and shipping activity. The report also advised \n     of preparations for an invasion of Australia to be launched \n     from Davao, Mindanao, by the Japanese 35th Army with 15 troop \n     transports and destroyers. Sakakida later learned from an \n     officer of the sole surviving ship that American submarines \n     had annihilated that convoy, probably reported in WW II \n     history as the Battle of the Bismarck Sea.\n       Sakakida also engineered a daring prison break from \n     Muntinglupa Prison by disguising as a Japanese security \n     officer. The escape freed guerrilla leader Ernesto Tupas and \n     500 of his men. Tupas escaped to the Rizal mountains, where \n     he established radio contact with MacArthur's HQ through \n     which Sakakida could relay more tactical information gleaned \n     from the 14th Army HQ where he worked. This could be the only \n     instance in World War II where a U.S. Military intelligence \n     agent relayed information from the very heart of the enemy's \n     headquarters.\n       After October 1944, when the American forces invaded Leyte \n     and American planes bombed Manila, inflicting heavy damage, \n     General Yamashita moved his headquarters north to Baguio. As \n     the American invading forces encircled the beleagured \n     Yamashita's 14th Army, Sakakida encountered increasing \n     hostility from his captors and decided to make his break. In \n     June 1945, he escaped from the retreating Japanese forces and \n     fled into the hills where he joined a band of guerrillas. \n     During a firefight between the guerrillas and the Japanese a \n     shell fragment hit Sakakida in the stomach. The retreating \n     guerrillas had to abandon him. For the next \n      [[Page S3992]] several months, Sakakida wandered alone \n     through the mountainous jungle, scrounging for food from the \n     wild. He was weakened with his stomach wound and ravaged by \n     malaria, dysentery and beriberi. His hair and beard grew long \n     and wild; insect bites and sores covered his skin. His \n     clothes hung in tatters; semi-starvation emaciated him.\n       One day, unaware that the war had already ended, he saw a \n     group of approaching soldiers wearing unfamiliar uniforms and \n     deep helmets, unlike the pie-plated American helmets of 1942. \n     He thought they were Germans. But his heart leaped as he \n     heard them speaking English. Sakakida emerged from his jungle \n     hiding, waving his arms and yelling ``Don't shoot!'' and then \n     fervently convinced the dubious American GIs that this ragged \n     and haggard Japanese-looking soldier was an American sergeant \n     captured by the Japanese at Corregidor. He begged them to \n     call the CIC to verify his claim. Two hours later two CIC \n     lieutenants drove up in a jeep, leaped out to identify him \n     and welcomed him back to the CIC ranks. They took him back to \n     the field office of the 441st Detachment where Sgt. Richard \n     Sakakida was home at last. His long, lonely, fearful, \n     tortuous ordeal as an undercover agent in the Philippines \n     finally ended. On July 1, 1988, Lt. Col. Richard Sakakida was \n     inducted into the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame at Fort \n     Huachuca, Arizona.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

ALICE SPARKS\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nan outstanding Kentuckian who was recently honored with the Kentucky \nEnquirer's Woman of the Year award. Mrs. Alice Sparks of Crescent \nSprings, KY, has dedicated her time and energy for the betterment of \nnorthern Kentucky and its citizens.\n  Mrs. Sparks has made it common practice to work hard for the causes \nthat she deems important. She has always strived to make a difference, \nespecially when it comes to education. This interest in education has \nbeen acknowledged by her appointment to chair the Northern Kentucky \nUniversity board of regents.\n  In addition, Mrs. Sparks has been politically active for the past 40 \nyears. Often, her political interest has been combined with her \ninterest in education. In particular, she helped usher in the Kentucky \nEducation Reform Act, a major piece of legislation in my State.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to \nAlice Sparks, the Kentucky Enquirer's Woman of the Year. I know that \nMrs. Sparks will continue to display the leadership and dedication that \nshe has demonstrated so capably in the past.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Enquirer's March 6, 1995, article on \nAlice Sparks be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Kentucky Enquirer, Mar. 6, 1995]\n\n                Sparks Flies Into Adventures With Aplomb\n\n                           (By Krista Ramsey)\n\n       Alice Sparks sits contentedly behind her desk in a \n     nondescript corner of the WCET-TV (Channel 48) studios, and \n     it's hard to imagine that a week earlier the 60-year-old was \n     swimming with the piranhas in the Amazon.\n       It's not much easier to picture her tearing across the \n     explosive Brazil-Colombia border in a Volkswagen caravan.\n       It was ``just for fun,'' she says of the escapade, the \n     third in a series of adventure vacations that have taken her \n     to Tanzania and the mountains of Costa Rica. Back at the WCET \n     studios, she says, is where the real pressure lies.\n       For 11 years, the Crescent Sprints resident and WCET \n     trustee has been scheduling chairman for the Action Auction, \n     the station's annual April fund-raiser. From her office, she \n     routes more than 4,400 items to be sold over a 10-day period.\n       ``I'm laid back in a lot of ways, but I'm also dead \n     serious,'' she says of the auction. ``Don't get in my way \n     when we go on the air.''\n       No one does.\n       Sparks is granite sheathed in satin. She has the savvy of a \n     political trench worker sweetened with the smile of a \n     homecoming queen.\n       When the cause is right--and the cause is always \n     education--Sparks can be found in the back halls of WCET \n     lining up auction chattel, or in the back rooms of the state \n     Capitol in Frankfort, lobbying for legislative support.\n       As state legislative chair for the Kentucky PTA from 1988 \n     to 1993, Sparks served as midwife as the Commonwealth gave \n     birth to the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA) of 1990.\n       The legislation changed everything, from how schools are \n     funded to how students are arranged in classes. It sparked \n     controversies, which never deterred Sparks.\n       ``I like all of KERA,'' she says firmly. ``I can see the \n     results. There are now more opportunities for parental \n     involvement in\n      the schools than ever before.'' Status quo wasn't good \n     enough, she says. The Commonwealth was ready to take a \n     risk.\n       Sparks is comfortable with risk, piranha and otherwise.\n       ``I like to gamble,'' she admits conspiratorially, leaning \n     across her desk. ``My father liked to gamble. In the summer, \n     we'd play cards all night.'' The itch still sends Sparks off \n     on periodic trips to Las Vegas, and to play the ponies \n     locally.\n       Besides how to spot a good poker hand, Sparks' father \n     taught her to like another kind of risk. He was a printer at \n     the Louisville Courier-Journal, and became an international \n     representative for the printers union. A staunch Democrat, he \n     always was concerned with social issues, she remembers.\n       The political bug bit his daughter as well, but the \n     Republican strain. Her entry into Kentucky politics began \n     nearly 40 years ago, when she left college and went to work \n     as a social secretary for Mildred Chandler, wife of former \n     Gov. A.B. ``Happy'' Chandler.\n       ``The Chandlers made me a member of the family,'' she says. \n     ``I had an apartment right by the mansion. I learned a lot. I \n     met a lot of influential people.''\n       Later, she served on the Kenton County Republican Executive \n     Committee, and is a member of the local and statewide Women's \n     Political Caucus and the Kenton County Republican Women's \n     Club.\n       In 1992, she earned an appointment to the Northern Kentucky \n     University Board of Regents. Two years later, she became the \n     first woman to chair the board. When Sparks speaks of NKU, \n     she uses the collegial ``we.''\n       ``We're playing the third-place team,'' she says of men's \n     basketball. ``We need a new science building,'' she says of \n     the university as a whole.\n       Sparks' involvement with a cause, says W. Wayne Godwin, \n     general manager of WCET, is paid for with ``personal \n     currency.''\n       ``Alice gives her causes her dedication, energy and \n     thoroughness,'' Godwin says. ``She works at an institutional \n     level--as a trustee or board member--but she always stays \n     focused on the personal level.''\n       Sparks works so hard that the thought of spare time makes \n     her nervous, she says. She has cut back on socializing to \n     make room for more causes, but chooses carefully. Many, like \n     her membership on the board of the Greater Cincinnati Film \n     Commission, are a chance to make sure Northern Kentucky is \n     well represented.\n       In daily life, little fazes Sparks. She bounced through her \n     South American trip in turbulent skies without complaint. On \n     her return, she was gracious about finding a stuffed \n     wildebeest in her family room, a gift of her son-in-law.\n       She knows who she is, what she can do and what she's after. \n     She's used to moving things along, from goods at the Action \n     Auction to play on a golf course.\n       ``I do still golf, especially at benefits,'' she says. \n     ``But I always stand on the green and admit I cheat. I don't \n     have time to worry about a bad lie. I just kick it \n     out.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/15/senate-section/article/S3993-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3993-S3994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     THE WELCOME AND THE UNWELCOME\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, yesterday my colleague Senator \nMurkowski and I rose to speak about the U.S. Government's shameful \ntreatment of the democratically-elected leader of loyal friend of the \nUnited States. We were speaking of President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan, \nwho has been informed that, despite an invitation, he will not be \nadmitted to the U.S. to attend his class reunion at Cornell this June. \nTo admit President Lee, we are told, could jeopardize important \ninterests we have in a key bilateral relationship, our relationship \nwith China.\n  Sometimes, though, the U.S. is prepared to run such risks. Despite \nstrong objections from the United Kingdom, our longstanding ally, we \nhave admitted Gerry Adams, the leader of the Sinn Fein, to our country. \nIndeed, Mr. Adams is receiving a level of attention that a head of \nstate might envy; he will even be welcomed to the White House on St. \nPatrick's Day.\n  I recognize the need to take risks for peace sometimes; the \npossibility of a fair and lasting solution in Northern Ireland may be \nworth taking a few chances for. But shouldn't we also be willing to \ntake a few chances for Taiwan, a country that, in its adoption of \ndemocratic principles and its commitment to free market economics, can \nserve a model to many other countries in Asia? Other countries \nincluding, I would stress, China itself.\n  An editorial in today's Wall Street Journal does a particularly good \njob of highlighting the inconsistency between the welcome the U.S. \nextends to Mr. \n [[Page S3994]] Adams, and the insulting brush off we give President \nLee. I ask that the editorial ``Two Visitors'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The editorial follows:\n                    Review and Outlook--Two Visitors\n\n       Gerry Adams can tour the United States, but Lee Teng-hui \n     can't. Gerry Adams will be feted and celebrated Friday at the \n     White House, but when Lee Teng-hui's plane landed in Honolulu \n     last year, the U.S. government told him to gas up and get \n     out. The Gerry Adams who is being treated like a head of \n     state by the Clinton Administration is the leader of Sinn \n     Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army. The Lee \n     Teng-hui who has been treated like an international pariah by \n     the Administration is the democratically elected President of \n     the Republic of China, or Taiwan. The disparate treatment of \n     these two men tells an awful lot about the politics and \n     instincts of the Clinton presidency.\n       Gerry Adams's face will be all over the news for his Saint \n     Paddy's Day party with Bill O'Clinton at the White House, so \n     we'll start with the background on the less-publicized \n     President of Taiwan.\n       Cornell University has invited President Lee to come to the \n     school's Ithaca, N.Y., campus this June to address and attend \n     an alumni reunion. In 1968, Mr. Lee received his doctorate in \n     agricultural economics from Cornell. The following year, the \n     American Association of Agricultural Economics gave Mr. Lee's \n     doctoral dissertation, on the sources of Taiwan's growth, its \n     highest honor. In 1990, Taiwan's voters freely elected Mr. \n     Lee as their President. He has moved forcefully to liberalize \n     Taiwan's political system, arresting corrupt members of his \n     own party. Last year, The Asian Wall Street Journal \n     editorialized: ``Out of nothing, Taiwan's people have created \n     an economic superpower relative to its population, as well as \n     Asia's most rambunctious democracy and a model for neighbors \n     who are bent on shedding authoritarian ways.''\n       Asked last month about President Lee's visit to Ithaca, \n     Secretary of State Christopher, who professes to wanting \n     closer links with Taiwan, said that ``under the present \n     circumstances'' he couldn't see it happening. The \n     Administration doesn't want to rile its relationship with \n     Beijing. The Communist Chinese don't recognize Taiwan and \n     threaten all manner of retaliation against anyone who even \n     thinks about doing so. That includes a speech to agricultural \n     economists in upstate New York. This, Secretary\n      Christopher testified, is a ``difficult issue.''\n       Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams, meanwhile, gets the red carpet \n     treatment at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Mr. Adams assures his \n     American audiences that the IRA is out of the business of \n     blowing body parts across the streets of London. He promises \n     the doubters that if people give him money, it won't be used \n     to buy more guns, bullets and bombs for the high-strung lads \n     of the IRA.\n       Now before the Irish American communities of Queens and \n     Boston get too roiled over our skepticism toward Northern \n     Ireland's most famous altar boy, we suggest they take their \n     grievances to John Bruton, who is Irish enough to be the \n     Prime Minister of Ireland. He, too, will be at Bill Clinton's \n     St. Patrick's Day party for Gerry Adams, and he has a message \n     for the two statesmen: The IRA has to give up its arms. \n     ``This is an item on the agenda that must be dealt with,'' \n     Premier Bruton said Monday in Dublin. ``It's a very serious \n     matter. There are genuine fears felt by members of the \n     community that have been at the receiving end of the \n     violence.''\n       We don't at all doubt that somewhere amid the Friday \n     merriment, Mr. Clinton will ask Mr. Adams to give up the guns \n     and that Mr. Adams will tell the President that is surely the \n     IRA's intent, all other matters being equal.\n       It is hard to know precisely what motivates Mr. Clinton to \n     lionize a Gerry Adams and snub a Lee Tenghut. The deference \n     to China doesn't fully wash, because when Britain--our former \n     ally in several huge wars this century--expressed its \n     displeasure over the Adams meeting, the White House \n     essentially told the Brits to lump it. Perhaps the end of the \n     Cold War has liberated liberal heads of state into a state of \n     light-headedness about such matters. We note also this week \n     that France's President Francois Mitterrand has been \n     entertaining Fidel Castro at the Elysees Palace.\n       But it's still said that Bill Clinton has a great sense of \n     self-preservation. So if he's willing to personally embrace \n     Gerry Adams while stiffing the Prime Minister of England and \n     forbidding the President of Taiwan to spend three days with \n     his classmates in Ithaca, there must be something in it \n     somewhere for him.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/15/senate-section/article/S3993-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3994-S4000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n      THE PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT OF 1995--MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

For the information of all Senators, if we can reach an \nagreement for a short list of amendments to the supplemental \nappropriations bill, it will be my intention to call the bill back \nbefore the Senate in order to complete action on it expeditiously, and \nI think that means around 2 o'clock in the afternoon. Then we would \nhope to move to the line-item veto at that point.\n  I urge my colleagues--I know everybody feels compelled, because it is \npermitted in the Senate, to offer everything that they have ever \nthought of on every bill that comes through here.\n  I hope, at least it is my understanding, the President very much \nwants the supplemental appropriation bill. The Defense Department has \nbeen calling on a daily basis. I have notified the White House that if \nthey were really interested in getting this bill done maybe they could \nhelp talk some of their colleagues off offering amendments, so we are \nworking on that. We will be working on it overnight.\n  If an amendment is acceptable, that is one thing. If it is something \nthat is going to take a long time to debate, then we would hope it \nwould be called up at a later time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/15/senate-section/article/S4000-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
